1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:10,840
so good evening hoping that my voice does the

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,240
thing it's supposed to do which is you know be malifu

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:23,320
okay so today I received an email from someone and she said um she had this

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:30,519
phrase in it that said it's a busy December but let's see

5
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:36,399
not staying UNF frazzled for the most part you know you got that double negative in there I wasn't sure whether

6
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,600
she was frazzled or

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:56,160
unfledged but there's this pressure around the holidays that has to do with how we're supposed to feel you know

8
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,920
we're supposed to feel Goodwill happy Holidays happy

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,520
holidays and there is the pressure of family or no family gifting or not

10
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:14,960
gifting short short time or short on cash or am I going to get this done or

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:21,720
not done and of course then there's all the usual things that happen I'm working I'm not working I have my social

12
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:30,360
activities my financial issues my family issues the social issues stuff the stuff of life times we

13
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:36,399
feel like we need an antidote to life you know it's just too much stuff and

14
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,640
we're carrying around all of this accumulation of things that we're

15
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:47,840
keeping track of and it feels like a load of stuff that we're carrying

16
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:54,759
around and it's quite common to say I'm feeling frazzled or I'm not feeling frazzled and we you know we have a we

17
00:01:54,759 --> 00:02:00,719
have the list of things the to-do list

18
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:07,200
or the rehashing of the conversation that we had today or the the email that we're writing about something that we're

19
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:14,800
going to do or you know the conversation I was going to have with my insurance company on why my auto rates went up 50%

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:21,720
over last year apparently that's happening everywhere in

21
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:32,000
California excuse me and so meditation can seem like a refuge a

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,720
respit but what I'd like to do is give both my friend and you a

23
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,760
gift the gift of ease even in the midst of all the rest of that stuff that

24
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,879
doesn't rely on you being in meditation to feel at

25
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,159
ease now if I had a wand I would just do that but you know I left my veryy

26
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:01,640
godmother Wings somewhere I haven't I don't have them anymore

27
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,680
so here's a quote from Andrew olinsky from his book

28
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:14,799
unlimiting mind the radically experimental psychology of Buddhism it's a relatively new book of

29
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:18,920
his Let Me Clear My Throat

30
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,680
again let go for the moment the impulse for sensory

31
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:36,000
gratification hold off a annoyance toward what you don't like settle down any restlessness in

32
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:42,319
mind and body stir up energy when you feel sluggish and postpone thinking over

33
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,879
any doubts you may have as you do this successfully for several moments in a

34
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:55,040
row you will find the Mind gradually becoming more tranquil more focused more

35
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,360
clear and more powerful the Buddha might have said I

36
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,200
know of no single thing more healthy than doing one thing at a time end of

37
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:11,280
quote now of course I love this quote but it sounds like you've already

38
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,959
acquired the ability to do all these things but I want to put an underline

39
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,120
under the one moment at a time part one moment at a

40
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,479
time because the truth is we only live in one moment at a time and it's only

41
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:36,360
our tendency to drag our entire life story behind us that makes it seem

42
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,360
otherwise

43
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:49,199
boy might help let try the

44
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:56,039
water thank you so uh recently I went to a

45
00:04:56,039 --> 00:05:01,440
conversation at Stanford with uh between some people in Humanities and a man

46
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,800
named Allan Lightman he's an author and he's uh got a professorship at MIT in both physics

47
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:16,560
and Humanities he's a very unusual guy he's a philosopher physicist and he talked about this

48
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,560
experience he had um that he wrote about in a book called searching for the stars

49
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:30,680
on an island in Maine and uh he also had a PBS series of a similar title

50
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:37,520
and the experience in the experience he described taking a boat off to the island at night and he laid down he he

51
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,919
suddenly stopped the boat and he laid down on the deck and he looked up at the stars and as he laid there he suddenly

52
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:52,160
had the experience of just merging with the Stars and everything just

53
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,160
became one everything was happening now just now

54
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:08,599
everything now you may have had a similar sort of transcendent experience

55
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,560
yourself everything was included in just that moment now he doesn't try to explain

56
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,919
that in physical terms and neither do

57
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:30,039
I but what similar experiences to that I have had lead me to conclude is it's the

58
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:36,400
Now is really important and the question is how do I get into the

59
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:41,639
now when am I in now and when am I somewhere

60
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,880
else so in the last year I have lost a number

61
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:54,759
of people really dear to me and so I have moments of grief that sort of

62
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:01,280
overtake me unsuspectingly so one of those events

63
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:08,639
happened on Saturday and I was just suddenly overwhelmed and my husband

64
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:15,160
took one look at me and he said you look like you are really suffering and I said well yeah I

65
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,800
am and he said yeah do you want to go out to lunch do you want to go out to breakfast you know he he wanted to fix

66
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:29,000
it right away and I said well let's um uh let's go to that exhibit we've

67
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,680
been wanting to go to so we went off to an exhibit at the Legion of Mary

68
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:41,960
Cassat and the idea in my head was grief is here but so is the rest of my life so

69
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,520
is everything else it isn't that I can ignore grief or make it go away or

70
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:54,280
change it and there is also this so we jumped

71
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:01,159
in the car and we went off to the exhibit and we we had tickets you know they have these time tickets and so

72
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:08,680
while we were waiting we went to we went into this room that had um uh decorated

73
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:14,400
porcelain it's a fancy porcelain room of dishes different kinds of dishes dishes

74
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,000
made like arti Toes or with certain kinds of elaborate painting on them

75
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:25,479
porcelain it's a porcelain exhibit and they have a new piece in

76
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:30,759
there that is uh made with um uh kugi

77
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:35,880
art if you're familiar with that is anybody familiar with that so kugi is a

78
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:43,959
te a Japanese technique where they take broken pieces of porcelain and they literally glue

79
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:49,959
them together with resin that has gold powdered gold in it and so you have

80
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:55,240
rivulets of gold streaming holding the pieces together

81
00:08:55,240 --> 00:09:01,200
and the resultant pieces sometimes are more beautiful than the originals so so I've recently seen this in a couple of

82
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:08,440
different places never having seen it before and and they're quite beautiful pieces so this new artwork is a large

83
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:17,160
sculpture and there must be maybe 20 different plates that have been mended using this K kintsugi technique and in

84
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:27,279
the center was a um assembled porcelain piece of uh

85
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:35,040
quen which is the female Buddhist representation of the Buddha of of com

86
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,360
compassion I'm looking at this piece and I'm thinking okay here are the broken

87
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:46,120
pieces The Broken Pieces Of My Life The Broken Pieces of your life and and they're put together and they're held

88
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:54,600
together by this shining gold and I wouldn't be experiencing grief if love wasn't there to begin

89
00:09:54,600 --> 00:10:00,920
with and they they travel together they're not separate from one

90
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:08,839
another and this is true of all the things in our life Pleasant and unpleasant travel

91
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:17,360
together they're not independent of one another we tend to get stuck in I like

92
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:24,640
what's Pleasant and I don't like what's unpleasant and I need to fix it human beings tend to want to fix everything we

93
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:31,240
want to manage it we want to control it we want to make it the way we want it

94
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:39,160
but equinity is the space between wanting and not wanting liking and not

95
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:45,880
wanting liking and not liking equinity is not having a preference

96
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:51,160
for it doesn't mean that Pleasant and unpleasant don't

97
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:56,880
exist it doesn't take the texture out of life it doesn't mean that sadness and

98
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,000
gladness are not both present it means that we ride the place of not

99
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:09,160
grasping at one or the other at not saying I must have that or

100
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,079
I can't be happy it is allowing both to be present

101
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:22,920
in one's life it's a

102
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,639
kugi it's being present with all of what occurs in

103
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:36,399
life and saying ah life this is what's

104
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:44,720
happening this is what's happening it's like this today this is

105
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:50,560
here where we get into trouble is we say oh it's been this way and we start

106
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,079
justifying why we're angry or why we're upset or why we're happy and I want more

107
00:11:57,079 --> 00:12:02,279
of this or I want less of that and we project it into the

108
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:10,600
future it's going to be like this forever or the way that I protect my future is if I make more of

109
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:18,440
this the trick the trick to being at ease in life is to give up all hope of a

110
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:24,000
better past or that we can control the

111
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:29,800
future neither is possible what we do have some influence

112
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:36,839
on is how we meet the present how we meet the

113
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,120
present how am I now right now what am I

114
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:47,720
seeing now how am I

115
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:57,720
here I'm tired I'm sore I'm upset I'm

116
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:07,279
happy and what else is happening what else is here what

117
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:14,839
else it's really an opening up and not abiding abiding only by the story that

118
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:20,360
we came into the moment with it's seeing that experience is an

119
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,199
accumulation of moments and it's only our our wanting to carry along my story

120
00:13:26,199 --> 00:13:33,440
the story of my life my life that gets us in a

121
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:41,160
rut that makes us want to justify what's going on now explain it to

122
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:47,519
ourselves when I was upset on Saturday I knew the proximal cause of why I was

123
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:52,560
upset I was thinking about a particular person I was upset I can't do this I

124
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,839
can't talk to this person

125
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:06,360
again and it was it was very sad for me but it wasn't the only thing that was

126
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:14,079
true it wasn't the only thing that was true it was just one thing that was

127
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:25,639
true you know we we we're told that we have to let go of uh of toxic feelings

128
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:30,920
like anger or displeasure or ill will well what if you can't let go of ill

129
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,279
will you know what if you wake up and you're just cranky and you don't know what to do about it or or you're sad and

130
00:14:36,279 --> 00:14:44,480
okay I don't want to be sad well at least be the person who doesn't want to be sad give yourself some

131
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,440
credit but it is not the only thing that's true about you and it's only true in this

132
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,120
moment it doesn't have to be true in the next moment

133
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:08,600
so what do we do about it how do how do we meet that how do we find ourselves in

134
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:14,959
a moment without becoming overwhelmed by whatever emotional overwhelm is

135
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:23,320
there how do we deal with it because it happens strong feelings

136
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:30,959
occur strong feelings of frustration or being flustered or whatever that fr

137
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:36,360
how do I become peaceful in the midst of that well the first thing is don't make

138
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:43,759
it yours it's not my frustration my anger my sadness it's just

139
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:48,959
sadness it's just anger I don't mean to diminish it or

140
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,639
dismiss it but it's not yours it's just

141
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:03,319
here this is amazing practice to realize it's not yours and it's not you it's

142
00:16:03,319 --> 00:16:05,879
just

143
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,480
here it's just happening in this moment it's a condition like any other

144
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:21,880
Condition it's only when we try to explain it to ourselves that it gets prolonged emotions actually have a very

145
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:27,240
short lifetime neurologically but if we keep telling ourselves the story or explaining it to

146
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:33,120
ourselves we keep restarting the clock we keep reinitiating the

147
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:38,959
stimulus so it isn't a matter of ignoring it or pushing it away you're saying it's not here but you can you

148
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:45,319
know if you have a a plate of uh information a billboard you stick it on it's there it's right out in

149
00:16:45,319 --> 00:16:52,720
front maybe it's in the middle it's right here but there's a lot more space on the board it's not everything and it

150
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:59,440
isn't mine it's just a prominent notice it's just a notice

151
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,240
it's just

152
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:13,400
there I had foot surgery ear earlier this summer and it is

153
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:19,240
frustratingly persistent that I have pain in my foot not where I expected to

154
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:27,199
have it but in my big toe just will not go away it doesn't

155
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:35,640
hurt now it only hurts when I walk no problem only when I

156
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,360
walk fine and I walk and I go there's that

157
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:49,520
toe again it's not debilitating it just hurts it's not even my toe that hurts

158
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:56,480
it's just pain it's just a signal just like noise like a loud

159
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:03,080
noise it's not mine it's just a

160
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:09,200
signal and I have to decide how much attention to play pay to that

161
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:20,400
signal that's all how much attention do I pay to that

162
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:25,799
signal and what else am I aware of

163
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:42,440
there are all kinds of conditions that come to this moment con conditions of that are

164
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,440
determined by who else is in the room whether I'm doing something

165
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:56,280
interesting hearing something interesting whether I'm bored out of my

166
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:03,440
mind whe whether I'm at peace for other reasons that influence how important how

167
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:08,559
much attention something gives if I can look at it and see it as just

168
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:14,480
that it has less impact on the stories that I tell

169
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:22,360
myself it is the understanding how the mind works seeing how the mind is

170
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:27,840
working in the moment that influences how much influence that emotion has on

171
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:36,440
us seeing it just seeing it that's all it's not control it's just seeing

172
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:42,760
it and the second thing is to not have an opinion about

173
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:49,520
it and by that I mean not having a preference for it or against

174
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:55,760
it now I can certainly say I prefer that my toad doesn't hurt but then in a

175
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:02,640
moment as I'm walking along I I have to be able to say

176
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,840
okay I prefer walking to worrying about whether my toe is going to

177
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,960
hurt I don't prefer not

178
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:26,000
walking so the pain is unimportant until it becomes important

179
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,080
the preference has to do with grasping on one side or the other it's whether I

180
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:42,280
hold on to it it's the preference that is holding on preference that's the problem that's

181
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:51,080
where the suffering comes it has to be this way but we when

182
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:57,320
we are just in the moment in this room in this moment it's what's true in this

183
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:02,880
moment not what I'm afraid afraid is going to happen in the next moment does that make

184
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,640
sense it's not what I'm afraid of what's going to happen so awareness without

185
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,200
wanting this is this is the goal awareness without wanting I'm aware of

186
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:20,279
it but I'm not wanting it to be other than it is it's the Leaning one way or

187
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:27,480
the other it's leaning toward or or pushing away so one thing to ask yourself in any

188
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:34,159
moment is where am

189
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,640
I now this may seem like an odd question to ask yourself but it's an important

190
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:44,919
question am I here in the room with what's happening or am I in another

191
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:51,120
place is the Mind here with me or am I thinking about you know let's take the

192
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:59,080
question of grief am I thinking about this person located in that other place or am I in this room am I thinking about

193
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:05,440
something that happened before or am I in this room am I here in this

194
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:15,760
body even though I may be crying in this body my mind may be somewhere else oh

195
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:22,200
that's interesting I'm not actually here ahuh so where am I is a really

196
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:29,240
important question where am I or am I worried about what's going to happen tomorrow

197
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:37,000
oh tomorrow I'm going to feel really bad because this is going to happen now right here how to get into

198
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,840
the now is to say where am I where am I where's my mind where's my body am I in

199
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:50,360
my body or am I in the concept of my mind it's sort of like when you're following your breath and you're going

200
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,840
in and you're actually breathing out and you say

201
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:01,320
whoops nope yep I'm back on the breath in your

202
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:09,320
body where am I it opens up a sense of curiosity and of opportunity gets you

203
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:16,600
out of the out of the conceptual world where you think you know what you're doing and you think you know where you are and you think when you find yourself

204
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:22,960
thinking about your condition where am I really where am I

205
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:30,000
am I here or not here you want to be in the place

206
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:36,760
of not knowing what is to be known what is to be known you want to

207
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:43,679
know what is to be known does that make sense awareness

208
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:54,000
is asking the question what is to be known here not coming into the moment knowing

209
00:23:56,520 --> 00:24:02,799
already give up knowing it everything in Awareness awareness is asking what is to

210
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:07,480
be known here what is to be known

211
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:14,960
here the second question is who am I in the room

212
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:21,080
with who am I in the room with somebody who's not

213
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:28,520
here am I in the room with you and I'm aware of you or I'm not

214
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:34,559
aware of you because I'm in my head and I'm somewhere else or I'm thinking about what I'm

215
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:41,320
going to say to you be so I'm not aware of you or I'm not aware of

216
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:47,960
myself I'm not even aware that I'm standing in the room who am I in the

217
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:55,039
room with who am I in the room with when my

218
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:01,159
husband said to me you look like you're really suffering that re that gave me the opportunity to

219
00:25:01,159 --> 00:25:08,480
to say Here I Am visibly suffering and there's someone in the room with me

220
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:15,760
what's he experiencing which got me solidly in the room and out of my

221
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:23,679
head it's not trivial who am I in the room with and the last thing is what is my

222
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:31,279
intention in this moment to know your intention you have to know know the attitude your attitude

223
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:37,760
of Mind am I am I sad it's a quick survey

224
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:45,360
am I sad am I anxious am I angry am I happy am I light am I agitated am I

225
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,880
irritable what is what is the attitude right here it's not the mood so much is

226
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:58,760
what is what's uh am I just frazzled is it just frazzled

227
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,600
the word you choose is not so important as being aware of the condition the

228
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:09,880
condition of your mind that information tells you I need

229
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:16,679
to be vigilant about what I'm doing or I'm peaceful because then you can check in

230
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:23,799
with what is my intention for now what comes to mind for me is very

231
00:26:23,799 --> 00:26:30,760
often I wish to be kind I wish to be kind in the moment when I'm stopping to say

232
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,880
what is my intention there's a chance for that to arise I wish to be

233
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,200
kind and when I know who's in the room who am I with and I wish to be kind then

234
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:50,200
I then I have an opportunity in that moment to be really here and

235
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:55,600
do create the conditions in my mind for the next

236
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:00,679
moment that's likely to be much more light than whatever the moment was that

237
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:06,399
brought me here does that make any sense to you so I'm going to tell you a really

238
00:27:06,399 --> 00:27:12,559
quick story so when I was in one of these agitated Minds I

239
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:19,000
had I was determined to take some packages to UPS I had a half an hour and

240
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:26,000
I live a mile from UPS and I thought no problem I could do this and I was very irritable I get over to I drive over to

241
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:31,679
UPS I get my packages I go in there's nobody waiting except the person the UPS

242
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:39,360
person is in the middle of doing a notary job so if you've ever watched somebody do a notary job it could be 15

243
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:46,480
pages or one you know it could and I'm thinking oh no you I don't have much time and I can feel the irritability

244
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:52,200
coming up and I tell myself just you have plenty of time just

245
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:57,720
be at ease no problem here and she said I'll be with you

246
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:05,640
shortly I said no problem 10 minutes later now I'm getting itchy I'm thinking

247
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:14,240
no problem I know it's just irritability is here no problem some other UPS guy comes

248
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,919
in and he's walking really slowly and I'm noticing the mind going why is he

249
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:26,720
walking so slowly now Maria he doesn't know how you're

250
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,320
irritable this is not his problem

251
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:40,240
either eventually the woman finishes what she does rushes over it takes her all of a minute to take care of my

252
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:45,559
packages I leave and I go out and I I'm still hurrying right because I got to

253
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:51,240
get home for this Zoom call and there's somebody standing very

254
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:58,480
close to my car and I'm thinking you know if I just get in my car I'm going to scare her and and so I I just said

255
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:05,880
you know I I don't want to startle you but I'm about to move that car and she looked at me and she goes oh and I

256
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:12,240
thought wow that was cool just the act of constantly reminding myself to be

257
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,880
kind allowed me to be kind and I thought wow that was great

258
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,000
and the irritability left it wasn't it wasn't like I set out

259
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:30,200
to do something kind it was like the moment arose because I kept setting it

260
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:35,320
up in my mind that I intended to be kind it's not like I did it it's not like I

261
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:42,960
was determined to be kind it's more like what you hold in your mind heart is

262
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,720
what you create in the next moment that's why it's so important to

263
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,679
be in the now and not to hold on to whatever that attitude of mind is

264
00:29:54,679 --> 00:30:00,039
whatever it is just be in the now

265
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:11,159
kugi with whatever it is with no opinion so I'm going to close my latest

266
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:18,120
book of poems from Joseph Goldstein who is a meditation famous

267
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:24,880
meditation person and now okay here's the

268
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:32,559
poem this is called a January morning unrelenting Gray Bears down subduing

269
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:40,120
Morning Light it might be enough to dampen our Spirits except except for that secret

270
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,840
Stillness within not wanting not planning not

271
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:54,679
intending moments of Silence forgetting for some time who we think we

272
00:30:55,559 --> 00:31:02,360
are unrelenting Gray Bears down subduing Morning Morning Light it might be enough

273
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:09,399
to dampen our Spirits except except for that secret Stillness within not wanting

274
00:31:09,399 --> 00:31:16,720
not planning not intending moments of Silence forgetting for some time who we

275
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:23,480
think we are so what I wish for you is moments of

276
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:30,639
Stillness when you forget who you think you are thank

277
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:39,919
you so any questions comments

278
00:31:52,519 --> 00:31:57,039
Tomatoes to-do lists

279
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,320
yes when you were referencing grief and that

280
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:22,559
you um you know were thinking about your loved one or whomever had passed and and

281
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:28,960
bring yourself back to the present moment where you're at who you're with

282
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,840
but I guess I just wonder about the that sometimes maybe you want to

283
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:41,559
think about um the person that's passed or that it's comforting in a way to

284
00:32:41,559 --> 00:32:47,880
think of them or maybe you talk to them because that brings you comfort to it's

285
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:53,039
kind of a continuing Bond type of thing so they're not here um in the room

286
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,760
necessarily but I don't know if that makes any sense

287
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:06,320
so uh so there are different conditions so what I was describing for

288
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:11,399
before was a condition where I was really suffering

289
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:17,880
now to in that moment

290
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:25,639
uh conjure up moments of our conversations probably would have only

291
00:33:25,639 --> 00:33:33,039
increased the suffering oh this won't happen again this won't happen again in other moments in other moments under

292
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:39,799
other conditions I might want to say oh we had some great

293
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:47,840
times and and recall that now what's going on in the moment in my heart is

294
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:54,320
feelings of love and and peace and there's a very different feeling the comforting feeling is different than the

295
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:59,639
suffering of loss the suffering of wishing they were were here the com the

296
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:06,559
yeah hold it close to you oh the suffering of wishing wishing they were wishing things were different yeah

297
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:13,358
wishing things were different is is not the same as recalling a memory that

298
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:20,480
reinforces the the feeling of uh

299
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:29,200
uh why why the why the love is here now so I I'll give you I'll give you a

300
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,839
different example that's a little closer to what you were really asking about so

301
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:40,000
um my brother passed away suddenly this

302
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,638
summer and uh I was very close to

303
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,760
him and what I remember even in in moments of great

304
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,880
grief was one particular conversation we had

305
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:10,920
when I visited him in prison and he was

306
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,200
uh confessing to me things about his

307
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:23,640
life and it was as if he was saying and I was holding his hand and it

308
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:29,320
was if he was saying what if I told you this would you still love me then

309
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:36,359
what if I told you this and what I remember is it didn't

310
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:44,200
matter what he told me I still loved him and how powerful that was for both

311
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:50,440
of us that it was

312
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:59,040
independent of what he did that love

313
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:06,240
and that's what I remembered even the moments of deepest grief how

314
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:13,280
strong the connection to him was so that's a case where both things

315
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,640
were there and it was comforting to me at the same time as it

316
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:28,400
was intensely painful that he was gone

317
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:36,160
both things were true at the same time does that answer your

318
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:02,160
question it also is a lesson for

319
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:11,960
me that one has to be present for oneself regardless of what one has

320
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,319
done to be present for oneself and that question of who's in the

321
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:23,480
room has to do with being able to trust oneself to be present for one's own

322
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:30,720
strong emotions it's it's all when when you ask yourself

323
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:39,280
who's in the room am I actually in the room it is a matter of do I trust myself

324
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:42,720
to be here with this strong

325
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:52,359
emotion and it's only by showing up that you can answer the question for

326
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:59,440
yourself so this it's all related

327
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:10,160
can I be present for this emotion this person not the person I was

328
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,760
then this person can I be present for it because in this moment you're a

329
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:21,319
different person than you were then

330
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:38,480
for

331
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,599
so there's an alternative poem to the one I read you also from J's book this

332
00:39:10,599 --> 00:39:15,680
is called Dreamscapes of the mind that he's just

333
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:24,400
published it's similar but not quite the same this one is called Ode to

334
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:33,960
[Music] non-being and it starts to the quote if now on top of this non-being

335
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,520
is who can comprehend it by

336
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:46,839
changu so that's the quote he opens it with if on top of this non-being is who

337
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:52,960
can comprehend it non-being that is what Matrix Keeps

338
00:39:52,960 --> 00:40:00,040
Us wandering in the Dreamscape of the Mind what if the Matrix is beingness

339
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:05,960
itself castles of sand at Water's Edge where aging children play and Shiva

340
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:13,359
laughs as breaking waves turn castles into caves in zero all the numbers of the

341
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:18,599
world are freed who will Brave this Embrace of

342
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:27,640
peace that mysterious absence terrifying at first and then release

343
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:34,800
now this refers to the willingness to enter every moment of now without

344
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:42,000
knowing who you are without knowing in advance who you

345
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:47,800
are so let me read it again what Matrix Keeps Us wandering in

346
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:53,680
the Dreamscape of the Mind what if the Matrix is beingness

347
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,240
itself castles of sand at Water's Edge where aging children play and Shiva

348
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:05,359
laughs as breaking waves turn castles into caves in zero all the numbers of

349
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,079
the world are freed who will Brave this Embrace of

350
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:19,720
peace that mysterious absence terrifying at first and then

351
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:29,000
release so just in case you want to take that step toward nonbeing

352
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:37,720
there is peace and release in not being so sure you are who you think you

353
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:47,200
are please have a wonderful holiday season good night
