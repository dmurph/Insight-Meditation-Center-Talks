25
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:50,920
lovely to be with you lovely to practice together so for today's uh practice for

26
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,159
tonight's um or whatever time zone you are for this moment may not be night

27
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:03,760
where you are uh practice I'd like to lead a a um more stilling more silent

28
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,120
more embodied um expression of meta and

29
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,720
compassion and I'm going to be uh yeah starting with meta leaning into

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,519
compassion and compassion essentially is when meta Goodwill friendliness holds suffering holds pain or any challenge

31
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,959
that there might be in the body or in the heart so we're going to go back and forth between these these two these two

32
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:34,920
practices so that's the that's the plan and um I won't say a whole lot more

33
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:41,080
we'll just explore and discover as we go how does that sound let's uh let's get

34
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:48,920
settled let's get settled and arrive in our

35
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:57,000
bodies in this moment in time arriving

36
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:06,799
settling and then iding ourselves to first and foremost feel this feeling of

37
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:15,079
just sitting here having your body what does it feel like to be sitting here and having a

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:31,520
body to have a body and can we

39
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,680
relax into this

40
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,639
body and notice if there are areas of tightness and holding in this

41
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:59,520
body how is the neck how are the shoulders

42
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,759
can we have a sense of kindness about the neck and

43
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:18,680
shoulders and invite them to invite them to relax to release

44
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:21,440
however much is

45
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:33,039
available or perhaps simply bringing a caring attention to the neck and

46
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,919
shoulders we don't pay enough attention with care to this

47
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,560
body how about

48
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:53,199
we bring we gently gently bring care appreciation

49
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:59,120
gentleness friendliness the muscles in the neck and

50
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:07,319
shoulders and proverbially put down the weight of the world just for a moment we can all pick

51
00:06:07,319 --> 00:06:12,880
it up again all the worries and Fring if we choose to later but right

52
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,319
now choosing choosing to put it down putting the weight

53
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,160
down just just this

54
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:52,319
moment and then inviting or hands also to settle to

55
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:01,400
relax as if we were breathing with our hands let let our hands take a breath

56
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:15,960
these hands have been doing so much perhaps feeding

57
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:22,199
us cleaning us working whatever they've been doing

58
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:31,479
so much whatever they've been doing maybe give them a moment of rest with care and appreciation in

59
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:35,280
goodwi what does that feel

60
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:51,440
like perhaps borrowing from the practice last night we engaged in what

61
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,560
is not wrong in this moment with these hands but is not

62
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,080
wrong they are not broken in my fingers they're not bandag right

63
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:10,280
now what is not wrong this moment right now

64
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:03,920
and can we invite our feet to to also relax our feet and our legs to offer

65
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,279
their weight to the Earth with

66
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:16,320

00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,560

73
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:45,320
and inviting the sit bones also the area of contacting

74
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:52,120
connecting settling releasing this body onto the cushion or the chair the sit

75
00:10:52,120 --> 00:11:02,279
bones relax offer their weight their weight to the Earth to gravity for

76
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,680
and can we invite the breath to flow just as it is Flowing any

77
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,440
way he wants to

78
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:49,040
flow and allowing the breath to be

79
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:59,800
received through the Body Sensations of the breath

80
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:06,519
within the body receiving them with kindness

81
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:14,960
gentleness with friendliness to this entire body

82
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:22,480
[Music] breathing digesting

83
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:32,160
healing pumping blood all that this body is doing dear body e

84
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:18,600
and appreciation friendliness for the dear mind planning usually thinking forwards

85
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:26,279
backwards past present future no need to do that right now but not to make an

86
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:33,079
enemy out of thinking and the mind and the emotional

87
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:38,120
states can there be a sense of spacious

88
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:45,560
friendliness with what it's like to be human to think to

89
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:53,279
feel having a spaciousness about it not diving into it right now but having

90
00:13:53,399 --> 00:14:01,920
goodwi equinity yeah this is what it's like dear me be human yeah

91
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:10,160
appreciating the whole the whole catastrophe was a smile

92
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:50,399
and if the mind starts to feel busy and

93
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:57,759
active we release gently with friendliness release the thoughts and come back to the breath the sensations

94
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:04,600
of the breath in the body just rest just rest nowhere to go nothing to

95
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,499
do just rest with kindness [Music]

96
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:15,560
gentleness a reprieve for a

97
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
moment

98
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
e e

99
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:41,000
maybe allowing one part of the body

100
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:49,000
to to come forward to receive bit more

101
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,399
meta a bit more friendliness

102
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:01,800
Goodwill what part of the body is moving if there if all the parts of the body

103
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:08,360
were standing in line one part is like oh I need a little more love need a little more love tonight or appreciation

104
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:14,280
might be could be a part of the body that is challenged perhaps maybe it's

105
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:21,880
the back lower back mine is stepping forward like yeah I'm hurting a bit I can receive a little more love if there

106
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:27,480
was no discomfort might be say the hands like oh yeah I've done a lot today I can

107
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:33,520
I can get some more love or may you went for a walk a fast walk in the feet step

108
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:42,640
forward in line and say oh yeah I can re I can use a bit more love a bit more

109
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:54,760
meta perhaps if that feels appropriate allowing that part of the body to be

110
00:17:54,760 --> 00:18:01,120
wrapped in more care the whole body wrapped in the blanket of meta but this part even more

111
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:09,520
so appreciation with care and if this part that's volunteered to receive more

112
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:15,919
metti perhaps in pain or has a bit of discomfort

113
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,240
maybe this practice then becomes a practice of compassion because when

114
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:28,159
Goodwill friendliness meets pain we're practicing compassion just as

115
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:30,760
simple as that

116
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,760
so simply bringing Goodwill kindness to the body to this part of the

117
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:48,200
body Shing e no dear part of the

118
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:53,679
body appreciate you I care for you may you have

119
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:00,280
ease maybe there are words maybe it's wordless just ra radiating radiating

120
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,039
Goodwill and

121
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,320
care wherever it's

122
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
needed

123
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

124
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

125
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
e for

126
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:56,120
if you're working with areas in the body that are challenged can you imagine that

127
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:03,278
you're putting a soothing self a soothing

128
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:10,919
s which is enriched with your care with your love with your

129
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:17,120
friendliness that part of the body giving Extra Care Extra Care sharing

130
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,520
Extra

131
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:30,279
Care not to get rid of the discomfort that's not the purpose it's just to care

132
00:22:30,279 --> 00:22:38,000
just to care because if we have the agenda applying meta Goodwill in order

133
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:45,640
to get rid of what we don't like it becomes an aversion

134
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:55,559
practice allowing it to be just as it is and showering showering with

135
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
care

136
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
for e

137
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:29,600
and as we're showering our body body part particular

138
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,750
part of the body can we bring this meta

139
00:24:34,750 --> 00:24:41,640
[Music] Goodwill to the whole to the gestal to

140
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:50,320
the complete whole of the body parts and this being who is me wishing yourself

141
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:59,679
well I wish myself well I hold myself with kindness and care may I have ease

142
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:07,000
may I be happy may I be

143
00:25:12,919 --> 00:25:16,559
healthy may I be

144
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:25,960
safe may I have ease in whatever order you like whatever

145
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:32,880
order these metaphases work for you or perhaps

146
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:39,120
simply I love and accept myself just as I am or I wish

147
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:44,159
to grow to a place where I love and accept myself or whatever

148
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:51,200
Nuance or maybe just sticking with I wish myself ease may I have

149
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,278
ease may I be a friend to

150
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
myself

151
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

152
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
e e

153
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:58,880
can there be kindness both to yourself and also if the judgmental thoughts Rising

154
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:06,000
they're pretty kindness to them to these thoughts and a very lightweight

155
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:11,279
lighthearted gentleness oh here they are the

156
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:19,720
usual the usual Army of judgmental thoughts you don't have to believe

157
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
them

158
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
e e

159
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:46,919
and as we turn to bring this meditation to

160
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:53,919
close appreciating appreciating yourself or having showed up as best as you able

161
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:57,679
to planting seeds

162
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:04,158
planting seeds of kindness and

163
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:12,640
spaciousness wholeheartedness friendliness and trusting that there's

164
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:20,200
been co-created goodness in our practice together and with generosity sharing all

165
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:25,960
this goodness with all beings everywhere May the cultivation of my

166
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:32,080
heart be a cause and condition for all beings everywhere to be happy to

167
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,240
be free including myself may all beings be

168
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:43,799
happy may all beings be free

169
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:49,440
ding ding

170
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:56,120
ding that's our verbal Bell thank you all for your practice thank you for your

171
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:02,760
practice so the Arc of our practice

172
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,840
tonight was we started by um parts of

173
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:15,120
the body wishing ease inviting ease settling in the neck and shoulders

174
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:22,600
putting the proverbial weight of the world down for just this little while KN that we can always pick it up after the

175
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:28,200
the session but just to have a rest bit so that we can have more stability to be

176
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,480
in the world as things keep changing and shifting and being impermanent in the way that they

177
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:43,519
are and challenging in the way that they tend to be so neck and shoulders or hands

178
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,919
inviting them to rest having gratitude appreciation IMB them with appreciation

179
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:56,559
our feet similarly inviting the breath to flow as

180
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,840
it likes to flow with appreciation and then the whole body sense of Goodwill friendliness

181
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:09,000
gentleness So Meta as a way of know gentle friendliness for body

182
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:15,440
parts and I invited you if there's one body part that needs more care to wrap

183
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,679
it in more care and if that body part happens to be in pain or suffering

184
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:29,120
having a difficult time then our meta practice our Goodwill practice becomes compassion practice because remember

185
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,480
care or meta Goodwill plus suffering this hold suffering that's compassion

186
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:42,399
compassion is equal to meta plus suffering meta Plus Pain Goodwill plus

187
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:49,760
pain so in that way meta Goodwill shape shifts into compassion when it meets

188
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:55,639
suffering and pain and it shape shifts back into Goodwill when we're meeting

189
00:32:55,639 --> 00:33:02,440
perhaps the body if there's no suffering or pain so we explored that a little bit

190
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:07,679
and then I invited you if if you're opening up to the whole body body parts

191
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,240
then well guess what this whole you know my my self my dear self is made up for

192
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:19,039
all these parts so can we wish ourselves well may I be well may I be safe happy

193
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:27,880
healthy have ease or whatever phrases work for you and and staying with those spaces so um that was roughly the Arc of

194
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:36,600
our practiced or a few other things um that was roughly the arc so so with

195
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:43,240
that with that I want to invite a particular practice tonight as we go

196
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:49,080
into um small groups together and the

197
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:58,880
I'm going to describe what the invitation is and then I'll I I'll lay out the small the uh breakout group uh

198
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:07,519
guidance so so the invitation for the prompt tonight is the prompt is um what

199
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:14,480
part of the body needs needs the this moment in time is the

200
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:21,280
whole actually I put the guy uh I I'll get to the um uh breakout room

201
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,079
guidelines in a moment but the the the um uh prompt is what part of the body

202
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:32,358
needs more care in this moment in time um

203
00:34:32,359 --> 00:34:37,960
and in a small group for example if I was if it was my turn the small group I

204
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:43,079
would say well maybe I'll dedicate you know this this period of this you know

205
00:34:43,079 --> 00:34:49,679
the two minutes that I'm or the one minute that I'm checking in to my lower back it's it's been sitting a lot today

206
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,480
it's all tied and and I just appreciate that you know my back really does so

207
00:34:55,480 --> 00:35:01,520
much and it's been injured before and it's hanging in there and thank you back just

208
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:07,040
this sense of appreciating and really bringing bringing meta hearing yourself

209
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,079
speak out loud with kindness because a lot of times with our body parts we

210
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,400
we're angry we feel like they're letting us down or or um it's not so much this

211
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:25,280
meta filed relationship that we have and if there's no discomfort maybe you decide oh my hands they've been typing

212
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:32,480
all day and they've answering emails and they've been working thank you hands I so appreciate um that that these hands

213
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:39,680
are doing what they're doing or my feet or whatever or maybe your whole body that it's you know not so bad today yeah

214
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:47,480
of course you're aging and and all of that as as everyone is but you know today it's U the the body just bringing

215
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:54,119
more meta so so uh going over the guidance for the

216
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:59,880
small groups and standing for mindfully speaking listening E standing for

217
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:06,960
compassion embracing compassion staying on topic and the topic today is how what

218
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,960
part of the body do you want to give more meta more compassion perhaps to if there's a challenge and um maybe you

219
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,000
you'll have a minute or two to if you want a minute to speak about that and

220
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,640
we'll go in reverse alphabetical order um you'll say something and please make

221
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:34,200
sure everybody else has time to also uh mindfulness out loud uh give

222
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:39,319
some meta to to any part of the body that needs more care and support or

223
00:36:39,319 --> 00:36:45,760
maybe the entire body taking turns briefly and avoiding cross talk so um if

224
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:53,880
any questions you can share in chat but otherwise I'm going to go ahead and create the the breakout rooms uh for us

225
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:00,280
to have the opportunity to to speak out loud to practice out loud in the small

226
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:06,680
groups and see what it's like to acknowledge to actually to appreciate these bodies that we often take for

227
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:13,920
granted we take them as work hes or or goodness knows

228
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:18,960
so so breakout rooms here we go I'm

229
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:26,160
creating them now and remember as long as you're kind you're um yeah you're

230
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,680
you're kind you're being generous to yourself and to each other

231
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,560
you're doing this practice right so um I going to open the breakout rooms take

and uh just giving some more love to to to the body part especially if they're challenged any any discoveries any aha

255

257
00:47:32,359 --> 00:47:34,759
what what

258
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:02,640
happened Andy says we had fun connection nice oh that's sweet

259
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:07,799
nice Diana I see your hand

260
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:16,079
please this was a wonderful meditation really bringing me back

261
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:24,240
to all that's good and present and so I really enjoyed it and and got a lot

262
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:31,440
benefit from it I have a question about something you said earlier um about

263
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:38,440
meta shapes or shifts into compassion when there's pain for

264
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:45,160
me I mean it just seems like it happens automatically that is that what you

265
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:52,760
meant in other words sometimes a com compassion comes without me thinking

266
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:57,799
oh I need what do I need here what it just pops

267
00:48:57,799 --> 00:49:04,760
up is that part of that's that's exactly it that's what I mean Diana that's exactly it so so you know sometimes it's

268
00:49:04,760 --> 00:49:12,319
a surprise what's that it's a surprise somehow yeah yeah it just shows up yeah

269
00:49:12,319 --> 00:49:18,480
so I mean a couple of different things I think one is um uh yes it's it's lovely

270
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:25,280
that it comes up when it's needed right oh yeah that since you've practiced compassion and for so long and part of

271
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:31,880
happy hour and there was pain pain or suffering or difficulty oh compassion is is is the automatic response of the

272
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:38,480
heart instead of beating yourself up or beating somebody else up like well you're having a tough time today well

273
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,599
get it together girl like instead of that like oh sweetheart you're having a hard time okay do you need care do you

274
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:49,520
need what do you need in order to to to be able to uh feel better and be able to

275
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:55,240
to meet the world in a wiser way right so so that's the the automatic response

276
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:01,640
that comes up right instead of the former the latter that's one that's one part of this but I was making a

277
00:50:01,640 --> 00:50:07,960
different point Diana the point I was making with the shape shifting is the

278
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:14,760
following sometimes uh some people have this conception that compassion is one

279
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:21,400
practice and meta loving kindness is a different practice but what I'm trying what I'm saying is that yeah they're

280
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:29,040
their join at the hip it's really meta it's Goodwill so Goodwill is the basic

281
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:34,680
expression of friendliness of the heart and when good Goodwill comes across

282
00:50:34,680 --> 00:50:40,280
someone who's suffering or if that someone is ourselves um there's

283
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:46,720
suffering there's pain when meta meets suffering it becomes compassion it shape

284
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:52,000
shifts it's the same thing it's not of a different ilk it's just the circumstance

285
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:57,160
of what it's meeting but it's the same kindness Goodwill care of the heart it's

286
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:04,880
not a totally different practice it's the same practice of the heart that now is meeting difficulty that's what I mean

287
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:12,400
I thought that's what you were saying I just thought it was a Wonder it's just if it's something for me to wonder about

288
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:20,160
as in a Wonder all right thank you thank you a miracle a miracle or something El to me

289
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:28,559
thank you sweet thank you so much and Claire V

290
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:40,520
you're still muted Claire try again an an extension of Diana's question would

291
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:50,880
empathy fall into the same mix yeah so so that's a really good

292
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:58,400
question and think of empathy as a constituent of compassion it's not

293
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:05,000
empathy is not equal to compassion empathy is is a constituent so

294
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:10,280
so we need empathy to feel our own pain

295
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:16,960
it sounds strange to say that but to feel someone else's pain and to think of that aspect is the meeting of the pain

296
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:24,359
the acknowledgment of the pain right so compassion has two aspects it's it's meeting acknowledging of the pain and

297
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:30,000
then holding it with care okay so the empathy is meeting of the pain is just

298
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,119
meeting and if you end it if you stopped at empathy that would be empathy

299
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:42,559
practice um and empathy practice alone without that care warmth kindness can

300
00:52:42,559 --> 00:52:50,040
Veer into empathic distress because you're just feeling the pain oh this is painful oh this is hard oh poor you this

301
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:57,440
is you can Veer into actually uh pity also or or uh empathy distress which

302
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:05,400
some people think of as compassion fatigue but it's actually empathy fatigue so so empathy is a constituent

303
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:12,480
but it doesn't have the complete picture of of um holding the difficulty not just

304
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:19,079
meeting it but also meeting it with kindness and Care warmth so empathy and

305
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:24,880
some people consider again going one step deeper you can think of empathy

306
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:30,280
especially as your empathizing with someone else's pain as the the way that

307
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:36,880
say our bodies Our Hearts our brains light light up and and they um there areas in the brain that become more

308
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:42,000
activated when we see other people being in pain so there studies where if you

309
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:48,720
see someone for example being poked by a needle then you feel pain like ouch ouch right that's the mirror neurons that's

310
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:54,920
the empathy you're empathizing with someone else's pain that's not compassion right compassion would be

311
00:53:54,920 --> 00:54:01,720
ouch that's painful oh I'm that's hard oh dear one this you know how uh I I

312
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:08,319
wish you well I wish you freedom I wish you ease from this pain there's that care that you bring and different areas

313
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:15,240
of the brain light up when it is compassion not just the the Mir neurons the prain centers but also the filial

314
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:21,960
the warmth the care areas of the brain get more activated when you do compassion practice because it's both

315
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:28,680
it's feeling the pain and holding it with care and that I cannot EMP ize that

316
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:33,810
enough make sense thanks Claire thanks for that

317
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:40,440
[Music] question any other questions Reflections how was it I would love to hear actually

318
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:46,079
if anyone would like to report well how was it in the small groups uh offering

319
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:53,000
more care to a part of your body out loud acknowledging Valery

320
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,520
um yeah I it was really good for me I

321
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:08,680
was telling my small group I had this thing happen last night where I was in a community of people I really care about

322
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:14,720
and there was a couple there that I see a lot of places and I really care about

323
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:19,920
them and uh they're very sweet and I she asked me how I was doing and I told her

324
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:26,839
I wasn't doing well that I was waking up in the middle of the night like in Terror and very quickly it became

325
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:31,960
evident that like she's like a very different

326
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:37,119
political side than I was and she started saying some things that I just

327
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:44,720
was like what are you saying like and um I wasn't expecting it at all and I made

328
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:49,960
an assumption that that you know we were maybe closer

329
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:55,839
together on some things and anyway I had such a reaction to her and I had to

330
00:55:55,839 --> 00:56:01,039
leave I had to like leave her company and then I was sitting in a a reserved

331
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:09,240
area that she had sponsored and and that I felt so hard in my heart with her like

332
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:15,640
I just didn't like how I reacted I didn't like and it was colding both not

333
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:21,039
me not liking what she was saying and then not also not liking my reaction and

334
00:56:21,039 --> 00:56:29,160
I I kind of settled myself and resourced myself and then I went back to her and just offered some loving kindness to her

335
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:34,440
like I told her how important she was to me in the community and how much I care

336
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:42,280
like how and it's so funny how much I can care for her and then when I hear like things that I I don't like how how

337
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:49,319
I was rejecting her and so I didn't I mean I just went to her and just apologized for my reaction and just

338
00:56:49,319 --> 00:56:54,760
offered my loving kindness to her and she was very gracious and she hugged me and

339
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:00,960
um it was very loving and for her I don't I don't think she had any

340
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:07,760
reactions but um but it felt so good in my heart to offer that to her but I noticed during the meditation I was

341
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:15,280
still feeling a little of that contraction around her and so it was the meditation was really helpful for me to

342
00:57:15,280 --> 00:57:21,079
just offer love be in loving kindness with people that I don't agree with or

343
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:27,359
um so it's really powerful very helpful and and it's a

344
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:32,839
practice right yeah it's a exactly we're always learning and and and I really

345
00:57:32,839 --> 00:57:39,400
appreciate how you shared that uh you wisdom arose as you were sitting in this

346
00:57:39,400 --> 00:57:45,520
area wisdom arose oh dear you know this is not how I want to show up in in the world I want to show up with with

347
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:51,359
kindness I want to show up with loving kindness even if I disagree with with people I want to show up with kindness

348
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:57,000
seeing for their humanity and and how you actually corrected this just I'm I'm

351
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:18,480
I'm really I'm really feel like I'm practicing listening staying listening and I just was surprised at my reaction

352
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:23,720
I think because I wasn't expecting it in the setting but uh yeah you know we keep

353
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:31,359
practicing and noticing reac activities and holding it with kindness compassion for ourselves and others thanks Valerie

appreciate what you just shared get it and what was really quickly what was the

356
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:53,599
Imaging that shows up in the brain around empathy could you restate what you said just before Valerie's question

357
00:58:53,599 --> 00:59:00,400
do you remember what yeah yeah um so so the um so with compassion practice two

358
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:06,200
areas of the brain become more activated more active one is the areas that that

359
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:12,839
get active when when we feel pain when we feel our own pain and when we feel other people's pain right when we if you

360
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:21,079
see somebody else in pain the areas of the brain that that get activated when you are in pain get activated that's one

361
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:28,440
the other one is the area areas of the brain that have to do with with family and love and care and warmth those areas

362
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:34,720
get light up so both of those okay okay okay so and and those are two different
