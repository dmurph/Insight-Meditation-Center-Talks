00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:05,639
hello and

2
00:00:06,439 --> 00:00:11,480
welcome and for this meditation

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,920
today I'd like to start with a kind of

4
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:22,439
a simplistic statement for the purpose of

5
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:30,359
making a point that some that we want to be careful that we're not using meditation

6
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:37,480
as a customer as a consumer and overlooking that in

7
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:43,320
meditation we should be the producer now that doesn't mean that we

8
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,559
have to work a lot but we have to create the we have to

9
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,120
bring forth the conditions that

10
00:00:54,120 --> 00:01:01,000
allow uh the practice to mature and develop the the practice does require

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:07,799
something from us but it's a it's a unusual thing it

12
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:14,159
requires and one way to understand it is that

13
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,600
um uh our hearts our minds our inner life our spiritual life is very

14
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:27,920
influenced influenceable that uh and what we're trying to do is to create the put

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:36,200
together those influences in good Buddhist language is uh we

16
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:41,600
are uh conditioned the it's it's the uh

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,240
we putting together the conditions that allow something to mature and

18
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:56,079
develop and our role is to bring along to produce to make happen

19
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,439
the conditions and then we have to make room and time for those conditions to

20
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:09,280
condition us so like a farmer or Gardener who uh has a role in creating

21
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:16,720
the right conditions for a seed to sprout germinate and to plant to

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:24,200
grow uh once the conditions are in place uh The Gardener has to make room and

23
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:31,160
give time and be patient for everything to develop and grow

24
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:37,519
and so the question is what are we what are the conditions to put in

25
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,080
place many years ago I met um um a young

26
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,599
monk one of the first monks I met in Thailand when the first time I went there when I went to a meditation

27
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:59,799
Monastery and was clearly it was had a reputation of being a very very deep practitioner realized

28
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:07,760
Buddhist in some ways and it was remarkable to look into his eyes very deep

29
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:15,959
peaceful so I asked him uh what he had attained uh through his practice not

30
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,319
knowing at that time that that was somewhat an impolite question to ask a monk because they're actually not

31
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:31,000
supposed to um they're not allowed it's very uh uh strict rule for man ICS not

32
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:38,319
to talk about their spiritual attainments with a lay person but I didn't know that so I asked

33
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,760
him what had he attained through his practice and uh his his answer struck me

34
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:52,680
very deeply and has affected me ever since um he said nonc

35
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:58,319
contention and uh and so this idea of living a life of

36
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:05,360
non-c contention is one way of saying to live a peaceful

37
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:14,560
life to live with peace and to sit in

38
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:21,160
meditation leaving alone other aspects of our life for now to sit in meditation

39
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,720
and create the conditions for the plant to grow create the conditions to be

40
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,560
influenced in a good way uh it really helps to practice non-c

41
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:41,080
contention it helps to practice peace ease to be at ease with what's happening

42
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,479
for us and that's what we bring that's what

43
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,360
we need to in some ways produce as hard as it might be

44
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:59,199
to bring at least a mind form of mindfulness a more a form of relating to

45
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:05,919
our exper experience that is peaceful or easeful nonc

46
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:11,639
contentious and so of course we have contention in our life but the task then

47
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:21,000
is to hold the contention with non-c contention hold it peacefully so that uh the peace is what

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,160
influences us and shapes us and grows in us we don't want to have contention

49
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:35,120
growing we don't want to have hostility growing conflict growing and not a few people are

50
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,039
cultivating conflict with themselves

51
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:50,280
and if we concerned with the world around us let's not cultivate more

52
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:56,479
contention let's cultivate wise contention let's cultivate the capacity

53
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:03,720
to be peaceful at ease as we engage in difference differences in opinion as we

54
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,880
engage in the challenges of our life not only is a good for ourselves but it

55
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:16,440
creates good conditions for the world so to assume a meditation

56
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,000
posture ideally it's a posture of nonc

57
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,840
contention I've known people who have come across a meditator sitting in a a

58
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:36,680
classic meditation posture and there was something about the peace

59
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:42,000
Stillness of that person that changed the viewer for their

60
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:51,000
lifetime one person I know uh became a meditator and a

61
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,759
practitioner someone else that I read about became a Buddhist

62
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,840
teacher because I was so struck she had lived such a contentious life a rebel

63
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:08,800
life angry with the world and she saw someone sitting in this

64
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,360
posture that she thought this is a posture of Peace how do people do

65
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,720
this gently closing your eyes

66
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:39,520
and breathing in such a way that you spread a

67
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,198
calming a calmness through your

68
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:53,120
body maybe breathing longer slower

69
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:02,800
Fuller maybe on the ex exhale longer

70
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:10,280
exhale having like a wave a shower of

71
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,840
calmness flow through your body from the top to the bottom

72
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:42,599
and letting your breathing be normal as you

73
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:51,000
exhale to whatever degree you can can you set your body at

74
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:01,200
ease releasing any ways in which you hold the body body

75
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:08,399
tense ways in which you brace yourself against life for what's

76
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:32,079
coming as you exhale setting your heart heart at

77
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,000
ease the wave of calming the

78
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:45,720
heart enveloping the heart with a care a

79
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:52,440
calmness a peace so the tensions of the heart can

80
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,440
relax soften

81
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:11,720
and relaxing the Mind setting the mind at

82
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:22,560
ease and if you feel uneasy in any

83
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:27,800
way see if you can be easy with

84
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,320
that hold it

85
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:45,760
lightly and can you find within body mind or

86
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:51,839
heart some reference point for being at

87
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:58,240
peace being peaceful or

88
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,040
calm or at ease

89
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:40,279
and to breathe with a

90
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:47,160
peace or imagine that as you exhale or

91
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,720
inhale that you're spreading the peace the calm the

92
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:58,600
ease through your body

93
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,000
breathing breaths of

94
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:22,560
Peace where you relate to your breathing very lightly

95
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,279
softly gently

96
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:52,120
and if it's helpful for you if it's nice you might ever so

97
00:12:53,120 --> 00:13:00,839
gently say in a peaceful way the word peace

98
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:03,320
as you

99
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
exhale

as we come to the end of this

130
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:26,480
sitting may we consider is there any way that you

131
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:37,120
feel now having been meditated that could be a gift for our

132
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:43,880
world where there is

133
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:53,200
agitation may we bring our calm where there is

134
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,398
conflict may we bring our peace

135
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:08,398
where there is struggle let us bring our

136
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:18,200
ease where there is hatred may we bring our

137
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:30,159
love where there is suffering may we bring our compassion

138
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,200
pass where people feel

139
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:50,640
abandoned may we meet them with respect and

140
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:55,760
dignity seeing them clearly

141
00:28:01,399 --> 00:28:10,080
and where there is need let us find a

142
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:18,360
way to support Others May this practice give

143
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:23,640
us the strength and the

144
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,159
inspiration to live for the the welfare and happiness of

145
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:41,000
Others May all beings be happy may all beings be

146
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,760
safe may all beings be

147
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:52,399
peaceful may all beings be free

[Music]

149
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,200
thank

150
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
you e

151
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:25,720
so good morning and welcome to the second talk in a series called to transform the

152
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:34,080
world and um one of the purposes for me being a

153
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:41,960
Buddhist teacher dedicating my life to Buddhist practice is

154
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:48,240
um to support this world to be able

155
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:55,120
to teach a path of practice that leads to the end of

156
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:01,799
suffering and the more that I know their suffering in the world the more I want

157
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:07,639
to meet it and address it and my particular way is through

158
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:12,760
Buddhist practice primarily that I understand to

159
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:19,880
be um pointing to the root causes the very Foundation of where suffering and

160
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:25,480
conflict arise and that uh I feel like it's very

161
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:31,039
important that we address suffering and conflict in all

162
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:38,320
the ways that can alleviate it but that we shouldn't neglect the root

163
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:45,159
causes and since there's very few people who do that uh I think I try to

164
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:52,799
specialize in that in some way or that's what the specialty of Buddhism is not to diminish the other ways the

165
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:58,720
extremely important but what what does Buddhism

166
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:05,120
have to offer what does this practice have to offer the world and

167
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:13,559
um it offers a profound example of a way of living not in

168
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,880
Conflict Not In Contention not in despair or anger or

169
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:25,200
and anxiety because we've seen the roots of

170
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:31,360
those we found what gives rise to those difficult emotions we've learned how to settle

171
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:38,519
Beyond it we've learned how to let go in a very deep way but not a letting

172
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:44,840
go that removes us from the world many years

173
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:51,480
ago I a teacher of mine said that um the

174
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:58,639
Buddha taught the world to sit and meditate Mahatma Gandhi

175
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:08,320
taught the world that it uh it's uh significant where you sit and

176
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:13,840
meditate and so I understood this statement to be that it's one thing to go meditate

177
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:22,799
alone now to develop peace for oneself it's another thing to uh

178
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:30,760
sit um uh and meditate in front of of

179
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:38,559
uh tanks approaching violence in the

180
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:44,679
works sit and be peaceful in the presence of those who are

181
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:50,200
contentious so the idea that we would not just be alone and practice for

182
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:55,440
ourselves but to practice for others to be the kind of people who can be agents of

183
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,519
change but how do we change the World there are many ways the world

184
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:06,240
changes and I don't want to diminish any of the values of the wholesome ways of

185
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:15,599
ethical ways of changing the world for the better but uh I think that uh to do it

186
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:21,520
with love and to do it with be with being um

187
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:28,398
carriers of Peace agents of peace and these two are so important

188
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:36,000
and uh one reference point I have for this is raising children and children who are not

189
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,480
loved uh grow up in problematic ways that it's a huge impact on a child

190
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:51,800
not to be seen not to be loved to feel it's almost a form of trauma to not have

191
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:58,320
that if a child grows up with parents are always anxious the child learns that

192
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,920
the world is a scary place and there's reasons to be anxious if a child grows up with angry

193
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:12,320
parents maybe the child grows up afraid maybe the child grows up shut

194
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:21,240
down maybe the child grows up to be angry as well and uh there's a phenomena where

195
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:29,040
people who are bullied people who are oppressed people who are

196
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,440
um will then turn around and do the same to the people who are lower than them on

197
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:40,680
the social picking order and just perpetuates the

198
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:49,640
cycle and um and so but if children grow up with peace they learn that there is

199
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,160
peace in this world it is possible to breathe at peace and be at ease if

200
00:35:55,160 --> 00:36:02,960
children learn to uh uh see generosity see caring for others then

201
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:08,000
they learn that that's valuable and it's possible for that that what they learn

202
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,400
growing up the conditions in which they grow up in has a huge impact on children

203
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:19,119
that can affect them their whole life human beings are conditioned

204
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:26,319
creatures we are conditioned we are influenced by the things that come our way that how we

205
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:33,800
live and so the same thing is true for us that uh if we live angry we are

206
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:40,400
reinforcing anger and developing within us if we live peacefully or with love we

207
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,720
we enforce that and one of the characteristics of this is that some activities that are

208
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:54,440
object focused that are so much about hating someone so much about wanting

209
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:02,599
power so much about getting something thing um uh it Narrows the

210
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:09,560
attention it it disconnects people from themselves there's other ways of living

211
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:15,400
that open up a connection to ourselves and others that doesn't narrow it and uh

212
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:21,720
and put blinders on so love without Need

213
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:29,240
Love Without craving or clinging is the one that opens us up to see more widely

214
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:35,000
ourselves in the world being at peace is an experience

215
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:42,440
that opens us up to see more widely and be present for what's happening to be mindful to be present to

216
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,800
be respectful to be caring to be compassionate all these have a very can

217
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:55,560
can have a very different movement that uh is opening and spreading rather than narrowing and

218
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:04,480
Contracting and so ites makes a world of difference which of these we take and now either one conditions us

219
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:11,200
either one has a influence on us if we live peacefully it creates more peace in

220
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:17,960
ourselves if we live peacefully it spreads peace if we live in Conflict it

221
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:24,040
spreads conflict and some of these things are self-fulfilling if we live in conflict

222
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:30,839
and in Anger it's more likely that people will be in conflict with us and be hostile towards

223
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:38,640
us people don't like to have hostility directed to them and they'll turn away or or bark

224
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:46,920
back if we meet the world with peace with love with care then um that doesn't

225
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:54,280
give people as much occasion to be angry to be hostile it might even make hostile

226
00:38:54,280 --> 00:39:00,000
people peaceful um and

227
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,119
um I've had conflict with people where the conflict seemed to you know have no

228
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:13,920
end in sight when we stayed apart but when I go towards a person sit with a

229
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:20,440
person and I sit that with peacefully and uh attentively and caringly and

230
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:27,400
willing to be open to our conversation to find out what's going on for the other person more often than not it's

231
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,480
settles things it creates more the conditions for some kind of

232
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:40,760
Frank and careful conversation of course there's no guarantee and maybe some things are only

233
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:45,960
happen in the long term some things happen in the aggregate over time with many

234
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:53,920
people but to a very important way uh we create the world uh according

235
00:39:53,920 --> 00:40:00,480
to how we are if we want a world that's peaceful it's important that we live

236
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,359
peacefully if if we want to have a world where

237
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:13,079
love where the power of love is stronger than the love for

238
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:21,160
power we need to trust the love and live with love and give strength to our

239
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:28,359
love so to find a way to live to find a way of

240
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:35,040
being that is the message we want the world to hear the influence that we want

241
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:41,800
to have on the world and we should never succumb to the

242
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:49,160
belief that our singular individual efforts make no

243
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:56,800
difference they're not big enough they're not important enough we should never hand over the authority of the

244
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,440
wellbeing being to others others have to change others have to do

245
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:08,800
something others have to stop if we're waiting for others to

246
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,040
change we will never be agents of change that changes the world for the

247
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:24,240
better if you're waiting for others to change change the world then in some ways we are showing

248
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:32,839
the world a resignation a p I ity a giving up our own

249
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:39,400
agency may it be that as we

250
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:46,839
um uh may it be that you all become agents of

251
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:58,000
change not in a way to exhaust you not a way to stress you not no way to um um

252
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:07,079
maybe even change your life too much but that you go through this world in a way

253
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:12,440
that gives love kindness peace

254
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:19,079
care respect a prominent role in how you meet

255
00:42:19,079 --> 00:42:26,160
the world don't be distracted don't find yourself narrowing

256
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:31,280
your attention around a desire a fear and

257
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,839
hostility so you're not available to open up to the all of who you are so

258
00:42:37,839 --> 00:42:43,079
that the fullness of you is what

259
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:51,280
conveys peace into this world the fullness of you is conveys care non-c

260
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:57,040
contention everyone can do this

261
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:04,319
and uh I hope that meditation is one way that teaches us

262
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:11,079
guides us to this possibility may we be agents of

263
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:17,200
Peace in every way we talk and every way we walk and every way that

264
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,800
we um

265
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:28,400
meet others may we be agents of peace

266
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:31,599
thank you
