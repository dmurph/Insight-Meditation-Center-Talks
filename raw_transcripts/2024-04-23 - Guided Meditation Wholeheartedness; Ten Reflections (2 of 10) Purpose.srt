1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:06,920
so good morning everyone

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:15,040
welcome and I find myself sitting here somewhat

3
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,160
quiet so

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:32,439
the background of our discussion meditation today is these four these 10

5
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:40,640
Reflections or 10 um foundational aspects of a human life

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,239
that it's useful to think about and reflect on and uh today the topic is

7
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:54,879
purpose and in relationship to purpose I would like to talk about

8
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:01,640
confidence that uh whatever our purpose is to do it

9
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:07,960
wholeheartedly to see that whatever we have to do in the

10
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:14,119
moment that what's important one of the one of the aspects of purpose is not the

11
00:01:14,119 --> 00:01:20,840
purpose of the activity but uh the purpose of doing something

12
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:27,600
wholeheartedly our life is too precious to do things half-heartedly and even if it's a

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,479
mundane task even if it's a and not such an important thing that we're doing

14
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:43,920
seemingly uh that the fact that we're doing it is important and uh and so

15
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,399
to the doing the fact that we are have the ability the capacity to engage in

16
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,399
something if we're cleaning the kitchen that uh to not do it

17
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,759
half-heartedly but to there's something very profound about giving ourselves fully to the task at hand as if it's the

18
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:11,599
most important thing even if it's not so important in and of itself our ability to be alive at any

19
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:17,000
given moment and give ourselves to our activity that is

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,440
important and um so that is the um task

21
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:30,400
of the meditation is to give yourself to the meditation wholeheartedly

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,840
and

23
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:47,840
um and what would that look like for you to just this task to do it this is

24
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,080
the per for these 30 minutes the purpose is this is the purpose not to

25
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:58,360
strain to strain is to do things in a certain kind of way

26
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:06,080
half-heartedly because we're leaving out so much of who we are but to do it in a relaxed Way open

27
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,760
way inclusive way of all of who we are bringing as much as who we are here into

28
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,360
the experience there's purpose to that there's a way of finding fulfillment not

29
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,000
in the task we're doing but in how we do it the freedom we find to give ourselves

30
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:30,640
to it in a full wholehearted way

31
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:36,680
so to assume meditation posture and part of the value of

32
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:44,319
meditation posture is to do a posture that feels to you that you can now give

33
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:51,239
yourself to the task of meditation that you can you really can be present for it

34
00:03:51,239 --> 00:04:01,159
in a nice way and um so a posture of attention a posture

35
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:05,319
of presence being

36
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:14,640
present gently closing your eyes and part of the purpose for closing

37
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,079
the eyes is so that we're less likely to be

38
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:27,800
distracted and we can give ourselves over to this Simplicity of just

39
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:34,120
sitting in Zen they use the expression for meditation just

40
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:41,120
sitting what are you doing I'm just sitting not thinking about other things

41
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:48,280
not thinking about what I'm going to attain and what I'm going to accomplish in meditation not uh thinking about what

42
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:56,400
happened yesterday not judging myself just sitting just sitting here

43
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,720
and in that expression just sitting in Zen is the idea of

44
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:08,360
a a wholeness a wholeheartedness a fullness of being here for this

45
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:13,639
experience that there's purpose to that there's value to

46
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:22,720
that so to have confidence in just sitting just being here with our

47
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:32,600
experience and taking some deep slow

48
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,800
breaths relaxing as you

49
00:05:51,800 --> 00:06:00,720
exhale as you settle in relax into your body

50
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,199
let your breathing return to

51
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,280
normal and with a normal breathing continue relaxing your body in ways that

52
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,639
are easy there is a way in which relaxing

53
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:24,560
the tensions of the body allows us to be more whole

54
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,720
or in our engagement in meditation more more

55
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,360
of us can be

56
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:41,039
included here just sitting just

57
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:47,120
breathing there's a deep satisfaction in the body and the heart

58
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:54,680
and the mind to be fully involved in the task at

59
00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:02,319
hand there's purpose to just sitting being present here and

60
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:08,599
now and through these next minutes to give yourself over to this purpose of

61
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:15,440
being here gently quietly without

62
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:23,599
strain willing to let go of whatever it takes

63
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:31,520
you way from being here fully In This Moment's

64
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:36,560
experience until you appreciate that it isn't the experience that's

65
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,919
important but rather the wholeheartedness and freedom that

66
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:52,520
comes with choosing to be aware with this now

67
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,479
for for

68
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
for

69
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
for

70
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
for

71
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
for

72
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

73
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,200
for for

74
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
for

75
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
for

76
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079
for for

77
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

78
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,880
for for

79
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:09,880
for

80
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,799
for

81
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:10,440
when there is confidence or faith inspiration in the purpose of

82
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:20,840
meditation perhaps you can give yourself over more fully to the task at

83
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:32,640
hand there's value in a whole wholehearted relaxed

84
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:37,480
attention to Here and Now

85
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

86
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

87
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

88
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

89
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

90
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
for for

91
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

92
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,278
for e

93
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:16,559
and then as we come to the end of this

94
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:28,440
sitting to appreciate that we have the capacity

95
00:26:29,399 --> 00:26:36,320
to bring kindness friendliness to the people we encounter

96
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:43,039
in our daily life we have the capacity to bring

97
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:48,840
respect and attention and

98
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,399
well-wishing and then this is profoundly valuable for the people we encounter

99
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:02,679
and for ourselves in our relationship to

100
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:09,360
others that there's a purpose to

101
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,559
living with kindness and respect there's value and

102
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:22,720
meaning to live in a way that supports others in their

103
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,799
lives and thereby supports ourselves and so we end this

104
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:37,480
meditation preparing ourselves to go out into the world or encounter with other

105
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,720
people to do so in the foundation of

106
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,640
meditation to do so with kindness and Care respect and

107
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:57,840
well-wishing and so we say at the end of the sitting

108
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:04,320
as a way of expressing Our intention our purpose our

109
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:11,320
aspiration may all beings be

110
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:18,720
happy may all beings be

111
00:28:18,919 --> 00:28:23,679
healthy may all beings be

112
00:28:24,519 --> 00:28:30,120
safe may all beings be peaceful

113
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,240
and may all beings be

114
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,120
free and may we in whatever way that we

115
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:51,880
can see the purpose live find purpose in these

116
00:28:52,440 --> 00:29:00,720
aspirations so we contribute to making it possible may all be be

117
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:13,240
[Music]

118
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,480
happy thank

119
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
you e

120
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:36,159
so welcome to this second talk on the 10 profound

121
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:43,480
Reflections that we can engage in to live a Dharma life a spiritual life a

122
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:48,960
whole life and these 10 Reflections are not just good

123
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:55,200
for Dharma practice they're actually very important Reflections for any human

124
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:02,080
life because they point to the totality of profound concerns profound ways in

125
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:10,240
which we are animated we are we are motivated to live a full

126
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,440
life and so yesterday I talked about

127
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,360
meaning so today following up and closely connected to meaning is purpose

128
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,760
tomorrow will be agency followed by

129
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:33,559
autonomy and and then um identity and

130
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:41,679
dignity community and kinship and then healing and

131
00:31:41,679 --> 00:31:47,399
Reconciliation so each of these is worth giving time to and so we're kind of in some ways going through these quickly

132
00:31:47,399 --> 00:31:54,559
and over these 10 days we're meeting but I'm hoping it gives you a a

133
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:00,519
valuable orientation for how to think about your life and consider it so today

134
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:06,360
is meaning uh purpose today is purpose and as I said it's closely connected to

135
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:13,080
meaning that uh meaning sometimes um provides a sense of purpose for what

136
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,919
we're how we're living our life or in some large way but also the purpose for

137
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:28,000
the particular activity we're engaged in at any given time and um so even if we're uh you know

138
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:35,240
stopped in the gas station to put gasoline in our car that um uh you know

139
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:41,399
we could say what's the purpose for doing that well it's to put gas in my car and then we check it off we we

140
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:46,919
checked out and recognize the purpose but you can ask the question more deeply

141
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,200
yes but what's the purpose of having gasoline in my car oh so I can my car

142
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:58,559
can take me places but what's the purpose for that that's the purpose the purpose for that is so I can do the

143
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:05,320
things that are important in my life visit the people who are sick or go to work and be able to support my

144
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:11,039
family and what's the purpose for that and so the question what's the purpose

145
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:17,279
um there's layers and layers and keep asking what's the purpose what's the purpose until we find that uh maybe what

146
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:24,799
we're doing doesn't really have a import more a really valuable purpose sometimes the purpose just to

147
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:31,240
become uh wealthy or just become have uh promotions at work might seem very

148
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:38,960
important and drive a person's Behavior Uh day and night sometimes but um but we

149
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:46,480
really get down into the roots of our being our life so well that what doesn't really uh support us it does not really

150
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:55,159
so great uh to have that be the primary purpose of our life and um we go to the gas station to

151
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:02,279
get gasoline and what's the purpose there uh maybe the purpose is to uh uh you

152
00:34:02,279 --> 00:34:08,280
know go pay cash with a cashier if we still do that and um and to have a human

153
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:15,800
interaction with someone and take the time to look at them and H you know say hello and see if what what what's

154
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:20,919
possible part of the purpose we could add purposes to what we do that uh and

155
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:25,878
and animate it with something of a really great

156
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:31,638
value but to reflect on what's the purpose of my life what's the purpose of

157
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:37,000
my work what's the purpose of my activity um am I imbuing it with the

158
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:43,919
purpose that's valuable and this relates to the Buddhist uh idea that whatever we're

159
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:50,440
doing um should be uh considered whether it's wholesome or UNH wholesome is it

160
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:55,599
beneficial or not beneficial is it skillful or not skillful is it healthy

161
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:02,079
or unhealthy that um and this idea of that it's wholesome means that not only is it

162
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:09,320
wholesome and valuable in and of itself but it also brings good consequence and so in Buddhism the sense

163
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:14,839
of purpose is uh to to uh is to do the

164
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:21,119
things that are consequentially beneficial so do they benefit my own

165
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:27,119
spiritual growth so how I stop to get gasoline how does this benefit my

166
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:35,200
spiritual grow growth um well maybe it doesn't really benefit it to do to multitask and to be on the phone and to

167
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,960
um you know uh pump gas at the same time what's

168
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,880
beneficial is to really have the stability and the calm and the centeredness to really just be there for

169
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:54,000
the activity of doing getting the gas and so it's a training ground for

170
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:01,119
presence for attention and and over the long term we're really develop veling our capacity to be here and present uh

171
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:08,400
so that we're not divided we're not distracted that something deep can well up inside we can develop the practice in

172
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,760
some important way or is it beneficial for other people what we're doing how we

173
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:20,440
pay a cashier uh what are does that have any benefit for them is the way we do it

174
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:27,280
I've had some wonderful conversations with cashiers in the Market Supermarket um especially sometimes I

175
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,040
like to or early in the morning when there's not a lot of people there and uh and then there's a wonderful chance to

176
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,480
have some connection um and I have uh I don't know if some of the cashiers remember me but I remember them and and

177
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:47,319
they're kind of have a warm place in my heart uh just because uh they're there early in the morning and and um and it

178
00:36:47,319 --> 00:36:52,760
just had this wonderful nice connection and

179
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:58,480
um so the idea in Buddhism is to one sense of purpose is there's a path of

180
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:05,960
practice there's a path of spiritual growth that we can be engaged in and that's extremely valuable it's very

181
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:11,480
meaningful to be in a path to Liberation to Freedom Liberation from all forces

182
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:19,160
that are harmful all forces that diminish us us or contract us or um uh

183
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:28,520
move us away from a path of liberation of freedom of openness of joy of of uh

184
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:35,119
of generosity and so these are all considered wholesome things and to have

185
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:41,760
a s a purpose that we think is valuable that uh is motivating that gives us a

186
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,520
reason to wake up in the morning it gives us a reason to go to work for example that's not just to get a

187
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,440
paycheck but to do something more profound for ourselves and for others that whatever we're doing we're

188
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:02,599
seeing it as part and parcel of this profound found the meaningful thing to do which is to live a a Dharma life a

189
00:38:02,599 --> 00:38:10,200
life that's on the path of practice the Buddha made a remarkable statement that uh inspired me very much

190
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:18,960
when I heard it first time and still does he said um uh do what is this is my

191
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:25,280
paraphrase do what is wholesome if it is not possible to do

192
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,000
what is wholesome I would not teach you to do what is wholesome but it is

193
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,880
possible to do what is wholesome so you know that it is

194
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,119
possible we can do this path we can cultivate ourselves we can develop

195
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,040
ourselves we can do what is healthy and skillful and purposeful and so to have a

196
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:56,839
sense of purpose that uh that has meaning that has value that has really

197
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:02,280
feel as important for us and so that when we go about our life we're

198
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:10,920
connected to this deep sense of purpose the sense of purpose also um is

199
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:17,880
a wonderful reflection to have when you're thinking about anything you're going to do make any decision and to ask

200
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:23,000
the question why do I want to do this what is the purpose of this activity is

201
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:30,160
this does this is the purpose really serve what is most valuable for me me or for the world around me what is the

202
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,680
purpose of this and many times we do simple things maybe or things which uh

203
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,440
are meant to kind of distract us are meant to uh relieve us us relieve of us

204
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,680
relieve us of some of our stresses and challenges and difficulties and that might be very purposeful and meaningful

205
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:53,599
to do but sometimes it actually takes us away from ourselves and actually doesn't

206
00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:01,160
help us do the really important work that needs to happen in in order to heal a it needs to to develop it needs to

207
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:07,119
help us move into this world in a full and dedicated way and so to ask

208
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:12,480
ourselves keep checking in with ourselves what's the purpose of this what's the purpose of

209
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,560
this to add to that is there a purpose I can add to this yes I have to do this

210
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:27,000
and it's a drag but can I now imbue it with a higher purpose um because purpose

211
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,920
is don't settle for the obvious purpose getting gas I'm just getting gas um can

212
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:39,440
I abue getting gas with a higher purpose um what is it or or a deeper

213
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,640
purpose or whatever metaphor you like for this and um what is the purpose for

214
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:52,000
what I'm doing why am I doing it and to find a profound or important or a

215
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:58,440
valuable sense of purpose for our life is invaluable and it can be found any time

216
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:05,040
at all even if we're on our deathbed that um uh even there what's

217
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:12,640
the purpose Here and Now is the purpose now as I'm dying to

218
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,640
uh linger in my resentments about what happened 20 30 years ago is the purpose

219
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,319
now to worry about um you know the future that

220
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:30,280
I have no control over anymore because you know I only have maybe a minutes or

221
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:37,520
an hour left there is purpose to Letting Go fully there's now a purpose to a

222
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,560
possibility to let go in a deep full way to be really present here and now

223
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:49,280
without the the um extra of the tension

224
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:56,240
of past and future worries regrets uh anticipations dreams about

225
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:04,480
the future just here so fully that even the sense of dying disappears because it

226
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:10,520
just breathing just here now this is invaluable there's purpose to this kind

227
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:16,800
of freedom of being here for this so the sense of

228
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,400
purpose and um I've offered you some words of my own on this topic I don't

229
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:29,880
pres I don't present these ideas as I said yesterday as being the defense ative um discussion

230
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,559
about uh these 10 qualities we're talking about I'm just trying to offer

231
00:42:35,559 --> 00:42:41,400
you uh some of my Reflections on it and what's valuable for me uh with the idea

232
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:46,520
that um hopefully it to be a catalyst for you to think about this for yourself

233
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,280
and maybe you'll come up with very different understanding for each of these 10 Reflections than what I've

234
00:42:52,280 --> 00:42:57,559
presented but if my Reflections have prompted that reflection great I'm happy

235
00:42:57,559 --> 00:43:05,000
for that and um because these are a really important part of the life and there can't be any kind of uh someone

236
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:11,480
else's answers to what these mean for any of you so to spend some time now for

237
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:16,520
the next 24 hours reflecting on purpose

238
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:22,119
what are the purposes that you live by what is the is there some kind of some

239
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:27,720
sense of purpose that's really foundational or fundamental deeper than anything else

240
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:36,119
something that's some sense of purpose that can animate any more obvious purposes any reasons

241
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:44,400
why you do things you can imbue it with a really deep life purpose or deep spiritual purpose for yourself and for

242
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,960
others so to reflect on purpose why you do things and uh and see what you learn

243
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,480
and keep asking the question uh well I have this purpose now what's the purpose

244
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:03,480
for that purpose why is that so important and just kind of keep asking that you know and see how deep you can

245
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:11,079
go or how you can go through the different lay levels and layers of your of your heart of your mind to see to

246
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:17,160
understand yourself better and better and if you have friends you can talk to or paper you

247
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:23,079
can Journal about this topic great take it as far as you have time and interest

248

to do so thank you very much much and uh

249
00:44:28,839 --> 00:44:33,960

250
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:39,960
to meaning and purpose thank you
