1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,200
so hello from Insight Meditation Center here in Redwood

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:11,400
City and um welcome you to our

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,480
meditation and this week the emphasis is on mindfulness of

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,519
breathing um as a and the different foundational approaches or attitudes for

5
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:30,439
mindfulness practice and one of them is um the idea

6
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:37,000
that um there's a wonderful idea I think that

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,640
uh mindfulness of breathing works even when it fails and maybe even the language of

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:53,559
fails shouldn't be used but it's kind of a little bit of a kind of evocative way of saying that

9
00:00:53,559 --> 00:01:00,840
uh if they uh we kind of offer at the beginning our attention to breathing

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,920
but when that doesn't work uh then the task of mindfulness is

11
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,400
not necessarily to go back to the breathing but rather to know to

12
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:18,799
recognize um what is happening to notice what has taken us

13
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:26,079
away and if we notice that and see that then uh we're mindful so even when we're

14
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:32,600
not successful at staying with the breathing the breathing is that reference point

15
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:38,799
for noticing when the mind is drifted off and the more stronger the tendency

16
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:44,439
to drift off in thought be preoccupied uh with anything at all the

17
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:50,680
chances are something in our mind or body has some tension in

18
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:56,280
it uh tension is uh often the

19
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,240
fuel for preoccupation uh tension

20
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,800
clinging strong sense of pressure about wanting something or not wanting something and part of

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,560
mindfulness important part of it is to see that and to see it to know it know

22
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:22,080
that's happening without participating in the pressure in the

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,440
tensing in the desires or the aversions and the Art of it is that just

24
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:35,120
in the knowing just know it clearly or feel it clearly in such a way that's

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,440
kind of like stepping back and and observing rather than being in whatever

26
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,080
is going on participating fueling it engaging in it uh identifying with it

27
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:56,480
identifying with the good cause of the desire or the aversion or the the the

28
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,519
preoccupation so uh in that way and don't worry about how successful you are

29
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:09,480
with staying with the breath uh just do it just practice focus on mindfulness of breathing just enough that it helps you

30
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:15,720
to see better what is the currence of preoccupation the energy the momentum of

31
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:21,080
your mind and heart in a clearer and clearer way and learning how to relax

32
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:28,879
around what's happening as there's more sense of ease or relaxation with the present moment it

33
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,959
might be possible to uh remain longer with the body's

34
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:42,159
experience of breathing and and this idea of lingering

35
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,159
or hanging out with a breath um cruising on the breath floating on the experience

36
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,280
of breathing um surfing on the waves of

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,760
breathing in and breathing out uh when my son was quite young I

38
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:07,239
would put him to sleep by imagining that he was an otter floating on top of a the

39
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:13,599
ocean in a nice comfortable bed of kelp and that the gentle waves would lift him

40
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:19,680
up and down and that the gentle waves was the movements of his breathing and he would just kind of lay in bed kind of

41
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,280
feeling those movements of breathing in and breathing out until he fell asleep

42
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,720
and um so uh so you kind of just stay with

43
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,720
the breathing and there's a number of ways that we can linger with a

44
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,880
breath and uh one is to rest in it one

45
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:50,479
is it to um uh different people find different things are useful but one is to rest in

46
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,479
it the other is just to gaze upon it like you're gazing upon waves coming up

47
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:03,680
and down on the ocean shore perhaps just watching um something that becomes more important

48
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:10,600
as the practice of mindfulness matures is uh some combination sometimes

49
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:18,800
one sometimes the other sometimes both and some combination is to feel the experience of

50
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,960
breathing the sensations of breathing the physicality of breathing to really

51
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:32,000
feel it and to know those Sensations to know movement is movement pressure is

52
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,840
pressure release of pressure contraction is contraction to know warmth is warmth

53
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,280
coolness is coolness to know a smooth movement versus a choppy movement not

54
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:51,960
without judgment just oh this is what it is and the art is to do all this not So

55
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:59,319
Much from the control tower not at all from the control tower in the head but to have an intimacy or to be almost as

56
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:05,599
if if you're in the experience the physical experience of breathing feeling

57
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:10,880
it and gently quietly simply uh knowing

58
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,680
it and sometimes the feeling of the breath is enough to linger and stay and

59
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:22,639
if we kind of rest and surf on those the sensations of breathing and sometimes we

60
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:27,759
um it's really helpful to have some clarity oh this is movement this is

61
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:34,319
pressure this is contraction and um and to know it but to know it not

62
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:41,720
forcefully or to know it not as a checklist that's like okay know it and then on to the next thing but uh the

63
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,360
knowing which is kind of like to know and then almost like The Knowing opens

64
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,000
the Vista opens the Mind opens awareness to feel and experience the breathing

65
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,039
more fully it's almost like the each Act of knowing movement for

66
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:06,520
example there's movement there's a almost like um okay now let's receive

67
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:13,759
welcome that experience of movement more fully so uh those are a lot of words to

68
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,639
explain this and now we we'll guide you with this a little bit more so to take a

69
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:28,000
medit assume a meditation posture

70
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:36,560
and either lower your gaze or close your

71
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:47,360
eyes and so it's less from the control tower and the head directing what's

72
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:53,000
happening let it be almost at the direction of the body

73
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,599
itself Direction Guided by what's comfortable and nice to do from from the

74
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:06,879
body's point of view Let the Body allow the

75
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:14,520
body to take some deeper inhales and deeper

76
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:34,240
exhales and with a deeper exhales relax the body

77
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:54,480
soften with a deeper exhales maybe you can allow the thinking

78
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:01,200
mind to relax and soften as well

79
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,279
on the exhale allowing the center of gravity of your sense of

80
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,800
being to settle into your torso into your

81
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:34,079
body the deeper inhales begin in your

82
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:38,120
torso and end in your

83
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:48,880
torso how does your torso experience

84
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:05,920
breathing and then to let your breathing return to

85
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:13,920
normal take a few moments here to scan through your body and see where

86
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,120
else you can relax in your body

87
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
soften

88
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,440
e as you

89
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,360
exhale maybe calming the thinking

90
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:26,680
mind if there's any sense of contraction or narrowing of the

91
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:32,600
thinking mind on the exhale let that spread

92
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,880
out

93
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,920
widen and if there's any sense that you are your

94
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:03,639
thinking you are your con concerns on the

95
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:10,480
exhale relax and settle yourself your sense of

96
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:19,000
self let it come to a rest deeper in the Torso maybe even all the way to the

97
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
belly

98
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,680
and as you breathe notice the rhythm of breathing

99
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,800
in and breathing

100
00:12:51,320 --> 00:13:00,839
out and which is clear for you breathing in or breathing out

101
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:09,800
The Body Sensations as you inhale or the Body Sensations as you

102
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
exhale

103
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:55,000
and other Body Sensations of breathing which are

104
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:04,160
Pleasant and if there is is whenever they

105
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,360
appear feel them in

106
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:22,480
intimately the pleasant sensations of breathing are an invitation for

107
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:27,680
you to linger to remain

108
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:34,680
resting on the body's experience of

109
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:02,959
breathing and if there are

110
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:10,399
Sensations connected to breathing which are unpleasant or simp or

111
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:17,880
neutral see if you can allow for a kind of pleasant

112
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:25,040
lingering resting in all the sensations of

113
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
breathing

114
00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:04,800
and an important part of mindfulness is feeling the sensations connected to

115
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:12,319
breathing not up in the control tower watching it or thinking about

116
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:19,800
them but allowing the body to

117
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:25,519
feel to sense the

118
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:30,519
sensations to sense the sensation

119
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:38,440
in the place where sensing and Sensations occur

120
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
together

121
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:25,400
with every exhale relaxing and letting go of

122
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:32,520
thinking that Creeps in and as you let go of

123
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:38,640
thinking let go into the sensations of the body

124
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
breathing

125
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

126
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

127
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

128
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
e

129
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

130
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

131
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

132
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:42,158
and as you feel your breathing the sensations of the body

133
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:51,120
breathing let there be a very simple knowing of what those Sensations

134
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:58,880
are knowing the breathing

135
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:04,600
and simple means

136
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:12,039
allowing recognition to occur almost from within the sensations

137
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:19,400
themselves instead of straining to understand or to figure

138
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:26,840
out no strain content with whatever

139
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:32,660
way this deeper quieter knowing can

140
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:38,240
[Music] occur that's deeper than the usual place we

141
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,400
think the knowing that arises out of

142
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,840
Silence pressure

143
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:59,400
movement inhale exhale pause the end of the exhale

144
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:07,200
sensations of begin that associated with beginning and ending of the

145
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:16,960
inhale gently calmly let there be as you feel the

146
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,960
breathing get to know it

147
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:29,880
better the knowing that allows for a deeper familiarity

148
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
he

149
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

150
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
e

151
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
for

152
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

153
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:29,600
and then as we come to the end of this s

154
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:36,720
relax even more can you settle

155
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:44,240
calm and take a few moments to re familiarize yourself with

156
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:50,559
how the breathing is now maybe noticing how it's different

157
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:54,840
now than it was at beginning of the

158
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
meditation

159
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:18,639
and then without changing necessarily how you

160
00:27:18,919 --> 00:27:26,520
breathe with your imagination or imagine you welcome

161
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,279
others to come in

162
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:41,640
close so that they can be comforted or

163
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,640
[Music] reassured with your calm

164
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,519
breathing as you breathe

165
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:04,159
calmly it's a

166
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:16,440
reassuring presence for others nothing you need to say or

167
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,600
do reassuring others that it's okay for a

168
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:39,600
few minutes just to be without needing to do much of

169
00:28:41,559 --> 00:28:47,519
anything that others for a few moments are allowed to be as they

170
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:01,640
are and then imagine

171
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:07,039
how coming back to your breathing and

172
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,120
relaxing can be beneficial for yourself and for others

173
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:20,600
as you go about your day and may it be that our capacity

174
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:26,320
to relax with the breathing check in with the

175
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:33,240
breathing may it be for the benefit of others as

176
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:41,399
well may we be reassuring for others may we be a

177
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:48,320
peaceful presence for others may we be a

178
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:58,679

thank [Music]

185
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
you

186
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:48,200
so welcome again to this introduction to mindfulness meditation and this fourth

187
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:55,320
talk and this first uh five talks uh centering on breathing mindfulness of

188
00:31:55,320 --> 00:32:02,120
breathing and breathing uh is a kind of an unusual maybe exceptional piece of

189
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:08,760
our psychophysical existence in a way breathing sits at the

190
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:13,840
Nexus at the crossroads of so many different parts of our life so much of

191
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:19,039
our cognitive emotional uh e

192
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:26,440
um physical world come to play as we breathe so much of what happens in the

193
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:33,799
world around us and our intentions what we want to do or our emotions in regards to what's happening around us will

194
00:32:33,799 --> 00:32:40,240
affect our breathing uh breathing speeds up it goes deeper it goes

195
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,720
shallower um we breathe differently if we're trying to be physically exertive

196
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:51,880
than we are if we're just very calm and relaxed not doing much we breathe

197
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:57,919
differently if we're afraid than if we feel deeply reassured and safe we Fe we

198
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:04,159
breathe differently if we have fantasies that are frightening or filled with

199
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,399
desire and then if we do if we imagine ourselves in situations where it's very

200
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,320
comforting and easeful for us so our thought World our physical world what

201
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:21,639
happens around us affects our breathing and

202
00:33:21,639 --> 00:33:27,440
um and so as we learn to pay attention to breathing as we become more sensitive

203
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:33,360
to it take time to get to know it um we're kind of sitting there at the

204
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,720
crossroads of so much of what's happening in our life and we don't necessarily have to understand

205
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,279
everything that's happening but we can begin appreciating how um the breathing

206
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:50,440
shifts and changes and how certain ways of breathing maybe are more tense or

207
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:56,039
more part of reactivity or um and that there's other ways of breathing which

208
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:01,240
are more calm and settled and soothing and

209
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:07,200
settling and so um and simply to know that to experience the breathing make

210
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:14,480
time to feel it introduces into the breath a new element it introduces to

211
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:23,480
breathing a kind of sense of um space or time um an element of giving room for

212
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:29,158
breathing to relax to soften that is not going to happen there happen if we do

213
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:35,720
not notice the breath but stay preoccupied with our irritations frustrations

214
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:42,720
our um desires our fears and U we to spinning out with our

215
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,960
thoughts then there's no room for breathing to by itself to begin

216
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:55,000
relaxing um but if we sit down quietly and there no longer doing the things

217
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:00,920
that agitate or contract ra or you know affecting the breathing uh and then if

218
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:06,079
we learn to relax a thinking mind and and learn to relax the body the

219
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:11,280
breathing starts to shift and change and the shifting changing nature

220
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,640
of breathing and starting to know get a sense of an easeful breath and be familiar with that is one of those

221
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:22,760
reference points that are so valuable in mindfulness meditation a reference point

222
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,599
that helps us see better more clearly when the Brea brething is not easeful

223
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:36,200
when we're tensing up when the breathing gets tighter or contracted or speeds up or moves from the belly relaxed and

224
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,640
moving to the chest being kind of the where the force of breathing begins

225
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:48,359
happening and um and uh and a big part of uh this

226
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:53,760
practice of mindfulness is developing a heightened sensitivity and familiarity

227
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,160
with all the different ways that breathing happens all the different ways which the mind is caught in its thoughts

228
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:07,760
and feelings and the heart and and as we know it not necessarily having to fix it

229
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:14,359
maybe in mindfulness practice not necessarily having to fix anything but a certain kind of allowance

230
00:36:14,359 --> 00:36:20,119
and making room to know it trust the knowing and the knowing makes space The

231
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:27,440
Knowing creates a kind of atmosphere uh that um allows the things

232
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:34,359
which are tense uh to relax any tension that we carry any

233
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:43,480
force and agitation of strong energy we having is in a sense a um a working

234
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:49,000
against the pool of gravity it's working against the natural way in which muscles

235
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:55,079
want to relax if if they're given a chance and um but we keep them tense we

236
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:02,599
keep them by by our activity or thinking our fears our emotions our desires and so just to know and feel and

237
00:37:02,599 --> 00:37:07,680
make room for everything it lets things return return to a kind of

238
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:14,800
equilibrium homeostasis a kind of peace and so one of the ingredients of

239
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,560
this in mindfulness meditation is uh giving time to what's

240
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:27,200
happening to feel it feel the sensations of it and let there be a quiet

241
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:35,119
knowing recognition oh this is what it is and um and we're both the feeling and

242
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:40,960
they recognizing are themselves uh peaceful or calm or

243
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,440
settled uh if people hear the instructions to to know to recognize

244
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:53,040
what's happening some people take that to be work they have to strain and lean into it and contract to try to do a

245
00:37:53,040 --> 00:38:01,000
better job but the way of mindfulness is the opposite there is a knowing uh recognition but a

246
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:06,119
recognition that comes from that soft relaxed place a recognition that is

247
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:11,880
itself kind of relaxing um it's kind of like if like we're having we're tense but we don't

248
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:19,200
even know it we're so CAU up in our concerns and a friend comes over and gently puts their hand on her shoulder

249
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,040
and says so kindly it seems that you're tense today and only then do you

250
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:32,440
recognize that you're tense but having that someone recognize that something goes ah

251
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:39,440
relaxes and um and uh and the opposite could happen as well as if someone

252
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:48,760
recognizes that uh you seem so uh happy today and um and there's something about

253
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:55,800
being recognized that something kind of lightens up and oh yeah I am I didn't kind of I wasn't really taking it in but

254
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:03,359
I am it's true true so that uh this gentle recognition that kind of ah yes

255
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,680
I'm I'm tense that's the case as opposed to oh no I'm tense what a terrible

256
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:16,920
meditator I am this simple simple recognition and and so as we practice

257
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:25,800
meditation with uh breathing uh it's important to remember the first steps that uh I've talked about this week that

258
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:32,240
we don't have to stay with a breath you know stay there and hold on to it and without wandering

259
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:39,359
away um we just want to start seeing more clearly what's going on here as we sit to meditate and learn how to

260
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:46,880
relax uh some modum of relaxation but at some point as we get more settled then

261
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:54,520
there is a a u almost a natural tendency or a wonderful dedication to then uh

262
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:01,119
Stay Stay surfing on the breath lingering with a breath hanging in there with and just kind of be aware of the

263
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:07,440
more breaths over time and that does a few things one thing is that then the

264
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:14,160
mental energy is not being channeled all of it into thinking and

265
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:21,640
preoccupation um less energy is available for preoccupation because now the mental energy is going into uh

266
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:27,240
staying with a breath and so the energy that goes into preup ation that creates

267
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:33,400
more tension agitation is not being not creating it and it allows the mind the

268
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:39,119
heart to settle and quiet down and so just lingering and staying but not

269
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:46,200
without without Force without holding on and without the idea that you're failing if you can't do

270
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:51,520
it uh it's actually important if you use the word fail it's important to have

271
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:58,480
that because that indicates there something you want to recognize about the Mind One wering off the mind being

272
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:04,040
agitated it's all just something to know and recognize in a calm

273
00:41:04,040 --> 00:41:09,520
way but then as you are able to stay with the breathing of sensing and

274
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:15,400
knowing it knowing it and sensing it uh staying close and intimate to the

275
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:22,480
experience um uh uh floating on the breath rising and passing rising and

276
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:29,160
settling with each inhale and exhale and allowing that breath to inform

277
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:36,240
you so um this is something that uh you can do throughout the day and I'd like

278
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,319
to offer you one practice for daily life that um can be invaluable and very

279
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:50,119
simple to do it doesn't take much time and that is to uh take the three breath

280
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:57,359
journey and that is whatever circumstance you're in uh uh you don't have to close your

281
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:02,720
eyes people don't have to know you're doing this but um maybe close your eyes

282
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:10,680
and but then just kind of give yourself over to really experience three breaths

283
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:18,000
experience how you are what's happening with you as you breathe just stay with those three breaths and maybe count one

284
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,280
two three to really as much as you can give yourself over to just those

285
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:30,760
breathing those three and familiarize yourself for the breathing and you might find that if you

286
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:37,040
do that through the day throughout the day in small ways traffic lights or standing in line or waiting for

287
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:44,119
something to happen or um May sometimes even um doing that before answering an

288
00:42:44,119 --> 00:42:49,280
email or even might even be time to do it when someone calls and let it ring

289
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,559
for a while and you take your three breaths um you'll probably find that

290
00:42:54,559 --> 00:43:00,520
just taking those that little three breath break shift something inside of

291
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:07,720
you it also will help highlight for you how you were how you are and how there

292
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:13,839
can be a shift to a different way of being and how breathing is different after three

293
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:20,000
breaths and um so this mindfulness of breathing is not only something to do in

294
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,920
meditation but something to do in daily life as well and for those of you who

295
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:34,400
maybe uh in meditation uh it seems really hard to stay lingering or surfing on breathing

296
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:41,160
the forces of distraction are quite strong uh it might be useful to uh not

297
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,720
try to stay with breathing for a long time um but rather in meditation too

298
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:56,400
just do a three breath journey and when that journey is over when you're ready do it again not any more uh ambiti I

299
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:02,839
about staying with your breath than just that so

300
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:08,319
um uh I hope in the process of all this you

301
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:14,440
come have a greater appreciation of the body breathing um breathing is not just

302
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:20,920
bringing oxygen into your system it's h connected to so much of who we are and

303
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:26,079
um that's it's why some people some religions really put breathing as a

304
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:32,800
synonymous with life so thank you very much and um we'll

305
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:40,640
have one more day on mindfulness of breathing and then we'll go on to mindfulness of the body thank

306
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:43,800
you
