00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:17,920
okay welcome to imc's monday night sitting and dharma talk

2
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,160
all right i assume that things are going okay so um uh we're going to begin

3
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,398
this uh session uh with um about half an hour of a guided

4
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,399
meditation and then um i'll share some reflections

5
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:45,839
um based on a topic and that i bring in today

6
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:59,839
so let's begin the sitting

7
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:15,439
maybe take a moment and to find a posture that's supportive of meditative practice

8
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:26,640
i'm aware that today is the first night right after the full moon

9
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,400
night since yesterday yesterday was a full moon night

10
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:40,000
and so in some sense this is kind of an auspicious auspicious night and so

11
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:47,759
on may we all have an excellent night or an auspicious night

12
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,560
sitting together practicing together

13
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,840
so maybe just take a few moments to settle in into wherever you're

14
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:09,840
meditating in

15
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:23,840
the first few moments just to allow the body and mind to arrive

16
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:37,840
arrive into here and now

17
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:55,040
so often useful to begin by taking some long deep breath

18
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:05,840
as you breathe out just allow the body to relax

19
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:22,720
feeling the connection of your legs and feet

20
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:33,840
with the ground the floor and the chairs or the cushions

21
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:47,840
having a sense of groundedness grounded on earth

22
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:15,120
as the lower half of the body began to settle and rest on earth

23
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,079
allow the upper half of the body

24
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:29,840
to rest and settle as well

25
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,478
can you feel the weight of the arms

26
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
hands

27
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:25,840
let the arms hang naturally

28
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,800
maybe the torso is upright

29
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,879
and neck is aligned

30
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,800
with the spine like an extension of the

31
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
spine

32
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:21,840
allow the muscles on the face to soften

33
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:32,560
feel sensations on the top of the head

34
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,160
on the back of the head

35
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:54,240
just do a quick scan from the top of the head all the way down to

36
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:03,440
the bottom of your feet inviting ease

37
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:07,440
inviting relaxation

38
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:17,840
and softening

39
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:30,080
and then momentarily if you're ready

40
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,360
can turn our awareness

41
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:45,520
to the movements of our breathing

42
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:50,800
that maybe is rising and falling of the belly

43
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:59,840
or the expansion and contraction of the chest

44
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:41,839
resting your attention on the movements of a breathing

45
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,839
without trying too hard

46
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:02,079
simply resting like putting a gentle hand

47
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,959
i'm petting the little baby

48
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,880
stroking the baby

49
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:37,839
soft gentle awareness on the breath

50
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,040
the concerns of the past and future

51
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:05,839
maybe can be faded into the background

52
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:18,240
allow the foreground to be filled with the experience that's happening

53
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:33,839
here and now in this body

54
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,959
maybe tinkling on the feet

55
00:10:44,839 --> 00:11:01,839
warmth in your palms

56
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:29,839
coolness of the breath

57
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,839
there's a secret life force unfolding right here

58
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:57,839
right now

59
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:39,839
now you can rest your attention your awareness

60
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,920
right here in the whole body

61
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:53,839
it's as if the awareness is

62
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:59,920
filled imbued in the body itself

63
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,839
there is nothing to do to be aware

64
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:18,800
by simply receiving the experience of the body

65
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:35,839
and experience of the mind in the restful field of awareness

66
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:49,839
maybe the sound is known

67
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,639
sound of my voice

68
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,839
ambience sound

69
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:17,839
silence in between

70
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:31,839
vibrations in the belly

71
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:45,839
i thought

72
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,079
tightness on the forehead

73
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:27,839
everything everything that's happening can simply be received at known

74
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:09,199
and pleasant experience

75
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:23,839
unpleasant experience

76
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:51,839
a moment of doubt

77
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:01,040
a moment of wanting

78
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:05,839
grasping

79
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,840
everything can happen on their own terms

80
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,840
this kind gentle awareness

81
00:17:49,679 --> 00:18:01,840
simply receiving

82
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:14,559
no need to fix

83
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:18,159
boundless allowing

84
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:43,840
some experience may be extremely challenging

85
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:57,840
getting to know this through the embodied experience

86
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,000
persistent swirling emotions

87
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:25,840
how does it feel in the body

88
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:21,840
are you aware

89
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:48,159
if the mind wandered away it's never too late to start again

90
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,200
right now this moment

91
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:13,840
mindfulness front and center right now

92
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:20,960
if the mind wandered away just know that this temple of this body

93
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:29,840
always has a door wide open for you

94
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:43,840
always welcome

95
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:48,400
to enter and return

96
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:57,840
to the temple of his body

97
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:49,840
seriously

98
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,360
in this last few moments of our sitting

99
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:13,039
i'm going to read this poem versus from a middle length discourses

100
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,960
in the title of this poem is an auspicious day

101
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:31,200
maybe you can listen to those words while you're you sit

102
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:44,240
allows words to drop into your awareness

103
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,559
however it might touch you connect with you

104
00:28:53,039 --> 00:29:01,440
allow it to be received in the wide open field of awareness

105
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:13,840
and if something bubbles up receive that too

106
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:26,720
an auspicious night this is a translated by gil fransto

107
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:34,640
the buddha said don't chase the past or long for the future

108
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:42,720
the past is left behind the future is not yet reached

109
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:51,679
right where it is have insight into whatever phenomena is present

110
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,039
not fartering and not agitated

111
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:03,120
by knowing it one develops the mind

112
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:12,799
ardently do what should be done today who knows death may come tomorrow

113
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:20,720
there is no bargaining with mortality and his great army

114
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:28,480
whoever dwells thus ardent active day and night

115
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:37,840
is says the peaceful sage one who has an auspicious day

116
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:51,840
and the other translation of the auspicious day is a single excellent night

117
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:12,819
[Music]

118
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:31,278
so welcome to our monday night dharma talk

119
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:39,760
and so what i had in mind today is to maybe unpack this poem um

120
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:46,240
a little bit together and just reflect upon this poem that i just

121
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,278
i read

122
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:58,960
so i said that this poem sometimes and the title is translated as a single

123
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:04,799
excellent night or an auspicious day

124
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:12,158
the first time when i read this poem and i was very touched

125
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:21,360
without knowing anything about this poem the context of it and the significance of it i took this

126
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:29,519
poem with me to various locations i read this poem to

127
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:37,679
the dharma system who's in the in the hospital bed

128
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,399
and i took this poem and read it at a memorial service

129
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:55,919
and i took this poem to my heart i memorized it and reflected upon this

130
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,840
and so maybe i'll read the discipline one more time and then we'll kind of unpack this

131
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:10,240
together and i'll unpack one stanza at a time

132
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:18,399
it's an auspicious day the buddha said don't chase the past

133
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:25,440
or long for the future the past is left behind the future is not yet

134
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,399
reached right where it is have insight into whatever phenomenon

135
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:40,720
is present not fattering and not agitated by knowing it

136
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,600
one develops the mind ardently do what should be done today

137
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:53,840
who knows death may come tomorrow there is no bargaining with

138
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:02,320
mortality and his great army whoever dwells thus ardent

139
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:08,240
active day and night is says the peaceful sage

140
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:20,800
one who has an auspicious day

141
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,839
so so what does this mean to not chase the past or long for

142
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:33,919
the future past is left behind the future is not

143
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:36,799
yet reached

144
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,919
we all probably have experiences of this and where we might be chasing the past or lying for

145
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:51,599
you for the future right and for me

146
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:58,800
right away and what becomes a vivid is you know for

147
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,599
most of us when we are getting older and older

148
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:10,560
we chase the youth that we used to have

149
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:17,838
and we really long for the use where we had before

150
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,680
and name is pandemic it's probably not hard to feel this kind of

151
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,400
lying for the past are the future and the vacation

152
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:44,800
the vacations that you used to have where you can travel to different places

153
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:50,640
and we can be chasing the past in this way you know whatever

154
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:59,119
accomplishments that we may have had in our earlier careers and work and job

155
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:05,520
family or maybe even you know you were the dance champion in

156
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:12,960
high school and so in the suta and this is the

157
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:18,320
majimanika yeah 1-1 and let me see 131

158
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:26,960
where this poem shows up and the buddha explained this

159
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:33,839
how does one chase after the past and he said one gets carried away

160
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:40,160
with the delight of in the past i had such a form or such a

161
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:47,040
body in the past i had such a feeling in the past i had such a perception in

162
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:52,720
the past i had such a thought fabrication or mental formation

163
00:36:52,720 --> 00:37:02,640
in the past i had such a consciousness this is called chasing after the past

164
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:10,359
i don't know if everyone is familiar with this particular formula

165
00:37:10,359 --> 00:37:17,280
in that the buddha is pointing at how one gets stuck

166
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:24,880
in the past and getting carried away by it in this ways that are related to

167
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:32,480
ourselves through this this list that's called the five aggregates

168
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:37,839
these are the things that we often identify as ourselves

169
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:42,000
i mean mine this is me

170
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:50,000
and i'm struck by the key word that's been used here by the buddha and that

171
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,520
is and he defines how one chases the past

172
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:02,480
by that one would take delight in the past

173
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:10,480
in this form of a taking delight it could be you know and really getting um

174
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,880
consumed by the past in that you know that maybe pleasant experiences

175
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,160
we had before and who we were before in the past

176
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,320
and this taking delight could also happen even when it's

177
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,320
unpleasant it experiences unpleasant history

178
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:42,560
we could be defined by those and when we're being defined by them

179
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,839
we get hooked by the past

180
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,119
even when we do not like them

181
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:02,960
you know sometimes i can see you know and sometimes i had a certain

182
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:10,160
recognition that you know i used to be this way i really didn't didn't like it but somehow being really

183
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:18,640
annoyed by it i actually get hooked by how i and how i get myself identified

184
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:26,640
with those and so this is taking delight in

185
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:34,400
the past this way or that way that we how we are and how does one

186
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,720
not chase after the past and the buddha continued by saying well

187
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:48,079
if one does not get get carried away with the delight in the past in that

188
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:54,480
and i in the past i had this kind of a form or the feelings and perception or the

189
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:02,480
mental formations or the consciousness and then this is called not chasing after the past

190
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:10,560
and so the formula is quite simple you know if we stop being consumed to stop taking delight

191
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,330
in the past and we no longer have that kind of um

192
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:24,160
[Music] uh force in us to begin to chase the past

193
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,480
anymore so so there's a recognition that there is a possibility there is a

194
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:38,720
choice not to get swept away in the past

195
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:42,480
so how do we really do that

196
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,440
in our meditation practice in our mindfulness practice

197
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,319
when i began to notice that one is being hooked

198
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:04,800
by the memory and by the history by the stories that were lived in the past and that's when we began to

199
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:10,160
have a choice well we see wow you know here

200
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:16,720
here i am but i'm hooked by this story and i recognize this is

201
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,240
happening when we begin to recognize that this is happening

202
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,800
this is where um detaching from

203
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:36,000
being taking delight in them or detaching from being

204
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,000
attracted by the past the story of the past

205
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,560
we can begin to loosen the hook with it

206
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:55,520
and often what happens is when we're being mindful

207
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:04,079
we can for example rest our attention in the body shifting from the stories of

208
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:11,359
the past to what's happening in our body then the memory and the images that came

209
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:17,040
from the past can simply become kind of a

210
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,079
ripple that to flow through in our awareness

211
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:30,640
there's no need for the story of the memory and the past to take a foot

212
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:37,280
in us so it's possible that you know our mind may have a thoughts of

213
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,280
the past or the stories but they don't have to be a problem

214
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:52,160
it's when we begin to take delight in them and really being consumed by them that we get swept away

215
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:59,920
but when we're aware we can see the memories as simply memories

216
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:06,480
they flow through like clouds in the wide open sky

217
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:15,520
and similarly how does one long for the future a buddha used a

218
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:21,280
similar language no one one gets carried away with the delight

219
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:28,880
in the future you know i might become this way i might become that way

220
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:37,200
and that this is becoming this is what in the suta it says this is called

221
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,838
placing expectations on the future

222
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:49,440
we all have this kind of experience in our own lived experience right

223
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:56,000
and maybe um

224
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:02,079
there are lots of examples that we can take

225
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:09,760
when we're not comfortable with what is happening here and now sometimes

226
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:14,880
we construct a future in our head

227
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:21,200
and then we hook onto and this kind of constructed experience and we

228
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:27,359
really go after that and to pull us out of what is happening in the present

229
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:30,078
experience

230
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:43,359
and so there's a form of uh expectations in the future here's a construction of

231
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:50,720
um it is a form of a mental construction

232
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:57,920
and we can believe in them so strongly that they become almost real for us

233
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:08,240
and similarly the buddha kind of explained you know how not to place expectations

234
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:14,000
in the future and and the the same formula was

235
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,920
prescribed by not do not get carried away with the delight

236
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,720
in the future

237
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:32,079
and it's easier said and then dumb you know we all know that and it's very

238
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:38,560
easy to fall into this a form of taking delight but what it takes is to become

239
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:45,200
recognized that this is happening you know maybe expect expectation or

240
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:52,160
projection is happening and allow ourselves to then rest into the

241
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:58,720
field of awareness to simply notice

242
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:02,400
projection being projection

243
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:11,760
and planning being planning our expectations being expectations

244
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:20,880
sometimes they're really momentary maybe they're just one or two thoughts they come and go

245
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:27,520
just like a snap of the finger but if a feed onto them you know

246
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:35,359
continue to plan and tell our stories and

247
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:40,720
and this can become something really big take us away

248
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:47,040
but when we began to see

249
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:53,680
this expectations the simply being expectations the thoughts as the thoughts and there

250
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:00,640
is a real sense of lightness in all of this experiences

251
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:11,680
and so the next stanza the buddha brought us back to where where it is here and now

252
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:19,200
why right where it is have insight into whatever phenomena is present

253
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:28,319
not fattering and not agitated by knowing it one develops mine

254
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:42,480
and disappointing at this is this moment is where we live

255
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:50,400
the present moment the present experience the present phenomenon is

256
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:58,078
where we live and this is where insight

257
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:07,280
can happen and this is where we practice this is the field of our practice

258
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:14,400
but very interesting though in the susuta it says that even in this

259
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,599
practicing with the present experience there can be two ways

260
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:26,160
and one way is a skillful and one way is not very skillful

261
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:34,400
so when i first direct this i was kind of puzzled wow you know i thought being present was you know what would be all

262
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:41,920
good and fine um but there can be a way that one will be being present and

263
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:50,319
we there can be still unskillfulness in there so how is that possible

264
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:57,520
and so let's let's take a look at this so what happens is with respect to the

265
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:05,200
present experiences the present qualities an unskilled person can take whatever

266
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:10,559
is arising as i me my

267
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:17,550
so what happened so whatever is happening

268
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:22,559
[Music] in one way an unskillful way

269
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:30,640
is that we take that this is me for example right now if there is a

270
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:37,760
little moment of a sadness that happened in the field of emotion

271
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:46,640
one way to relate to this sadness momentary sadness said

272
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:56,559
i'm a sad person i've always been sad there is so much sorrow in me

273
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:03,359
now what happens we began to construct

274
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:08,800
myself in this simple moment of sadness

275
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:14,240
a moment of grief

276
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:21,359
oh my god i am really miserable i've always been

277
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:27,839
very miserable i don't know how to get out of this

278
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:37,599
and this is what the buddha is pointing at we can make self out of the momentary

279
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:45,440
experience that's happening and when we do this what happens is we get

280
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:51,440
hardened into this experiences

281
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:58,318
and this becomes more permanent than what it is

282
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:07,359
and most of the time our emotions flows up and down this way and that way

283
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:14,079
throughout the day but we can oftentimes pick on to hook onto

284
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:21,200
certain forms of emotion and make it ourselves i remember

285
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:28,160
um gail fransto sometimes would teach that it is more skillful

286
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:33,680
to be situational centric rather than

287
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:42,240
self-centric or you know in another word in this particular suta maybe we can say

288
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:50,079
it's a phenomenon centric rather than self-centric whatever phenomena a situation that

289
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:55,839
comes about in our present lived experience

290
00:51:56,400 --> 00:52:03,359
we simply see this as the situation or the phenomena

291
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:11,280
and this is a skillful way of being with our experiences

292
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:20,880
and the self-centric approach would be turning everything that is happening into something related to

293
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,960
i me and mine

294
00:52:26,079 --> 00:52:33,359
and for example you know if you drop a plate on the floor

295
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:39,119
maybe the immediate the reaction would be i am so sloppy

296
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:46,319
but is it is it really all about you i use it to just oh this is a situation

297
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:49,200
that just happened

298
00:52:53,440 --> 00:53:00,400
so i get identified with the situation what happens is there can be a lot

299
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:06,319
of dukkha a lot of stress that comes along with it

300
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:15,839
our experiences can become stuck and no longer flows

301
00:53:17,760 --> 00:53:22,240
like the clouds in the in the sky

302
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:32,079
and so the opposite and that if if we're not taking this phenomenon

303
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:39,839
and the situations as i mean mine and there can be simple transient

304
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:45,520
changing experiences are rising and passing

305
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:57,839
and when this happens there can be a quality of not being wavered or shaken

306
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:06,640
by agitation by fartering the agitation happens when there is a

307
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:11,599
center like the center of the self

308
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:20,720
when there is no center of self the agitation cannot shake anything

309
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:25,838
there's nothing to shake

310
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:34,640
so when one develops the mind in this way

311
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:42,720
mind will no longer be shaky or restless

312
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:54,559
and so the poem goes on by encouraging this

313
00:54:54,559 --> 00:55:01,599
and so the the next stanza says ardently do what should be done today

314
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:07,839
who knows death may come tomorrow there's no bargaining with mortality

315
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:11,280
and his great army

316
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:22,400
i don't know what more is to be said about this particular line because it is true

317
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:28,960
we don't know we don't know when death may come

318
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:38,720
it may not even be tomorrow maybe next moment

319
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:46,720
and i know this can be can sound

320
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:52,078
untrue unreal but we really don't know

321
00:55:54,160 --> 00:56:00,000
you know oftentimes you know our intellectual mind understands that you

322
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:07,040
know when everybody gets born and death will be part of it i think

323
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:12,480
and one of my teachers philip moffat sometimes would like to quote his

324
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:19,520
teacher john sumato and that birth

325
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:27,920
has a death as life sentence and it's it's true and yet

326
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:36,000
we often live our lives with the complete denial that this might happen to us it might

327
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:39,359
happen anytime

328
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:46,559
and so the buddha knows this and knows the preciousness of a

329
00:56:46,559 --> 00:56:52,640
practicing in this moment here and now

330
00:56:55,839 --> 00:57:01,440
and so argently do what should be done today ardently do what should be done right

331
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,000
now because we don't know

332
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:18,079
and the poem ended with this line whoever dwells thus ardent

333
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:24,480
active day and night yes says the peaceful sage

334
00:57:24,480 --> 00:57:28,880
one who has an auspicious day

335
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:39,040
i love this definition because oftentimes we associate auspicious day with some

336
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:44,079
i don't know special days like yesterday i know it's a full moon day

337
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:49,200
and even in the buddhist tradition and maybe many different spiritual

338
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:57,119
traditions full moon days is considered to be auspicious day

339
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:03,280
but the buddha had a different definition for this

340
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:09,440
whoever dwells thus ardent active day and night practicing ardently

341
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:14,558
day and night this

342
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:23,760
says the peaceful sage is the one who has an auspicious day

343
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:30,640
i love it because this makes um the practice very accessible we don't

344
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:36,319
have to wait for some special day in order to practice

345
00:58:36,319 --> 00:58:44,559
this day if you practice here and now it's an auspicious day

346
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:52,880
the other translation a single excellent night or an excellent day

347
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:03,520
and so we just need to become become fully present become aware

348
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:10,480
of what is happening cultivating our mind skillfully

349
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:19,440
seeing what's true right in front of us

350
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:25,920
and this is where the piece lies and this is where the freedom is found

351
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:35,920
i'm gonna close tonight by just reading this poem one more time maybe by now the few lines

352
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:41,680
even sinked in in you in some way

353
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:52,079
the buddha said don't chase the past or long for the future the past

354
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:58,799
is left behind the future is not yet reached

355
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:06,559
right where it is have insight into whatever phenomenon is present

356
01:00:06,559 --> 01:00:16,240
not fattering and not agitated by knowing it one develops the mind

357
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:24,240
ardently do what should be done today who knows death may come tomorrow there is

358
01:00:24,240 --> 01:00:30,480
no bargaining with mortality and his great army whoever

359
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:37,280
dwells thus ardent active day and night is

360
01:00:37,280 --> 01:00:44,799
says the peaceful sage one who has an auspicious day

361
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:50,640
may you all have an excellent night

362
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:57,838
so take good care
