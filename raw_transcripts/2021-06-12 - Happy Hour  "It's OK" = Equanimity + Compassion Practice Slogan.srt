27
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:38,400
might be so so for our practice today um especially given that it's

28
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:45,040
you know conventionally it's the end of the week i like to have a lot of silence and space for us to settle

29
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,520
and be together in this space and the theme i'd like to invite us to explore

30
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:58,560
is um is uh inspired

31
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,919
from uh oh various inspirations but really the the words we'll be playing with

32
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:11,360
tonight is it's okay it's okay it's okay

33
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:18,880
it's okay and if if you want to translate that to your mother tongue the equivalent of that and so it's okay

34
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:25,440
and the the sense to bring that in is um the the sense to bring in and play

35
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,800
with tonight and explore is um one aspect of it i'll offer

36
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,479
different things but just to set the stages you know when say if there is a child

37
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:45,600
who's hurt themselves themselves and and fallen um on the playground and they get

38
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,720
up and they're crying say it's okay it's okay it's not a way of saying you know

39
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:57,759
shut up stop crying it's like it's okay sweetie you know it's hurting but it's okay it's really okay because as the adult

40
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,360
you have the bigger picture that yes this is this is just a scrape and yes you're

41
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,919
upset and in the big picture it's really okay so it's that wisdom perspective it's

42
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:15,199
that in the inner wisdom the wider perspective that you bring in in this

43
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:22,960
way and for the younger child like it's okay it's okay sweetie it's okay um

44
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,880
it's the sense of comforting there's a sense of also confidence that it is okay even though

45
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:36,720
it might be hurting right now or challenging but really it's okay it's okay and there's another

46
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:42,960
aspect of that with the it's okay which i like to invite you to explore is that

47
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,440
it's okay even when it's not okay it's okay and that

48
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,000
is a perspective of

49
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:03,680
awakening a perspective of wisdom that it's all okay even when it's not okay

50
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,720
it's okay and as i say this don't try to figure it out

51
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,319
um and if it doesn't work for you throw it away but there is some there

52
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:19,840
can be a sense of okayness when we really um

53
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,680
drop in or expand dropping into a sense of spaciousness expansiveness this

54
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:33,280
the knowing of the inner buddha within us that it really is okay it's

55
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:40,479
all okay even when it doesn't feel like it's okay so working with that um

56
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:46,000
and even even if you we might think oh i'm not there yet i don't i don't know and she's talking

57
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,240
about this and this awaken enlightenment perspective when it's all okay like it's not this is terrible

58
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:59,440
can can we for a moment just for a moment drop into that and allow in knowing that

59
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,879
we all have this capacity this inner awakened buddha that we all

60
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:12,720
share and and and have um allow that to shine for a moment with

61
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,759
the yeah it's okay it's really okay so

62
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:25,440
so we can take this practice of it's okay on many different levels on the relative level of oh i've had a

63
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,879
hard week or i've had a hard day or right now my body is hurting oh it's

64
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:37,200
okay it's okay it's okay sweetie it's okay so you can take it on the relative level

65
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:42,959
and that's perfectly fine please let's let's actually explore it on the

66
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,320
relative level and as we quiet invite our mind to be

67
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:54,160
quiet maybe the maybe what's called perhaps

68
00:08:54,160 --> 00:09:01,680
the ultimate level might peak through might show itself

69
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:09,200
through a grace beyond our control we might just show up like oh yeah it really is okay it's all okay

70
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:16,000
it's great actually just as it is i can be happy just as things are

71
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,920
not needing anything to be different or perfect not waiting for life to be perfect for

72
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,600
me to be happy um it's it's okay it's all okay

73
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:34,720

landing again in the sit bones

103
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:08,000
the breath as if it's expanding

104
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:19,360
the contact area as if we were a beach ball being inflated by the breath

105
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,199
our bottom breathy contacting [Music]

106

ah the legs lower legs and feet

107
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,839
not scrunched up but having a lot of surface area

108
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:55,839
to connect the cushion of the earth

109
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,560
and if thoughts arise

110
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,600
it's okay it's really okay

111
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:55,839

112
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,399
seeing clearly smiling late

113
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:07,360
letting there be space

114
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:16,240
as you breathe throughout your body feeling spacious not tight

115
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,959
about thinking it's okay thoughts come they go

116
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:30,640
let's land again with ease in the body with the breath befriending the breath

117
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,799
taking a moment of refuge

118
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
together

119
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,679
and whatever arises sounds arise

120
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,000
if pain discomfort arises

121
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:48,320
or if the mind wanders onto something else

122
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:57,840
let there not be self-judgment

123
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:05,360
criticism it's okay it's okay

124
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:13,519
it's all okay and gently lovingly

125
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,559
releasing

126
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,440
without judgment smilingly

127
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:39,840
coming back to the breath and the body it's okay

128
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:13,840
it's okay it's okay just as it is

129
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:26,880
it's okay whatever it's is arising in this moment

130
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,840
not fighting

131
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:36,158
not resisting

132
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,799
is it possible to open up to whatever is arising

133
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:55,840
with joy it's okay it's okay

134
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:02,080
you're welcome to stay with the simplicity of the practice

135
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:11,679
without any images just offering radical okayness to whatever is

136
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:19,840
arising the mind and heart that's okay perfectly okay

137
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:27,600
and if you wish i'll offer some other invitations to

138
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,840
explore with this practice of it's okay

139
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:46,799
so you can tune them out or explore further here we go

140
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:55,840
if you wish can bring in bring in someone into your heart space

141
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:03,360
into this space this quiet space

142
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:14,400
maybe someone who's dear to you and maybe there's something challenging that they're dealing with

143
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:21,440
that's impermanent and if that feels too big or not easy to

144
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:29,039
access maybe having bringing inviting

145
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:36,720
an image of a child you know or when they were a child maybe

146
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,640
they're grown up now

147
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:47,440
maybe has a scrape or has just fallen

148
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:55,519
maybe not even a scrape but but they're upset they're crying and you're holding them

149
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:03,279
saying it's okay it's okay sweetie you're letting them cry it's okay

150

151
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:14,399
and you know with your wisdom

152
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,679
the bigger picture you have access to the vision the perspective that you have that it's

153
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:30,880
okay this is impermanent it hurts now and in the big picture it's

154
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
okay

155
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:17,840

158
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:24,840
offering comfort offering meta friendliness care

159
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,840
love

160
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:37,679
might show up in the form of meta or compassion if there's a lot of hurt that's being

161
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,679
met it's okay it's okay

162
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:49,278
it could be a sense of equanimity

163
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:58,880
imbued with love imbued with care it's okay it's okay seeing the bigger picture

164
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:09,840
it's okay

165
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:23,840
see what nuance works best for you

166
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,519
and now letting ourselves be the recipient

167
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,399
of the care

168
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:43,440
can either have a sense of yourself sitting as you are maybe even putting the palm

169
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,760
of your hand in your heart center it's okay sweetie it's okay it's

170
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:57,039
all okay it's all okay sense of comfort peace reassurance

171
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:04,640
it's okay or you can imagine yourself a younger

172
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:10,960
version of yourself

173
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:17,519
having had a little fall playing or riding a bike

174
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:24,240
you're comforting a younger version of yourself it's okay sweetie it's okay

175
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:31,120
now now it's okay i love you it's okay

176
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:39,840
see what works best for you play around

177
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,360
and remember you're both the wise

178
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,840
loving compassionate being

179
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:18,158
who has equanimity as well as the one who is

180
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,599
receiving it and if holding both is difficult maybe you can

181
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:31,280
see yourself receiving it from [Music] a compassionate image maybe

182
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:37,520
the buddha or konya or the being of light is holding you and

183
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:44,560
saying it's okay it's okay it's okay it's okay

184
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,839
feel free to explore

185
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:21,119
and for the last few minutes of this practice i'd like to invite you to explore in

186
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:29,838
your own voice it's okay with empowerment

187
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,240
it's okay it's okay

188
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:43,839
it's okay it's all okay

189
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:50,960
see if there might be nuances not just of comfort and compassion

190
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:56,079
but have empowered equanimity

191
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,320
radiant it's okay

192
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:11,839
nuances of joy

193
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,839
do

194
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:59,359
may all beings everywhere

195
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:13,839
enjoy a deep okayness and be free

196
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:37,359
thanks everyone thank you for your practice

198
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:55,200
it's okay can have a sense of care love comfort and yet this perspective

199
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:00,400
this perspective equanimity of holding it all

200
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:07,359
having a bigger picture of you and interested to hear what nuances you

201
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:12,560
discovered and explore it and you're welcome to type in chat

202

questions comments and if you type to me privately i won't say your name

203
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,319

204
00:44:24,319 --> 00:44:32,160

205
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,440
your practice is is precious your questions whatever you bring forth

206
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,680
know that it's an offering to the sangha and i like to make space again stepping

207
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:51,838
forward for those who haven't spoken in a while first so uh

208
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,839
what did you notice what what did you

209
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:18,800
discover and silence is okay too it's okay

210
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:25,839
jerry says it reminded me of the beatles song let it be yeah

211
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,240
since you talked about the song i'll also say i was going to talk about this a little later

212
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:40,400
but but i'll say it now the um one inspiration for the session

213
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,079
this evening was a friend forwarded to me a

214
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:53,200
um little youtube segment um and in that it's it's one of these

215
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,400
shows the um these talent shows where someone comes and

216
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:06,160
sings and in this one very touching a young woman 30 years old um

217
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,599
comes and sings this song and she's very thin not quite clear at first and she says

218
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:18,960
she's okay and turns out she has cancer active cancer and she has two percent chance of survival and she sings this

219
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:25,599
song beautifully with so much joy that it's okay it's an original song so i'll ask neil

220
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:30,640
to to forward that to um to the google groups

221
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:37,119
so that if you're interested you can all watch it but it's so touching that it's okay it's okay

222
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:44,880
there's such a sense of power and grace in in her offering it's okay it's okay

223
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:53,200
so i wanted to give her credit and unfortunately i don't know her name to give her proper credit uh whoops

224
00:46:53,200 --> 00:47:01,520
if i find it i will share it when you come back from the groups but any other kenneth yes please

225
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:10,079
ah hi nikki thank you um near the end when you were when you

226
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,200
started talking about saying okay as an and empowerment

227
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:21,760
yeah it reminded me of kristen neff divides self-compassion

228
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:30,640
into tender and fierce yeah so it reminds me of fierce self-compassion yeah

229
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:36,559
yeah yeah thank you yeah it's um exactly there's so many nuances there

230
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:41,920
can be tender self-compassion that that's one aspect it's like it's okay sweetie it's

231
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:48,559
okay and then there's like okay i'm here for you i'm gonna protect you it's okay sweetie it's it's it can still be the

232
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:55,520
same words but different nuance itself of yep i'm i'm here for myself yeah

233
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:01,119
thank you kenneth charles lee please

234
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:11,440
okay there we go hi yes thank you this is a

235
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,960
concept that uh my understanding is certainly cheap and

236
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:24,880
changed by practice i always thought the phrase

237
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:31,440
it's okay was kind of patronizing kind of uh just

238
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:38,319
kind of one of those meaningless things that you know that that people say in uncomfortable

239
00:48:38,319 --> 00:48:45,359
situations but uh leaning leaning into practice and

240
00:48:45,359 --> 00:48:53,599
really you know leaning into that that that suchness just just you know it

241
00:48:53,599 --> 00:49:02,240
you know being able to experience something just just as it is um i think i had a

242
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,440
an experience of this on on the playground with my daughter

243
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:12,640
she had apparently been yelled at or talked to not nicely by

244
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:18,400
another another five-year-old and she came crying to me

245
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,160
and um i could sense uh this immediate want to like go fix

246
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:30,640
something and go like you know who you know who treated you badly and who and i and then i

247
00:49:30,640 --> 00:49:36,078
recognized that wait a minute you know um right now

248
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:45,520
she's upset and she needs you know she needs to be held and and uh and i was able to do that uh

249
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:52,640
and and what happened was that i i kind of just i forgot about the other kid i forgot about needing to kind of

250
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:58,319
get revenge or or figure out you know what went wrong um

251
00:49:58,319 --> 00:50:04,160
and i thought that was uh you know that was something i wouldn't have done two years ago i would have been

252
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:10,480
you know already you know become a detective prosecutor you know judge and jury for this you

253
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:17,680
know five-year-old kid who who knows who they are so thanks

254
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:24,640
thank you charlie it was a beautiful story i loved both aspects of it and how leaning into

255
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:31,359
the practice you know it's okay it really has it's not this dismissive oh it's okay

256
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:39,040
it's it's more like oh it's tapping into the suchness of things oh it's okay there's a deeper okayness that

257
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:46,079
we're acknowledging when we say it's okay and and beautiful i love the the the story the

258
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:53,119
reactive catching yourself and especially given that i brought the story of the the image of the playground i love that

259
00:50:53,119 --> 00:51:00,079
your story had this you know your child actually on the playground and being upset and oh yeah with the appropriate

260
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:06,880
response the appropriate response is what's needed here thank you it's beautiful i appreciate you sharing that

261
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:12,640
lovely and mark has a comment the impermanence is crucial

262
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:19,920
however awful the suffering it will end sometime even if it takes death to end it death can be the ultimate

263
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:28,880
in our being loved yeah yeah touching yeah

264
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:35,839
so dear ones let's turn our attention to practicing together in small groups and

265
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:41,599
it's okay if you have to go but it's okay if you're uncomfortable in the group so extend

266
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,960
your limit like oh i don't want to be with people see it's okay to be just a little uncomfortable

267
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:52,800
if you to stretch yourself a little bit and see what it's like to practice with sangha members it's it's actually

268
00:51:52,800 --> 00:52:00,880
they're quite lovely they're more than okay so so um let's start with 15

269
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:06,800
when you get into groups uh when you get into groups of three

270
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:14,000
roughly that would be the size let's start with 15 seconds of silent

271
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:21,040
meta just warmth for yourself care for each other it's all okay to be in silence together and

272
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,559
then you can share as little or as much as you like with each other with this precious
