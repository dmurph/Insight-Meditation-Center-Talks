so hello and welcome everyone [Music] happy to be with you lovely to be with

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:15,960
you so for today's practice i'd like to invite us to

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,359
practice um [Music] both equanimity resilience just quiet

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:31,640
stillness for the benefit of compassion with what is going on in the world

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:40,559
it's time it's we need more we need more stability we need more resilience we

6
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:48,399
need more peace and calm so that we can be available we can be available both

7
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:55,039
internally for ourselves not to be completely toppled over into sorrow and grief

8
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,640
but also available for others how can we help how can we support how can we serve

9
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,520
and maybe one way we can service through our availability of space of kindness space

10
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,799
of of stability and i also like to bring in some

11
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:20,000
practice of with meta and compassion for all who are suffering in the world which

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
in some ways includes all of us all of us human beings and especially for those who are

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,040
especially suffering in really really difficult situations right now

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,920
um in ukraine and in russia people who didn't choose the political situation but they're

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,360
being severely impacted and hurt by it in so many ways

16
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,840
so so maybe there's not much more i want to say but but to say that

17
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,560
yeah we'll start with a lot of silence tonight and just settling with the breath with the body

18
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:04,000
and then um in in order to build stability in all

19
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,119
order to build spaciousness and then i'll have invitations for us to

20
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:16,480
both include ourselves in our mette and our compassion because even when difficult challenges are

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,680
happening in the world and in war zones our own personal suffering and dukkha

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,950
does not end does not cease so to bring our own

23
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:34,239
[Music] dear selves to mind to heart to care for this being who's me and also sharing our

24
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,640
our care our good will for other beings in the world who are

25
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,159
suffering so that's the framing

26
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,959
so without further ado let's practice together let's arrive

27
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,159
fine our meditation posture

28
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:10,000
sitting lying down whatever is nourishing or supportive in this moment

29
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,319
oh dear heart dear

30
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,280
taking refuge in the heart space

31
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,840
with each breath settling more

32
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:37,120
to the body

33
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,480
to the lower abdomen

34
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:56,599
feet releasing letting go of any tension

35
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,360
being embodied with the breath

36
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,919
the entirety of the in-breath breathing in

37
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:23,759
the counts counting slowly up to four

38
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,280
then pausing for a moment holding the break breath briefly and then

39
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,240
exhaling for a paw for a count of five

40
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:43,040
do it together first a couple times and then you can do it in your own time just to help settle and arrive

41
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:48,320
breathing in one two

42
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:55,120
three four pausing the breath

43
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,600
exhaling one two three

44
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,720
four four briefly pausing

45
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,720
and again inhaling four

46
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,560
exhaling count of five pause

47
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:25,840
letting the exhale be longer than the inhale can help settle

48
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:35,159
the body the mind we'll do that just a little bit before we let the breath be natural

49
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,360
if the mind is particularly unsettled tonight you can continue

50
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:18,319
this counting with the breath longer to help support arrive

51
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,560
and land

52
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,120
this

53
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:09,519
if you are still using the counting device with the breath

54
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:15,279
let it be gentle and again

55
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:22,880
breathing at the count of four pause breathing out gently

56
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:27,720
releasing the count of five

57
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,160
you can change the count and make your breath longer both the in-breath and the

58
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:51,839
out-breath that might happen naturally as you settle in and arrive more

59
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:54,839
deeply

60
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:40,560
and imagine the breath

61
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:49,000
gentle the body relaxed as much as possible

62
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:54,720
that the breath age in breath out breath

63
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:04,320
is like fluffing a feather bed

64
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:10,320
fluffing making it soft ready your body as if your body is a feather

65
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,839
bed and i'm fluffing it gentleness kindness your body is the

66
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,399
soft gentle welcoming

67
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:31,839
nourishing home

68
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,160
that's holding your tired heart and mind

69
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:49,800
with each breath gently being fluffed

70
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:03,199
let the breath fluffing

71
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:13,199
be nourishing fluffing the energetic body

72
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:21,000
or the energy body let it be nourishing healing

73
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:34,519
soft supple [Music] kind

74
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,840
maybe the image that works better for some is

75
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:46,880
a mane of a horse soft being mentally combed

76
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:57,000
same idea the breath doing that with the body energetically

77
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:06,000
is there any proverbial death

78
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:11,360
dirt oh it's gently fluffed

79
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:18,720
calmed out the body kindness

80
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:26,200
gentleness holding this tired heart and mind

81
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,840
resting resting

82
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:55,200
each breath combing fluffing the energy body

83
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:05,880
the heart can rest and the kindness of the space

84
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:14,360
relax feel safe

85
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,960
with each breath

86
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:13,799
so

87
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:30,200
creating a safe comfortable kind loving space for ourselves

88
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:38,760
it's an expression of meta of care

89
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:48,120
let the breath be breathed

90
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,600
and the inner g-body fluffed

91
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:29,799
just as if the mane of a horse soft gently brushed

92
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,039
where a feather bed is fluffed

93
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:05,720
let it be nourishing healing for you

94
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,720
if you've had called specially challenging day or time in your body

95
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:23,840
your heart and mind you can stay with yourself if you like

96
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:31,200
otherwise if there is space capacity to open up further

97
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,200
here are the invitations

98
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:44,559
continuing the same metaphor of fluffing

99
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:48,399
comfortable feather beds

100
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,039
or brushing the hair the maid

101
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:03,600
of a horse gently

102
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:13,440
as tightnesses maybe pieces of dirt

103
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:22,080
are released to smooth it out and there's just a harmonious

104
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,080
flowing

105
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:34,799
main afterwards as if symbolically as if you had a big

106
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,799
brush

107
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:49,840
combing all beings

108
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:58,559
just gently fluffing [Music] as if all the ills all the sorrow

109
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:05,440
all the challenges brushing them through

110
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:12,880
bringing healing sucker comfort because you care

111
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:19,240
sharing your care

112
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:27,760
whereas if you are fluffing pillows feather bed

113
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,960
for beings around the world many beings many humans

114
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:39,679
especially those in challenging situations they're there

115
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:48,720
offering your care if you're laying a comfortable bed for them

116
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,760
covering them with your love with your care in a blanket of meta

117
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:06,720
may you be free may you be free from sorrow from suffering

118
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,720
may you have these

119
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,600
may there be as much ease and comfort and well-being

120
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:26,200
for you in this difficult time

121
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:51,278
those in places of war famine

122
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:57,960
the orphans of the world

123
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:16,080
as the ryokan said oh if only my monk's robes are white enough

124
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,640
to protect all the suffering beings

125
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:32,399
in this entire world the same spirit of generosity and care

126
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:38,159
it's an aspiration aspirationally of course

127
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:46,000
our robes can never avoid them but we offer we offer our kindness

128
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:55,320
our goodness our compassion as a training as service

129
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,840
imagining that your care brings comfort

130
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:32,880
and if you fall into distress and grief come back to yourself

131
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:37,559
come back to yourself

132
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,080
holding yourself with care

133
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,799
and compassion

134
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:30,679
remember if you fall into empathic distress come back to yourself

135
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,519
with compassion and care

136
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,800
and for the last few minutes returning back to yourself

137
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,599
with each breath letting the energy body be fluffed

138
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:15,720
naturally place of comfort ease sucker

139
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:41,040
may all beings everywhere especially those

140
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:44,079
in the war zones

141
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,359
maybe free from suffering sorrow pain

142
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:59,280
distress may they have a

143
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:05,920
peace of being [Music] as possible

144
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:10,320
in the midst of the challenge

145
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:19,960
may all beings everywhere including ourselves be safe

146
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:27,119
healthy and have ease

147
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,040

170
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,599
i read an article um that was about

171
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:46,800
a unit of snipers in the ukraine and it was really on my heart just because the article kind of really

172
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:54,319
portrayed them in balance as people who kind of celebrated their craft which is killing people

173
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:01,520
and also people who are very brave and very much defending their homeland and somehow the this this very calm

174
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:08,160
space that we kind of held today was i think a very supportive space for just kind of sitting in that realm of

175
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:15,119
like you know i don't really know i don't really know the full picture here you know on both sides of people who are

176
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,599
killed and being killed and you know i mean there's just there's so much and yeah somehow it was it was a very

177
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:27,760
healthy space of just kind of holding that that not knowing and

178
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:34,280
kind of just holding the bigness of what's happening so thank you

179
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:42,960
thank you nicholas thank you so much for bringing that in that bigness that you mentioned and and how this

180
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:49,040
holding the space of spaciousness for all the suffering so

181
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:55,599
much suffering all around us just the the killer and the killed it's just so

182
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,800
the snipers and the it's just it's beyond imagination all the suffering of

183
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,240
everyone involved and everyone watching holding witness it's just

184
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,560
and also to know that humanity has gone through cycles of this right humanity

185
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,480
i think we're hopefully better a little bit but but but still it just keeps

186
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,240
happening so just holding spaciousness oh dear dear humanity which i'm a part

187
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:32,560
of oh holding all of us with compassion yeah thank you nicholas

188
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:39,920
mima i see your hand please um i appreciated this because it feels

189
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:46,000
so overwhelming sometimes um the um

190
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:52,319
the amount of suffering that we hear about and not feeling like there's nothing i can do about it

191
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:58,480
and knowing that being here with the sangha and meditating and contributing in that way

192
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,078
um to me is very significant it gives me peace

193
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:11,119
yeah yeah thank you mima it's it's important because

194
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,720
it can be overwhelming and then if it's when it's overwhelming we want to just

195
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:24,480
turn away and completely tune out um and that's not helpful either right

196
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,240
so so having the space to actually

197
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:37,599
hold witness and and offer care which which it is you know as the

198
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:44,720
buddha says whatever you frequently think and reflect upon that becomes the inclination of your

199
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:50,319
mind so the more we upon kindness care compassion

200
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:56,000
for others that becomes the inclination of our mind and our actions too so it's

201
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,079
not just in the mind space it's not just in the the holding space space which is

202
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:09,040
important too for our own equanimity stability and those of others but it's also it leads to action

203
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:15,319
wholesome action in any way we can in our community

204
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:24,480
he says thank you for the breathing reminder to arrive tonight if anyone awakens in the night wide-eyed

205
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,520
thinking about the world your recording of

206
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:35,440
uh it went oh re-recording of overwhelm was just the ticket to settle back down with

207
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,839
more equanimity and compassion thank you nikki i had a better day because of your guidance oh thank you

208
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:47,040
vicky so appreciate it to hear that it was supportive for you especially in the

209
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:53,040
middle of the night that i think we did i did maybe it was monday or la i think it was last week

210
00:44:53,040 --> 00:45:00,319
it was about uh practicing with equanimity when suffering of the world is overwhelming so i think that's the

211
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:05,920
one you're referring to vicky i'm glad it was supportive for you in the middle of the night may be

212
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,960
supportive to others

213
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:24,640
yeah yeah and dipper is bringing up the complexity of the

214
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:31,040
the pain of of both the killer and the kill and i think i'd rather not get entangled than that it's a bigger topic

215
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,480
it's more than i want to spend time and talk about right now but yeah

216
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:44,160
but it but everyone suffers really everyone suffers in that entanglement

217
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,480
so i'd like to to invite us now to hold the space this

218
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,480
fluffy energy body fluffed space as if we're fluffing um

219
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,560
comfortable blankets and and uh pillows for one

220
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:07,920
another as we enter into the small sangha with another couple of

221
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,760
practitioners can there be sense of holding space and there may there may not be a lot of

222
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:20,319
words said tonight and that is okay but can we hold space for each other

223
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:25,359
