00:00:01,719 --> 00:00:07,800
hello from Redwood City at the Insight Meditation

2
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:12,839
Center and uh so I'm particularly happy to be here

3
00:00:12,839 --> 00:00:19,840
today I was this morning as I turned my attention to the topic of today I

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,439
started to feel a kind of smile and delight and joy some happiness just just

5
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:32,000
from turning my mind in that direction and that's because the topic for today is

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,399
Happiness and happiness is a word that I see as a umbrella term for a whole

7
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:42,719
family of states of well-being that we can

8
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:49,120
experience and it's a important reference point for Buddhist

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,760
practice on one hand clearly Buddhism is an honest meeting of our suffering an

10
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:03,719
honest assessment and consideration turning our attention towards suffering to be very honest and

11
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:09,040
truthful about its presence but not so we can suffer more

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,400
but so we can somehow resolve that suffering or dissolve that suffering or

13
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:24,439
solve that suffering in some way so that uh the mind can open to

14
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:30,439
happiness I like to think of the there's a natural capacity we have for for

15
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,680
happiness that is often obscured by our clinging and our

16
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,640
holding and that as we let go as we let go of clinging

17
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,000
grasping that the mind's simple capacity to feel delight

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,840
and joy becomes increasingly important

19
00:01:54,840 --> 00:02:00,479
and so of course it's difficult to to

20
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:07,160
sometimes be happy and we have many challenges in our lives I don't want

21
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:10,840
to excuse me for a

22
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:19,599
moment I don't want to in any kind of way diminish the difficulty belittle the

23
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:27,640
difficulty we have with the challenges of our life lives and at the same time I don't want

24
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:32,720
to limit uh uh our

25
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:41,519
capacity to recognize well-being and these can

26
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:50,319
coexist sometimes the problem with anything is that when we get fixated on it we get attached to it we make it the

27
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:56,000
whole picture this is what's who we are we identify with it we become it and

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,800
it's possible to be so identified so connected so pre occupied with suffering

29
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:09,599
that we don't have the bigger picture what's happening for us the bigger context and in The Wider context it's

30
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:17,720
possible to hold suffering with a sense of well-being with a sense of confidence

31
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:23,400
with a sense of goodness generosity with

32
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,000
compassion it's possible to hold the suffering even with a in a field in an

33
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:35,480
atmosphere of something that resembles well-being Joy or

34
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:42,120
happiness and so to be start becoming attuned start to recognize our capacity

35
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:49,439
for being for Joy or happiness in the letting go in the relaxing in the

36
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:55,599
lightening up in the easing up uh with what's

37
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:02,360
happening so we'll begin this meditation and and I'll put an emphasis

38
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:09,519
on uh easing up on being easy uh

39
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:17,759
uh be being at ease putting yourself at ease and as we do so as you be able to

40
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:25,280
find this see if you can find glimmers maybe more of something in the

41
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,759
family of happiness joy Delight well-being

42
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:36,120
without getting fixated on anything but even if a glimmer of this well-being is

43
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:43,320
there let it be the support for you to continue with the practice of being here

44
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:53,639
and now let it be a support for you to help you um to let

45
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:00,440
go of anything that takes you away from the present moment or obscures it

46
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,520
with suffering so assuming a meditation

47
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:15,919
posture and closing the

48
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,360
eyes and gentling yourself into your body

49
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:30,960
gently almost as with your awareness enter into your body from the so your

50
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,520
your sense of Sensations awareness

51
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,120
aliveness is found within your

52
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,520
body and even if you're feeling some

53
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:52,560
distressing Sensations or

54
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:02,759
emotions maybe there's a way to appreciate how even those

55
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:14,520
Sensations are a form of Vitality a form of being here alive in

56
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:20,639
the present moment and to tune into it

57
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:27,039
as Vitality or Activation so we don't

58
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:34,319
identify with the content the story the predictions the

59
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,199
meaning that we attribute to our

60
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:51,919
suffering and gently from the inside out to take some long slow deep

61
00:06:56,199 --> 00:07:01,520
breaths as you exhale

62
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:10,319
shedding stories ideas considerations of the past

63
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:16,000
the future

64
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:22,919
shedding the discursive mind that tells stories about how we are

65
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:25,160
what's

66
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:34,919
happening taking some gently deeper

67
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:40,280
breaths and relaxing the body as you

68
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:58,440
exhale as you relax maybe there can be a kind of letting go into the pool of

69
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,439
gravity well

70
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:13,520
simultaneously we keep a kind of alertness in the body in the

71
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
posture

72
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:06,240
for letting your breathing return to normal and with a normal

73
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:13,800
breath continue to relax soften let go of the muscles in your

74
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:23,600
body and as you do so see if there's any feeling of ease

75
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:31,360
or pleasure in the letting go in the Rel

76
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
relaxing

77
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:23,519
as you exhale see if you can let yourself be at

78
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:31,320
ease at ease in your body

79
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:39,880
or being easy with what's happening in your

80
00:10:41,079 --> 00:10:46,720
body easing up lightening

81
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:02,839
up gently setting your heart at

82
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:18,240
ease or being easy with how things are in your

83
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:31,240
heart easing up any

84
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:39,600
tightening grasping pressure associated with the

85
00:11:54,040 --> 00:12:01,240
heart and as you exhale maybe setting your mind at ease

86
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:09,000
at temporary EAS for just

87
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,399
now you can pick up your challenges

88
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:22,839
later or if the mind is not at ease ease

89
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:27,120
up on the tension that's

90
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:35,839
there or be easy with

91
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:45,880
it lightening up softening the tension and the

92
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:06,040
grasping and then as you sit

93
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:13,439
here is there any sense of

94
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:22,440
wellbeing maybe it's a global feeling that has a slight

95
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,760
glow or Buzz or

96
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:37,240
warmth or maybe there's a slight sense of

97
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:43,160
pleasure somewhere in the face around the lips in the

98
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,639
chest in the

99
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:00,800
hands maybe it's a contentment in the mind

100
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:07,079
for the opportunity to sit in meditation putting aside our

101
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:15,240
responsibilities and busyness content with the Simplicity of

102
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:18,440
just being here

103
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:34,079
breathing and with whatever sense of ease or

104
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,839
well-being or happiness that you

105
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:47,440
experience see if that can be the

106
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:55,839
atmosphere within which you're aware of your

107
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:01,040
breathing your present moment experience

and as you're sitting here are you to some degree a bit more

129
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:04,480
settled Cal calm at ease than you were when you

130
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,398
first sat down to

131
00:26:14,679 --> 00:26:19,720
meditate and is there some

132
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:27,480
pervasive but maybe very subtle pleasure in your body your heart your

133
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:34,120
mind in being calmer more

134
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:42,600
settled more at ease breathing being

135
00:26:51,919 --> 00:27:00,240
here in wherever you feel somewhat relaxed or at ease in yourself

136
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:08,559
is there a pleasure or a contentment or some form of

137
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:18,960
well-being that maybe has no reason except the satisfaction of being

138
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:27,159
connected and alive and with these settled feelings calm

139
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
feelings

140
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:48,919
and giving room breathing room to any feelings of

141
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:55,240
contentment pleasure

142
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,559
wellbeing as you breathe breathe with it breathe through

143
00:28:03,799 --> 00:28:08,158
it making room in your

144
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:19,480
body making room in your heart making room in your mind for

145
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,840
wellbeing

146
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
happiness

147
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:41,799
and then imagine you think about or

148
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:47,640
visualize would it be like if you went through your whole

149
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:56,039
day rooted in some feeling of well-being that's present right

150
00:28:56,159 --> 00:29:02,679
now you don't give it up for anything so whoever you encounter

151
00:29:02,679 --> 00:29:11,960
whatever you're doing happens together with a sense of

152
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:17,840
well-being there's nothing you do that sacrifices

153
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:30,039
it what would that be like for you

154
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:46,679
and perhaps one of the consequences could be to feel some AUM of well-being

155
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:53,399
happiness in yourself and to wish that for

156
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,039
others to wish that for the people you encounter

157
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:10,919
and to not be a force of agitation or desires

158
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:18,000
or agendas that make it harder for other

159
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,480
people to settle into their own

160
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,960
well-being May our connection to

161
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:37,519
wellbeing lead us to wish this for others as

162
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,399
well may all beings be

163
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:48,960
happy may all beings be

164
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:54,080
safe may all beings be

165
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:59,919
peaceful may all beings be

00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,279
on

173
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:49,799
the the signs or symptoms of non-

174
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:54,880
clinging so was a kind of reviewing little bit that this follows up last

175
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:00,919
week where the focus was on mindful of the bundles of

176
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:09,600
clinging and um the source of a lot of suffering and as we untie the bundles as

177
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:14,960
we dissolve the the glue that holds

178
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,679
together the infrastructure of attachment of clinging grasping that we

179
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:27,039
have the the continuity of resistance and

180
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:35,120
pulling away closing down all the different variations of what Buddhism might call attachment or

181
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:43,279
clinging that the release of that non- clinging has symptoms has leads to

182
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:50,960
senses of well-being and uh we start discovering that our clinging our grasping our

183
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:57,880
resistance our closing down interfere or cover over our

184
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:05,200
capacity to be happy our capacity to feel contentment at ease and even when there's times of

185
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:11,040
great challenge it's possible to stay connected to some special kind of

186
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,320
feeling of that being present being here feels

187
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:23,800
good feels right being connected to reality has a has a goodness to it has a

188
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:29,720
rightness to it that might not be literally considered be happiness but

189
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:35,960
maybe we could can call it a dharmic happiness or a kind of symptom of

190
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:43,398
wellbeing so one way or the other one of the symptoms of letting go well

191
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:49,118
is in the family of happiness happiness joy ease lightening

192
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:55,280
up and I've learned uh through too many

193
00:34:55,280 --> 00:35:02,000
painful um experiences that if I let

194
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,000
go and and the consequence of letting go is I feel neutral then I haven't really

195
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,320
let go and because I've been doing this Buddhist practice so long letting go

196
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:21,480
sometimes can be relatively easy for me and so I've let go of situations where

197
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:27,839
um were challenging or maybe I was angry or upset somehow and I let go and I

198
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:35,520
thought I had let go but I ended up feeling neutral it's like okay I'm back to normal or something and inevitably I

199
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,800
hadn't really let go and and like whatever I was holding on to and clinging would come back and bite me

200
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:47,040
would come would reappear at some point and what I learned was that if I'm

201
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:54,000
going to let go or if Letting Go happens for it to be full and and healthy there

202
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:59,160
has to be some feeling of goodness in it some lightning up up some feeling

203
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:04,400
of uh joyful energy or uh Happy energy I

204
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:12,400
want to be careful with the words I choose because sometimes we let go in very challenging situations and we can't

205
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:18,440
obviously say in conventional ways we happy as a result of that but there is something that feels

206
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:25,920
right a goodness to it a lightening up and easing up a sense of richer Vitality

207
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,440
or maybe not contentment with what's happening but a contentment of now being

208
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:41,880
more fully present here for it so one of the symptoms of uh of release Letting Go

209
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:50,200
non-attachment non- clinging is a a a range of emotional states that are in

210
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:56,040
the family called Happiness the happiness family and

211
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:02,720
so but if we're not oriented towards that if we ignore it if we somehow think

212
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:09,119
we're not supposed to be happy uh that somehow Happiness joy is not serious enough for someone who's a serious

213
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,400
practitioner who's just going to go directly to the truth emptiness

214
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:21,680
nonself um and as if you know just somehow in the seriousness of it and the

215
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:28,520
directness of it um there's no room for joy and happiness we're doing oursel

216
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:35,520
a great disservice certainly it can be easy to overemphasize joy and happiness it's

217
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:41,480
possible to be attached to it to cling to it it's possible to expect it and try

218
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:46,640
to hold on to it all ways which interfere with the deeper possibility of

219
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:53,160
well-being that practice can bring but uh don't deny yourself that

220
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,520
don't let don't get in the way of it and what's I think unfortunate is how many

221
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:07,119
of us um are so busy with what we think is important with basically sometimes

222
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:13,680
with our attachments our clinging our sense of responsibility our sense of obligation sense of fear that drives us

223
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:19,280
we have to do something here um that uh we don't Avail

224
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,560
ourselves of the wellbe that's here uh

225
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:32,720
that doesn't require some great wonderful thing happening in the world doesn't require having the you know

226
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,960
getting something or having some relationship with some person or having

227
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:44,920
praise or success or you know many of the conventional worldly

228
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:51,079
things there's a well-being that we can have that's independent of worldly

229
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:58,000
conditions and it can it's very simple uh it can seem unimportant it can

230
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,240
seem like why why should we focus on it when it is not doesn't relate to my

231
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:09,400
sense of self my agency who I am and who I need to have and what I need to

232
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:18,839
do deeper than that or Fuller than that is a sense of just simple

233
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:26,359
ordinary um well-being a simple Jo the joy of

234
00:39:26,359 --> 00:39:35,280
simplicity uh the joy of just being alive a simple sense of contentment or

235
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:43,000
ease or or satisfaction in simple

236
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:49,520
things uh you know the looking at the sky when it's blue appreciating the sun

237
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:54,720
and the clarity of the air appreciating the temperature or the

238
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:00,319
freshness of the morning first morning breast outside can feel so nice there's

239
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:05,760
all these Simple Pleasures in life that we stay for that are help us realize

240
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,920
there's more available here that I'm overlooking by the Rush by

241
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:16,440
accomplishment getting things done doing the the responsible thing certainly

242
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:21,480
don't give up some of your responsibilities but uh there's more

243
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:26,960
well-being in this life that most people Avail themselves to than most people

244
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:34,440
feel like they have permission to stop for and enjoy to make room for and the proposal

245
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:41,560
is that if you can start appreciating the joy the happiness that's are available here you also might

246
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:46,920
begin begin appreciating the sense of well well-being that comes from non-

247
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:53,359
clinging non- rushing nonattachment nonhostility non

248
00:40:53,359 --> 00:41:00,760
greed and that that is a Val invaluable well-being to be attuned to because that

249
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:06,200
gives us an alternative a healthy alternative to hostility to this

250
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:12,160
satisfaction of a good anger or satisfaction of being involved in a

251
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:17,240
strong desire that seems promising we are shifting the

252
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:25,040
orientation to get our satisfaction from non- greed nonh hatred

253
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:31,200
non-fear and to be Rec conditioned by that to be shifted and changed and

254
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:38,000
transformed by that well-being so to begin appreciating the

255
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,079
happiness of non- clinging so that we can be nourished by it we can

256
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:49,800
be reconditioned by it some of us have been so powerfully conditioned so

257
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:56,440
powerfully shaped by The Chronic fear we live in The Chronic ambition or desires

258
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:02,000
this chronic conceit we live in The Chronic hostility that aversion we live

259
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,359
in it's kind of some people have been so shaped by it they don't even know they have

260
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:15,200
it and um it's a powerful conditioning to live with those and in Dharma practice we're

261
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:21,920
looking to change that conditioning to decondition the UNH wholesome forces

262
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:28,119
within us and to bring forth a conditioning that is uh wholesome

263
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:33,559
nourishing supportive of what is all that's good within us supportive of that

264
00:42:33,559 --> 00:42:40,800
which leads to greater and greater happiness and well-being it is possible to be

265
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,800
happy and this Dharma practice that we do here is a path to

266
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:55,240
happiness so a step in that direction is to begin availing yourself of the

267
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:02,960
well-being of the contentment M of the joy that might here be for you already

268
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:09,599
if you give yourself your time to realize it to make space for it to allow

269
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:14,680
for it and um so that would be the challenge

270
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:22,040
I offer you for today is spend good part of today

271
00:43:22,040 --> 00:43:29,240
recognizing how realistically not uh superficially not

272
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:37,559
as a holding on or you know kind of uh color coding your life but

273
00:43:37,559 --> 00:43:45,640
realistically is there something a sense of well-being joy happiness contentment

274
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:52,520
satisfaction that you can have just with a Simplicity of being just being here as

275
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:58,880
your life is right now granted that you might have challenged

276
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,559
but even with those are there things that you can be are there sources of joy

277
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:09,760
and happiness that are simple and clear and right here that you can nourish

278
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,040
yourself with recondition yourself so non-

279
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:23,359
clinging the the happiness of non- clinging so thank you this is also part

280
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:29,079
of mindfulness practice and remember that uh some of you this is the introduction to mindfulness we're still

281
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:35,680
doing so in this big kind of package of things we include as part of mindfulness

282
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:42,280
part of it is the well-being that arises as well thank

283
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:46,559
