1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,839
good morning I see some new faces hello I'm Tanya nice to meet you and those I

2
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:13,040
know good to see you too so today is um Mother's

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:19,880
Day and um so I will weave this theme into the talk um and I'll expand the

4
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:26,039
definition of mother to include all the growing and

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,960
nurturing that we all do inside of ourselves and for others

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,600
and um so I'm going to tell you a little bit

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:44,800
about more what I'll talk about and then I'll I'll come back to um kind of this a

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:50,719
few Reflections on motherhood before I start but I want to share a sua with you

9
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,440
today um it's known as the ship or the chick the ads and the ship

10
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:02,920
um and uh so I'm going to share that sua and it's one of the parts of the suit is

11
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,479
about chickens and hatching eggs

12
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:16,320
yeah um and then uh yeah like I said I'll sort of start

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:25,119
with this theme of motherhood and then kind of dip in and out of that as I progress I think I just want to put my

14
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,680
hand on my heart uh when I think about mothering and I think about being

15
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:39,000
mothered um it's not easy and um you know it's also

16
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:47,119
incredibly uh it's been a huge part of my practice and um both dealing with my own

17
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:54,240
internalized mother and dealing with myself as a mother

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,759
um and all of us have the mother in us all of us

19
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:08,679
have the mother in us so I read a quote this morning and

20
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:15,840
I'm sorry I don't have the name of the author but I was just reading Marie papova or papanov she's got this

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,519
beautiful um email she sends out and she quotes an author who says about

22
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:28,040
motherhood it's hard to love and let go at the same

23
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:34,560
time and uh similarly um it's hard to provide safety

24
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:42,519
and danger at the same time right the love safety the Letting

25
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:49,080
Go the danger all are important we actually have to let our kids experience

26
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,360
difficulty we need to experience difficulty to grow right so it's very challenging

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,319
thing and um yeah so the wearing

28
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:09,280
green and um I'm wearing green for two reasons well one maybe but green

29
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:17,159
represents growth for me in nature and um I have a poem that my son

30
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:25,120
wrote when he was in um grade school so I'll start with

31
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,560
this I love you the greenest the color of all the leaves the

32
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,280
color of

33
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:45,040
watermelon and then I'll read you a different uh quote or a different poem

34
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,200
um by uh Rosemary traumer but before I go onto that I'll

35
00:03:52,200 --> 00:04:00,560
say a little bit more about growth and this idea I have a quote from Dr cila

36
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,840
Majid and she was just uh interviewed in tricycle magazine

37
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,840
recently and um she says some beautiful things and

38
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,519
hopefully I'll come back to them but I'll just read or and reread this one quote now we can recognize ourselves as

39
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,199
part of the community of beings forever coming to know forever unlearning what

40
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:34,320
we thought was reality because we're growing you're not growing if you know

41
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:44,360
everything so for me this is a huge part of practice in life is this ability to

42
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:50,960
be present and to continue to evolve and grow and show up for the moment as it is

43
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,400
because it's always different and uh we get pretty stuck in our ideas of what is

44
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:04,560
our beliefs our expectations it should be and um we'll see more about that when

45
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:10,160
we get to the suta too so here's the poem by Rosemary

46
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,240
traumer it's called motherhood today again I praise the

47
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:21,000
beaver who spends her life building rebuilding rebuilding her Lodge where

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:27,600
her young will live with small sticks and big sticks and Tall solid trunks

49
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:33,479
with logs and rocks and mud with her teeth she builds a home buil it

50
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:38,880
on moving water because rain because snow because

51
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:47,400
warm because cold because flow because flow because flow her home is forever in

52
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:52,800
need of repair and so on a day when a surprise

53
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:59,880
storm has flooded the stream and washed much of my Lodge away I honor the the

54
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:07,639
beaver stalwart resilient habitual I notice the longing to move to

55
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:13,840
land then I gather new sticks of Courage stones of

56
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,039
forgiveness logs of compassion and the Deep sticky mud of

57
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,520
love I weigh to the middle of the current I like all the mothers I build

58
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,198
this home again

59
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:42,039
so this there's a theme in here which is this um the flow the changing flow right

60
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:49,319
and growth and in the poem there's this one line where she's talking about the

61
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:55,160
surprise storm and it's washed away most of her Lodge and then she says I noticed

62
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,440
the longing to move to land which to me is

63
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,759
the the desire to cling to make things solid to move out

64
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,319
of the flow of

65
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,319
life so this is the suta we'll now move into the suta and um I'll be going in

66
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,759
and out and explaining some of the things that the suta says and

67
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:33,759
um just just to say I'm I'll read the suta and then I'll share what has come

68
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:41,280
up for me my Reflections in response to the suta this is not to say this is the

69
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,639
right interpretation of the suta but this is how this suta brings

70
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:55,159
my helps me see my practice as it is right now so as you hear the suta you may have

71
00:07:55,159 --> 00:08:02,800
other things that arise for you as well welcome them it doesn't mean that they're not right

72
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,639
okay all right so as usual they the suit to start with saying where they're at

73
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:14,280
where this is taking place at savati in this particular suta there the blessed

74
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:20,440
one said I tell you monks it is for one who knows and sees that there is the

75
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:26,039
ending of the effluence so I'm going to come back to

76
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:31,479
that and Define that word for you I'll just finish this section for one who

77
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:37,640
knows and sees what is there the knows and sees whoops there's

78
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:43,200
a little the ending of the affluence who is it right who sees the ending of of

79
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:48,600
the affluence they see such as form its origination its Fabrications its

80
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:53,720
Consciousness such as its origination such as its passing away it is for for

81
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:00,720
one who knows and sees in this way that there's the ending of the affluence

82
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:09,399
so the effluence come the word comes from a Latin verb afflu to flow

83
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,560
out in an older meaning an effluent was a stream of flowing out of a river or a

84
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:23,200
lake nowadays affluent almost always means wastes that pour out into water or

85
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:31,480
air so you might think of it as um things that pollute or things that

86
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:40,399
block right so things that cause suffering from the practice

87
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,760
perspective on the night of his Awakening this is a um I'm not reading

88
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:53,360
the sutta right now but on the night of his Awakening the Buddha focused his attention not on like concentration and

89
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:59,880
all these Altered States but actually on the mental process of trying to develop skillful

90
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:07,760
mental States this would be the opposite of the affluence so he was sitting down to

91
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,399
cultivate skillful states of mind and he did it in this way which was

92
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,720
to not reference himself which is very important it turns

93
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:28,760
out because it turns out that when we start to think I'm doing this this is mine this is me we are clogging the flow

94
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:35,240
we stop things up we pollute it with this identification and we're clinging

95
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:40,320
and it it really prevents this natural flow of life from happening and for

96
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,680
being clear about what it is so without referring to himself right he just

97
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:54,040
worked on cultivating wholesome skillful states of mind so this is what his he

98
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,199
the night he woke up this was his task

99
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,279
all right back to the suta so now he's going to you know he's

100
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:16,519
saying this is what we do we sit down and we cultivate this understanding we

101
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:23,279
see what's happening right we see the effluence End by noticing feeling

102
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:31,000
noticing our perceptions not ours I should take that word out of it you know um the way that we're fabricating the

103
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,079
Consciousness that's created seeing all this clearly simply without

104
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,240
identification and he says even though you he's going to talk about another

105
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,399
Monk now even though this wish may occur to a monk who's sitting down to meditate

106
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,800
I Want to Be Free essentially but he's sitting without

107
00:11:53,800 --> 00:12:00,320
developing devoting himself to development and I'll talk more about that but developing essentially these

108
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:07,440
skillful states of mind so a monk that sits down and wants to be

109
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,760
free but hasn't devoted himself to developing skillful States is not going

110
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:21,040
to get free is what essentially he says and he says why is that because of

111
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:28,000
lack of developing and then he lists the things that should be developed and the he lists this set of

112
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:36,560
seven qu qualities or sets of qualities the Buddha has lots of lists actually kind of amazing some of

113
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:42,480
these lists are really pretty um powerful because they they have this way

114
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:48,600
of growing building on each other or leading for being forward

115
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,040
leading and so there's these um seven sets of qualities that have been termed

116
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,360
uh the wings of Awakening so these sets these you know supportive qualities that

117
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,279
apparently he developed that night right are the wings that carry us to Freedom

118
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:13,160
they help us you know we aren't caught in these

119
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:22,440
effluence and um in other places in in the the sutas the Buddha tells us in

120
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:28,160
majaya 103 he says if you you know so this is what you think of me you think

121
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:35,320
of me as the bless blessed one sypa sympathetic seeking our well-being and teaching the Dharma out of sympathy this

122
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:40,959
is how he was seen and said to his followers this is how you see me he said

123
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:47,920
if that's how you see me then you should train yourself and the qualities I have

124
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:53,720
pointed out so it's these qualities in

125
00:13:54,279 --> 00:14:01,320
particular and so um back to the ship the ads and the um chick we are back in

126
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:06,880
the suta am I bouncing around too much are you guys following me okay

127
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:12,880
okay okay great thank you all right suppose a

128
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:20,519
hen has eight 10 or 12 eggs okay if she doesn't cover them rightly

129
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:26,680
warm them rightly or incubate them rightly then even though this wish may

130
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:33,759
occur to her oh that my chicks might break through the eggshells with their spiked claws or beaks and hatch out

131
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:40,839
safely so even though she has this wish but if she hasn't covered them

132
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:47,480
rightly still it is not possible that the chicks will break through the

133
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,079
eggshells so for me the Buddha is pointing to the fact that we can want to

134
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:59,560
get free but if we don't do the work if we don't sit and cultivate

135
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:04,480
and gestate not going to

136
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:16,680
happen and so then you know there's this language in the suta that says just this that um just you know just like if the

137
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:22,320
hen hasn't covered them warmed them incubated them rightly in the same way

138
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,000
even though the monk may wish to be free right it's not going to happen

139
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,120
because he hasn't been reled released from these effluence through lack of

140
00:15:35,319 --> 00:15:41,880
clinging not clinging to the sewage the things that cause us

141
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:48,000
suffering and developing at the same time these seven wings of Awakening one

142
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,160
at a time perhaps or several as they

143
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:02,759
build and then the Buddha goes on to say um that if there's a monk who's

144
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:09,720
practicing and he doesn't have or she doesn't have this wish to get

145
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:18,519
free her mind can still be released by

146
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:24,959
developing these wholesome skillful qualities and letting go so we don't

147
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:30,120
have to want to get free we just have to practice

148
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:37,079
we in the next sections about the hen goes back to the hen the hen doesn't have to want the eggs to hatch the hen

149
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:42,480
just has to sit on them rightly

150
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:55,319
right so of course then he goes on to say you know the hen has these eggs sits

151
00:16:55,319 --> 00:17:01,199
on them incubates them warms them does doesn't want them to hatch but they do

152
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:09,160
right because she has essentially done the things that need to be done so let's take a minute to step out

153
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:13,559
of the suta and talk about chickens and

154
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:22,280
eggs this the simile of chicken and eggs is um of course very relevant to

155
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:30,400
Motherhood but it's um also just relevant to uh

156
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:39,720
all all of us have the capacity to develop and cultivate um all kinds of

157
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:45,960
States all kinds of actions all kinds of ways of

158
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:56,520
being and um some of them require a lot of patience we can't be sitting on our

159
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:02,240
eggs checking every 5 minutes minutes am I there yet am I there yet is it here

160
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:09,280
yet is it here yet right or cracking them open or help trying to help the egg you know there's various stories about

161
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:14,360
trying to help butterflies come out of cocoons and it just doesn't work right

162
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:21,400
same with chicks they need to get their way out of their eggs

163
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:29,640
so there's this poignancy for me around our practice and growth and life

164
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:36,360
and watching our children or our loved ones and sitting back and letting there be this process

165
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:44,280
happening this undergoing the the flowing of the river not trying to control it too much right and not

166
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:49,159
getting it too blocked up this love and letting

167
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:58,280
go and the incubation and the gestation beautiful words right for all of us to think about

168
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,360
there's also like sometimes you'll hear people talking about building a practice

169
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,480
and we're like okay it's like planting a seed and letting the seed grow in the

170
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:15,519
garden and then okay well let me see how are the roots you

171
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:24,400
know we have to just trust there's a lot of trust that's required tending patience

172
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,720
trust and the right conditions we need the sun we need the water

173
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:37,320
right so just like um the chicken creates the

174
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:43,360
conditions you know the chicken has the egg but the egg really is maybe just a

175
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:51,720
symbol for what is possible within us all of us regardless of gender

176
00:19:51,720 --> 00:20:00,639
regardless of fertility you know is just what what is possible deeply possible

177
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,760
and so this patience and this practice is you know of of creating these

178
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:14,000
conditions is really our practice and how we do it and how we understand that we're in this flow and that we you know

179
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:21,200
consistently help ourselves to remember to let go of all the identification to let go of the not wanting to let go of

180
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:26,440
the wanting you know just this constant needing to keep meeting and

181
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:34,760
meeting this moment and S daania says this thing that is um

182
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:40,360
really you know the Buddha talks about a lot too but it's like the thing that

183
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:47,679
starts to happen is if we sit long enough the eggs hatch and if we're present for that and

184
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,240
aware when that happens it's it's really really

185
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,280
rewarding and encouraging and um

186
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,760
when we start to have wisdom about how we're showing up for our practice in

187
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:10,799
life the mind starts to feel Joy as it starts to understand as wisdom grows and

188
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:16,960
as we see this process we have joy and it grows our faith in our trust it's

189
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:21,840
very very you know motivating for

190
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:30,600
us boo osaro um talks about this whole se you know kind of idea of what the

191
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:38,320
Buddha is talking about in terms of cultivating the skillful and he uses the word karma karma right he says the

192
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,400
principle of skillful Karma formed both the how and the what of that Awakening

193
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,840
that the Buddha experienced the Buddha was able to reach

194
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:54,158
Awakening only by developing skill for

195
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:02,279
karma and his understanding of the process of developing this skillful karma is what sparked the

196
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,480
insights that constituted his

197
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:15,080
Awakening so the Buddha then in the same suta goes and offers this other um

198
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:21,559
simile to talk about this kind of to this process of growth and

199
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:26,919
cultivation and he talks about a carpenter

200
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:32,880
um or the carpenter Carpenter's Apprentice um just as when a carpenter

201
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:37,919
or a carpenter's Apprentice sees the marks of his fingers or thumb on the

202
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,799
handle of his ads but but does not know today my ads handle wore down this much

203
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:51,320
or yesterday it wore down that much or the day before yesterday it wore down this much right so the overtime tools

204
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,440
wooden tools handled tools that are handled over and over again they wear

205
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:03,360
they wear and slowly there are imprints in the wood from the

206
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:10,120
hands and you know the monk or the Buddha says that um in the same way the

207
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:15,360
monk doesn't know today my effluence wore down this much

208
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:22,880
right or yesterday they wore down that much the day before you know it just it

209
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:28,600
happens and eventually we start to see some evidence of it

210
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:37,679
so an example of um how this you know kind of can happen

211
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:44,480
on Retreat for example or in our practice is that you know if we keep staying present if we keep meeting this

212
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:49,640
moment if we keep staying in the flow and with mindfulness

213
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:56,200
right we can start to notice the Mind states that

214
00:23:56,200 --> 00:24:04,480
arise we can start to witness it and the closer we are to the moment the more closely we are to witnessing the

215
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:14,720
hatching and and for me a really beautiful place for practice is bringing

216
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:20,760
awareness to suffering which I've I like to translate as pain some of you may have heard me

217
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:26,279
talk about sort of pain which is a messenger and necessary and a signal for

218
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:30,360
us to pay attention

219
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,200
and so I really like to notice when I'm suffering when I'm feeling

220
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,880
pain and then when I do that and bring my awareness to it you know I can sort

221
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:51,120
of soften into it with curiosity opening to what's

222
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:57,360
happening and then sometimes sometimes there's a moment of just all of a sudden

223
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:02,559
going oh I get it right and maybe it's

224
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:08,799
as simple as I just have this ability to see the thought pattern that's going on

225
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:16,480
that's causing suffering it's just this chain of thoughts I'm been caught in and it's

226
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:22,679
sort of this Loop and it just keeps hurting and there can be this moment of

227
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:28,000
just going oh I don't have to keep thinking that

228
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:33,559
way and when you see this in this right

229
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:39,880
way there's this huge energy that can arise joy that can arise this feeling of

230
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:44,919
like okay I have a choice here and it's like putting your foot down instead of

231
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:51,440
going over here it's like going over here and all of a sudden you're just walking on a different path your mind is

232
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:57,360
just in a different path because you've decided somehow enough of your system

233
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:04,520
enough of your awareness enough of your wisdom and your heart have all gone I don't want to do that anymore

234
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:11,799
hurts and if we can then witness oh look this shift is there it feels

235
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:19,919
better it feels better we we're recognizing the birth of

236
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,640
wisdom and Faith from meeting suffering and that faith that Joy brings

237
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:36,158
energy or joy and that energy supports our mindfulness our ability to keep staying

238
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:45,399
present

239
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:54,399
so yeah it's not going to happen every

240
00:26:54,399 --> 00:27:01,440
time but it will happen if you stay in the practice stay present

241
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:10,159
right and sometimes it's a big letting go and sometimes it's a little letting go but wow every little letting go is

242
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:15,880
powerful especially if we stay with it and appreciate it and choose it because

243
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:24,799
we can also so quickly just go back to what was po painful so easy so

244
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:34,799
easy so then there's one more simile in the suta it's about um a

245
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:41,120
ship and the Su goes like this just as when an oceangoing ship rigged with

246
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:48,159
masts and stays after six months on the water is left on the shore for the

247
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:55,120
winter it it stray it stays weathered by heat and Wind moistened by the clouds of

248
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:02,080
the rainy season and it easily will wither and rot

249
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,200
away in the same way when a monk dwells devoting himself to development his feds

250
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,440
easily wither and rot away so for me this this suta really

251
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:19,000
emphasizes um for me again right this

252
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,640
sitting with suffering sitting with pain just sitting so because I love this like

253
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,480
under the the weather the sun the sun to me is a symbol of awareness of of seeing

254
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,559
of bringing light putting our light on something our Awareness on

255
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:43,320
something and um so and then this this the weathering of it just just this

256
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:50,399
awareness just the letting it be seen and the to me the the rain and the

257
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:58,679
storms feels so much like duat me right and so sitting with this wisdom of

258
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:05,760
of seeing and feeling the difficulty this just this consistently

259
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:11,679
over time his feathers easily wither and rot

260
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,880
away the this the weather does the work of letting

261
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:24,799
go make sense and something that's I think

262
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:32,519
really important um for us to know when we talk when I talk about like sitting and being with our pain our suffering

263
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:39,200
you know there's a lot of things going on in life that are very difficult inside of me around

264
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:46,320
me but I can be okay I can be comfortable when that's happening I

265
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:52,000
don't have to be depressed I don't have to be

266
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,000
miserable as long as I'm growing as long as I'm practicing

267
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,200
right I know it's going to be

268
00:30:04,679 --> 00:30:11,200
okay being a mom has been a huge motivation for me to

269
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:17,679
focus my attention directly on suffering and on cultivating skillful states of

270
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:25,039
being a huge motivation it has given me so much importance and urgency around my

271
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:31,279
practice at times just deep deep urgency you watch your children growing you go through difficult times you're like I've

272
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:38,720
got to get this right I have got to get through this and we can't you know we

273
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:45,120
can see things and know our patterns and our reactivity and we can't just stop

274
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:53,440
it we can't just you know make it disappear it has to weather it has to be

275
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:59,760
seen under the light it has to sit on the shore it takes time

276
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:10,000
so to reinforce this PO Point um there's a back to majam Manaya too all the

277
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,000
effluence uh the Buddha says and I'm going to give this a genderless pronoun

278
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,159
they attend appropriately this is

279
00:31:21,159 --> 00:31:26,360
stress this is the origination of stress this is the cessation of stress this is

280
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:32,159
the way leading to the cessation of stress this is how we attend and this is

281
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,880
the for Noble

282
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:45,519
Truths just practicing attending with the understanding of these four noble

283
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:51,320
truths and then the Buddha goes on to say as they attend appropriately in this

284
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:58,559
way the feds are abandoned the effluence are abandoned

285
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,519
so um you know we all have our our things

286
00:32:24,519 --> 00:32:29,840
that we want to get free of right I hope

287
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:41,440
I was uh back to Camila Majid I was really inspired by uh the

288
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:47,960
way she framed this and her she wrote a book and and um

289
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:54,679
was interviewed by tricycle and and the book is about um Justice and

290
00:32:54,679 --> 00:33:00,840
racism and um and this is one of the things that I aspire to be free of right

291
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:09,840
is is these the conditioning of bias and she said that her she believes

292
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,518
the or her for her the fight for justice can be and has been

293
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:24,880
joyful and this is you know kind of going this is what the Buddha says right that what if we engage with our Dua with

294
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:32,320
wisdom right if we see it and we H we see that there's another way Faith

295
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,919
arises energy arises Joy

296
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:43,039
arises and then she goes she says this beautiful thing she says in her view or

297
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:49,080
this is the the tricycle author in her view Justice is inexorable from Joy and

298
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:55,600
it involves accessing the inner joy that is available to us when we treat ourselves and others as enlightened

299
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,320
beings she says thee more we step out of what we believe to be our comfort zone the

300
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:07,399
bigger that zone grows until the whole world is our comfort

301
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:13,118
zone but it's not comfort in the sense of I feel good all the time we're going

302
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,839
to be very distressed if we expect to feel good all the

303
00:34:19,879 --> 00:34:27,040
time and this is that quote that I shared earlier that I'll share again when we can recognize ourselves as part

304
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:34,358
of the community of beings forever forever coming to know forever

305
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:44,398
unlearning what we thought was reality because we're growing you're not growing if you know

306
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:53,560
everything we have to uh really counterbalance the mind's natural

307
00:34:53,560 --> 00:35:00,760
tendency to under to learn right the in the way that the Mind

308
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,760
learns for efficacy right the brain learns things and then stores it in

309
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:12,200
memory and the older we get the more we've got stored so the more we have to

310
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:18,520
unlearn and um and you know we get taught things from all kinds of sources

311
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:23,800
directly and indirectly could be an advertisement on TV it could be you know

312
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:29,359
a parent it could be a friend who knows right it all comes in and somehow some

313
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:37,599
of it gets really stored and becomes a reference point for us our beliefs about what it is to be a

314
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:43,800
mother about other people about ourselves all of these things have been

315
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:49,480
grown over time and very unconsciously are stored

316
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:55,800
within ourselves and we're none of us are free of this we're all subject to

317
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,599
it so if we we can bring a lot of curiosity to witnessing what what the

318
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:07,800
mind is generating and bring more of a the

319
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,680
awareness of Right Here Right Here Right Now what is this in this moment that's

320
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:21,079
happening we start to help un uncouple what was

321
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:28,560
stored most of it without choice and we can recouple if we stay

322
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,920
present with what's happening now with what's in front of us now what's here

323
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,680
now the unlearning and then the learning but awareness is essential for the whole

324
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:47,640
process being aware and I love this forever

325
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:54,880
unlearning what we thought was reality because we're growing because it is kind of every time you meet a tree it's a new

326
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:02,560
tree if you don't watch out you're going to just see it as the word tree however it's stored in your mind right it just

327
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:09,079
becomes this thing a thing instead of something unique and beautiful and green

328
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:17,319
and alive and growing so I think that's the end of my

329
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:24,440
talk thank you all we have a couple minutes so if

330
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:32,400
anyone wants to ask a question yeah Genie can you get a mic so that it's it's hearable to

331
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:38,800
others hello my name is jeie and um I really like this talk what you're just

332
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:45,000
describing at the end is that what you would call skillful Karma because I never heard that before skillful

333
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:52,200
Karma well skillful Karma so I didn't really go into the you know seven um

334
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:58,560
wings of Awakening but that's like the the qualities of um for example the the

335
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:05,520
five faculties are one of the seven lists so they're faculties of

336
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:12,640
Faith um energy mindfulness calm or concentration and

337
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:19,359
wisdom so these are skill these are some of those seven wings of Awakening so that would be skillful Karma to have

338
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:29,000
cultivated these skillful ways of of being present thank you thank you

339
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,640
Tanya was the entire suta about the beavers and the chickens from MN number

340
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:53,720
two it's um no I think it's uh Samaya samut aaya

341
00:38:53,720 --> 00:39:00,440
22101 uh which one uh s mhm

342
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:04,599
22101 thank you very much yeah

343
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:16,160
absolutely I love the forever unlearning what we thought was reality isn't that

344
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:20,119
great I love that one

345
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,560
too okay question number there

346
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:39,040
hi Jen uh my question is how you referenced faith I I kind of I was

347
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:47,880
raised as a Catholic so I'm familiar with what faith has been to me great um but I don't understand it in Great this

348
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:55,560
scenario beautiful great question I love talking about this too so happy to answer um so first of all I like there's

349
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:01,520
three words that can be alternately considered for me Faith

350
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:09,480
which is Faith trust which has been my my Harbor and confidence and maybe it can

351
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:15,119
be thought of as a Continuum and so and and what the um the

352
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:21,560
Buddha teaches us is that we don't have to um have just we don't he doesn't want

353
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:27,839
us to have just faith in what he says he wants us to take what he says and practice with it

354
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:35,520
so that we grow trust in the practice itself and that we see the unfolding of

355
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:41,359
the practice we we witness things like I was describing through the practice so

356
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,960
our faith then over time becomes absolute

357
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:54,680
confidence yeah so uh don't ever just accept anything that is taught to you in

358
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:02,680
other words there's an the Buddha um didn't wouldn't even answer questions

359
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:09,078
about um is there a soul or not a soul or any of those kinds of

360
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:12,359
things

361
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:22,480
great hi uh my name is Abby and as I

362
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,839
like the idea of forever unlearning things uhhuh

363
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:34,280
but it invokes a sense of conflict within me MH

364
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:40,400
because the way I understand it the Buddha says that look at things

365
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:47,640
like processes rather than solid object right but then that directly contradicts

366
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:53,040
with the way we live life because our sense of security comes from T being

367
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,839
certain way yeah and so how do we find a balance between like a conventional life

368
00:41:58,839 --> 00:42:06,319
that we like we lbers people live yeah yeah well it's not a problem to live a

369
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:13,480
conventional life it's not a problem to love people to have family to have

370
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:19,800
commitments to have jobs to have things it's not a problem to have desires the problem lies in our

371
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,599
attachment to those things and are clinging to those

372
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:33,160
things and and are wanting to control those things and thinking that they're

373
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:38,640
ours so it's really about our relationship to Conventional

374
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:46,520
life not the the objects themselves it's about our relationship to life and

375
00:42:46,520 --> 00:42:52,880
letting life flow life letting people change letting ourselves change even

376
00:42:52,880 --> 00:43:00,880
when we're not really wanting to sometimes yeah does that answer your question

377
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:06,559
no well it's not going to resolve your problem that's for sure it's not going

378
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:12,920
to make it easier until you are have moments where you see the the pain

379
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:19,200
that's being caused by the attachment so so notice where you're

380
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,640
clinging notice where you're wanting things to be different than the way they are or not wanting them to

381
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:33,680
change and track that space because that's the space of uh where Dua will

382
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:40,040
arise where suffering will arise where stress will arise where pain will arise and that is your

383
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:47,480
teacher and we start to then you have to kind of this is where we have to keep unlearning because if we are looking at

384
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:53,680
what's happening and we keep from a fixated point of view we're not going to see the truth of what's Happening why

385
00:43:53,680 --> 00:44:00,079
that there's pain there and then we're never motivated to let go thank you that was helpful thank you one

386
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:05,440
more behind you hi I just wanted to express my
