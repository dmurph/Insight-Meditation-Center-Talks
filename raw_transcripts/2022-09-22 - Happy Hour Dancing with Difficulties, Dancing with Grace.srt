1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,760
there so so hello and welcome to this

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:16,800
edition of happy hour happy to be with you all and um

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,119
um i notice actually as i'm starting to to to speak and smile and try to smile and

4
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:28,720
speak it's a little hard to talk because i just had a feeling done earlier this

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:36,800
afternoon and part of my mouth is still numb so it um that's what's happening anyway

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:43,360
we'll see how much it impacts my my speech but um the vowels that the round vowels are

7
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,760
going to be hard anyway so um [Music]

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,399
so for today um [Music] i wanted to invite us

9
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:05,359
to this this new exploration i haven't quite taught it this way so i wanted to set the frame

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,479
so to set the frame i wanted to invite you to consider um you know there is this this game

11
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:19,759
uh that uh is played in um the context of maybe team building or

12
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,799
i've taught it in improv courses and i'm gonna describe it and then

13
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:30,320
i'm going to invite us to see well actually i'll just do it let me just

14
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:38,079
tell you what it is so so there is this game that's called a mirror where you get in front of another

15
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:45,520
human being physically and one person is a and the other person is person b

16
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,320
and for a while a leads with physical motions raising their arms maybe winking

17
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,479
and physical motions and b tries to follow b is the mirror tries to follow

18
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:07,280
really follow the lead of a okay got that can imagine yourself doing that

19
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:13,280
in the second part of the this game person b takes the lead

20
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:19,520
and moves their arms maybe their body their legs walks back and forth or whatever it

21
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:26,640
is movements and and person a is the mirror tries to follow all their try

22
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:34,640
to tries to mirror all their physical movements to follow them so now b is the lead and a is the

23
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,640
follower the mirror and then we often surprise people uh

24
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,959
with this third one which opens up your thinking open opens up this this

25
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,080
traditional way of thinking about being a leader or following in life

26
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,120
and the third part of this game is no one is a leader no one is a follower

27
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,239
and both are leaders both are followers so the idea is you learn you you get a

28
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,239
sense of how to become in sync no one really takes the lead otherwise

29
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,640
it really loses its edge but movements happen there's maybe little movement and the

30
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,159
other person continues it and the other person the person so so lead is kind of

31
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:29,920
handed back and forth and bad following is handed back and forth and so both

32
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,959
people are following and leading at the same time both entities okay

33
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,239
and if you've never done this game it can be mind-blowing how it works and how

34
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:46,560
it opens possibilities up actually and if you've done it now

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,159
hopefully you're you're remembering the joy the beauty of this of being in flow

36
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:57,920
with another human being and leading and following so

37
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,640
so with this i wanted to invite us

38
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,959
to consider the difficulties or the challenges in

39
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:16,799
our lives what if we were dancing we were dancing in the same way

40
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:23,360
with our challenges we weren't trying to to lead trying to

41
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:31,440
dominate trying to say okay challenge i'm going to put you in a box i'm gonna deal with you i'm gonna get rid of you

42
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,360
and we were not dominated we're not completely following the lead

43
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,479
of wherever difficulties and challenges took us but

44
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,960
what if we're actually in a dance we're gonna dance with life

45
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,479
we're when the dance with our challenges so the challenge leads a little bit

46
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:02,400
and then maybe we're following then we lead a little bit with oh this maybe this challenge actually is opening me up

47
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,039
to see in this way to move in this way and then maybe the challenge opens you up and moves you this way a little bit

48
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,039
and you move and then yeah you take the next league so it's a it's a dance it's a dance

49
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,800
and dance isn't a fist fight isn't an act of domination

50
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,680
but is what life is made of it's an infinite infinite game it's not a finite game

51
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:34,800
when there's a winner and there's a loser it's an infinite game of expression

52
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:40,400
so the title i want to give to this section to this practice that i'm offering is

53
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,800
dancing with grace and there are two meanings to this so what if

54
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,680
this dance you're doing this challenge isn't just that you're dancing with challenges

55
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,240
in your life what if challenges are actually expressions of grace

56
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:09,199
goodness in your life and through the stance you're being opened up to more grace to more goodness

57
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,639
to more wisdom to more compassion for yourself and for others

58
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,400
so dancing with grace so your partner is grace your partner is grace you're

59
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,520
dancing with grace you're dancing with grace

60
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:31,360
and the great and grace is also the challenges too it's both grace and challenge at the same time

61
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:36,639
and also dancing with grace another way that that in english that phrase

62
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:43,360
uh has a meaning is oh when you dance with grace there's a sense of um

63
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:50,800
move your movements your your actions there is a sense of

64
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,800
uprightness there's a sense of goodness that the whole dance the whole

65
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,560
being in the world so dancing with grace dancing with grace both of those

66
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,800
meanings so the invitation i'm going to make i'm making for our practice together in the

67
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:16,639
guided meditation as we're about to to do it together

68
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:22,400
uh of course after we settle in with our breath our bodies as always with our intention

69
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,680
is to see to see our challenges as grace as if

70
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:33,280
we're dancing with them is there a way that they're pointing and opening us to

71
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:39,360
goodness to to seeing things differently and maybe seeing this whole

72
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,759
dynamic as dancing with grace instead of oh poor me i have all these problems or

73
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:55,120
these challenges in my body and my mind and my life but seeing that you're dancing with grace dancing with grace

74
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,440
giving giving a much more dimensionality in this plane so

75
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:08,000
so enough of the framing let's practice together so

76
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:16,080
like to invite you to land in your meditation posture

77
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:23,319

78
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:41,240

this breath being a dance

112
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,600
you're not leaving

113
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,480
all the time you're not following all the time you're both leading and following

114
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:07,920
and the breath in the body this body knows how to breathe on its

115
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,240
own

116
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:22,519

breathing is a dance not too complicated

118
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,399
don't think about it you weren't thinking about this dance of

119
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:47,639
breathing until a moment ago let it be natural let it be joyous

120
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:08,880
as if it's where a partner dance

121
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,520
a delicate dance like the tango

122
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,799

123
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,720

00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:38,440
delight of dancing with the breath

127
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,640
nothing more joyful than just dancing with the breath in this moment

128
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:49,840
all thoughts can wait they can wait not now

129
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:59,960
receiving giving

130
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,279
dancing with the breath with grace

131
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,640
as a practice for what comes next

132
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:39,120
maybe when challenges arise in the moment just remembering this

133
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:45,280
dance with the breath it's dancing [Music]

134
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:50,880
giving taking [Music] kindly

135
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,720
spaciously can help bring perspective

136
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:02,440
groundedness grace

137
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:19,440
grace to our dance with a challenge a difficulty perhaps

138
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:24,880
what if you imagine yourself

139
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,720
dancing with this partner

140
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:40,480
this challenge in your life dancing with grace

141
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:54,480
maybe a different attitude a shift in attitude is needed not to dislike your partner dance

142
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,760
partner not to try to dominate it not to be scared of it but to open your

143
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:04,799
arms hold their hand

144
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,158
as if in the partner dance

145
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:15,520
a sense of trust and let yourself be held

146
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:19,840
both leading and following

147
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,919
not so much thinking you don't have to think about solutions

148
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:37,120
but energetically shifting your relationship to this difficulty

149
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:46,600
an energetic shift you're dancing you're participating

150
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,720
you're leading in some moments and you're following in some moments

151
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:55,679
it's a dance

152
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:03,600
completely engaged in this dance

153
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:15,760
you're engaged wholeheartedly in this dance it challenges you it also nourishes you

154
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:21,120
there's some moves there's some areas in the dance floor you've never explored

155
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:28,000
ever and this partner leads you there

156
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:34,480
you don't have to know what they are [Music] but trust you follow

157
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:42,480
and oh [Music] you notice another corner and you lead

158
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,600
let's explore this do your challenge together

159
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:58,960
and the more you dance the more confident you feel

160
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:10,278
this is the worthy dance partner

161
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,080
challenges you helps you grow opens your heart

162
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,840
teaches you

163
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,480
but it's not always in the lead sometimes it follows

164
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:39,559
as you lead both leading and both following at the same time

165
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:44,960
passing the baton back and forth seamlessly

166
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:51,200
it's a graceful dance and again you don't have to put concepts

167
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,840
and words

168
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,080
it's just shifting a relationship

169
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,080
there's a sense of delight i get to dance i get to participate in

170
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:19,400
this dance maybe there's more zest

171
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:29,440
maybe as you're dancing in your mind your image

172
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,240
there's meta there is good will for yourself for the challenge for this

173
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:43,360
space between the two of you and this stands for

174
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,640
the space this dance floor of life

175
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:53,919
much wider than you thought it was much wider

176
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:59,679
much bigger more expensive keep dancing

177
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,840
keep dancing with grace

178
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:13,480
breathing in breathing out

179
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:32,080
and when your heart feels like this dance with

180
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:42,919
this partner feels complete in this moment maybe you bow to each other

181
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:53,840
or maybe another dance partner could be a challenge or could be gift

182
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:57,640
in your life a blessing

183
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:08,480
that leads you and you lead it you help it grow

184
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:15,200
it helps you grow the more you dance

185
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,919
the more full of vitality life grace kindness you become your heart

186
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:26,919
becomes

187
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:35,600
keep dancing with grace

188
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,840
in your mind's eye

189
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,760
whatever feels appropriate you can bow

190
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,840
to your dance partner maybe another dance partner or maybe you

191
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,360
simply sit and breathe

192
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:29,278
dance with the breath and feel into this shift in perspective

193
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,840
challenges with metta with kindness

194
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:42,200
spacious spaciously

195
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,559
you're still dancing maybe the dance floor keeps expanding

196
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:24,080
beyond your imagination wow so much potential possibility

197
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,840
gross

198
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:23,358
maybe the sand sludge has arisen or can derive is

199
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:31,040
through imagining this dance dancing with grace with challenges and difficulties

200
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:40,000
maybe there's a recognition of your own ability to dance

201
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,720
skills capacities goodnesses

202
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:54,398
that you're getting to recognize and have more confidence in

203
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,040
capacity to follow and lead lead and follow

204
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:14,000
into wisdom and love

205
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:20,480

212
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:22,800
thank you all for your practice and for participating in this dance

213
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:26,520
exploring together

214
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:35,440
so we have a few minutes for any questions comments reflections

215
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,480
special reports from the field how was this for you

216
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,560
claire i do happen to see your hand i usually don't see people's hand there you go

217
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:55,920
you're still muted yeah i couldn't on unuse i was having some problems

218
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:02,640
anyhow um you may have noticed that i was smiling through the whole meditation

219
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,400
and this is because it's my favorite of anything you've ever done

220
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,440
my husband and i started dancing tango 12 years ago

221
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,640
and we dance every week and what you talked about speaks so much to

222
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:28,000
the practice of tango you know tango is sometimes referred to as dance as a meditation

223
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:33,839
um and it is very much tango people do not speak at all

224
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:39,680
the music directs what we do the man directs the woman through his

225
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:47,680
steps and when you finish you want to change partners you just say thank you

226
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:55,520
and that's the end of that partnership but it is such it's such a cool experience i really urge everybody here

227
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,960
to try it it's really wonderful it's the most beautiful dance you can ever do

228
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:06,320
and it does it does encourage meditation actually you don't talk at

229
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:12,720
all to each other you're just following the music so yeah you're so much in the space of

230
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,280
of leading and following yeah thank you claire thank you for bringing that in being a tango dancer yourself that is

231
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,320
sweet that's lovely yeah yeah appreciate that and uh and i do want to

232
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:31,680
point that that one difference between the dance of tango as you point as you uh mentioned and here in this meditation

233
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:37,200
it's obvious but i still want to note it is here we were imagining not

234
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:44,720
leading or following an entangle one person leads one person follows yes and here it is deleting and following

235
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:51,920
yeah exactly and here we're leading we're leading and following at the same time yeah thank you claire yeah

236
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:58,000
beautiful so lovely any other reflections that came up maybe

237
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:05,599
as you tried this on was there something about your perspective that maybe all of a sudden shifted with respect to

238
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,119
some challenge you're having in your life it was maybe not thinking so much but their

239
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,640
sense of wow yeah i can dance with this i can hold myself upright

240
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:22,400
madison uh can you hear me yeah

241
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,920
um i was at first confused by the idea of letting the

242
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:35,040
thing lead um i was working with like this character of my anxiety

243
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,760
that i have all the time with me and i was like this doesn't make sense i don't want to go down this trail that

244
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,200
they're trying to lead me but later in the meditation

245
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,400
when i imagined that like letting them lead it was like i'm not

246
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,760
afraid of you it's okay this is okay it just

247
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:04,079
i don't know it sort of helped me like not be afraid and and build trust

248
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:10,880
with it and like that created a lot of space so i just wanted to share that beautiful

249
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,400
thank you so much for sharing that medicine that's it exactly because in the dance right there's a sense of trust

250
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:22,800
right you know you're holding like okay i'm gonna hold your hand there's some and and there's a sense of trust and you

251
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:29,119
also have contro you know there's there's give and take so that's exactly it this shift in relationship exactly as

252
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,480
you said it beautiful thanks so much for sharing that that mates serve you mate support you

253
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:38,760
beautiful barbara

254
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:45,760
still muted my dear

255
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:54,240
ah still muted wait how can we help on mute you hold on

256
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:02,480
try again there we go there we go thank you i just want to thank you nikki this was

257
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:09,200
uh so different from other meditations other meta

258
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:17,200
practices and it was wonderful for me my mind went back over the over

259
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:23,920
40 years that i was married and times where my

260
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:30,880
husband was a lead and other times you know over all the years it just there was so much

261
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:36,240
things changed as you know causes and conditions and

262
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,880
health and you know different things that come up in life

263
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,200
and so just that's what came up for me was to run my

264
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,920
you know mind's eye through this sort of timeline of when i was leading and when

265
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,800
i was following and i think it was a valuable exercise thank you thanks for ever i appreciate

266
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:08,400
hearing the sense of or recognizing that actually you've been doing the dance of

267
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,440
both leading and following in your life in your relationship in your marriage

268
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:21,359
for 40 years did you say so leading and over 40 years leading and following well

269
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:28,400
yeah it's it's done now it passed away a few years ago

270
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:34,079
this was a a nice meditation to think back over

271
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:40,560
the thing that uh we did together and a sense of appreciation of of your and and

272
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,880
to bring it here in the present and here and now barbara's capacity to dance with

273
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:52,319
life lead and follow yeah yeah and that's a sense of confidence it

274
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:58,720
builds yeah wow look at that that's beautiful it's not always leading or always following

275
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,079
beautiful thanks for sharing the bourbon yeah beautiful [Music]

276
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,680
nice yeah any other reflections and you can also type them in chat if you type them

277
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:14,800
to me privately i won't read your name if you type them to everyone i'll read

278
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:21,040
your name and yeah anything else that might have come

279
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,720
up i'm saying oh this is interesting

280
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:32,400
and maybe what we'll do if i don't initially i think i see your hand there

281
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,640
um my challenge is very heavy but i noticed in the dance it got so

282
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,960
light nice and um

283
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,800
was could move around so i appreciate that thank you

284
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:58,079
thank you michelle that's fantastic yeah that's exactly that's the intention for this meditation it's to shift our

285
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,280
perspective from something that's heavy and unmovable it's like oh it's lighter

286
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:08,319
it moves and that that can create a

287
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:13,599
different perspective yeah different perspective of working with it beautiful thanks for sharing

288
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:20,839
them jerry says it seems that life is in fact a tense of change absolutely

289
00:44:20,839 --> 00:44:26,480
absolutely so speaking of a dance of change we are

290
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:32,720
going to shift into small groups and practice together

291
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:38,960
this dance of life dancing together and um

292
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:45,280
i'll create the rooms and the invitation is each person will just share one nugget

293
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:51,119
one brief nugget maybe about this practice what came up for you or

294
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,640
maybe this this sense of dancing with life dancing challenges like really

295
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:04,400
speaking about that for your own sake really and be held witness so that this perspective this this sense can be

296
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:11,839
spoken for you and and really um and it can be about a challenge or it can be about something good or or again

297
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:19,280
by this meditation or in general and if it comes to you and you you want to say pass and just hold kind space for others

298
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:25,920
that's perfectly fine and so let's do alphabetical order

299
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:31,119
um first actually reverse alphabetical order just to shake it up a little bit

300
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:37,760
first name and one nugget next person one nugget next person one nugget again the first person one nugget

301
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:44,000
you go around around and remember you're just sharing from your own experience not asking questions directing leading

302
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,359
just offering yourself your kindness and it might be silence so

303
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:58,319
so ready opening the rooms take care of yourselves take care of each other

304
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:03,760
figure that out next time anyway so any final reflections anything that came up

305
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:10,000
for you especially if you haven't spoken today or in a while

306
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:19,920
and i may not see your hand physical hand because there are only very few of you i see so

307
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,078
vicky oh you're still muted

308
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:34,240
yeah nikki i've been away um at different time than this time

309
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:40,839
but i just wanted to thank you for tonight because this is the first time i've ever really

310
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:46,800
been connected to what the breath is in meditation and it was just great

311
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,839
it was um a way to break down that breath to both leading

312
00:46:51,839 --> 00:46:56,880
and following it was yay coming from a walk so i was

313
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,519
leading and following in the walk and it just matched exactly what i had been doing
