so so for today's um practice what i would like to invite us to

30
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,599
consider in our practice

31
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:17,360
is um is both how

32
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:24,080
how compassion how suffering how challenges how ouches

33
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:31,280
are both personal and also impersonal

34
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,040
um i was having a conversation earlier today with a practitioner

35
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:43,040
but um since has been inspiring to me so i wanted to share that with you this

36
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,319
these images these ideas that

37
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,080
but a lot of times you know our confusion our sorrow

38
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,519
our pain or those of others

39
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:08,959
can feel so personal are i'm sorries like oh i'm sorry oh i'm so sorry ouch

40
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:14,480
ouch or they i'm sorry that other people have for us

41
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:21,600
i'm sorry that they have i'm sorry i didn't treat you the way i would have liked to treat you i'm i'm

42
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,440
sorry i wasn't there for you or maybe the i'm sorry is that we have the sorrows

43
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,360
that we have i'm sorry that i wasn't the person i wanted to be or

44
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,560
show up the way i wanted to i'm sorry for myself or for others these these

45
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:44,800
expressions of of of perhaps

46
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:51,919
sometimes um [Music] regret that can turn into shame that can

47
00:04:51,919 --> 00:05:00,080
turn into shame what if we heard what if we really allowed ourselves

48
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:06,800
to perceive to hear these expressions of i'm sorry

49
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:16,000
whether it's for ourselves or others we heard it as an expression of sorrow

50
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:23,120
not one of shame or blame but one of expression of sorrow sadness suffering

51
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,360
and what if as if we listen to it

52
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,360
with the ear of kuan yin ear of compassion the same way

53
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,240
that kuan yin this embodiment this this paragon of

54
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,039
compassion it is said that kuan yin listens to all the cries of the world all the sorrows of

55
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:56,080
the world so what if you had this image of say a conch shell and listening

56
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,800
listening you know the way it seems like when you listen to a conch shell you hear the sound of the sea you

57
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:09,600
hear the sound of the ocean all of that you're like one year you're listening to all the

58
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,880
the sorrows all to all the i'm sorry both yours others

59
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:20,160
all of humanity's both yours both the

60
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:26,639
sense of personality in the um how personal these sorrows are the i'm

61
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:34,479
sorries are and also how universal the human condition how challenging it is

62
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,720
to be human we can't be perfect none of us we all make mistakes

63
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:46,960
all of us everyone ourselves others mistakes we've made for

64
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:53,680
ourselves we've let ourselves down we've let others down other people might have

65
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,520
let us down all these sorrows all these stories all these i'm sorry listening to

66
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:05,280
them through this conch shell with the ear of compassion

67
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:11,440
as if the buddha or the kuan yin so in this way

68
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,840
hearing the impersonality both the person the personhood

69
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:26,400
the particularities as well as the universalities not taking it so personally

70
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,319
ah the heart can relax the heart can relax when we realize that this is part

71
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,000
of the human condition these sorrows i'm sorry are part of the

72
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:43,360
human condition and can open up our heart

73
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,720
to compassion and care for ourselves for others

74
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:55,440
wherever it's needed it's the human condition after all

75
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:03,759
do we know a single person who's never been sorry who's never made a mistake

76
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,520
no oh of course not that's preposterous right what a silly question is she

77
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:15,680
asking of course but often we think we're the only person oh my goodness

78
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:22,240
i'm the only person ah or this

79
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:29,440
say if if there is a mistake somebody else has made oh it's it's just this

80
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,719
relationship that's entangled so so that is

81
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:39,760
that's the basis of the guided meditation i like to offer

82
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:48,240
tonight which is both recognizing the humanity the particularities as well

83
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:55,839
as the human condition in all the sorrows all the sorries

84
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:02,320
becoming sorrows deserving of compassion not shame

85
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,760
not finger-pointing wherever there is a sorrow

86
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:12,880
right answer is compassion self of compassion so

87
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,839
so i think i have said enough so [Music] i'd like to invite us into a guided

88

116
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:31,839

00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,480
it's like music oh this is this is part of the music of being human

163
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:08,159
it's not that heavy or morose

164
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:12,080
it's just part of being human

165
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,840
my voice added to so many listening to it

166
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:31,279
as if kuan yin the buddha was listening

167
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:40,799
taking heart taking heart that you too you're part of

168
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:46,720
this amazing mysterious ocean of humanity

169
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:54,480
you're not separate you are uniquely you

170
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,919
and yet so

171
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:07,679
human see if your heart and open can open

172
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:18,600
to holding to hearing this with kindness

173
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:35,360
maybe forgiveness if it's needed it's available

174
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:43,120
maybe sense of strength it's not just you

175
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:51,039
no need for shame or blame sense of power strength

176
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:57,480
in recognizing your rightful place

177
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:10,158
it's okay you're fully human

178
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:15,840
fully beautiful fully imperfect

179
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,080
it's okay

180
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:52,440
you're doing the best you can

181
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:04,158
and you've done the best you can given all the causes and conditions

182
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:10,720
of your unique humanity could have been any different it would

183
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:17,760
have been each breath

184
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,200
i think there'd be ease care

185
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:33,559
warm-heartedness for yourself this ocean of humanity

186
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:02,159
and now if you like you can stay with yourself for the rest of the time

187
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:05,600
if this being who is you

188
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:17,240
needs the most holding compassionate bearing witness today

189
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:29,360
for those of you who like to offer

190
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:34,960
some bearing witness someone else

191
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,080
in your life who recently might have offered you and i'm sorry

192
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,880
you can listen and follow [Music]

193
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,360
these suggestions invitations

194
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:57,039
to bring someone to mind

195
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,240
or maybe recently

196
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:08,720
offered i'm sorry in words or

197
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,840
in actions to you

198
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:26,200
again not going to the most difficult challenging person or situation

199
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:34,799
something a little lighter that is not going to unsettle you in this moment this is a

200
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:41,600
gradual practice easier later to more challenges don't

201
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:48,640
choose something easy let yourself sif again picking up the

202
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:53,840
conch shell listening to i'm sorry this expression

203
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:59,679
of sorrow [Music] sadness that they didn't live up

204
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:08,039
to their values who they want to be the care they have for you

205
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:13,919
the respect they have for themselves

206
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:24,960
as much as possible listening with the ears of compassion the ears of

207
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:34,080
kuan yin or the buddha this i'm sorry this expression of sorrow

208
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:38,720
both uniquely theirs offered to you

209
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:49,158
and one of the sounds in the ocean of humanity ocean sounds

210
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:09,559
we are not perfect we do our best we often fail

211
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:34,080
is it appropriate in this case especially if the person who's offered

212
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,000
the words i'm sorry has a lot of shame or guilt

213
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:47,840
especially to offering them this gift of hearing them out listening to them

214
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:55,279
with the ears of kuan yin the ears of compassionate being

215
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:01,639
especially if it's someone we care about

216
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:12,080
maybe in this way of hearing we offer it back to them it's a different way of being in the

217
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:18,880
world not with so much shame or blame but taking heart

218
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:28,960
and trying failing learning forgiving

219
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:32,600
and trying again

220
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,760
and for the last minutes of this practice period

221
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:08,960
picking the proverbial conch shell again and listening to all the i'm sorry

222
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,839
sorrows

223
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:21,520
yours included the sound of the ocean of humanity well as

224
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:26,319
the other person you thought about all of them

225
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,839
so many intentions expressions of goodness

226
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:42,878
imperfections imperfect causes and conditions

227
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:49,040
listening to it all as if kuan yin heart of compassion listening

228
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,638
to the cries of the world tenderness

229
00:34:54,639 --> 00:35:01,680
with appreciation sound of the oceans like this to be

230
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,800
human your joys also ten thousand joys ten

231
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:14,599
thousand sorrows it's like this being human

232
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:37,160
it's heartbreaking and it's beautiful at the same time

233
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:33,520
this kind of listening bearing witness can extend our capacity

234
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:41,839
capacity of our heart for ourselves for others for all beings

235
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:55,640
how mysterious and amazing to be human to hold witness

236
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,680
be conscious

237
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,520
contain infinitives infinitudes

238
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,520
more than we realize we are capable of

239
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,000
offering our ear our heart to the world to ourselves to

240
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,440
others as a gift

241
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,319
or kindness

242
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:53,839
our ah as much as available

243
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:01,040
may all beings everywhere including ourselves

244
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:07,839
know the goodness of their uniqueness and

245
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,680
that whatever they're going through is a part of being human part of being alive

246
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:19,800
conscious this mystery

247
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:27,960
may all beings everywhere wake up

248
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:39,760
their eyes opening up their ears opening up to beyond their little shell

249
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,280
of their own life to how magnificent it is to be

250
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:51,319
to be swimming to be a drop in the ocean of humanity

251
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:22,000
thank you all thank you for your practice for picking up the conch shells

252
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,480
listening to yourselves others

253
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:36,160

255
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,960
you can type in chat if it's just titled to me it'll be private

256
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,440
i won't read your name just your reflection if it's typed to everyone i'll read your name also

257
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:02,880
jamie please yeah um for some reason i i just got really

258
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,960
locked in to imagining

259
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,400
people in marginalized groups or who have experienced trauma who

260
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,359
have been conditioned um to feel sorry not for what they've done but for who they are

261
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:27,520
and um you know i felt anger but some of it was directed at the members of that

262
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:35,839
group you know it's like i wanted to say you matter but it i mean it felt like angry

263
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:41,040
i'm just wondering if you can comment on you know those those you know people in those

264
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:46,720
categories yeah

265
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,839
yeah thank you for sharing that thank you for what came up for you jamie um

266
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,400
something that i'm hearing actually here and what's come up is i would turn

267
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,520
i would turn the compassion first towards yourself because in what you're

268
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:14,480
describing you're the angry one right it's the projection of anger

269
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:20,560
it's it's it's an anger it is said that anger is like picking up

270
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:26,880
a hot coal right it's you're the one burning clearly here

271
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:34,000
so so that's the first thing to notice ouch there's there's suffering here ouch

272
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,119
they're suffering here um [Music] so when the mind gets

273
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:48,160
off kilter with anger in this way there isn't enough balance to offer the

274
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:53,359
listening year or even any support or the wise action what would be the wise

275
00:41:53,359 --> 00:42:00,160
action you would take in in the real situation not just in your meditation but but in the real

276
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:06,240
world if if you are having actual interactions and and what you're hearing which i'm

277
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,280
taking has inspired what came up in your meditation to actually take the

278
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,280
the appropriate steps the appropriate responses not being locked into this anger

279
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:25,040
yeah how does that land no thank you and um

280
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:32,000
you just helped me uh see where that came from actually it's you know i need a little upeka practice i think because

281
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:39,119
it's a someone who really matters to me who who falls into the sort of you know

282
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,800
has experienced some unfortunate things in her life and um

283
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,960
you know i took it on in a way where when she uh didn't change because i wanted her to

284
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,880
i was frustrated with her so it's i think that's a carryover but thank you starting with compassion

285
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:03,040
for myself always seems to help yeah brilliant i appreciate the light bulb

286
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:09,839
going off and and supporting the person because through your equanimity then you can actually through conversations and

287
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:15,359
you're listening ear and bearing witness and letting them see through the

288
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:21,200
reflection your mirror that them blaming themselves

289
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:28,319
is not the solution here so yeah so yeah there's more i can say

290
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:35,760
but i think that there's the you can support them more by bearing witness actually yeah great thank you for that

291
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:42,160
yeah any other reflections you can also type them in chat

292
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:46,559
either to me privately or to the whole group

293
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:59,440
done um thank you so much and um two things

294
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:06,560
came up and then when you said at one point you said uh this is it and um and it is

295
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,599
very evocative for me and it's like it's sort of motivating and uh in a way it's

296
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:17,200
like this is it and the other thing is um

297
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:23,839
uh i think myself and and no doubt others are often at war with ourselves

298
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:32,160
and um the and and there's and i'm sort of interested in thoughts on

299
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:38,480
uh a practice to and i'm sort of thinking okay i'll try to practice for six months

300
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,880
or a year or just sort of try to melt this a little bit

301
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:52,160
and um anyway there's no doubt different ways to do this and one book that comes to

302
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,520
mind um i think it's called good morning i love you and and the author of the book pretty

303
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:03,599
much said you know i didn't believe this at all and and it's sort of the sort of the

304
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:10,319
fake it until she made it kind of thing anyway i i'm interested in your thoughts over yeah

305
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:15,359
yeah yeah there's there's a lot in what you're you're saying don um

306
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:20,880
so it's it's the faking it until you become it that's the other thing i like

307
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,240
actually it's like until you actually become it you practice it and yes

308
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:33,680
definitely there is this um you know i i i think i've said that before that i um dedicated about a year

309
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:41,119
of my practice primary practice to be mental and compassion and it was a beautiful wonderful year

310
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:46,720
um and i do recommend that to people actually a certain amount of time

311
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,640
uh to just dedicate themselves to this practice and see the potential of it

312
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:58,319
um and yeah being locked into just so many different states to so many different

313
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:06,640
perspectives so so instead of you know you know it doesn't happen overnight but little by little by little by little so

314
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:12,079
so basically i'm offering encouragement if you feel called to do this absolutely

315
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:20,480
yeah definitely yeah daily yeah in daily life and in sitting practice yeah thank you

316
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:26,160
so let's see uh

317
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:32,480
one request from one of the members if folks want to walk around and otherwise move around a lot maybe they could turn

00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:25,960
that you know i can have compassion for someone's i'm sorry

346
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:32,559
but there's also the case of um the story not being the kind of story

347
00:57:32,559 --> 00:57:39,119
that is a transformative kind of sorry but uh

348
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:45,599
a quick way to um try to eliminate the problem they have caused

yeah i hear you i knew that was i know that was going to come up when i was giving the instructions so i was trying to yeah let me say something very quick

350
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:58,000
about that so so it's it's really the difference between an authentic and inauthentic sorry that you're bringing

351
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:03,520
up and i was trying to be careful in the guided meditation to say we're not talking about the inauthentic ones like

352
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:10,400
well i'm sorry like that's that wasn't a part of this guided meditation but i completely it was more about the blame

353
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:16,559
and shame that some people have like i'm so sorry i really messed up that's what this was about yeah so thank you for
