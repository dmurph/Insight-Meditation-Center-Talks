1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,880
good evening good evening because there aren't so many do you guys

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:12,240
want to come a little bit closer instead of like being you know the you can move wherever you want but just you know

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,400
maybe bring a chair in a little bit closer

4
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:33,619
and actually it's better if you're not on top of this blue line right here so you can be on either side of it yeah

5
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,539
and then maybe I'll begin by apologizing by about last week maybe some of you on

6
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:56,520
YouTube or some of you here I am I had to cancel at the last minute I had laryngitis and I'm hoping that my

7
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,920
voice holds up it's recently I still have it here a little

8
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:06,960
bit a week later so apologies for last minute having to

9
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,780
cancel on Monday last Monday

10
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,460
so today I'd like to continue on this theme that I've been doing talking about

11
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:27,240
like what is the Dharma like we have this expression you know the Dharma and

12
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:35,460
I think we all have a sense of what it is but been poking around a little bit and what does the Buddha say explicitly

13
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,619
when he says like you know this is the Dharma or I'm gonna Proclaim that our

14
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:46,759
mind it's um you know it's this

15
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,920
and I have been looking at this like on some other earlier talks through stories

16
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:58,500
I've been done the story I read to Paula that was a few weeks ago when the story

17
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:05,579
of kisakotami talking about the Dharma and tonight I had intended to use this

18
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:12,540
other story but I was really working with this story

19
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:18,739
I kind of like you know this story really doesn't make any sense

20
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:24,360
so I think I'm going to like abbreviate a part of it and really emphasize the

21
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:31,560
part where the Buddha is talking about the Dharma I'll abbreviate the part of like how it gets that this person is

22
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:38,580
asking and part of the reason why I feel okay about doing this is because this story

23
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:46,379
is from the last section of the pariah navaga this is a part of this who does

24
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:54,060
that Scholars think that is like the oldest part of the Buddhist literature

25
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:01,080
and for some people this is really meaningful because if it's oldest that means it's the closest to the time of

26
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,599
the Buddha not everybody thinks it's that meaningful but some people do

27
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:13,080
and then maybe I'll just say why they think it's the oldest is because elsewhere in the Polly Canon they talk

28
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:20,400
about the what's said in the part of August sometimes the Buddha asks I think he asks Ananda hey do you know about

29
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,819
this verse that's in the Para Pariah navaga so he's or he asks sorry

30
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:32,040
he asks different people so we know it's old because

31
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:38,760
referred to then but there's a

32
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:46,980
there's a part of this story that comes at the beginning but that's a completely different flavor

33
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:52,440
that Paulie's a little bit different and everybody thinks oh this is its own

34
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,799
little Standalone story that got tacked on on the beginning and that's the part that I think I'll abbreviate here a

35
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:04,739
little bit but one thing that's interesting and why

36
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:10,439
I kind of like chose to do this uh this uh oh Pariah navago but I'll

37
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:16,199
translate it um chapter on the way to the Beyond

38
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:23,340
so we've like how do you get there somewhere else other than here

39
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:28,400
the Beyond being kind of like you know nabana complete freedom

40
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,660
so I'm gonna I'll talk about this and I'll say a little bit that this is my own rendition I've done a little bit of

41
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,960
tweaking looking at the pulley looking at it with different translators have done as well as wanting to make it

42
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:50,180
accessible so

43
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,479
maybe I'll um I'll just say it starts with this first part is there is a

44
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,759
Brahman who you know at the earlier time at the time of the Buddha the dominant

45
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:09,960
religious tradition was the brahmanas can think of it as like proto-hinduism

46
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:17,280
and they had a real emphasis on rituals like you could please the Gods

47
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,919
by doing rituals and if things weren't going your way it's because either you hadn't done the

48
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:30,300
right rituals or you there was a mistake in them and the rituals were done by the

49
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:35,460
brahmanas like the Priestly cast so people would ask you know the priests to

50
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:42,539
do rituals for something and then the Buddha comes along and it's really something very different than

51
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:49,979
rituals you know just this belief that certain movements or certain words are

52
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:55,259
what's needed to make the world go correctly or

53
00:05:55,259 --> 00:06:01,160
and suffering or something like that so really different emphasis

54
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:09,900
and so there's this uh one problem and his name is bavari and he has a uh I'd

55
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:18,020
say it's like a Hermitage and he um wants to do a ritual

56
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:25,259
and it's uh and he spends all his money to do this ritual

57
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:31,919
but it's uh I don't know all the details of like what's required but you know like everything he has he puts towards

58
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,960
this maybe he's believing that then you know his life is going to go okay

59
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:47,039
so after he does this he goes back to uh this Hermitage and there's this other person that shows up there that looks a

60
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:52,319
little unkept and they talk about how his feet are

61
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:00,720
dirty and messed up in his hair is dirty messed up in his teeth and uh bavari says uh

62
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:07,380
though something like this and uh and this visiting he doesn't ever

63
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:13,620
um he's never given a name um

64
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:21,139
so he approaches the Barbary and he says give me 500 coins

65
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:28,680
this is kind of the way he uh he introduces or asks himself and Bobby says I can't I don't have anything I

66
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:36,960
just gave it all to this sacrifice and this visiting Brahman says well

67
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:42,419
either you give me these 500 coins or I'm going to place this curse on you

68
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:49,800
that in seven days your head will split open so maybe right this is part of the

69
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:56,759
bramonical thinking I'm not sure and then the visiting brahmana leaves

70
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:03,720
and Barbary is very worried he's afraid like maybe my head's gonna split open maybe there's some truth to

71
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:11,220
this and then um this is a story right so we don't have

72
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:17,220
to take this literally but maybe we can I don't know but a Deva which is a

73
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:25,259
disembodied entity and a reminder Javas are just like humans in the sense that they are not

74
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:30,840
free they're not in they don't have a like if they don't have they're not

75
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,839
awakened hmm so that's what Deva

76
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:41,479
comes to bavari and says um

77
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:50,640
and now I forget exactly what he says that um so this benevolent

78
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:57,360
um Deva shows up and says oh and tells Barbary you know that uh that visitor is

79
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:04,500
actually a charlatan and actually he doesn't really know anything about heads and head splitting

80
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,980
but before he's still worried so he asks well if he doesn't know about

81
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:16,740
head splitting we'll maybe you do you do so he asked the devil what it's about head splitting

82
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:22,440
David says I don't know either Bobby says well who knows about head

83
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:31,019
splitting Pottery is really nervous and anxious about this and the Davis as well

84
00:09:31,019 --> 00:09:34,459
there's this person

85
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,660
they call him the Buddha and he's way on this other part of India

86
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:50,519
and Bobby says you know I'm too old I can't travel there but I have these students I'll send them

87
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,680
so he sends 16 of his students to go

88
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,260
us to find the Buddha and ask about head splitting

89
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,300
so these students have followers of their own so this whole Entourage goes

90
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:13,560
all the way across India and I get to that Buddha they check to make sure is

91
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,200
he really the awakened one and they have these little tests that I won't go into

92
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,380
and keep a Buddha pass through the test so then the most senior of the students

93
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:33,800
asks the Buddha about head splitting and it goes like this

94
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:41,399
so agita who is the lead student says to the Buddha

95
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:47,339
Avery asks about the head and the splitting of the head

96
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:53,100
explain this blessed one and remove our doubt

97
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,320
and then the Buddha says ignorance

98
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:05,339
is the head and non-ignorance when combined with faith mindfulness

99
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:12,740
concentration zest and energy is the splitting of the head

100
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:20,820
thereupon the brahmana student uplifted by great exhilaration arranged

101
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:28,380
his cloak over one shoulder fell with his head at the Buddhist feet and bows and says the Brahman bavari together

102
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:37,100
with his students exultant and mine joyful worships your feet a one with vision

103
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,779
okay so this is a story so the Buddha just says one sentence and

104
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:48,120
all this exaltation and stuff but this is the way that I'm holding it

105
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:54,720
is that they were ritualists they were used to this idea that you have to like

106
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,940
appease the gods and you have to behave perfectly you know to do these rituals

107
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:06,660
but instead to realize oh no no this is about like the head and splitting the

108
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:12,360
head what's really important is actually about what one does

109
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:19,680
in terms of practice mindfulness Faith concentration zest and energy we

110
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:25,579
hear all about all these things and and the Buddhist practice so

111
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:30,839
Ajit ajita and is very excited and says

112
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,839
thank you and Bows to the Buddha and I'll confess it's not clear to me

113
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:42,060
why the head is ignorance and non-ignorances the splitting of the head

114
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:47,279
we could say splitting of the head is like having an open mind

115
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:54,740
but I think that would be more like a modern interpretation I'm not sure that they had that back then

116
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,079
but we could say well then this curse definitely came true because they had

117
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:08,060
some uh some knowledge so their heads got split open

118
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:14,459
okay so that's like the preamble to the story and maybe it sets the tone a

119
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:21,000
little bit about what happens next so the Buddha says well

120
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,120
I'm glad I answered your question but uh all of you all 16 of you you're welcome

121
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:33,480
to answer ask me any question you like and I'll answer it this makes sense in

122
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,519
the sense of if it's about knowledge and uh

123
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:43,680
non-ignorance so you know he's the Buddha is asking them

124
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:51,540
okay you can ask me whatever you like so one of the students metagu

125
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:58,260
goes up to the Buddha and asks him metagu we can translate his name as master of Mehta so somebody who has a

126
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:04,860
lot of loving kindness friend and he goes up to the Buddha and he says

127
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:10,860
I ask you o blessed one for I think you are a knowledge master and well

128
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,279
cultivated tell me this

129
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:24,120
from where has all this duka and it's countless forces in the world

130
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:33,740
and it's countless forms in the world where has all this Duca come from

131
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:40,079
I think this is a great question like where like you know Duke probably

132
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:47,180
you guys know right it's this uh represents this big range of experiences from just a mild

133
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:52,860
irritation or the sense of things not being right to just horrifying

134
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:59,579
terrifying pain so Duca has this wide range often translated as suffering but

135
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:06,660
maybe even like stress or unsatisfactory or you know really painful

136
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:12,620
so where has all this pain come from

137
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:23,339
and the Buddha answers of duka you ask me the origin maybe I

138
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:30,540
should say that this is all in verse of Duca you ask me the origin as one who

139
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:36,240
understands I will tell you dependent on

140
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:42,540
appropriation this Duca and its countless forms in the

141
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:48,180
world has sprung appropriation

142
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:54,959
like we don't hear this word as much it's this idea that it's a translation

143
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:02,699
of the word upadi and I like this word appropriation because it it has this uh

144
00:16:02,699 --> 00:16:08,459
uppity has his two related means like what's causing what's the origin of suffering

145
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:14,760
it's like this uh our Acquisitions our belongings our possessions we might save

146
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:20,760
in like our baggage that's one form of upity and the second

147
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:26,699
form is the attachment to these Acquisitions this inner sense of

148
00:16:26,699 --> 00:16:32,399
ownership so the Buddha is saying Appropriations

149
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:41,399
are a source of Duca the sense of acquiring things and making them mine

150
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:49,199
this attachment to them and wanting to get and and not only objects but

151
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:54,420
creating an identity like I'm the one that has this

152
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:01,220
even if it's not a exact object as we could even say I'm the one who doesn't

153
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:07,140
meditate well or I'm the one that meditates great look at me

154
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:14,520
like appropriating the meditation experience and making it mine and making an identity out of it

155
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:22,020
or even the like I'm the one that needs to get it together or I'm the one that's stressed or whatever we take as

156
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:28,459
something that too defines us as a part of our identity

157
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:36,000
or even it can be like this sense of ownership of like this is my meditation period why is everybody else making

158
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:41,700
noise don't they know that uh this is a precious time and I'm trying

159
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:48,360
to concentrate and get settled and you can notice on all these things

160
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:55,500
that I'm describing that there's a sense of me versus the world

161
00:17:55,500 --> 00:18:01,679
or US versus them there's this real sense of you know when there's a strong sense of identity there's a real strong

162
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:10,440
separation and then when there's that there has to be all this like protection or maybe we have to protect this me that

163
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,940
gets created or we have to bolster it up make sure it looks good for everybody

164
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:23,880
so Ubuntu is like both the things one owns

165
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,059
and this internal claim of ownership

166
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:36,720
and one way that I like to think about this is that if we just modify the language

167
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:45,299
the language that we use for ourselves and that language is clunky we probably wouldn't do this in regular life or

168
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:51,600
conversation but it's a way to help kind of understand this point

169
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,820
we could say feeling frustrated with meditation has

170
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,980
arisen we wouldn't say that but

171
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:08,700
feeling frustrated with meditation has arisen has a different flavor that I'm

172
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:14,580
frustrated you can feel like I'm frustrated like it defines me and like there's nothing else

173
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:21,380
happening it's just this so to like turn the language around like

174
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:26,820
feeling lost is happening so like I'm lost and I'm the one that

175
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:33,299
has to get it together it's like feeling lost is happening it just kind of reminds us that these

176
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:40,320
things arise and pass away there not always there and they don't Define us they're

177
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,000
just experiences that we're having

178
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,200
so the Buddha says you asked me the origin as one who understands I will

179
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,419
tell you dependent on appropriation

180
00:19:57,419 --> 00:20:02,900
this Duca and its countless forms in the world has sprung

181
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:08,160
an ignorant person so this is getting back to like head splitted and headed

182
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:14,820
stuff an ignorant person a knowingly appropriates and again and again

183
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:21,860
encounters dukkha one who understands does not appropriate

184
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:27,740
seeing it as the Genesis and origin of dukkha so

185
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:33,679
recognizing that like accumulating whether it's objects

186
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,600
or identification leads to suffering

187
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,640
leads to Duca and maybe the suffering is really subtle

188
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,059
but there's a way in which this uh it's like it's the opposite of

189
00:20:51,059 --> 00:21:00,320
like letting go it's the opposite of having Freedom it's more this like pulling towards and getting stuck

190
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:08,340
so then uh metagu he responds what I asked you've explained so he

191
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:15,380
feels very happy but I ask you another question please tell me

192
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:22,200
how do the wise cross the flood of rebirth old age sorrow and

193
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:27,900
lamentation please Sage answer me clearly for truly you are one who has

194
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:36,860
discovered the Dharma how do the wise cross the flood

195
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:43,740
so maybe metagu is like okay you talked about the origin of dukkha but how do I

196
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:50,280
like not have duka how did the wise cross the flood

197
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:55,860
and if we think about ancient India right which has Monsoon seasons in the

198
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:02,520
and in the plane of the Ganges where a lot of the Buddha's teachings was this idea of crossing the flood was a real

199
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:09,960
concern right there's times of the year when you simply could not get from one location to another you had to wait for

200
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,720
the waters to subside probably many of you have heard this too

201
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,600
that there's this well-known simile where the Buddha talks about crossing

202
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,240
the flood getting from here this Shore where there's dukkha

203
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:34,200
to the other Shore which is Awakening and then how do you get there is with a

204
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,299
raft and the Dharma is the raft and in this

205
00:22:39,299 --> 00:22:46,799
teaching this other assembly the Buddha says and just in the same way that you take the raft across the water you get

206
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:52,158
to the other Shore the way to the Beyond we might say

207
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:59,460
and then you're like all happy that the raft brought you there but you don't like pick up the raft put it on your

208
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:05,280
head and start walking with it once you're on the other Shore no you leave it

209
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:11,760
it was helpful to get over the shore but it's not helpful when you're already on land

210
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,580
to the Buddha is pointing to we don't even grab or hold on to the Dharma the

211
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:23,220
raft so

212
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:27,740
the Buddha continues so he says

213
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:35,039
um the meticu has asked how do the wise cross the flood and then the Buddha

214
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:43,020
answers this question I shall proclaim the Dharma to you

215
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:50,520
seen in this very life not involving hearsay

216
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:58,820
knowing which one may fairing mindfully cross over entanglement with the world

217
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:08,159
I appreciate that that Buddha is saying I proclaim the Dharma that is seen in this very life not on hearsay so he's

218
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:14,039
not giving metaphysical claims he's not saying oh you just have to believe stuff

219
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:22,799
you say no this is something that you can experience right now this is something that you everybody can

220
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:29,400
see in this life in this whatever life it is that you have now we don't have to depend on you know

221
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:35,280
somebody that told somebody that once knew something like no you can see this for yourself

222
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:39,919
I'm going to proclaim the Dharma that you can see

223
00:24:42,419 --> 00:24:50,840
knowing which one may fairing mindfully cross over entanglement with the world

224
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,539
I like this word entanglement like it's this is a translation the word

225
00:24:56,539 --> 00:25:02,520
facetica just not a common word we don't see so much

226
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:09,419
and it's um related to like being interlaced with or

227
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:15,600
somehow complicated or uh when we're in Tangles like something

228
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:22,620
that's impeding us from where we want to go it's opposite of being you know

229
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:28,080
disentangled so this disentanglement is another way

230
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:33,299
of talking about not appropriating like not making things

231
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:38,640
mine as a way of getting when we make things mine is the way we

232
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:45,179
get tangled up with them so we're not saying we have to get rid of everything we're not saying we can't

233
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:50,340
have both objects and that we can't have um identities

234
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:55,860
what's being pointed to is not getting tangled up in them

235
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:03,120
in a way that there's no freedom the Buddha is not saying you know don't

236
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:09,419
own anything or don't get involved with the world but just notice

237
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:16,380
how you are with the world is there a way that you can pick up and

238
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:24,539
engage with what's needed to be engaged with play work love

239
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:30,779
discipline you know all these types of things and then put them down when they're not

240
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:36,960
needed or when it's not appropriate come up when it's needed appropriate and

241
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,480
put them down sometimes we get entangled and we just can't put up our pick down we're just

242
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:49,620
like stuck maybe some ways entangled I kind of often imagining like a spider web or you

243
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:53,840
know something like this something sticky that's

244
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:03,299
I shall proclaim the Dharma to you seen in this very life

245
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:09,419
not involving hearsay knowing which one may very mindfully

246
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:16,380
cross over entanglement with the world so here's the Dharma that he's going to

247
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:24,899
give expel relishing and dogmatism

248
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:31,200
regarding everything you are aware of above below all around between

249
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:36,679
and Consciousness should not take a stance in becoming

250
00:27:36,679 --> 00:27:42,960
expel relishing and dogmatism so again this is kind of an unpacking

251
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:48,600
what is this entanglement mean dogmatism right we can imagine as this

252
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:55,039
side like you know again this real distinct sense of me I'm right

253
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:00,419
and you're wrong we are right they are wrong

254
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:07,740
this kind of you know this fundamentalism this tendency to like just lay down these principles of just

255
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:14,159
you know this is incontrovertibly true this is just the way it is

256
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:21,720
and it's Associated dogmatism of course it's associated with intolerance and arrogance and in some ways we might even

257
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:27,600
say it's a certain amount of stuckness entanglement

258
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:32,760
and then this relishing way to expel relishing I think relishing in this way

259
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:39,840
is just uh this way of like taking too much

260
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:46,679
pleasure in maybe there's a sense of gluttony or just rolling around in it in a way

261
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:52,559
that's not helpful to be sure pleasure is a part of our

262
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:57,720
life and as part of the path and joy is but there's a way that we could just get

263
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,059
entangled and be pursuing you know pleasure after pleasure after pleasure and our whole life we're just all

264
00:29:03,059 --> 00:29:09,919
tangled up with this and certainly addictions right or a sense of entanglement

265
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:18,059
spell relishing and dogmatism regarding everything you are aware of

266
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:24,779
above below all around between and then this last sentence Consciousness should

267
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:28,940
not take a stance in becoming

268
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:36,539
so I'm using tan Jeff's translation here because the pulley is a little bit weird but we could

269
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:44,220
relate this idea of becoming with this idea of me or Society of selfie and me

270
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:51,840
when there's a me that gets related to there's a sense of mine so we can see how all these ideas are

271
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,059
getting related that it's a way in which we

272
00:29:57,059 --> 00:30:04,620
like Consciousness not taking a stance in becoming like not making like here

273
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:10,260
there's a me here I'm going to become this identity the one that has problems

274
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:17,059
the one that has to meditate the one then whatever it is you could there

275
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,520
so maybe instead of this becoming this me

276
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:29,880
what's being pointed to is like to what is our

277
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:36,840
visceral embodied experience

278
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:47,279
like what's actually happening in without we having this conceptual

279
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:53,880
idea or conceptual analysis or not a theoretical or abstraction but what's

280
00:30:53,880 --> 00:31:01,220
being experienced sounds

281
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:08,700
movement in the body as it breathes maybe there's a sense of tightness or

282
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:15,740
openness be the activity of thinking

283
00:31:15,779 --> 00:31:23,840
maybe a little bit of discomfort in the body like trying to simplify here

284
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:32,159
and it turns out that our life can unfold in a way that works fine if we

285
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:37,860
stay with this Simplicity of our experience when problems need to be

286
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:45,240
solved the mind just naturally comes together and works on them and then puts them down when they're no

287
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:52,200
longer needed so this instead of getting entangled or

288
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:59,778
making things more complicated what's being pointed to is you know just keeping it simple

289
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:06,240
not being as simple 10 necessarily but recognizing that what our senses are

290
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:13,880
telling us to stay there rather than always being in the head or in the mind

291
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:22,200
so the Buddha continues with this and he's saying a person dwelling thus

292
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,899
mindful heedful having given up taking things as mine

293
00:32:27,899 --> 00:32:35,899
right here such a wise one abandons dukkha

294
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:43,020
abandoned Stuka birth old age sorrow and lamentation sometimes duka gets a

295
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:50,520
translated that way and then upon hearing the semeticus

296
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:57,960
says I rejoice in the words of Gautama the great Sierra well proclaimed was the

297
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,960
teaching of not appropriating clearly you the blessed one have

298
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:09,120
abandoned duka and this Dharma is known to you

299
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,000
and surely those you regularly teach could also abandon duka

300
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,720
therefore having met you I bow To You O spiritual Giant

301
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:26,880
perhaps the blessed one may regularly teach me

302
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:35,299
so he asks to become a student and then later in another setting we learned that he becomes awakened

303
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:42,480
so I I appreciate this uh teaching that you know we hear and other

304
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:50,700
settings about how that what is like the source of dukkha

305
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:56,220
often it's said like you know tanha is like you know clinging or craving but

306
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:02,039
this is pointing to another way like what clinging is

307
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:08,700
associated with or maybe it fleshes out what is this idea of clinging it's a big

308
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:14,580
part of it which goes under the radar result is definitely more subtle

309
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:20,820
but working with the clinging of that's creating an identity yes it is subtle

310
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:26,520
but it's really worth so much duka is

311
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:31,560
and the Buddha is really powerful like pointing to these powerful teachings

312
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:37,800
that the ending of dukkha I mean that's like quite something to

313
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,359
think about that this is possible

314
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:51,419
and it's just about our relationship to our experiences and what we're having

315
00:34:51,419 --> 00:34:56,520
in the world are we grabbing on to them appropriating them are we getting

316
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:03,119
entangled with them or are we allowing them to arise and pass away as they do

317
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,940
are we allowing the experiences to come and go as they do without like

318
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,760
placing some big conceptual framework on top of them because this experience that

319
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:21,420
happened it means X Y or Z and everything else is wrong

320
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:26,760
instead it could be well because this experience is there I'm thinking my

321
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:34,200
current understanding is that it's x y and z it makes sense to me that it's x y and z

322
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,140
I wonder if it is X Y and Z it seems like it might be X Y and Z you can see

323
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:46,560
how that's very different and then saying it is X Y and Z and then we're kind of saying I'm the one that knows

324
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:51,800
it's X Y and Z and then we've like set up all these barriers and uh

325
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:59,220
separation and that have to be defended and upheld and

326
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:06,260
propagated and there's all these subtle ways in which Duca shows up

327
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:14,240
so that is the story of metagu talking to the Buddha

328
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:22,380
and he was there talking to the Buddha because bavari was afraid that his head was gonna get split open and so he sent

329
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:27,259
some of his students including metagu

330
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:36,000
I'll end there and open it up if there are any questions or comments

331
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,780
thank you

332
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:09,440
okay oh I spoke too soon

333
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:18,000
so so what is the Dharma so this is so that he is saying here

334
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:24,420
right it's about not getting entangled right and what are how many ways we get

335
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:29,820
entangled right it's countless ways that's the countless ways that uh duka

336
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,300
shows up

337
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,460
we have a very large

338
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:49,940
go to hundreds many hundreds of dark talks thousands I would say thousands

339
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:59,060
virtual real let's use a different microphone

340
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:09,540
maybe um you know there's this big quite public candidate and teachers give lots of

341
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:15,119
Dharma talks but because there's many ways that our minds

342
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:22,338
getting tangled I would say I would say what would you say Bill

343
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:34,320
I'm not going to say it because just lately I've been wondering what is the Dharma I

344
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,359
mean I'm right I'm rethinking a lot I like that question I asked a few

345
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,599
weeks ago you know what's and uh and and it's also

346
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:51,380
it's hard to remember all this suit is I've read

347
00:38:52,320 --> 00:39:01,020
I read I listen to the expositions in our in our groups pay attention I don't you know write

348
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:07,320
down key points I try to to internalize all this but there's a

349
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,280
lot to remember so

350
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:18,720
I like that's part of what seems to he's saying the Dharma that is seen here and

351
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,300
now and it's not hearsay so he's really pointing to experience and I've kind of

352
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:29,579
getting entangled is more like an experience right it's not

353
00:39:29,579 --> 00:39:36,420
um it's not just wisdom you know sayings that we've heard there's a way in which

354
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:42,300
we feel or as I'm saying saying entangled leads to dukkha is saying that

355
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:49,740
uh there's a way in which sometimes we feel stuck a little bit or we don't feel free or open

356
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:55,980
and what you said a few weeks ago when I asked the question was well guilt's been teaching

357
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:01,859
present experience so it's like a theme when we were going

358
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:09,060
through the Mantra matakaya right we were kept on pointing to the importance of experience as opposed to philosophy

359
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:14,820
and the Buddha in this in early bosom is definitely about one's experience it's

360
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:22,020
not a metaphysicist so I I guess what I've been the conclusion I've come to after many years is that well the darn

361
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:27,960
what the Buddhist teaching basically was understanding suffering and the source

362
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,480
of suffering and release from suffering in

363
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:39,540
maybe some course teachings maybe some subtle teachings um

364
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:48,060
and maybe how we get entangled is the same as that but I'm anyway I'm still

365
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:54,960
turning it over in my mind nice nice I love it I love it that you're still targeted it over that's perfect

366
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,920
and and can you tell us where to find this suda yeah yeah it's a

367
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:07,800
in the suit and apata yes which is in the Cayenne

368
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:13,880
yes and it's the last chapter of this

369
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:22,680
five four metaku the questions of metagu it's not

370
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:29,940
in the book of eights it's after the book The Book of eights is the fourth the sutinapata is Big the book of eights

371
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:34,980
is the fourth chapter we could say the Pariah navaga is the fifth chapter it's

372
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:39,980
after the book of eights I can find it now thank you very much

373
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:48,920
yeah another yes

374
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,320
um I guess earlier I heard you talk about fundamental kind of thinking and whatnot I was thinking to myself like

375
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:01,859
would we ever be able to all be on the same team or something like that and I thought probably no impossible

376
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:07,260
um it made me think of a philosopher I forget who it was but he pretty much talked about our past experiences kind

377
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:13,920
of inter influence the way we interpret stimuli and things coming in in life and so I was just thinking we all are headed

378
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,339
in different directions or have different experiences and interpret things differently and as we go through life you know something that may have

379
00:42:20,339 --> 00:42:25,740
been important at one point May totally be you know foreign later on in Life or

380
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:31,859
vice versa or whatnot but it was interesting to hear you talk about fundamental kind of thinking or interpretation and whatnot

381
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:37,440
yeah and I think what's been important too is this idea of like holding on and like this is the truth and everything

382
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:42,960
else is wrong kind of that that there's different saying this makes sense to me

383
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,420
it's that second step and everything else is wrong that it gets us into trouble because I think you're right all

384
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:54,000
of us of course we're not going to have the same understandings at the same time but it's the way that we make other

385
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,660
people's or other ideas wrong I guess is the what's being pointed to you here

386
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:05,660
dogmatism fundamentalism yeah thank you

387
00:43:09,859 --> 00:43:15,060
so during during part of that discussion you mentioned specifically

388
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:21,300
getting entangled with objects meaning both physical objects but also mental

389
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:27,060
constructions and I think that you implied and maybe you said directly

390
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:32,760
the sign that this is happening the entanglement is is an i statement I me

391
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,819
or mine is the beginning and so if you will this is the

392
00:43:38,819 --> 00:43:45,660
the signpost that you're heading into entanglement I guess that's also

393
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:51,839
the signpost the other direction which is the non-self to not being entangled

394
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,060
means not being tied up with I Me Mine

395
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:03,420
exactly that's pretty much the the Nugget there yep yep yep that

396
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:11,160
entanglement and selfing and Duca right these are almost we could even say are synonyms yeah then the cell phone shows

397
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:18,540
up when we're of course we use I mean mine in language it would be really awkward and odd if we didn't but uh just

398
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:23,760
with we could use that language without creating this entity that's separate and

399
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:29,180
distinct and everything else thank you

400
00:44:31,260 --> 00:44:38,579
okay so we're at the or did you want to say something quickly no no Jim I thought somehow you did okay so thank

401
00:44:38,579 --> 00:44:43,740
you all uh for your attention and I wish you all a wonderful rest of the evening

402
00:44:43,740 --> 00:44:49,940
and a happy and safe Fourth of July tomorrow thank you

403
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:58,160
and if you'd like you're welcome to come up and talk to me now afterwards
