1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:04,480
so

2
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,240
warm greetings to all of you as i begin

3
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,880
this talk

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,880
there is a renowned verse

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,920
from the dhammapada

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,039
ancient anthology of buddhist poetry

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,920
verse and it goes something like this

8
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,199
hate

9
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,640
is not overcome by hate

10
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,320
but by love alone is hate overcome

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,840
this is an ancient truth

12
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,680
so hate is not overcome by hate

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,760
by love alone is it overcome

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,000
and it's possible that translating the

15
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,879
ancient world

16
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:00,800
word is love doesn't really capture the

17
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,680
full richness of this verse and i'll

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:06,240
talk about that a little later

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,360
but i want to evoke this very

20
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,119
you know well-known verse

21
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,640
that it's really a central idea

22
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,040
in buddhism that we cannot

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,840
pacify hate by adding more hate to the

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,520
fire

25
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,880
hate is considered to be a

26
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,360
fire

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,880
that burns the one who's hating that

28
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,799
harms the one who's hating

29
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,159
so to respond to hate with hate

30
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:47,680
means that there's two people now

31
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:49,680
who are burning and suffering who are

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,560
wounding each other

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,360
wounding themselves both

34
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,240
and this is such an important topic in

35
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,719
the climate of

36
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:06,399
the world really i don't know if there's

37
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:09,440
more or less hatred in the world

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,959
than there's ever been before

39
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,160
but we're certainly becoming

40
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,319
acutely aware of it here in the united

41
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,800
states

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,840
and perhaps

43
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:28,160
perhaps we're coming into an era of this

44
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,680
country

45
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,400
where there is the possibility of

46
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,400
beginning to recognize

47
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,040
the tremendous harm that hate has

48
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,519
that maybe it was difficult to see

49
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,800
before when

50
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,400
the hate was expressed

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,000
with you know so

52
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,599
you know violently that people are

53
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,800
mostly spending their time

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,440
protecting themselves from lynching and

55
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,200
riots and all kinds of things

56
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,319
and hate was certainly present back then

57
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:12,640
but maybe it was not what was being

58
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,800
addressed directly

59
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,879
but now we come to a time where there's

60
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,280
a real heightened sensitivity to

61
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,840
what hatred looks like how hatred speaks

62
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,360
how it spreads as a kind of poison to

63
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,280
our society

64
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,360
and i speak about this because of in the

65
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,840
wake of the

66
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,239
the rising hate crime against asian

67
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,879
americans

68
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,959
here in california just a month ago

69
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,920
there was a arson and

70
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,720
vandalism of a buddhist asian buddhist

71
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,280
temple

72
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,519
in in los angeles

73
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,280
a japanese buddhist temple the pure land

74
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,640
tradition of buddhism

75
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,120
a very peaceful peace-loving of buddhism

76
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,599
and and the temple was partly destroyed

77
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,760
not dramatically but enough to be quite

78
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,920
disturbing

79
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,159
and

80
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,880
and you know these are this is a

81
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,840
tradition of buddhism where uh it's been

82
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,960
in this country for well over 100 years

83
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,840
it's possible that membership of their

84
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,120
temple has or at least of that form of

85
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,639
buddhism

86
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,000
their members have been here in the

87
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,639
united states for

88
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,360
six seven it's possible even eight

89
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,919
generations by now

90
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,479
and and to

91
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,800
be the recipients of hate as if they

92
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,600
don't

93
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:52,960
belong in this country is quite painful

94
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,720
for all of us

95
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,960
in this family that we hope to be and in

96
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:59,600
this country

97
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,520
and so in some of these images we've

98
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,800
seen of

99
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,960
elderly asian americans being attacked

100
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,840
on streets

101
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,280
right here in san francisco as one of

102
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,960
them

103
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,440
and it's not like over there that this

104
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,199
kind of violence happens but it's

105
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,960
close in and it's uh

106
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,600
it didn't start then but it certainly

107
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,639
raised people's

108
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,440
worry a year ago when there started to

109
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,560
be

110
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,840
hateful things said to people of asian

111
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,759
descent especially chinese descent here

112
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:32,479
and locally in the peninsula

113
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:38,000
because of the coronavirus

114
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,880
and somehow

115
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,199
spreading of animosity towards people of

116
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,160
any kind of

117
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,680
asian descent because of a virus

118
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:54,639
like this so there's ease in which uh

119
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,160
sometimes people hate this

120
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,000
part of the issue here in this country

121
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,440
and and certainly there's a need to

122
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,720
stand in solidarity with the people who

123
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,880
are the recipients of hate and

124
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,960
certainly to send solidarity with the

125
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
asian americans who are

126
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,800
struggling with this and with fear and

127
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,720
worry and

128
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,880
about what it means to be out in public

129
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,000
even or

130
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,560
not in public at night and we know

131
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,039
what's coming

132
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,440
and um and to offer our protection and

133
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,479
to create places of sanctuary where

134
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,880
it feels safe to come and not just

135
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,400
welcome to come but

136
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,840
feeling like it's home like they belong

137
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,919
and it's a little bit hard here at imc

138
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:45,680
to be maybe teaching here

139
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,039
all alone these

140
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,680
this last year but you know it's i want

141
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,039
this place to be a home

142
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,680
for all people and for everyone to come

143
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,479
here to feel like they belong and

144
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:00,880
even not just welcome not just belonging

145
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:01,599
but

146
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,840
feel like it's their place where they

147
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,759
can really

148
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,080
engage fully and bring themselves

149
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,960
completely here

150
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:16,080
so um

151
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,360
you know certainly i'm concerned for the

152
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,840
membership of imc that are asian

153
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,840
american the membership of imc

154
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,440
that are black and all the people who

155
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,000
are been

156
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,639
the recipients of hate crimes here in

157
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,960
the united states

158
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,960
the word hate crime is an interesting

159
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,240
term

160
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,720
because the definition of hate in this

161
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,840
regard

162
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,440
is different very certainly very

163
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,800
different than some of the other

164
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,240
meanings of hate and

165
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,440
that we use we use the word hate uh when

166
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,360
people say that

167
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:52,800
you know they hate spinach it's uh

168
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,199
it's a very different connotations very

169
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,319
different

170
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:59,199
meaning of the word that when we say we

171
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,240
hate

172
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,960
an ethnic group or we hate one of the

173
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,720
you know i think i think the the highest

174
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
number of hate crimes in the united

175
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,520
states is

176
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,440
against african-americans and

177
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:16,240
one of those other really high numbers

178
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:16,680
is

179
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:19,680
lgbtq

180
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,400
and

181
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:27,599
so the um the

182
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,440
um to be a res so when there's a hate

183
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,159
crime it's not just you know that

184
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,880
an intent you know a dislike of someone

185
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,919
but one distinction

186
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,399
some people make also between like anger

187
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,599
and hate

188
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,240
i hate hate as a hate crime is that

189
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,279
anger

190
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,920
is for a particular behavior a

191
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,040
particular event particular situation

192
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,720
whereas uh

193
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,080
racial hate or gender hate or

194
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,959
ethnic hate or something it's hate

195
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:02,720
towards a whole category of

196
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,080
the whole person not the behavior of the

197
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,000
person what they say or do

198
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,440
but the whole being of the person

199
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,760
and and their family and their community

200
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,760
and so it's not just a singular emotion

201
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,959
but it's an attitude a disposition a

202
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:25,680
way of seeing it's an interpretation

203
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,080
that's

204
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,720
overlaid on the totality of who a person

205
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,760
is

206
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,920
and that's why hate crimes and

207
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,120
expressions of this kind of

208
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,880
ethnic and category crimes is so total

209
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,920
why it's so

210
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,959
difficult for people and so painful is

211
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,560
because it's a diminishing

212
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,279
diminishment a contempt of who they are

213
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:45,839
as a

214
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,560
as a human being and to have that

215
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:49,440
repeatedly

216
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,279
to be recipient that you as a human

217
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:52,560
being

218
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,880
are somehow worthy of my

219
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:00,080
hate is quite difficult

220
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,079
and then to know that that's a lingering

221
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,240
disposition a lingering attitude

222
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,720
it stays means that you know it's not

223
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,279
just

224
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,200
a mistake of the moment or an incident

225
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,320
of the moment

226
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,480
passion in the moment but it's something

227
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,600
that

228
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,839
stays and will be here and continue and

229
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,160
continue

230
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,360
and to be the recipient of the victim of

231
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,000
hate crimes it's not just individuals

232
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,600
who suffers but also

233
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,440
the families in the community because

234
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,880
it's known that it's

235
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,279
it's in some ways related to all those

236
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:36,720
together so it's really a fabric

237
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,079
a tear in the fabric of society

238
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:43,360
it's a rupture in our ability to be

239
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,200
together

240
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,560
cooperatively harmoniously as

241
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,920
as fellow citizens fellow

242
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:55,920
companions in our humanity

243
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,120
it's also kind of a diminishment

244
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,720
of people's humanity and

245
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,720
and this is one of the great tasks i

246
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,640
think of our society and for ourselves

247
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,839
and our times

248
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,640
is to learn how to see the humanity of

249
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,079
other people

250
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,040
and how to share our humanity with other

251
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,800
people

252
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,959
there was i i saw an interview recently

253
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,079
of um

254
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,200
between um i think an imam the

255
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,440
religious leader of a mosque and the

256
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,040
neighbor

257
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,640
of the mosque a man who had been high on

258
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,160
drugs

259
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,519
uh heard about some

260
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:39,519
violence i think it was the paris

261
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,079
shooting

262
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,480
a massacre where all these people died

263
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,760
in paris

264
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,519
uh by some uh

265
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,360
isis kind of followers and he came home

266
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:54,880
high on cocaine and uh

267
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,120
and we're just you know angry at muslims

268
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:57,920
they're all

269
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
his idea was that they were he he said

270
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,360
he had been listening to a lot of social

271
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,399
media

272
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:04,160
and so he thought all muslims were

273
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,959
somehow violent and terrorists and

274
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,720
terrible people

275
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,839
and um so he shot up the building next

276
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,279
door the mosque

277
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,760
and no one was hurt but uh still he shot

278
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,040
it at it

279
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,320
so he was arrested and went to jail and

280
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,000
um for the for what he did and he

281
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
apologized for what he did and

282
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,519
you know he i think when he was no

283
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,040
longer high he understood what he had

284
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:28,240
done and the mistake

285
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,279
huge mistake he had made and when he

286
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:32,399
apologized the

287
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,480
people in the mosque the religious

288
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,680
leaders of the mosque

289
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:39,040
forgave him and apparently brought him

290
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,639
food and little gifts in the prison and

291
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:44,639
when he was released because he lived

292
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:45,920
next door

293
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,040
they invited him over to the mosque and

294
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,360
and uh and they were able to tell them a

295
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,079
little bit about

296
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,200
the what their form of islam was and

297
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,279
and he was shocked he found these people

298
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,760
to be fantastic wonderful people

299
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,800
and peace loving people and

300
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,440
and who had forgiven him and as then he

301
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:06,560
brought his friends over

302
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:08,800
and to see them and they were all kind

303
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,040
of discovering the humanity of each

304
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,800
other sharing each other's humanity

305
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,639
getting to know each other

306
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,720
which is not so easy not possible when

307
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,839
there's hate

308
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,760
not possible when there's that

309
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,120
categorical

310
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,519
idea that someone is somehow

311
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:26,399
contemptible

312
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:32,639
and so how do we respond to hate

313
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,760
as individuals in society

314
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,079
and from a buddhist point of view we

315
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,760
don't respond with more hate

316
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,000
and so to take a lot of care it's hard

317
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,560
to avoid doing it's hard not to be upset

318
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:49,199
with

319
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,079
them those people who are doing it of

320
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,480
course there should be

321
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,160
of course they shouldn't be of course we

322
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,399
should take a strong stand

323
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,399
against the acts of violence against

324
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:01,519
these acts of

325
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,279
this level of hate and uh

326
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:07,839
and hopefully stand up and help protect

327
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,600
our fellow humans who are

328
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,839
struggling with this kind of situation

329
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:13,920
it affects all of us

330
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,959
but we shouldn't hate and so

331
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:20,240
in this dhammapada verse it says hate is

332
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,160
not overcome by hate

333
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,440
and common translation is by love alone

334
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,800
is hate overcome but the actual

335
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,199
language of the original language of the

336
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,800
of the line

337
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,079
it literally says by non-hate

338
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,920
is hate overcome and so non-hate

339
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:43,040
is a larger category larger points to a

340
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,160
wider range

341
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:47,600
of responses than love

342
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,800
love maybe is too hard too difficult to

343
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,480
draw up love and expect we're always

344
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,000
supposed to be loving and

345
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,800
and maybe it's not even appropriate as

346
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,160
as the first response

347
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,279
or as the response and situations of

348
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,199
hate

349
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,760
and so the question is what is non-la

350
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,040
what does non-hate

351
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,560
mean and most literally it means

352
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,760
not to hate and so

353
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,600
the idea of loving i think is a great

354
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,959
one

355
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:21,920
and and and the motivation to love

356
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,839
it can arise out of deep meditation

357
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,240
practice

358
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,800
in meditation practice we let go we

359
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
quiet all the fevers of great hate and

360
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:31,680
delusion

361
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,240
we settle discover a deep level of peace

362
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,600
and well-being

363
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,639
within a settled peaceful contented

364
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,480
reassured heart

365
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,920
we discover that there there is a way of

366
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,240
living a way of being

367
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,199
that becomes more important like one of

368
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,360
the most precious things that

369
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,000
live there can be a feeling of kind to

370
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,720
kindness

371
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,519
love friendliness compassion that

372
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,920
radiates from within

373
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,959
and with this is this feels like home

374
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,680
this is the this has integrity this is

375
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,240
the

376
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,600
place of of um value

377
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,560
of how to live this life and then to

378
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:14,000
feel a commitment

379
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,680
that that this is how i want to be

380
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,839
and so what can what can exist rather

381
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:21,440
than being loving

382
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,040
there can be the wish to be loving

383
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:28,160
we can't always love but maybe we can

384
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:31,839
always have the aspiration to love

385
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,759
and sometimes that aspiration to love

386
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,120
means that the best we can do it today

387
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,839
is not to give into our hate our

388
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,240
hostility

389
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,360
maybe not giving in to hate maybe the

390
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,120
wish to love

391
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,920
commits us to pausing sacred pause

392
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,120
to hold in check

393
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,839
any movement we have to hate ours to

394
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:00,959
hate

395
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,240
we we hold and check our tongue we don't

396
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,640
speak

397
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,319
words of hostility we hold our our hands

398
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,839
in check to not express

399
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,959
any uh physical expressions of of

400
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,959
hostility

401
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:18,319
that uh this learning to to hold

402
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,319
ourselves back

403
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,798
because we want to love it's not a kind

404
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:25,120
of repression

405
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:28,558
but rather it's a kind of expression

406
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,160
of something that's deeper that wants to

407
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:32,960
come out

408
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,760
something deeper that's that's saying

409
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,320
wait

410
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,320
hold it there's something more important

411
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,440
here

412
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,679
don't lose yourself don't give in to

413
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:42,880
something which

414
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,960
adds to fragmentation alienation

415
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,799
don't give in to something that is going

416
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,679
to burn yourself

417
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:53,520
that's some of the dramatic images of

418
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,039
hate and

419
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,600
metaphors for hate and buddhism is that

420
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,600
of a poisonous snake which is biting

421
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,039
itself

422
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:04,480
or that of a fire that is burning itself

423
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,000
when it burns

424
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,280
so hate we the fire of hate burns the

425
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:12,320
person who's hating

426
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,960
the poison of hate poisons the person

427
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,440
who hates

428
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,160
and one of the one of the dynamics of

429
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:20,720
hate

430
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,320
is that for sometimes hate is a

431
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:27,520
person's response to their own pain

432
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:31,360
their own hurt and it's often said that

433
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,480
that hate that hurt

434
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,559
can evoke hate

435
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,120
a kind of blaming others and trying to

436
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,200
avoid the pain we feel ourselves by

437
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:47,120
attacking other people and blaming other

438
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:47,600
people

439
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,840
and and turning the attention outward

440
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,600
so hurt can evoke

441
00:18:55,600 --> 00:19:00,559
or hate but then hate

442
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,080
in return evokes

443
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,799
hurt and there you see there comes a

444
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,320
vicious cycle

445
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:09,919
one leads to the other and round and

446
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,440
round and gets stronger and stronger

447
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:19,120
hate evokes alienation

448
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,919
and alienation is a condition that

449
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,080
promotes more hate

450
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,120
that when we end up hating we're

451
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,799
separating ourselves from the humanity

452
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,320
of other people

453
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:33,679
and then we're more alone unless we then

454
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:34,080
find

455
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,400
companionship in other people of hate

456
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:38,160
and we think we're connected then

457
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,160
the mutual cause of hate what we're

458
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,200
hating

459
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,200
but it's not really a very deep

460
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,160
connection it's a shallow connection

461
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,400
and to get somehow supported or feel

462
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,559
enlivened

463
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:54,640
by hate is a kind of self-alienation

464
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,559
and the more we're alienated from others

465
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:58,480
and alienating from ourselves

466
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,600
then the more um

467
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,000
the more that drives further hate

468
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,120
hate brings alienation and

469
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,679
alienation promotes even more hate

470
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:17,600
in buddhist language buddhist ideas

471
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,840
hate is a form of bondage

472
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,880
and to be uh to be free

473
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,159
to to freely um

474
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:33,679
you know do the wishes of our jail

475
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,400
keepers or jailers

476
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:39,440
is not real freedom so to feel have the

477
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:41,760
freedom to express the hate and feel to

478
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,760
be free and wonderful to express it

479
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,240
freely is really doing the work of our

480
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,200
jailers

481
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,840
they're just enslaving us or jailing us

482
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,320
more and more in bondage

483
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,840
that people who are hating are in fact

484
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,120
caught and diminishing themselves and

485
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,280
jailing themselves in these very strong

486
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,840
feelings

487
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:07,600
to find freedom is to find freedom from

488
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,559
hate to find the ability to allow

489
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:12,640
something that's deeper than hate

490
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,240
to come forth and move through us

491
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:19,520
and so for those of us who are

492
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,240
practitioners one of the great

493
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,080
possibilities for us

494
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,000
is not to diminish ourselves because we

495
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,520
might feel hate

496
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:32,159
or we might feel animosity or we might

497
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,200
feel

498
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:37,280
we have prejudice and bias

499
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,039
but rather to turn the light of

500
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,960
awareness on that

501
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,280
to really be honest about that learn to

502
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,760
see it and recognize it

503
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:51,360
in whatever form it takes our anger

504
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,400
hostility even to anything

505
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,240
to keep turning back 180 degrees

506
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:02,400
away from the object of our hostility

507
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,440
our prejudice our bias to

508
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:08,480
what it's like for us to have the bias

509
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,760
the prejudice the

510
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,480
hostility or even the intense hatred

511
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,600
that occasionally can exist

512
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:19,679
and really be honest about it and see it

513
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,880
and if we want to love ourselves

514
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:26,000
then we want to have the sacred pause

515
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,000
and don't give into it but look at it

516
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,400
deeper and deeper and deeper

517
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,039
what's going on here and

518
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,240
and then to see find by and and bring

519
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,120
with that

520
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,919
the awareness that's calming the

521
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,440
awareness that is peace

522
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,480
peacemaking the awareness is not

523
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,080
hating or in conflict non-contentious

524
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:51,840
awareness

525
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,600
so we can start relaxing and settling

526
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:58,880
the fires relaxing the hurt

527
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,679
the alienation relaxing the way in which

528
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,320
we recoil from pain

529
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,760
feel our own pain deeper and deeper

530
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,520
until we find where the healing is

531
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,320
where the where there is peace

532
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:17,840
where there's wholeness maybe where

533
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,480
there is love

534
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,520
and we discover that when we respond to

535
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:29,039
hate in the world with non-hate

536
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:30,799
that maybe it takes the form of

537
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:33,600
generosity

538
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,960
sending presence meals to someone in

539
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,760
prison who

540
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:40,880
hated us maybe takes a form of

541
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,880
forgiveness

542
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,880
the imam who was talking about forgiving

543
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,600
the man who shot their mosque

544
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,600
said it makes sense it made sense to

545
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,279
forgive him because

546
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:54,559
he had apologized and so

547
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:58,320
to discover the ability to forgive

548
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:01,840
to forgot discover the ability to

549
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,360
be friendly we don't have to be

550
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,640
to love someone to be friendly and in

551
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,640
these all these expressions maybe we do

552
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,640
discover how to bring more love into the

553
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,919
world

554
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:18,720
how we bring more of a peaceful settling

555
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,559
pacifying presence into this world to

556
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,799
benefit this world that's so challenging

557
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,039
here

558
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:34,720
so i think one of the great tasks

559
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,919
these days in the united states and

560
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:38,640
perhaps

561
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,279
many countries in the world one of the

562
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,200
great noble tasks the

563
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,440
important tasks is for us to

564
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,039
stand in solidarity with everyone

565
00:24:51,039 --> 00:24:53,679
who is a recipient of hate and hate

566
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:56,158
crimes

567
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,520
the black people in the united states

568
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,720
the indigenous people the hispanics

569
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:06,400
the lgbtq the asian americans

570
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:10,159
and the list goes on and on and also but

571
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,279
to really

572
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:12,960
more than just stand in solidarity and

573
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,640
support

574
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,919
to be actively involved in making this

575
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:19,760
world a better place and a safer place

576
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,279
for all

577
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,080
and understand as deeply as we can the

578
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,679
roots of hate in ourselves

579
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,200
how this works and to learn to develop

580
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:30,799
the strength and the courage and the

581
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,440
confidence

582
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,600
to always wish

583
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:42,159
always want to be loving

584
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,919
it doesn't mean you have to be loving

585
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,320
it's a it's a difficult task

586
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:49,440
but we can always want to do it and in

587
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:51,200
wanting to do it

588
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,720
maybe we pause sacred pause to avoid

589
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
causing more harm and

590
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:00,320
we at least don't

591
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,000
express actively our hostility

592
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:08,080
to anyone and maybe then slowly we can

593
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,840
begin learning

594
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,559
how really to meet the challenges of

595
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:18,799
this world

596
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:22,640
with expressions ways of being and

597
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,720
loving and

598
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,919
caring and and standing up

599
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,670
and speaking up in ways that are

600
00:26:30,670 --> 00:26:32,559
[Music]

601
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,840
