00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,360
practice theme um [Music]

60
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:42,040
i wanted to invite us to consider the practice of metta practice of

61
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:49,360
cultivating kindness loving kindness warmth good will so many different ways to relate to and

62
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,600
translate this this lovely word from paulie metta

63
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:02,240
m-e-t-t-a to relate to it as generosity to relate

64
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:07,360
to it as generosity um this week

65
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:15,519
i'm subbing for gail at the seven a.m sits he's hiking and on vacation so and the

66
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:23,360
theme i've chosen to explore in the morning to invite everybody's minds to swim in is the the

67
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:29,360
theme of generosity which is a deep deep practice it's not just about

68
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,880
giving um material items but it's a deep

69
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:40,839
practice of letting go and and cultivating an attitude of generosity

70
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,880
um an attitude of let of letting go relinquishing

71
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:52,959
relinquishing with good will it's not letting go like oh i have to let go you know when you think of met

72
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:58,800
for example meta or may you be well may you be happy you're letting go of

73
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,240
your good wishes of this well-being you don't want to keep it all for yourself

74
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,519
right it's an act of generosity this practice of metta may you be safe may

75
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:16,480
you be well you're you're blessing you're generously wishing you're generously offering

76
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:21,600
you're generously offering this uh

77
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:27,279
this good will for others and also generously offering it for yourself not

78
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:34,560
to exclude ourselves generosity doesn't mean that you just give it to others and not to give it to yourself but to also

79
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,639
generously oh may i be happy may this being who is me he may be happy may

80
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:47,120
may i appreciate the blessings of my life may i rejoice in the blessings of my life may

81
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:52,880
i have well-being so there's just some sort of generosity that is part of meta

82
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:00,480
so so that's what i'd like to invite us to explore tonight as we practice meta

83
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:05,600
this aspect of generously generously opening our heart

84
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,200
and offering meta first to ourselves and then to others actually maybe we'll

85
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,519
start with the dear being and then somewhere in the middle there we bring ourselves in

86
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:24,160
sometimes that's easier to to to do that so so

87
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,000
let's begin let's get started with our formal practice

88
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:38,560
so so landing landing in our chair landing in our

89
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,560
cushion

90
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:01,120
this chair this cushion offered

91
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:10,480
can we accept it can we land in it with accepting generosity with graciousness

92
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:16,040

93
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:25,199

94
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:31,839
supporting my weight dear cushion dear chair

95
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:16,800
relaxing inviting the body to relax to soften

96
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:27,000
starting from our hands softening

97
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,800
keeping their weight off to the earth

98
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:48,000

99
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:55,839

dividing the chest the upper back to soften relax and

103
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,320
receive the breath

104
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:49,210
the lower abdomen lower back too [Music]

105
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,120
giving their weight to the earth

106
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,159
making space for the breath

107
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,720
this

108
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,480
do

109
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:51,280
relaxing into the chair cushion they're sit bones

110
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:55,000
bottom on the cushion

111
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:20,120
releasing the weight of the lower legs and feet onto the earth

112
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,240
do

113
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:41,919
just receiving [Music] this in-breath this out-breath

114
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,200
in their entirety

115
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:58,200
tilling the soil inviting the mind to settle in your eyes

116
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:28,960
as we receive each breath

117
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:40,039
receiving the gift of each breath

118
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:45,400
in this body in this moment

119
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:07,240
can we invite ourselves to appreciate the breath the life-giving breath

120
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:14,960
soaking it in relishing it as a gift of generosity

121
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:21,639
offered to us not taking it for granted

122
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:32,159
not rushing for the next breath or trying to hold on any longer comes and goes

123
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:40,158
gifts come and go relishing each comings and goings

124
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,840
of this gift bestowed to us every

125
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,640
minute

126
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:13,720
this

127
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,360
and as if we were giving ourselves

128
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:13,559
a gift just as the breath is offered as a gift

129
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:28,480
because generosity is a gift that we give others and we give ourselves

130
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,559
to bring to mind someone who's dear to us someone who's easy

131
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:43,080
bringing them to our mind's eye

132
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:53,919
and as if we had a bag of gifts

133
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:59,679
generously giving them gift after gift

134
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:05,799
gift of metta gifts of goodwill

135
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,559
blessing them with these wishes of goodwill may you be safe

136
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,840
knowing that life is unsafe or the world it's human

137
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:34,159
being human it's not inherently safe there changes all the time anything

138
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:41,360
can happen at any moment and yet i offer you a wish of safety

139
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:48,400
i wish i generously

140
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:53,840
from my heart wish may you be safe

141
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:04,320
expressing my intention for your well-being as this wish

142
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:11,679
not hanging on to it just sprinkling it giving it freely

143
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:15,440
may you be happy

144
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,799
may you be healthy

145
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,840
may your life unfold with ease

146
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,440
feeling the goodness of the generosity in your heart

147
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:43,398
with each wish of metta for this dear being

148
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:33,200
now she'd like can we allow ourselves to be

149
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:39,679
seen through the eyes of this dear being

150
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:46,960
with their eyes of generosity and let ourselves be the recipient of generosity

151
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:54,159
can we accept their gifts of good will graciously not to deflect say oh i'm

152
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:57,840
unworthy i don't deserve

153
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,519
the kindest way to show up when someone offers

154
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,240
generosity is to receive it graciously

155
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:19,360
can we receive generous meta good will

156
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,158
good wishes offered

157
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,080
from a dear person dear being open our hearts

158
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:37,960
and receive them graciously with gratitude appreciatively

159
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:46,000
imagining your mind's eye that they say to us may you be safe

160
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,799
we let it land may i be saying

227
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:42,359
for your reflections for your questions

228
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:45,680
fred please

229
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:56,000
hi nikki hi so i had great difficulty at the very beginning

230
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,400
reposing into uh the gratitude for being here and

231
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:08,640
um i'm i'm a little self-conscious about going back into this again but this is

232
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:14,640
what i'm experiencing just you know seven weeks now into my ears ringing all the time

233
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:20,240
i'm just very very uncomfortable and it's really hard to feel

234
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:26,960
um [Music] the gratitude of sort of physical existence

235
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:32,400
and um i did feel something shift

236
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:39,680
slightly as i started to think of my beloved person that it wasn't it wasn't difficult to to

237
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:45,760
wish met up for them and then it was

238
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:51,280
entirely possible when i pictured that person then

239
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:56,720
looking at me and knowing that that she would wish with with great

240
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:02,800
urgency that i be safe and happy and well and at ease

241
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:10,000
so that was that was a really significant turn i won't say it you know

242
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,280
it eradicated what i was feeling before but it was different and um

243
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:20,960
and i appreciate that and i guess i also want to ask you then

244
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,480
if you have a more advice of how to

245
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:32,400
when i'm physically overwrought and exhausted

246
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:37,440
with this constant ringing is there um

247
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,880
do you have an advice about how i might try to step into

248
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:49,760
the physical pleasure of existence which i could tap kind of easily

249
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,880
before seven weeks ago yeah thank you

250
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:02,480
thank you fred first really feeling for you and i'm so sorry

251
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,160
this is it's it's challenging tinnitus is challenging

252
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,800
ah and [Music]

253
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:20,240
as i hold with compassion what you're going through i also celebrate with

254
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:27,599
mudita or what you just shared with this transition noticing this shift

255
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:33,040
which is profound which is profound this

256
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:38,960
shift and just a little more lightness not being in that state

257
00:49:38,960 --> 00:49:46,000
so so holding both of those holding both of those yes it's challenging and wow

258
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:51,200
notice this shift it was possible to wish well not to keep

259
00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:57,599
being in the state of uh over wrought or you didn't say any of

260
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:06,079
these but like really really challenge states you know it was possible to step out of that hooray hallelujah to offer

261
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:12,079
meta for dear being and then see them offering it to you beautiful

262
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:17,680
yay this capacity i celebrate what you're sharing this is profound i really

263
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:24,800
want to highlight it and um so that is beautiful yay

264
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:31,680
yay really leaning into that leaning into the possibility because

265
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:37,599
that really opens up even more possibility of what is possible for you

266
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:43,520
right now in this moment in this heart and in this mind and in this body and with everything

267
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:48,960
that's going on that yes it is possible a little more freedom is possible right

268
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:55,760
here right now right yes yes exactly it was possible yeah it was

269
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:03,599
experience yay and surprise yes beautiful surprise right

270
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:10,640
yeah i appreciate you smiling yeah um and these are mini nibana's these are

271
00:51:10,640 --> 00:51:18,559
mini moments of freedom freedom is like this more freedom there was more contraction and pain and being

272
00:51:18,559 --> 00:51:23,680
overrun ah now there's the heart is opened i've i've stepped out of myself

273
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:30,640
wishing this person a while the ringing is still present but there's less suffering in that moment

274
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:36,480
and oh yeah thank you one other thing i would say so so that

275
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:42,160
really i want to point that out just for you to see that yes there were you've

276
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:48,640
you are capable it just it's it's here already the freedom is here for you

277
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:55,599
and then the so in one more thing all to say uh also to add

278
00:51:55,599 --> 00:52:01,040
the moments when there is exhaustion and overwrought well yay you already know

279
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:06,640
this practice of menta for the dear being helps you step out of yourself out

280
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:12,720
of this the the the prison-like feeling of this so that

281
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:18,720
you know that that's possible and surprisingly wow and then wish you all for me and then there's just some

282
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:24,800
lightness the buzzing can still be there but you can be above it

283
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:30,640
there's some level of transcendence right

284
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,920
yeah um and also sometimes it could be so so

285
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,920
this is enough maybe i shouldn't even mention this next thing but but i'll say it

286
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:49,359
um sometimes it could also be skillful to turn your awareness if you wanted to explore this

287
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:56,480
other invitation also turn your awareness to something that is

288
00:52:56,480 --> 00:53:01,920
pleasant in your body because i'm willing to bet there is something that's

289
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:09,440
feeling good maybe it's the i don't know the weight or the warmth of the hands or

290
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:16,079
something just feels pleasant and warm or cool or turn your attention to that

291
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:22,160
not allow tinnitus to be the only game in town i mean as human beings

292
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,280
there's so many sensory informations that we receive as you well know every

293
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:35,440
second and perception can be selective select something else turn the channel

294
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:43,078
