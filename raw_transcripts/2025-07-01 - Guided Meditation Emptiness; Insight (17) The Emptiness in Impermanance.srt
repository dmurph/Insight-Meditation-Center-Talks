00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,920
Hello everyone and welcome and welcome back to IMC

2
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:26,960
and uh certainly nice to be here and it was very nice to be broadcasting from up

3
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:34,279
in the mountains yesterday. And um

4
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:43,840
so in this theme of these last weeks of insight, the first and the and in in the

5
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:51,920
tradition the most important insight is into usually we say impermanence in English

6
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:59,039
uh ana inconstancy and uh in this tradition

7
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,600
uh impermanence is closely assoc associated with the idea of emptiness

8
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,520
and one way is that things that are constantly changing

9
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,280
uh there is no center or ground that stays stable. There is nothing

10
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:27,439
which is there's no place to stand. There's no um essential

11
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,880
uh core or essence uh existentially

12
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:39,439
ontologically with anything. It would be a little bit like

13
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:46,880
uh maybe very much like someone who likes to uh kayak in a river, someone

14
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:54,399
likes to surf. The water is constantly changing and the ideas about the water might not

15
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,320
be changing. In fact, someone might be daydreaming about how wonderful it would be to float on a river thinking that

16
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,840
it's going to be exactly like there was uh it was before. And the idea of river

17
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,400
is stable. But uh when you're in the water ex experientially

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:17,920
everything is moving and shifting. There's no solid ground to stand on in

19
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,120
the ocean in the river. And so there's things are always shifting.

20
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,239
And so as we develop deep samadei, as we become very still

21
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:37,599
inside, very quiet in uh in the meditation where the world

22
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:44,239
of concepts, ideas with which we construct much of our

23
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:51,200
reality is no longer operating. And everything we feel is shifting and

24
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,959
changing and moving. At some point we also see

25
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,959
that mindfulness itself, awareness itself is

26
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:10,879
also part of the shifting and changing is also part of what comes and goes.

27
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:17,280
and and we find there's no place to stand in the river of time, in the river

28
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:24,319
of now. And as soon as we take a stand, then we're resisting the flow of the

29
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:31,360
river. And so there's art of this practice is to get quiet enough

30
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:41,280
and at some point turn the attention around 180 degrees to look back at uh

31
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,360
the source of awareness, the source of mindfulness. For some people we call it

32
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:54,000
maybe the source of consciousness to see that there is nothing there to

33
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,640
stand on it. It itself is shifting and changing, dissolving and reappearing.

34
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:08,879
And uh and this at some point as we get deeper and deeper, every time we look at something,

35
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:16,400
it's already shifting and changing, including the looking, including the agent who is doing the

36
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,000
practice. If we look for it, to feel it, to sense it, to experience it, there's

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,680
nothing solid there. It's all just shifting and moving and changing.

38
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,680
And to experience that while in samadei, while being really still and quiet and

39
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:39,759
peaceful, uh can feel really wonderful

40
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,040
because there's freedom there. There's freedom from holding on to anything,

41
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,360
freedom from taking a stand, freedom from resisting what's going on.

42
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:58,479
And so this idea of the insight into ana into constancy

43
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,880
at some point when we samadei is strong uh it becomes 360 degrees

44
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:11,520
everything is included nothing outside and um

45
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,080
of that change changing or constantly shifting for some people that's disorienting

46
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,360
but if we turn around the attention to look at the place of disorientation.

47
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,880
There's nothing there that also is empty. Everything is empty

48
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,639
because everything is a part of a process of change.

49
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,520
So to assume a meditation posture where we begin

50
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,400
by finding stability

51
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:02,479
We begin by finding our ground to to sit on, to lay on, to stand on.

52
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,600
So it's clear we're here.

53
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:17,639
And then gently closing your eyes.

54
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:28,360
and feeling your way into your body to where there's stillness in your body.

55
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,000
At first, it might be very tentative feeling of stillness.

56
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,479
And as you exhale to let everything around the stillness

57
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,479
relax

58
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:19,440
as you exhale. Feeling if there's any solidity or contraction

59
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,120
or pressure associated with thinking

60
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:30,960
that thinking mind, thinking muscle.

61
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:36,240
As you exhale, soften

62
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,960
the thinking mind.

63
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,960
feeling the area of your heart center. And is there anything there that feels

64
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,120
solid or contracted or

65
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,000
like there's a a location there where things are a little bit more

66
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
centered.

67
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:28,440
As you exhale to relax around the heart center, soften

68
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:46,519
and dropping deeper into the area of the belly, the har

69
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,959
feeling what's there

70
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:02,720
and to allow Allow the belly to soften

71
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:12,200
the tension there to begin loosening

72
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,320
and becoming aware. here

73
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:32,519
in your belly, in your chest.

74
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Becoming aware of the alternating rhythm

75
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,720
of breathing in and breathing out.

76
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,200
Inherent in breathing

77
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,600
is change and inconstancy.

78
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:19,399
Unless you hold your breath breathing.

79
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:25,160
Keep shifting and changing.

80
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:49,920
And in your breathing, can you find a place of stability or a

81
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,279
grounding spot from which the breathing begins?

82
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,760
Entering the experience of the body breathing.

83
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:13,240
Everything is empty.

84
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:21,040
If you turn around to look at anything which is solid,

85
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,880
anything that feels a gathering point for something that's

86
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,120
stable and constant.

87
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:40,519
If you look at it clearly, you'll see there's no center.

88
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:56,880
And if there is, breathe with it.

89
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,320
Let it soften and relax.

90
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:06,279
Let it dissolve.

91
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,040
Any sense of solidity, permanence,

92
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:03,160
anything that seems unchanging in your direct experience

93
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:08,839
is a construct of the mind.

94
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,240
Relax the mind deeply.

95
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:23,959
Let go of the doer, the knower.

96
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:50,519
letting the shifting changing waves of breathing in and breathing out.

97
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:05,399
Support you to let go into the emptiness of all things.

98
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:14,519
Where there's nowhere to stand and nowhere to fall.

99
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:40,919
Whatever is solid, wherever you're holding on,

100
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:51,160
look into the middle of it to See its emptiness

101
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:56,360
and there find your freedom.

102
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:10,480
To be aware like space

103
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:17,919
where awareness has room for whatever arises.

104
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:28,440
Being aware with silence

105
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:43,120
so that no sound or thought is blocked

106
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:48,760
but can flow freely in in the silence

107
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:58,120
to be aware with stillness.

108
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,840
So awareness isn't ruffled by anything.

109
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:22,278
Being aware of emptiness,

110
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:27,880
the emptiness of awareness itself.

111
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,278
Nowhere to stand, nowhere to fall.

112
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:51,400
Everything is shifting and changing and flowing

113
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:01,200
with no essence, no ground

114
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,919
that stays stable.

115
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,840
The only stability

116
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,240
is the floating in change.

117
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,760
And then as we come to the end of the sitting

118
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:58,880
to appreciate the emptiness of awareness

119
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,880
where we can be aware Aware but not resist.

120
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:09,320
Aware but not assert.

121
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:15,480
Aware and not afraid.

122
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:21,158
Aware without wanting.

123
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:28,000
And to offer this way of being aware

124
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:33,400
to our friends, our family, our community.

125
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:42,320
So that all beings will feel that they belong to us in our

126
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:49,400
awareness. That we are everyone's friend.

127
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:58,600
that we have space and time for whoever we encounter.

128
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:07,200
As soon as we have not the space or the time, chances are we've solidified around

129
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:14,919
something. Holding on to something with past pressure in it.

130
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:27,120
Living in the vast emptiness of a shifting, changing world of

131
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
experience.

132
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:41,600
Let us have space to be aware of everyone

133
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,360
with kindness and care with time

134
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,840
and openness.

135
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,880
May in the emptiness of our

136
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,799
mind. May we wish

137
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:14,399
happiness on all. May we wish safety for all.

138
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:20,039
May we wish peace for everyone.

139
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:28,919
May we offer freedom from suffering to everyone.

140
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:36,559
May how we're aware of others be the avenue of a gift,

141
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:42,480
the gift of attention. Empty attention

142
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,799
that has space for everything. May all beings be happy.

143
00:29:53,090 --> 00:30:00,779
[Music]

144
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,480
Thank you.

145
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:09,039
So hello and welcome and welcome to this continued series on insight

146
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:16,960
for insight meditation and I think now we're on the 17th talk on this topic

147
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:26,159
and uh continuing with the subthe of insight into impermanence, inconstancy,

148
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,399
change as this is one of the most important insights that this tradition offers. And

149
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,840
it the other three important insights that are really the transformational insights

150
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:46,000
um come out of insight into change. So the uh insight into inconstancy

151
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:52,000
insight into uh stress and suffering the and the

152
00:31:52,000 --> 00:32:00,559
third one the insight into uh what's called not self. So we'll go through these three in the as I teach these uh 7

153
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,760
a.m. through the summer through next while. And right now I just want to keep

154
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:11,760
focusing on this um impermanence because it's so foundational.

155
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:19,200
And uh in this terraoden tradition um there are teachings on emptiness and the

156
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,799
primary way of understanding emptiness is that it's synonymous with the concept

157
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:30,480
of anicha impermanence change in constancy

158
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,640
that um and what anything that's constantly shifting and changing has no

159
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:44,559
inherent solidity no inherent thing thingness there that lasts over time

160
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:51,440
and um and so it's as I keep like liking to refer to it's like a river that's

161
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:57,200
flowing that um you can't find a solid

162
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:06,080
place in the water that's unshifting unchanging. It's always dynamic. It's always in flow moving and um and then

163
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:11,360
you know unless it becomes ice but the river is not you know ice the river is

164
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,600
the flow and the flow and so um in so we would say in

165
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:25,279
terabadin Buddhism that the river is emptiness of any inherent so solid place

166
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:30,559
that makes the river what it is. What makes up the river is the flowing

167
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:38,960
changing molecules of water. And um as we settle into meditation

168
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,120
and below the level where we're going to argue or have concepts or have ideas of

169
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:52,720
how things should be or how things are, but we are settling the the thinking mind, the analytical mind, the the

170
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:59,120
constructing mind gets quieter and quieter. So we're now living with

171
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:06,159
awareness in in the um in direct experience, the experience of the

172
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:11,919
moment. And this is why samadei is so important for insight practice because

173
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:17,280
samadei is what allows us to be centered in the direct momentto- moment

174
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,440
experience as opposed to being away from it because of this concepts, thoughts,

175
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,520
ideas we have. And some some way of thinking can have give the idea that

176
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:37,599
something is permanent. And there's two reasons for that. One is that uh ideas

177
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:45,200
are unchanging. You know, like the idea of a door, the door that's there, the door doesn't change.

178
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:51,760
And so the door is unchanging. Um but the experience of the door is

179
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:58,640
changing all the time. I'm looking at it. I'm not looking at it. I close my eyes and I don't see the door. The idea

180
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,800
that it's still there, that's just an idea. in direct experience if I'm looking at

181
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:09,920
the door that um uh the awareness of it

182
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,560
is shifting and changing and um and so in the direct experience

183
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:23,359
the door doesn't change but the way I'm constantly being perceived the perception is shifting and changing and

184
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:31,040
moving all the time and if we now turn that kind of attention not to a door but to anything

185
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:38,000
that we feel inside is who we essence of who we are. This is my amness. This is I

186
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:45,440
am this uh I am whatever you fill in the blank. Um if that is something that

187
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:51,760
feels permanent, feels unchanging like we have been a you know then if we

188
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:56,880
really turn that uh movement of direct experience

189
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:02,320
experiencing directly what's actually there apart from the thoughts and ideas.

190
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,000
We see that there's nothing there but these but thoughts and ideas. any sense

191
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:14,160
of solidity that's there or permanence that's there begins to dissolve

192
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,440
begins you know and if it's like a like pieces of ice in the river that then

193
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,720
melt and fall away and to become become part of the flow and changing nature of

194
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,000
the river and it's profoundly satisfying

195
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,280
to be able to sit in meditation get quiet enough to perceive that everything

196
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,440
is nothing is solid solid. Everything now has become spacious, open.

197
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:49,280
Everything has become easeful, still, quiet. Um, and in that spacious quiet,

198
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,640
um, there's experiences for sure. There's perceptions for sure, but those

199
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:01,839
are constantly kind of flowing and moving. Sometimes they can be experiences happening quickly. Sometimes

200
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:07,040
in a very quiet, peaceful manner. things are just come coming into awareness and

201
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:13,440
receding and come arising and passing appearing and disappearing

202
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,760
and um and because the mind is gathered in the moment. It's not distracted. It's

203
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:26,960
not spinning out. It's not pulling back and judging and reacting and having preferences. It just right there in it.

204
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,160
there's something that gets very peaceful and very happy to just be there

205
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,000
in that flow and that in that uh and that the the changing nature of

206
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,760
phenomena as I said yesterday it becomes kind of the the the

207
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,760
organizing center for this gathering of the mind into

208
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:57,040
harmonious centered kind of uh um attention.

209
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,520
And uh and it's an attention where now we see in the direct experience

210
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,200
everything is empty. Everything nothing has any inherent

211
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,440
um self inherent essence that's just unchanging unmoving.

212
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:22,320
And the reason why this is so powerful is that the movement of clinging to

213
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:30,480
something only gives the only seems to work if it's there long enough to hold on to.

214
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,760
But if uh so if I you know have a striker I can grab it because it's there

215
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:42,320
long enough to grab. But if the if the SP if the striker is just comp you know

216
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:49,040
constantly disappearing then as I grab it there's nothing to hold on to. There's something

217
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:56,640
in very deep meditation where uh we see that what we're what we

218
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:03,200
cl what the mind wants to cling to is only concepts and ideas,

219
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:09,040
wishes, uh projections and that in the deep

220
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,320
sense of everything is empty, everything is changing. By the time the mind goes to grab onto something, it's no longer

221
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,520
there. And um and but before that it's

222
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,680
the very sense of grabbing the where we think we're grabbing something

223
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:34,000
but it's the grabbing gives a sense of solidity the because it gets tight. It

224
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:41,760
gets like an fisted or a knot or something. And then it seems like yes something is solid there. But if we open

225
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,760
the fist like this what happens to the fist? The fist is not there.

226
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,760
And um it just now there's just openness.

227
00:39:53,760 --> 00:40:00,160
So the um um the opportunity for deeper

228
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,599
meditation just like in deeper jam practice and deep samadeium we talked about earlier this year. we enter into

229
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,079
kind of a we enter into and abide in a very different kind of world than the

230
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:20,560
world we ordinarily live in going around taking care of things. And so there's a

231
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,480
there needs to be a willingness to um to drop the ordinary perspect perceptions,

232
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,960
the ordinary way of thinking in order to really become quiet and still enough to

233
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:38,880
be able to uh sense, feel into the empty

234
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:44,800
nature of direct experience and find the freedom in there. Find find

235
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:53,920
the delight in there. Find the the uh deep sense of being at home

236
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,599
that can't be there if we're holding on to something like this. Like this is how

237
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:07,359
we want to be open-handed, open, relaxed, at peace.

238
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:13,280
So um so the um so the important point I'm

239
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,000
trying to make here is that as insight meditation develops what we're entering

240
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,359
into and abiding in is direct experience direct perception of experience where

241
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:35,839
the experience and the perception itself is seen as a a flowing river. the river

242
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:43,680
of now that every experience is shifting and changing. And if we look deeply at that and find

243
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:51,119
any place that's not flowing, any place that's gotten solid and holding on, gotten frozen, if we look at that kindly

244
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,599
and gently, it too will dissolve into that flow of change. And everything

245
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,839
becomes change. Everything is shifting and changing. And there we find

246
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,359
the the fist of attachment, the holding on that we have begins to loosen up,

247
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:16,720
begins to relax. And the function of this deep experience of inconstancy as

248
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,240
an insight, the deep revelation of seeing things constantly change is not

249
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:28,640
to live with this kind of insight all the time.

250
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:35,599
The purpose of it is to how it helps to melt the attachments we have. How it how

251
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:43,359
it helps us to soften and let go. And so we get a very deep personal experience

252
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:51,040
of what it's like to not be attached. And in this insight tradition that I'm

253
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:59,680
teaching from here um they say that when uh that uh in the in in settling into

254
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:07,280
opening into this deep experience of constant change in meditation and feeling the freedom of it um this gives

255
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:12,319
a person a pretaste uh of what liberation will be like the

256
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:18,560
ultimate liberation. It's a it's a kind of getting a kind of a sense or a smell

257
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:25,440
of what what's possible in terms of a dramatic shift of letting go that the

258
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,560
that is the purpose of this insight practice.

259
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:36,079
So I hope that this um um

260
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:42,800
uh makes sense for you and um and then probably tomorrow we'll do one more day

261
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:50,000
on this impermanence um insight uh and then um and then start

262
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:55,440
moving into the uh so maybe the little more challenging ones that are very

263
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:04,319
important also for this insight tradition. So, um thank you very much and um look

264
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:07,800
forward to tomorrow.
