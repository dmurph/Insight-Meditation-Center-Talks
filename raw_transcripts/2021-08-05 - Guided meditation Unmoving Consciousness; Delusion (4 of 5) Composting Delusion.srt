1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,439
hello everyone

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,880
i think it's one of the really wonderful things to do is to sit

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,199
down to meditate i think it touches into some of the

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:30,000
it relates to or it is connected to some of the more profound aspects of being a human being that are often

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,960
overlooked if we spend the day distracted spend the day preoccupied

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:43,280
and that if we can learn to stop everything in a certain kind of way

7
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,480
stop the busyness of the mind the preoccupations of the mind the spinning of the mind

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:56,879
that we have an opportunity to connect and feel

9
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,158
the depth of us or that which is at the core of us or that which is

10
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:11,840
has the most integrity or the most create a sense of peace and well-being

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:19,360
and it's a great thing that uh to do this so today um

12
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,880
we're still on the week of focusing on delusion

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,320
and today i'd like to offer you what could be considered a little bit of a

14
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,840
maybe advanced practice so don't feel like you have to do it well um but maybe it'll give you a taste of

15
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,479
something that will help you appreciate the absence of delusion or if not the

16
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:51,439
absence the opposite the prevalence of delusion in the mind

17
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:59,119
and this meditation has two uh two stages or two steps

18
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,159
first is uh the warm-up step just the kind of way of getting started

19
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:11,920
and warming up getting settled preparing ourselves getting ourselves ready for the second one

20
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,720
and so to engage in the first one with interest and a certain dedication

21
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,239
like okay this is worthwhile and let me kind of think of this as uh

22
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:30,080
as going through the warm-up exercise and so give yourself over to it the best

23
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,440
you can and then the second stage is um

24
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:45,680
to sit and meditate uh doing nothing except allowing awareness

25
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,879
to be open allowing awareness to be present for whatever wants to come into

26
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,800
awareness and the awareness in this circumstance and knowing the awareness the

27
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,400
mindfulness is with the mind that does doesn't move

28
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,560
the attention doesn't get directed anywhere attention doesn't get uh doesn't move

29
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:14,080
from the breathing to a sound or to you know anything

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,560
all those things can be known but the mind doesn't move the mind doesn't is not trying to do anything

31
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:26,400
it's just there doing nothing and what that can allow us to do is to

32
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,319
see how much the mind wants to move how much the mind goes this way in that way how

33
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,000
much desires are operating aversions are operating and delusion

34
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:45,120
and in fact the theory or the idea is that any time the mind has

35
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:52,080
greed or aversion and moves for that reason and uh there's some delusion that's

36
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:59,840
operating and perhaps even just theoretically or hypothetically any time the mind moves to go someplace

37
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:06,959
or pick something up or to avoid something or analyze something or fix something that

38
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:15,040
maybe there's a little bit of delusion operating there the delusion that the mind is not

39
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,639
capable of having profound peace by itself

40
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,440
so something like that so two stages of meditation today so for this first

41
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:34,478
step assume maybe your regular meditation posture

42
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:42,400
with giving some care and attention to establish yourself in that posture make

43
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,000
making small adjustments

44
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,120
to kind of get yourself aligned

45
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:01,280
and attuned to your body from the inside out

46
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,840
and to gently close your eyes

47
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,520
and giving yourself over to it giving your attention over

48
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,440
as if it's the only thing you need to do

49
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:39,840
take a few long slow deep breaths

50
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:47,120
and then as you exhale deeply fully relax the body

51
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,840
especially the shoulders

52
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:07,840
the whole upper torso let it settle and soften

53
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,960
and then letting your breathing return to normal and again also as you exhale

54
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:03,840
maybe a deeper softening relaxing first of the face

55
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,440
maybe more in the shoulders

56
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,478
and in the belly

57
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:35,039
and perhaps as you exhale you can also quiet the thinking mind

58
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:49,280
allowing the thinking mind to calm a bit slow down

59
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:01,199
and as you exhale relaxing the thinking muscle

60
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:13,840
the tension pressure to think

61
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:27,840
and then to settle in to the body's experience of breathing

62
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:38,159
not so much making a lot of effort to stay with the breathing

63
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:43,760
but to as you breathe

64
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,320
to shed the concerns for thinking

65
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:58,880
as you breathe and let the thinking recede like a water like a boat moving through

66
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,959
water that doesn't stop for the water and

67
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:11,839
but somehow just keeps going straight and the water just washes off the side

68
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:17,600
of the hull and is left behind stay on the breathing and let your

69
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,839
thoughts recede in the wake

70
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:33,120
in this first step of meditation is to let the thinking mind settle and quiet by just staying closely

71
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,839
connected to your breathing

72
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
um

73
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:51,839
as you exhale gently maybe sweetly

74
00:14:52,480 --> 00:15:12,880
soften your body a softening move wave through the body

75
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,399
and as you exhale

76
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:27,839
gently sweetly a softening wave through the mind

77
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:03,120
as you exhale let there be a simple softening in the exhale

78
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:09,839
and then at the end of the exhale

79
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,839
let there be a stillness a silence

80
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:23,759
a kind of momentary pause where the mind becomes quiet

81
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:30,720
letting go of thoughts and concerns and for a moment awareness just is

82
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:37,839
without any rush of thinking and thoughts

83
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:03,040
the moment at the end of the exhale maybe the mind is quiet

84
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:11,038
like it would be if you were going to listen to a faint sound far in the distance

85
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:19,438
the quiet the stillness

86
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:28,799
where awareness just is for a moment without any doing on your

87
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
part

88
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:55,759
and that pause can be quite momentary but perhaps you can then

89
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:04,960
maintain this quiet still mind

90
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:12,840
as you inhale maybe it's a gentle receiving of the

91
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
inhale

92
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:25,840
where the sensations of inhale fill the space in the mind that is

93
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:43,840
normally filled with thinking and thoughts

94
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:11,440
seeing if you can let the mind the awareness consciousness

95
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,360
be still and quiet

96
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:24,559
noticing that aspect of consciousness where there's no work

97
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:32,320
no engaging inactivity of

98
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:39,520
being conscious or doing awareness

99
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:47,039
we're breathing in and breathing out is allowed to simply appear

100
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,840
in consciousness

101
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:18,640
and then letting go of any focus on the breathing see if you can let go of any doing in

102
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:25,120
the mind and if you start thinking that's a doing

103
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,120
if you intentionally focus on the breathing that's a doing

104
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:39,039
and rather than doing anything it's more like the mind is just very

105
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:48,240
still quiet peaceful nothing to do

106
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,400
experience appears in consciousness

107
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:00,720
breathing might appear sensations might appear

108
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:06,799
sounds without any preference for what appears

109
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:13,440
settle back into the still quiet mind

110
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:21,200
with nothing to do but where consciousness

111
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,320
in consciousness present moment experience

112
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:45,840
simply appears and maybe disappears

113
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:18,240
and if in this way of practicing it highlights how much the mind wants to

114
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:23,840
do then the exercise is working

115
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,840
you're seeing clearly

116
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:40,080
the doing momentum of the mind

117
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:46,559
but see if you can see it let's see if you can rest behind it or underneath it

118
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:54,320
to that place where consciousness doesn't need to do anything

119
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,840
consciousness just is and it's aware of the things that come

120
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:09,840
and go including the tendency to do

121
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:51,919
you

122
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:11,840
if you're thinking you're probably doing and involved in it

123
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,799
see if the mind cannot be actively involved in anything

124
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,960
the awareness not involved

125
00:25:25,039 --> 00:25:31,679
except that phenomena appear disappear in consciousness

126
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:43,840
but consciousness itself is unmoving

127
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:13,200
awareness is not directed anywhere they're just very quiet and still

128
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:17,200
with a 360 degree

129
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:25,840
range of perception

130
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:31,919
you

131
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,360
and in the last minutes of the sitting

132
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,559
continue sensing or

133
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:38,398
maybe even imagining the sweetness

134
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:45,440
of consciousness which is at rest in itself

135
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:55,840
that doesn't have to work or do anything or avoid anything

136
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:12,159
consciousness or the mind is as at ease and peaceful and unmoving

137
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:20,720
as you've been in the best times of your life of being at peace or at rest

138
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,520
maybe a time when you finish the day's

139
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,840
work

140
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:48,559
and then perhaps within that awareness

141
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:55,760
you might spill or search for a place of sweetness tenderness

142
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:05,840
some people might call it inner goodness

143
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,720
with which now you can become aware of the people in your life

144
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:19,840
those you know because you don't know

145
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,000
people spreading out from where you are now out across the lands

146
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:34,240
across the oceans into the lands of other continents

147
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:46,320
and to take a few moments to appreciate

148
00:31:46,320 --> 00:32:00,559
the basic humanity of all people

149
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:07,760
and offer a basic goodwill well-wishing

150
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,840
for all beings

151
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:28,480
and perhaps a wish for yourself that you could be peaceful

152
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:32,640
settled enough

153
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:44,880
to care for the welfare and happiness of others without that care being agitating

154
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:52,080
or any pressure with it may it be that you care for the welfare

155
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,320
and happiness of others in a way that's easeful

156
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:10,080
that actually is nourishing for you

157
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:19,518
with his ease wishing may all beings be happy

158
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:25,840
may all beings be safe

159
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:31,919
may all beings be peaceful

160
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,840
may all beings be free

161
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:53,840
and may you contribute to this possibility

162
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:23,599
so this will be the fourth talk on the topic of delusion and it

163
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,158
certainly builds on the first three and uh and the topic

164
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:37,679
that the kind of the title of it is is composting delusion

165
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:43,200
and i think of this uh as a kind of an advanced practice

166
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:50,398
because it does involve um it involves allowing delusion to be

167
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:55,520
present and delusion is one of the primary

168
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:02,720
sources of causing harm in the world or harm for ourselves so that's why it's an advanced practice

169
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,640
to allow for it but to do it without getting entangled with it without getting

170
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,880
caught in it and certainly without being motivated by the delusion

171
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:21,440
and um and so it's an alternative to the

172
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,599
attitude or the approach that when there's something undesirable

173
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:33,920
maybe even unwholesome going on in the mind that it's an alternative to trying to

174
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,400
fix it trying to make it better make it go away letting go of it

175
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:48,079
and which in and of itself sometimes is the operation of delusion so for

176
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:54,480
example there could be the idea that i will only be a good meditator or a good person

177
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:59,839
if i get rid of this delusion so i i have to do something to get rid of it

178
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:07,040
and there's a lot of baggage and some of it perhaps elusive around me myself and mine about who i

179
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,920
have to be operating in the movement to get rid of something or to stop it or fix it

180
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,760
of course sometimes it's completely healthy to fix something or let go of it so i don't want to say it's always that

181
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,359
case but the problem there's more delusion in that movement

182
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:32,320
than most people realize and so the alternative is to not try to fix anything or make anything

183
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:37,599
go away but without being caught in it and this

184
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:43,200
is where having a stable strong capacity of being still or present

185
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:50,079
especially in meditation where you're kind of committed to not moving or not saying anything during that time

186
00:36:50,079 --> 00:36:56,320
and then it's safer to just allow things to be there and so we

187
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:03,119
if we are present enough to recognize something as to delusion then

188
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:08,560
so for example it could be there's fantasies that involve delusion of

189
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,839
grandeur delusions of how great it'll be if i could do x y

190
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:20,640
and z and and and you've done this so much that you see it clearly or this is kind of a

191
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,160
fantasy world that i'm living in and so we see it clearly

192
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,599
but we don't try to judge it or judge ourselves for it we don't try to get rid of it

193
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:37,920
but we do tr we allow it in a certain kind of way we allow it while we know

194
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,960
it is the illusion and that does a number of things one thing that's very important is that

195
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,320
it allows us to become more familiar with this tendency more we get to recognize

196
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:56,880
and feel and sense what this delusion is and one of the uh one thing one

197
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,320
principle is that it's things you only let go of things in

198
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:08,320
a healthy way when we really understood it if we let go of things before we really understand

199
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:13,599
it it might not really be letting go we don't really we maybe let go just the surface

200
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,760
symptoms of it and not really what's happening and there's there's a lot of wisdom that

201
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:25,920
comes from familiarity and just seeing something over and over and over again it's a little bit of a

202
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:32,480
bad news this idea because it may be uncomfortable to see something some things over and over again but in fact

203
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:38,000
to see it with a non-reactive mind to see it with without being entangled or caught and

204
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,119
without trying to get rid of it allows a deep something deep to begin

205
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,440
happening within us and one of the things that that can arise with that

206
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,760
is a very healthy kind of enough already a healthy feeling that

207
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:03,280
you know i'm not really i don't really value this anymore i don't i'm not behind it i'm not

208
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:08,480
motivated by it i don't care for it i see that this is actually this

209
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:13,680
particular delusion i'm having is not really healthy for me or for the world

210
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,200
and um and uh that insight that real clear seeing like that

211
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,480
is not aversion uh it's not um you know any kind of

212
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,960
hostility or but it is just a clear seeing oh look at that it's like if you put your hand on a hot

213
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,240
stove um if you do it long enough and become familiar enough with it uh you want to

214
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,079
pull your hand away like this enough of this i don't want to do this anymore and for most of us that

215
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:49,839
we don't need a lot of time on the on the stove on the hot stove i mean just uh you know milliseconds

216
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:56,480
we know that we don't want to do that that's not wise but some of the illusions of the mind it takes longer for us to see

217
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:03,040
oh the healthy movement oh this is not for me and um and and building on that

218
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:08,400
especially if the delusion continues and we don't necessarily doesn't doesn't necessarily stop

219
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,599
it can be a source a wonderful source to be motivated to practice and feeling

220
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,520
you know i don't really want to live this way anymore i think that the only way i know to really get to the bottom

221
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,920
of it and work through it is to practice is to meditate and so a person might dedicate themselves to

222
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,920
meditation or a contemplative life for a while so that they can really tap into something

223
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,359
deeper than the surface mind of delusion and preoccupations that maybe we've been

224
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:45,520
living in so this allowing of delusion to be there to become familiar with it

225
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:52,319
can produce a healthy feeling attitude of enough already and a healthy motivation okay i'm going

226
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:57,520
to get serious about my practice let's do let me practice more

227
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,960
the other thing about allowing delusion to be there this composting is digesting of it is that

228
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,599
i think it's often useful to think of things like delusion uh as being a symptom of something

229
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,880
deeper and if we allow it to be there just without reactions without being for against

230
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:23,200
it it allows something deeper to manifest or allow something that maybe

231
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:30,880
metaphorically is a seed within the delusion that's healthy it's beautiful to sprout

232
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:37,280
and and uh and uh maybe it's the opposite of some

233
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,640
of the uh some of the conditions for the delusion to be there

234
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:49,200
maybe uh what some of the conditions for delusion is anxiety or loneliness

235
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:55,680
or insecurity or very strong desire and but as we sit

236
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:03,280
quietly and allow the delusion to be there knowing its delusion then we begin recognizing over time that

237
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,599
something inside begins to morph and change and settle and the opposite of those unhealthy

238
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:17,119
movements are there there's we can recognize there's peace there that's growing within it we recognize there's um some feeling of

239
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:23,839
security some feeling of well-being and ease that's kind of growing there and it's beginning to show itself

240
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:30,640
that has a lot to do with the ability to sit still and not be engaged and

241
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,960
reactive to it so um and this is very respectful this

242
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,160
attitude this idea of composting or digesting or allowing things to be so something can

243
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,440
be transformed and changed in a deep healthy way i like to think of it as

244
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:54,000
being very respectful of life everything can be respected

245
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:02,800
everything nothing has to be seen as a problem nothing needs to be seen as uh even

246
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:10,240
in a sense maybe unnecessary it's all it's all to be respected as a deep

247
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:17,920
unfolding and working of our humanity and um and we have this amazingly fantastic

248
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,640
wondrous potential to move towards healing to health to wisdom to freedom

249
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:30,960
that uh it doesn't have to be intentionally worked on it's like we have to be the

250
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:36,160
doer of it as much as uh as getting out of the way

251
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:43,200
for this deeper potential to kind of really show itself where mindfulness awareness

252
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,920
this unmoving consciousness that's really present for things is the field or the soil out of this

253
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,440
transformation can happen and so um this composting of greed

254
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:03,280
hatred and delusion that i've been talking over this last weeks on thursdays i think of it as a it also

255
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:10,640
helps us discover this deep respect for everything a respect that doesn't celebrate

256
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:16,000
everything it doesn't condone everything but it's a respect

257
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:23,119
that doesn't condemn anything it doesn't um you know

258
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:30,079
disrespect or treat as being just wrong whatever is happening for us

259
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:36,319
in that field in that container of a clear awareness

260
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:43,200
of what's happening without being entangled with it and without being motivated by what's unhealthy and that's

261
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:51,119
why i think meditation is such a powerful laboratory a place for this to so the composting practices i've been

262
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:57,839
teaching these last thursdays please be very careful with them think of them as kind of advanced practices

263
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,200
and a little bit dangerous practice because it's so easy to fall into

264
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:11,200
to believe we're doing non-reactive and then believe that whatever's arising from within is somehow wonderful or important

265
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:17,359
or wise and we should just make room to allow things to just um you know then

266
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:22,400
some some kind of inner intuition or inner deep knowing can flow

267
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:29,920
as we get out of the way uh that attitude can be a kind of delusion as well and um

268
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:35,119
and so you'd be very very careful with this that we don't in no kind of way or giving in to

269
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:41,200
something that's going to cause harm to ourselves harm to others harm to everyone and

270
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:46,720
anything that perpetuates other delusions like delusions of self and

271
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:54,079
self grandeur and things like that so and with the composting practice i've

272
00:45:54,079 --> 00:46:00,560
been talking about these last weeks it's probably if you really find it valuable or something that's meaningful

273
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:06,240
it's probably good to check in with a meditation teacher a little bit to make sure that you're on

274
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:14,319
the right track because it is possible to go a little bit off track doing this kind of practice so

275
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:24,480
thank you very much and i look forward to our last talk on this topic delusion

276
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:29,119
tomorrow
