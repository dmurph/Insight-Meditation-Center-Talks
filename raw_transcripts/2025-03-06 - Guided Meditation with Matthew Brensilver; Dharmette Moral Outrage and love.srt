1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:12,960
so so welcome to you all nice to um see some uh some names

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,640
there um so yeah good to good to be back with you it's uh sometimes a week away

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,400
feels like not so long this time felt like a long a long time and

4
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:35,040
um yeah thank you uh for for the questions you've you've submitted um

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,960
I'll answer more of those at some point and and let those inform uh the topics that I uh try to

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,960
address one question I I saw that I thought maybe should just very briefly

7
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:57,239
address was um something like why certain Wednesdays isn't just plain Wednesdays like in the suggestion very

8
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:06,240
reasonable to get substitute teachers uh on weeks that I'm uh away and I get

9
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:11,360
that and um partially it's just to be

10
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,320
you know gets more stressful administratively to do so some of it's my

11
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:25,159
laziness and um but there's also a kind of fire hose of online Dharma you know

12
00:01:25,159 --> 00:01:30,200
and that's mostly a great thing and um

13
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:37,880
and it has also perhaps driven down the kind of value placed on offerings too and so

14
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,240
anybody I could potentially get to sub has a wealth of online stuff

15
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,320
already and um and that kind of Market effect that kind of that logic of the

16
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,640
marketplace of um yeah just the kind of hyper availability I think is is

17
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:02,719
generally great but it's also so

18
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:11,680
complicated and the Dharma really only works under the assumption of certain

19
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:19,200
you know preciousness or Rarity maybe and uh and so that was on my mind

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:26,000
too and then uh and then also just like subbing subbing is a bad gig for the sub

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,239
you know generally like when there's an established teacher who is a effectively

22
00:02:31,239 --> 00:02:38,440
driven away all the people that they annoy I have driven away at this point

23
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:47,200
most maybe not all most of the people I annoy uh and then you have like a very

24
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:55,000
idiosyncratic crew that's left namely you all um the experience of kind of

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,440
stepping into that and subbing it is kind of jangly sometimes

26
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:05,599
so I'm sensitive to that so anyway that hopefully that uh sounds okay but just

27
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:11,640
uh wanted to uh explain that seemed worthy of

28
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,799
explanation and um we'll uh we'll sit

29
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,159
um sit in a a moment but just wanted to uh share

30
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:31,280
something um came up maybe a couple weeks ago this book I I just just finished uh Agnes

31
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:39,480
callard's uh open Socrates and um it's a book about uh the

32
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:47,560
necessity the necessity of others and growing our wisdom and uh we cannot see the back of

33
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:55,680
our own head and Socratic dialogue is a way to help

34
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:01,400
us pursue truth right where the goal is as much to

35
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,519
be um convinced by others as to convince

36
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:16,199
others the goal in other words is to lose debates as much as win

37
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:23,040
them and this not a Dharma book but it struck me oh yeah Dharma

38
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:31,160
practice is about losing debates so callard writes um we are

39
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,240
unable to think about the most important things on our own and we habitually

40
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,360
Shield ourselves from this terrifying fact all of us even professional philosophers that's what she is walk

41
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:50,880
around with a conceit of knowledge separating us from other people our feeling of basic mental

42
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,240
competence of having the answers on which the living of Our Lives depend

43
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:03,479
keeps us from connecting uh to others in ways that benefit us

44
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,960
most ignorance of ignorance leads us to think that we are to figure out these

45
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,160
important questions for ourselves ignorance of ignorance prevents us from

46
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:20,240
thinking alongside of another person about what neither of us

47
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:27,000
knows ignorance of ignorance is the barrier between us

48
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,639
Socrates dismantled that barrier

49
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:42,000
and Strikes me Sanka dismantles that

50
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,720
barrier spiritual friendship dismantles that barrier and that's part of what we do in

51
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,919
our practice this is the jewel of s not lesser than Buddha

52
00:05:54,919 --> 00:06:00,319
dama and even here on video

53
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:07,599
with our little chat and my little talks and the many ongoing relationships

54
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:16,440
you have amongst each other we have with each other uh we're we're attempting to

55
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,599
um to dismantle that barrier and uh to

56
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:28,080
think and practice alongside one another to wake up together that feels

57
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:34,960
especially important these days and so maybe we begin to sit just

58
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,960
um feeling the the goodness of our uh Collective

59
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:56,639
practice allowing your eyes to

60
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
close e

61
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,240
now

62
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:14,479
we cannot wake up on our own we

63
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,120
depend on so much and so many

64
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,440
we uh stand on so many

65
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:46,680
shoulders and we uh offer our shoulders to so

66
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,440
many for

67
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:50,680
and because we cannot distinguish between our wisdom

68
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:56,320
and our delusion we uh need each other quite

69
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,320
deeply

70
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:05,399
Jewel of

71
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,200
sa and so just um let the kind of

72
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:36,519
this network of um good will mutuality let it uh

73
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:45,759
soften your heart as we uh begin practice this evening

74
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
breathing

75
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

76
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
e e

77
00:12:50,120 --> 00:13:00,600
we are in a sense only aware of what our self model permits us

78
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,880
to

79
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:23,760
see deep assumptions about

80
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,279
uh who we are what life is

81
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,360
what the world

82
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:46,800
is and so what we know is mediated

83
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,880
by self self View

84
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:30,600
in this sense it's a kind of blessing when another person clanks into

85
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,880
our self View

86
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:17,920
we begin to make what um had been transparent

87
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:30,440
opaque begin to look at that which we're accustomed to merely looking through

88
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:51,199
the Avatar of

89
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,920
self the way that awareness

90
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,759
tastes like

91
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
self

92
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

93
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

94
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

95
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

96
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:01,760
e e

97
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:41,960
we begin to notice the ways

98
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:54,600
that we uh model

99
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:01,679
our life model this moment e

100
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:34,679
way we model a kind of vantage point

101
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:07,640
you practice noticing letting go disidentifying

102
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

103
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

104
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
e e

105
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:26,520
become awake to uh all the subtle feeling and words and images

106
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:33,799
that when unnoticed

107
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:43,080
become the center of gravity of I

108
00:24:55,159 --> 00:24:59,440
amness when noticed

109
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,799
become

110
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
empty

111
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

112
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

113
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

114
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

115
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

116
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,130
[Music]

117
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
e e

118
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,799
okay it's good to uh sit with

119
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:39,600
you

120
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:59,000
so before we we even begin Dharma practice um we have uh a lot of love

121
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:08,440
tremendous um depth of care and um s member was was was speaking about

122
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:15,039
generosity she talked about I think it was her very young nephew who

123
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:22,200
loves cheese yogurt and blueberries just eating it ravenously

124
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:28,519
delightedly and then uh all mashed up together and then very proudly

125
00:30:28,519 --> 00:30:34,880
presents that mashup to his aunt you

126
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,039
know and uh because she's trying to be a good ant

127
00:30:40,039 --> 00:30:46,799
gratefully takes it right but that uh these deep

128
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:54,600
impulses evident from very early on and they don't go

129
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:59,720
away and then you start um

130
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,279
start practicing and the love grows and yeah it's it's

131
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:13,600
hard uh practice is hard but there is only love and that

132
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,360
which has not yet been loved and the practice begins to free up

133
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:26,279
a lot of energy a lot of energy a lot of understanding of insight

134
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:33,240
and the face of insight s is love its manifestation in our

135
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:42,519
lives is is primarily love and we start to care more deeply

136
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:53,200
about so much the the circle of empathy uh widens begins to include the

137
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:59,360
nameless and the named those will never meet those not

138
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:04,480
yet born and uh the love begins to to

139
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:10,399
animate our our life our action in the world how we relate to one another how

140
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:17,120
we vote how we engage

141
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:24,039
um but as the uh the line in the song goes um there's a thin line between love

142
00:32:24,039 --> 00:32:30,240
and Heath and our moral

143
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:38,000
commitments um what we care about our love gets yolked together with rage and

144
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:46,399
the urge to uh to punish and and the question is like how

145
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:52,799
does that happen how do love and hate become

146
00:32:54,519 --> 00:33:01,080
entangled and uh um trying to address

147
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,120
this because I've been feeling sense of

148
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:13,000
moral something like moral outrage and I don't

149
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:21,000
know exactly what to do with it or what if anything to trust about

150
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:28,320
it don't feel uh I want to dismiss it out of hand if

151
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,840
it motivates some action wholesome engagement perhaps

152
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:40,799
that's useful um but is it is it possible to

153
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:48,720
harness kind of moral revulsion in a way that doesn't corrode one's heart and

154
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,200
is genuinely productive that reduces

155
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:01,600
suffering and uh Ruth King said um said anger is

156
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:08,118
initiatory not transformative we can

157
00:34:08,119 --> 00:34:15,240
begin perhaps with um outrage or anger

158
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:22,878
but never end there and through all the different Cycles in

159
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:29,440
my own life in my own mind I I am left with the sense that

160
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:34,280
love it has to have the last

161
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:43,118
word and we we tend to think that our clinging is what makes us persuasive but

162
00:34:43,119 --> 00:34:48,679
it's our letting go that actually gives us our power that

163
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:54,000
makes us persuasive and we think the volume of

164
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:02,240
our hatred is what signifies the depth of our care of our love but our hatred is a kind

165
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:09,520
of distorted expression of our care some kind of

166
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:17,640
alienated expression of our care and we are purifying our

167
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:23,760
love untangling it from hate even

168
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:29,400
even as one articulates a very

169
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:38,200
forceful no Hannah Chapman she says um disgust

170
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:43,760
plays an important role in Mor morality the commonality between

171
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:51,520
physical and moral disgust illustrates the elegant pragmatism of brain design whereby a new

172
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,359
set of abstract social triggers is attached to an ancient motivational

173
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:03,480
system system or originating in the rejection of aversive and potentially poisonous

174
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,560
tastes the co-option may be driven by the association between disgust and

175
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:16,800
withdrawal motivation which could have been a valuable addition to the behavioral

176
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,720
repertoire of our highly social

177
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:29,160
species rotting food disgusts us we wouldn't eat it we wouldn't let a loved

178
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:36,000
one eat it and ugly ethical conduct discuss us

179
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:40,800
we want to uh to punish

180
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,520
it but disgust and hate

181
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,520
probably live in the same

182
00:36:53,200 --> 00:37:00,839
neighborhood and the intensity of our feeling seems like it must be matched by the

183
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:06,960
intensity of our view our stated

184
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,800
position maybe not what is uh unbearable needs an

185
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:20,160
object of hate right

186
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:28,680
no and I'm trying to learn to surf the kind kind of intensity

187
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:34,560
of my moral emotions without acquiescing to the

188
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:42,960
kesas to greeting delusion and Dharma practice involves

189
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,839
the purifying the nature of our love refining out the

190
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:56,000
ancient evolutionary entanglements disgust and hate and

191
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:03,119
vengefulness and the the kind of cruel irony that

192
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:09,800
that which we most want to change tends to be that which we most hate and yet

193
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:17,200
hatred is often the worst way to get someone to

194
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:26,359
change so it's not really that there's a thin line between love and hate but there's a very thin line between

195
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:33,680
clinging and hate there's a thin line between fear and

196
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,680
hate and so we we begin with uh the

197
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:48,880
imperfection of some sort of like gets better gets worse gets better gets

198
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:55,319
worse that matters but always

199
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,359
imperfect and we open our heart to

200
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:09,880
that I feel a need to take uh we need take good care of

201
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:19,359
fear need to take good care of our fear that's not to say there's nothing to fear but we need to take good care of

202
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:26,200
it and we investigate the ways that um our love

203
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:34,400
becomes uh entangled with with a kind of egoic

204
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:41,119
tribalism our moral commitments are about love but but they're often entangled with

205
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:47,800
suity you know with self view our moral commitments and become

206
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:55,000
sort of egoic badges but our

207
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:04,160
love is not about self our love is not a badge it's

208
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:10,119
not an accessory of uh

209
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:18,920
ego and we want to [Music] be careful not

210
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:24,440
to impute an agent a self to processes

211
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:28,440
that in the end are empty

212
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:36,280
and cells are just linguistic channels into which

213
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,599
hatred can

214
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:47,880
flow we take some characteristic and make that the center of their being

215
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:57,520
their identity and then try to hang or hatred on that that uh Center piece

216
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:10,240
we will not keep our moral sanity through hatred but U but through

217
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,720
love and that might

218
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:21,680
mean less hate but more grief that's

219
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:28,400
possible and I don't really I don't know but I I don't

220
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:34,640
think grief can be reduced further can be

221
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,560
deconstructed more I think it's the the Quark level or whatever whatever the

222
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:48,440
next level is you know but I think uh the grief is kind of like yeah

223
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:54,280
that's that's um just going to be the

224
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:03,160
burden of those who love deeply and so let us let us bear that

225
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:09,920
well and let um our tears be the kind of

226
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,680
source of our

227
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:22,359
motivation and uh none of this means I won't be in the

228
00:42:22,359 --> 00:42:29,119
streets I have been and will be but uh

229
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:36,359
I'll try to remember you all and what I'm saying

230
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:43,480
now so offer this for your

231
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:49,880
consideration please pick up what's useful leave the rest behind
