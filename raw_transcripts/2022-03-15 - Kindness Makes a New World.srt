1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:07,359
so thank you all for coming here this evening and uh

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:15,599
i'm still marveling at what it's like to be together with groups of people in this way

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,320
i've now done a few on in-person retreats at our retreat center and then a few of the sundays and fewer much

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,840
fewer of the mondays and uh on and off since november we've met a

5
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,200
little bit but i still marvel at it and i don't take it for i don't take it for granted

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:39,440
i feel like it's a pretty wonderful thing that we come together

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,000
the first time i uh came together with people after

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,120
i think was back in august i had an occasion to meet outdoors with a group of people

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,760
and and i was surprised

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,119
that i was surprised surprised by how surprised i was

11
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:10,159
at the wonderfulness of being with other people this way three-dimensionally

12
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,640
i knew it'd be special i knew it was special to be with people in person but i was surprised that i was so

13
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,600
surprised it was like i'd forgotten something it was like i understood being together with people in a new way

14
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,600
that i hadn't known before or had i taken for granted or and because it was invisible because it

15
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:35,439
was so common so i kind of more i kind of marvel at being together with you all

16
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,880
here and appreciate it and it's very nice and then there's a group of people also on

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,680
uh participating exactly more people participating on

18
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:55,600
youtube then he's here today and so it's i find it delightful that we have this extended

19
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,079
feeling of connection and we live right now at a

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:07,360
perilous time for this world and i don't know if

21
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:14,319
in my lifetime if i felt so so much peril in the world at one time

22
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:20,080
i do wish to have memories of some of you maybe old enough for this memories of

23
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,280
60 years ago doing uh

24
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,080
atomic bomb drills and uh they had very special desks for students

25
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:38,239
back then because they had these desks that protected you from a nuclear bomb they went off nearby

26
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,160
if you just ducked underneath it so we would have these surprise ducking

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:50,160
exercises in the middle of just in the middle of classroom with no no no

28
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,080
no expectation of it suddenly the teacher would yell out duck and we were supposed to just dive under

29
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,360
the table and put our arms over our heads and and survive

30
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,760
so that was you know it had a formative impact on me that's possibility of nuclear holocaust in the

31
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,959
19th early 60s that we had my parents went through they were young

32
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:24,080
but they went through world war ii and my grandparents went through it and the parents-in-law went through it and

33
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,200
some of them are very difficult

34
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:37,280
and i grew up with lots of stories of war and it always felt like war was close by

35
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:44,400
and so we have um you know not just the war in the ukraine

36
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:49,440
but that's the most that's in some ways the most dramatic for us but there are

37
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,840
other wars in the world people are busy and engaged or

38
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,000
kind of overwhelmed by the local wars that they probably don't even know what's going on in ukraine because they're just dealing

39
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:07,519
with their own and it seems that

40
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,360
war is a phenomena of hatred and

41
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,840
competition greed power which doesn't bring out the best in

42
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:26,240
human beings and the sad thing is when it brings when the

43
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,160
war brings out the worst in human beings people otherwise who would have been nice but

44
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,720
and uh and it just perpetuates the awful ways in which people are

45
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,720
together

46
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,840
my i think coming out of these years many years decades now of doing buddhist

47
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,880
practice i have a strong sense that the world

48
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,600
that i live in begins with me not that i don't think it's a conceited sense that begins with me like that but

49
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:14,000
we're also to start let's but through through my experience the way that i have contact with

50
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:19,280
through my senses with the world around me and reading and learning about things far

51
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,479
away and and so in my consciousness it radiates

52
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:31,280
from here that contact with the world and the way that i perceive the world

53
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,479
is not a is not an indifferent bystander or

54
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,560
innocent bystander just seeing it as it actually is the way we experience and see the world

55
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,240
is very much connected to how we

56
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:54,320
the eyes through which we see the and if we see the world through eyes of

57
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:00,319
anger we see it one way if we see it through the eyes of kindness it's another way

58
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,400
if we see it through the eyes of greed it's one way if we see it at the eyes of generosity

59
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:11,520
we see a different world we attuned to different experiences to

60
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,840
different sites and sights and the sounds and different things we noticed

61
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:28,560
they've done studies of people who were and actually encouraged to be kind

62
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:35,919
and when they were encouraged to be kind they saw more kindness throughout the day and more opportunities for kindness

63
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:42,080
but when they they weren't told that they had this control group that wasn't told anything about kindness

64
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:47,720
they noticed fewer less kindness in their world

65
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,440
and so if the world begins with us then how do what do we put what do we offer this

66
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:03,840
world and i feel very strongly that if we want to live in the world that's peaceful

67
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,880
don't be expecting other people to make the peace if you want to live in the world where

68
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:17,759
you want a peaceful world be peaceful yourself be the be saving the world to save the

69
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,000
world but that begin with you don't look elsewhere for it

70
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,039
for one thing that means that if you look elsewhere someone else to do it

71
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:35,360
then uh you're not engaged and it's a kind of despairing not to

72
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,759
engage it kind of makes us discouraged and gives up our agency and

73
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,639
and then we get disappointed when other people don't behave the way they're supposed to or not successful

74
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:56,879
it's just so good for the human heart to be active to be engaged making a difference

75
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,240
it doesn't matter how big it is you're not going to chances are none of us here or today are going

76
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,639
to stop the war in ukraine but maybe we can help a little bit so

77
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,840
i'm you probably know but imc this week has a fundraising drive

78
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,440
to for money for save the children and one of the highest rated charities

79
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,560
to help them in their work with the refugees and the ukrainian refugees and

80
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:33,120
so that's something we can do as of i think this morning we've raised

81
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:40,240
40 30 43 000 it's you know it's a drop in the bucket for the billions that are needed but

82
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:46,399
it's something and and for the kids in the refugee camps

83
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:53,680
who don't have water or don't have food or blankets or something i don't know what their needs are

84
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,040
that's pretty big deal for them so to do

85
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,519
to engage and it's kind of a one of the it's remarkable we don't do more of it this

86
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,440
way because it turns out it's good for the heart it's good for us

87
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:17,519
to be kind to be generous there's been studies done on kindness

88
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,920
it's kind of phenomenal right finally i think they did uh studies on anger

89
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:29,360
first many years ago but now slightly slowly they're getting to these more

90
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:34,560
positive emotions and studying them and kindness uh

91
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:41,600
so one of the things people researchers say is what many of us already know that if you're kind

92
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:50,160
i can feel good for the other person but it can feel good for yourself the other day i took a taxi

93
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,240
and uh and the taxi driver was not a good driver

94
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:03,440
the taxi driver wasn't particularly pleasant to be with and at some point i

95
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,760
and was talking a lot in a way that was just not so pleasant also um

96
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,000
i didn't wear his mask except under a chin i thought that's kind of strange still

97
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,240
this time of day this this kind of time and uh okay you know i didn't quite know where

98
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:29,279
he was going exactly i had to kind of tell him where to go and uh so it's a little unusual

99
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,720
and uh but when i when he when i we got to a

100
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:40,959
place where i was going i just felt delighted to be able to give him a big tip

101
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:47,120
the big tip was not like oh you did a good job it was like oh you're a human my tip was

102
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:53,120
you're a human being who's struggling in life trying to make life get by and i felt that i got a sense

103
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,160
from this as a man who things weren't easy

104
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,680
i said oh you're you're a human being who's trying to get by and struggling and i don't know why the pandemic's been

105
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:11,040
hard for him and i just wanted to kind of do i just felt kind of cozy and friendly and kind

106
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,399
and as i hear and he was quite surprised to get a nice tip

107
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,959
and i was then i was happy again i was happy to be kind it felt nice to have that kind of

108
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,120
instinct of generosity but when he reacted so like wow

109
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,800
it wasn't you know that big but you know he wasn't putting his kids through

110
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:41,600
college or anything but you know just it was just like oh he felt you know he kind of lit up and

111
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:49,120
i thought oh great i did send like a good deed today i just cheered him up a little bit

112
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:54,399
did he deserve a tip big tip and that was not how i was thinking that was not

113
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,000
interest that kind of way of thinking was maybe if he'd done like an extra mile

114
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,600
that did something really special something maybe i would have done the same or more or something but

115
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:11,120
my generosity was not contingent upon him deserving it it was contingent about here as a person

116
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:16,480
who it can make a difference in this person's life and to care for him and

117
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:23,200
express some kind of goodness and kindness to it and i felt good that it was not i kind of felt kind of

118
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,560
cozy in my heart oh that was nice i wasn't proud it was just like oh and i didn't think about it again until

119
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:37,360
i was thinking about giving a talk on kindness today i remembered my the other day

120
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:44,240
it was a surprise uh this the way that being kind or compassionate or caring

121
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,440
can produce some very good feelings in the person who's kind i don't know if it's automatic but i

122
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:59,279
but i think that it works best to be kind if we feel confident and safe and comfortable with the situation

123
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:05,440
and if that's the case then i think kindness

124
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:10,959
creates a kind of mood or goodness or a warmth or a

125
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:17,279
softness in ourselves if we do it in a nice way a kind of if we're kind in a kind way

126
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:22,959
it does it does good for us and i remember uh

127
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:30,160
the first time i really felt this in a strong way was uh i was in a kind of hike and a desert

128
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:35,839
kind of area with a group of people i think was a lead group

129
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:42,320
but it was a little bit difficult because somebody had to climb over these little boulders and like little

130
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:50,000
in through these little valleys that they had the ledges you had to get up and over and there was a person on the hike

131
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:55,279
who had trouble with that so i just kind of stayed behind to help

132
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:01,440
this person up the ledges and over the elders and and i was just i didn't think much about doing it just seemed like the thing to

133
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:07,760
do but then after a while i started feeling like how good it felt

134
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:14,320
i just started feeling so good inside and i couldn't wait until there was a next ledge

135
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:21,040
and after a while like you know who was benefiting who here was i helping her was she helping me or

136
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,480
was i the one who was fortunate to be helping because i did such a good thing to me

137
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:34,079
or was she the one who was fortunate to be helped i don't know exactly how she felt by it but uh

138
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,720
but i felt isn't it i thought they said pretty cool pretty amazing

139
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:47,440
that if you want to be happy one of the ways to be happy is to help other people be kind to other people

140
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:52,639
generous to other people if you don't want to be happy

141
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:58,560
then it's recommended you don't be kind to anyone you'd mess up with your lack of

142
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,600
happiness if you uh if you start being kind

143
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,720
but uh the fact that we can be kind and and it does good things for us and

144
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:15,440
then it's self perpetuating once we start being kind we start seeing the world through those

145
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:22,720
those eyes we start seeing the world through those softness and that that orientation

146
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:29,120
and we start seeing more kindness in the world research people do a lot of good things for each other i mean small

147
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,759
things and the

148
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:44,240
and big things and so you're seeing and they start

149
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:49,120
living in a world that's not only

150
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,680
you know the horrific things we're seeing and reading about in the ukraine

151
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,279
that's still true we don't want to deny it and pretend it's not there and

152
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,839
but that's not the whole story even in the ukraine

153
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:15,440
there is a lot of people who are trying to help a lot of organizations who are rushing

154
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:22,399
with their their work and their money to provide for the refugees a lot of people who are there

155
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:28,320
going to help the people who are wounded and you can see you can see sometimes the horrific

156
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,800
pictures of someone being helped out of a building they've been bombed and there's blood on their face

157
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,000
and it's kind of horrific to see but then do you notice the person who's helping them

158
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:46,560
has their arm around their shoulders and leading them out that's pretty phenomenal that people are

159
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:52,000
doing that and in some ways it's me it's kind of that

160
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:58,560
helping is more dramatic it's probably dangerous to help in that way but the helpers are the people who are

161
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:04,640
making the world a good place to live in the kind of world that we want to live in so one of

162
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:10,000
the principles i like to live by is

163
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,438
i want to be live

164
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:23,038
my life as if i'm living in the world i want to be in

165
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:28,319
so what i mean by that i want to live in a world where people are kind to each other and supportive

166
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,559
and generous and caring and that world begins with me

167
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:41,200
being that way being kind and generous and supportive and uh

168
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:48,240
that's the world i want to live in it so much that world i prefer that or the value of that

169
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:54,000
i don't want to live in a world of violence but i don't want to turn my back on the

170
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:00,240
violence and pretend it's not there i don't want to be the ostrich you know putting my hand in the sand and ignoring

171
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:10,000
it but i don't want to succumb to that to anger succumb to despair succumb to

172
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,720
greed succumb to violence i don't want that to come out of me into

173
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:22,400
the world i don't i don't want that to be the influence i have on this world i don't want to live in a world that's

174
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,840
like that and

175
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:40,559
i would like to suggest that that take that sometimes takes a tremendous amount of bravery to do that

176
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:47,520
people who go to war to fight are said to be brave they risk their lives

177
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,440
sometimes they risk it for great causes

178
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:02,559
what about risking our lives for the sake of kindness

179
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:09,280
what about risking our lives for the sake of peace is it worth is it appropriate

180
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:15,919
is that worthwhile to have that kind of bravery as well to have such a high value

181
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:21,039
on on love and care

182
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:25,840
that if we want to have be a world like that

183
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:33,280
maybe we do have to sacrifice some things maybe it needs bravery maybe it is it then foolish

184
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,200
even to put our lives in danger going out into the battlefield to bring

185
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,200
back the injured or to stand in front of the tanks so that

186
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,039
they don't bump some people

187
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:56,240
i don't think that kindness is

188
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,399
is avoiding

189
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:08,960
to live dedicated to kindness or love or care generosity and

190
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,799
i think to really do it realistically for this world that's so horrific

191
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:20,720
we almost need like a kindness core you know people who

192
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:28,320
are so dedicated to it that they're willing to really give themselves over to it and perhaps even risk their lives

193
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:35,039
with it so it isn't just be you know well okay that's good i'll be kind to my cat now

194
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:41,520
when i go home it's nice to be kind to your cat but

195
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,600
but it's you know i think i'd like to think if we want the world to start with us

196
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:53,039
and we and how we are is what creates the world to some degree

197
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,240
do we have the bravery to hold on to

198
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:06,159
the values that we would like to have in this world to experience this world too

199
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,760
if you want to live in a world of peace

200
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,440
and you're contributing to it

201
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,480
how brave do you need to be

202
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:33,120
if society

203
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,360
struggles with some of the difficulties of effects of the war like

204
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,720
i mean something like the rising gas prices and energy prices

205
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:52,480
do we just complain do we have to be brave and wise and

206
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,600
clever about how to not use more so much gasoline

207
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:06,720
rather than being complained about gasoline prices do we find people to give them money so

208
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:14,640
they can give them gasoline people who need it more than we do how do we live in a world

209
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,919
how do we make the world the world that we want to live in that's the

210
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:28,559
that i think is one of the principles that i've learned from buddhism

211
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,080
and one of the reasons one of the reasons one of the ways that's represented in the teachings of the buddha

212
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,520
is this with the world the word a world in his language

213
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:45,760
it's loka loka has the same varied

214
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:53,280
meanings as the english world english word world it can mean the earth kind of

215
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:59,440
but you can also say the world of my senses you know just what i'm aware of in the

216
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:04,639
moment or the world of my emotions

217
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:12,559
and in the for the buddha the word loka sometimes just means

218
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:18,720
the direct world of your immediate experience here in this body

219
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,480
that's the world but also the globe is the world as well

220
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,679
and here we have the same word used for both and i think that there's something very profound about this

221
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:37,679
that they're not so separate and so it's from this kind of idea that

222
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:43,919
if you want to live in a kind world a supportive world a caring

223
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:50,000
world well there's a world where you in which

224
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:55,440
you can do that which is your world and your world

225
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:02,159
is connected to that wider world spreads from you and who knows

226
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,760
who you'll touch who knows where you where it'll take you

227
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:14,320
so what i'd like to propose to you all is that

228
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:22,159
if you are despairing about what's happening in the world

229
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:27,840
if you are angry with what's happening in the world

230
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:34,799
and you spend a lot of time in despair and anger you're wasting your time

231
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:42,320
it's a kind of an indulging it's reasonable that we feel these that

232
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:50,159
stuff but it's also possible to act differently it's possible to do and act

233
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:58,880
so that the what the world needs what you feel the world needs comes from you out into the world

234
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:07,600
and it makes a huge difference for your heart huge if you do something

235
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:15,480
if you're only reading the news that's all you do you know that's not good for the heart

236
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:21,840
the buddha who was a man was a man it was a they would have taught

237
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,039
action in a way that sometimes is not so obvious when we're

238
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:33,039
teaching buddhism through a meditation tradition where come and meditate and be quiet

239
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:40,320
but the teaching was really about action the world begins with your action

240
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:45,440
every day when you wake up you create a new world for yourself what's that world that you want to

241
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:52,640
create and each of us is capable of agency

242
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,240
each of us is capable even if it's small things

243
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:03,039
saying hello to a neighbor

244
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:13,919
picking up the trash someplace where no one's picked it up for a while

245
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,919
i have a friend one of her things is that she goes with uh periodically on the weekend

246
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,720
down around i don't know exactly downtown river city but somehow somehow somehow east of el

247
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:31,840
camino and she collects trash like from the train tracks and other

248
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:39,840
places and that's what she does all kinds of things that are possible

249
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:47,760
now if you're not despairing and not angry maybe that's a different

250
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,279
different i don't know what you know but if you're if you are despairing in anger and angry

251
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:58,480
i think it would probably do you a a world of good

252
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,559
if you acted in the way in the ways that create the

253
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:11,679
world that you want to live in in ways that are good for your heart

254
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:19,520
feed it and support it to nourish it so that you benefit from the goodness

255
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:26,399
that you do there's this wonderful mutuality that we do good for the world if you do it the right way

256
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:31,919
then it we benefit from it it's just what's fantastic it's almost like we should all be

257
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,760
selfish in this kind of way because in this very particular way

258
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:45,600
to to want our hearts to be radiant and glowing and warm and loving

259
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:51,200
what a great way to be and if you can be selfish around that

260
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,000
boy would you do good in the world and you wouldn't be able to stay selfish or very long

261
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,799
because selfishness is limits the glow of the heart

262
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:12,559
so you're welcome to start selfishly it's okay because it'll melt away if you're what you're doing is

263
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:20,320
benefiting yourself from love with love care kindness

264
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:31,039
so i would say the world needs kindness now

265
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:37,919
more than any time that is needed in my lifetime that i've known this is the great need we have

266
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:43,279
there probably is no hope for us unless we have people who care and act

267
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:48,639
on that care you love and act on that love

268
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:56,440
so i hope that this practice that we do our meditation practice or mindfulness practice

269
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,039
to

270
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:09,720
your love and empower power

271
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,360
and uh

272
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:24,559
so those are my thoughts for today any of you have any thoughts you want to

273
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:31,039
share about this topic

274
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:45,360
yeah you can use the mic and i see that uh something funny happened with the people on for youtube

275
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:50,640
and uh i i look like a one of those

276
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:56,240
mirrors in the amusement parks it's all stretched out i think it's a problem with our software

277
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,640
here i had a occasion earlier today where i was

278
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:09,440
doing something helping the community and this isn't about me and like what i was doing but

279
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,840
there's a lot of rote uh doing something over and over again where my body kind of gets tired and

280
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,840
but there are there's a larger community that i can interface with and be with

281
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:26,960
but while i was just mindfully just doing something over and over and over again to

282
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:35,278
do something was a good cause my brain came up with a song i haven't sung in decades

283
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,640
what a wonderful day i kind of had a headache my body was doing rotator cuff was

284
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:52,399
bugging me but this spontaneously song just came up

285
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:58,880
um that i haven't sung truly in decades and i don't know where it came from but there was just this

286
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,720
upwelling of a a song yeah very nice yet i love it the uh

287
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,640
one of the one of my ideas of uh reference points for being happy

288
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:17,200
it do is having our hearts sing what makes your heart sing

289
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:23,440
and so to live live live that way and so you can i guess your heart starts singing

290
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:36,278
beautiful very nice very nice thank you

291
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:55,600

00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:26,000
and then a few days later somebody told me that it is for the homeless guy

296
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,000
and i asked the lady about homeless but we literally had only one homeless guy

297
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,840
hanging around neighborhood i gave him sometimes money and but i never seen him interacting with

298
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,240
anybody talking with anybody but you see a person dies and

299
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,760
people's hearts opened to him people brought him flowers

300
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,240
it was very surprising and just like

301
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:07,278
i don't know it's act of kindness or definitely empathy uh

302
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:14,960
very strange sounds like it sounds like people were touched by him yeah in some deep way yeah

303
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,640
and it was not just two three it was a pile of flowers

304
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,080
nice very nice yeah

305
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,960
someone on youtube's wrote today i helped a neighbor whose electric wheelchair ran out of charge near my

306
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:15,118
house it felt good even though i was busy but the connection was super sweet

307
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,960
i bet that person didn't wake up in the morning thinking that they were going to do that but

308
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,800
who knows what will come our way sometimes i like to think that

309
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:35,679
it's good to be ready it's good to be in the world ready to be kind ready to be loving or caring

310
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:42,638
and sometimes we don't we're not in those states when we're harried and busy and trying to do too

311
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:49,118
much and then the question is what is what's most valuable way to be and again again it's

312
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:55,520
kind of in the theme of the talk i think one of the most valuable things to to waste to be

313
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:03,119
is to be the world that you want to live in and if you want to be in a world where

314
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,520
you're running running after your to-do list trying to do as much as you possibly can through the day just being hairy and

315
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:14,640
busy well that's the world you want i guess

316
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:19,920
there's a lot of a lot of people around here who can help you do it well

317
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,599
you know that people are skilled and uh but that's not i don't think

318
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:32,400
that's what the world we want to live in so please your life is so important and

319
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:40,000
so valuable and and each of you is important

320
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,800
an important part of this world important for making a difference for this world

321
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:53,119
and who knows who you're going to touch who knows whose life you save or close

322
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:59,440
to it who knows what your smile your care your good will can do

323
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:06,560
who knows when you give a live more than is expected and someone smiles and is delighted and

324
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:13,680
feels wow there's good people in this world it's not all people who are just trying and take advantage of me

325
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,800
and argue with me because they feel like i'm charging them too

326
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:25,440
much for driving them someplace there's other people too

327
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:30,640
this kind the world has kind people it has helpers

328
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:39,560
so when you'll see the photographs from the ukraine be sure to recognize the helpers as well

329
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:44,240
maybe they're the ones who are the most brave

330
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,640
so thank you for this evening thank you for being here and

331
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:58,200
