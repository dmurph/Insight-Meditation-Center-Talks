1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,080
so I think it's a coincidence that announcement than what I'm going to say next I'm going to talk about a topic

2
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:20,600
which uh is a reputation of being unpopular in the Buddhist West and I

3
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:28,960
hope by the time we finish it becomes popular and um so I'll begin with uh an

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,879
analogy to get to the topic if you are really

5
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:40,280
tense you something's going on in your life you're really tense you're kind of beside yourself in tension and

6
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,120
preoccupation and concern and and you're starting to feel like you're not really being efficient getting any anything

7
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:52,920
done just kind of like going in circles and you know or you know you're trying to cook but you're dropping everything

8
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:58,719
and you more time cleaning up than you spend time trying to cook and it's not really cooking is not even working but

9
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,040
just just imagine you're so tense and so finally it Dawns on

10
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:11,119
you you know maybe I should meditate and you sit down and you're not

11
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,280
really ambitious in meditating you just sit down to just sit there and be present for all this tension all this

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,000
agitation that's there and maybe you close your eyes maybe you sit

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,560
upright and as you sit there something begins suling some of the tension even

14
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:36,759
might even feel like it's draining away and something gets a little bit quieter and you feel your shoulders

15
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:42,560
release maybe your belly releases and oh this is kind of nice and so you stay and

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,240
and something begins coming back uh to what might we might called a

17
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,479
homeostasis and if you do it long enough maybe you get really relaxed you're out slouching a little bit it kind of feels

18
00:01:55,479 --> 00:02:03,159
good to finally just be relaxed but then you keep staying it and then something in inside of you it not not your desires

19
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:09,399
exactly but something almost physical inside it feels like there's an upwelling of wanting to be up upright

20
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:15,120
more not to slouch and so there's a movement to then come into a kind of

21
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:20,360
homeostasis where we're not tense we're not overly relaxed but we're kind of

22
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:26,840
here in a nice balanced full way and a number of things had to shift

23
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,000
for that to happen ands things had to be quieted down relaxed certain

24
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,280
preoccupations faded away from being preoccupations there's still issues in the life that be dealt with but we're

25
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:47,000
not obsessing about them and making us tense about all of them and and it was in just a very nice

26
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,360
process so uh that could describe

27
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,440
some and if you decide at the beginning of that when you're still running around you know I really need to settle down

28
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,959
and let go of some of this stuff I need to quiet down I need to kind of release a lot of these things I'm caught by and

29
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:15,440
and that's the thought you have when you first sit down it could still work just as well from a traditional Buddhist

30
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:23,280
language what you were doing was renunciation that's the unpopular

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,799
topic if we think of renunciation as let you know giving up your house your home

32
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:36,680
home your spouse your you know everything in order to go off for example to be a monastic you know they

33
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,760
have to you live a life of radical Simplicity maybe you know that's why

34
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:49,080
it's unpopular just like why do I have to let go of all these things uh when the Buddha talked about

35
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,599
this word he word he called renunciation it doesn't have the same kind of

36
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:00,840
negative connotations obvious negative connotations that I think the word pronunciation happen has in English Eng

37
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:08,200
because renunciation in English is so closely associated with leaving something behind with uh with uh getting

38
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:15,120
rid of something uh relinquishing something giving it up and the Buddhist word that's

39
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,199
translated as renunciation uh might have that

40
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:26,080
Association in Buddhism as well but it has also has a positive Association

41
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,720
positive meaning it uh it literally the the poly word literally means to go

42
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:39,960
forth to go out into the open to leave a confined space to go out and and walk in

43
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:48,080
the open air and um and what's emphasized in the poly word is more what's gained in the

44
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:54,000
process of renunciation rather than what is lost what you know so it's not meant

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,199
to be an act of deprivation to renounce it's actually meant to be something positive that brings you something

46
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:07,120
really good so in that exam example I gave earlier uh you know if if you felt

47
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:13,440
running around and someone came say I think you should just renounce you probably get more tense or angry with

48
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,720
them but if you understood that what that meant was to allow you to go forth

49
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,280
after a period of meditation go out back into the world refreshed with the open

50
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,280
air of a clear heart a clear mind um your friend advice might be really good

51
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:40,039
oh I just have to settle down and relax and just be present and there's actually a natural process inside that's not my I

52
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:45,440
don't engineer this kind of settling down I just have to be still for a while

53
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,479
and just being still for a while it quiets the momentum the fueling of

54
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,400
tension that the obsessive thinking creates And the emotions that go with it

55
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,919
but still there's a quieting there's an emptying out of of obsessive mind States

56
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,319
tense mind states which don't serve us which actually limit us hinder us um

57
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:13,840
they're the ones that are are depriving us of something really valuable we're

58
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:21,479
being deprived of a natural healthy way of being and the process of settling and

59
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:28,039
quieting is a process of uh letting certain things go so that we could come

60
00:06:28,039 --> 00:06:33,360
into this Healthy Home stasis healthy way of being and we're actually enhanced

61
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:39,319
by it not deprived by it so uh part of the reason why the PO

62
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:47,199
word NE the poly word is NE which means to walk out to go

63
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:53,560
forth um is translated as renunciation is that it's actually the word used for

64
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:01,120
someone who uh becomes a Buddhist monastic they they go forth and the idea

65
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,560
is they go forth from maybe this is an unfortunate Association but from the the

66
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,639
dusty confines of home life which may be meant in a small little hubel with 13

67
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:20,800
kids and just you know all the struggles and all that and somehow as a young person you could enough of this I want

68
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:29,520
to go out now and find a whole other way of living that clears the heart that clears the mind that frees it all and so

69
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:37,879
it's going forth and um so then because the I think in Christianity um the word for a

70
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:43,080
Christian monastic Catholic monastics becoming becoming a monastic is they

71
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:49,000
renounce and so they there's a then taking that westernized word and then

72
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:55,240
applying it to a Buddhist monastic calling that word going forth translating it as

73
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:02,440
renunciation but in um but when the when uh this discussion about renunciation as

74
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:08,560
a practice what's being focused on over and over over again is not letting go of

75
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:16,120
any things or people or activities per se and of themselves the focus is always

76
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:22,120
on on a renouncing or or a going forth

77
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,800
from unhealthy states of mind it's always these unhealthy states

78
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:35,279
of mind which are the primary Focus so there's a lot of discussion about renouncing uh uh

79
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,880
sensual Pleasures in the English translation of the Buddhist teachings

80
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:45,920
but it turns out that the word for that's translated as sensual

81
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,959
Pleasures because you can't really renounce sensual Pleasures you'd have to go I don't

82
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:59,920
know go live someplace that's always unpleasant or something

83
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:06,360
find some place like you know hell or something and then maybe you can renounce sensual Pleasures because I

84
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:12,440
mean they're part and parcel of life that the sun is shining and it's nice and I had a lot of pleasure walking down

85
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:18,519
here today just the fresh air it was so nice to breathing it felt Pleasant so you can't really renounce sensual

86
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:23,760
Pleasures but the word that's translated as sensual Pleasures is a a Sanskrit

87
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,560
word poly indic word Kama k m a which has a dual meaning

88
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:38,560
it means sensual pleasures and it means sensual desires and desires a product of the

89
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,880
mind and so what's being let go of is sensual craving sensual

90
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:49,040
compulsions those can be let go of because there might be one or two of you

91
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,560
here that maybe once accidentally in your life uh You Were Somehow caught and

92
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:01,399
trapped by some kind of sensual compulsion it might have been known but I don't want to assume anything that

93
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:07,480
that might have happened to any of you but it does happen to some people that sometimes they regret what they do

94
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:15,040
afterwards and sometimes they make a mess of their family and all kinds of things because of that particular you

95
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:21,120
know drive for sensual pleasures of some sense some sense or other so what what

96
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:26,160
the Buddha was talking about a lot then is not letting go of central Pleasures

97
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,320
um and to make to to make that clear in one of of the texts The Bu Buddha is

98
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:38,720
described as capable of or or or in actuality uh experiencing more sensual

99
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,880
pleas Pleasures than anyone else in the world just with the food he eats and uh

100
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:52,079
and with just walking down this down the street somehow in the Sun or outside and there's graphic depictions of the Buddha

101
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:59,680
just kind of he he's there's no no there's no um hindrances or no no

102
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:07,880
obstacles for him really taking in and experiencing sensual Pleasures to a great degree so it's not sensual Pleasures but

103
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:15,480
it's sensal compulsions that's what's renounced but why is that going to make your life less

104
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:22,920
interesting it certainly will make it U you know less suitable for a soap

105
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:30,839
opera which might be really you know I mean most of the books we novels we read I mean someone is doing something

106
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:37,639
kind of unethical that's what makes it interesting so if we want our our life

107
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:43,880
to be a novel then you know maybe sensual compulsions are how you make it exciting

108
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:50,160
for everyone but maybe it doesn't go end very well those

109
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:57,040
novels in life in real life so the idea to but to renounce them

110
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:02,440
renounce compulsive desires sensual Desires in an unhealthy

111
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,720
way um is not meant to deprive us but is meant to give us something

112
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:16,880
better so the act of renunciation is always a movement to something better and um and what is that there's

113
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,920
certain kind of Freedom certain kind of allowing something from within us to come forth

114
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:29,600
to go forth with the with a healthy wonderful

115
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:37,199
um uh inspiring kind of feeling and movement just as with sitting down to

116
00:12:37,199 --> 00:12:45,920
meditate when you were so tense uh what after that period of meditation maybe was inspiring now to go

117
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:51,320
forth to go on and continue your way and you find yourself surprised because it's

118
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,920
time for lunch and uh you and um but it's not even time for lunch but you you

119
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:03,399
you've been away from your phone for now 30 minutes 60 Minutes I mean that's like

120
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:10,639
a record I mean and so and normally you would like it's sitting right there

121
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:16,000
because you don't want to be too far away from it and so the normally you would just

122
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,680
grab it to look what's happened in the world what's happened with email what's happened in

123
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:30,120
text what's happened with phone calls what's happening on social media what's happened and um but you're so settled

124
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,680
you're comeing into kind of a balanced State of Mind balanced State you're so content here sitting here with the

125
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:40,839
tension is no longer there and you can feel like why

126
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,120
bother why you know the compulsion to look is not there you know what that

127
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:51,279
happens if you go for the phone and you know that right now you're connected

128
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,759
you're here in a nice way so you don't pick it up for that moment you renounce

129
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:03,560
your phone or the desire to do it because you know you're going to lose something that you've gained it's going

130
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:09,199
to diminish you in some way and then you go make your lunch and

131
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:15,759
you sit down to eat and you're so content it's so nice the colors are so good you're so content

132
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:22,160
and happy and the phone is there but you know you're alone eating

133
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:27,880
it's a waste of time you could you could be doing two things at once you have a lot of things to do you might as well

134
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:35,000
check your emails while you're eating and you know but it's so nice to sit and just eat and feel the food and no wonder

135
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:40,390
the Buddha had so much sensual pleasure when he ate because he didn't have a

136
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:48,920
[Laughter] phone and um and so just and so there's

137
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,000
something gained and in fact having meditated felt so good after the

138
00:14:54,000 --> 00:15:00,440
meditation sitting down and eating without looking at a phone and doing anything just being there with the food

139
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:05,519
actually something settles even more it feels even nicer and

140
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,480
better and then you get the phone call from your neighbor saying you know oh something

141
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:17,759
tragic has happened and I feel really sad and and you know I could really use

142
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:23,560
some company and you go over there and you're so glad you did all those things

143
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:29,160
beforehand because now you're completely present and open available you're not to

144
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:34,800
having to be torn away from your phone you're not caught up in the anxiety of what you have to do and you're not going

145
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,399
over there I'll just go there for a little while and I wonder how quickly I can help the person with the grief so I can get back to my

146
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:47,399
phone it's like now you're so happy that you enter this nice quiet homeostasis

147
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:54,040
healthy way because wow you were there for that person in a nice way in a good

148
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:59,639
way and um so so this renouncing

149
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:07,480
letting go is not meant to be deprivation it's meant to actually enhance us and that's the movement if a

150
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:15,639
Buddhist teacher SS Reen tells you to renounce um they should probably change their

151
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:21,959
English they say go forth come out of that shell come out of that prison

152
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:27,240
you've created for yourself come out of that how you're caught in preoccupations

153
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:34,480
concerns that you have come forth I'm here welcome come out join me here in

154
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:40,040
this Freedom so this the poly word for that's

155
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:48,199
translated pronunciation uh it kind of implies both movements it implies a kind of letting

156
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:54,079
go leaving behind something but it also implies the beautiful feeling of going

157
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,519
forth going out into Freedom both meanings are there

158
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,839
um but it's kind of similar to if you're in a house and you go through a door to

159
00:17:04,839 --> 00:17:09,918
another room simultaneously you're leaving one room

160
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,720
behind and going into the next room so this idea can happen together you're

161
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:23,360
simultaneously a letting go of some previous way of being caught and trapped in your mind preoccupied into more of

162
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:30,679
experience of freedom and this dual meaning that goes on is is really explicit in other words

163
00:17:30,679 --> 00:17:35,799
for letting go in in the Buddhist language uh there's the word that

164
00:17:35,799 --> 00:17:42,080
sometimes translated as relinquishment and um and I don't know how often we use the word relinquishment

165
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:50,039
in English usually but usually it's not a good thing like relinquish control something or something but um

166
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:57,080
but anyway it's used for this translation into English and uh it sometimes it's has a it's only used to

167
00:17:57,080 --> 00:18:03,840
describe the times uh a really high level of spiritual maturation and really

168
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:09,080
high levels of strong meditation uh when things are really good you enter into a

169
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:15,080
nice wonderful homeostasis some of the deepest attachments are relinquished given up Let

170
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:21,360
Go however this the word that's being used for relinquishment actually several words that translated as relinquishment

171
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:28,120
in English they have dual meanings sometimes what they mean is

172
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:34,799
giving generosity and so H so what do we you

173
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:42,760
know how are we supposed to do on one hand there's relinquishment it means and the other man it means generosity or giving Which do we choose maybe it's the

174
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:49,520
same thing going through the door in the house both things are meant and so we have a positive

175
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:56,600
Association also with the word relinquishment that means to give the the two of these words that

176
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:02,480
translates relinquishment um uh are U are

177
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:08,440
used to translate a a phrase in ply describes a person who's still living at

178
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:14,440
home like a lay person who um is H is uh

179
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:20,039
their mind is free of stinginess who Delights in giving

180
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:25,600
practices giving uh and

181
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,159
uh and uh freely gives open handedly gives and the word delight is used

182
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:37,240
repeatedly but and because Delights in giving

183
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:42,400
away so sometimes they translate one word as giving and the other one that's

184
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:47,440
giving away that both of them other situations are translated as

185
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:54,120
relinquishment and so we do that little bit in English we have this dual meaning as well when we have the expression uh

186
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:59,799
to give up give up kind of means like to surrender like kind of kind of you kind

187
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:05,400
of collapse and kind of abandon something but um I think originally it

188
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:13,840
meant offer up on the altar to give something up it's kind of a sacred act in the religious sense and so we say

189
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:20,200
giving up or to give away giving away can be have all kinds of meanings but it

190
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:28,159
could also be a beautiful thing to give away something in a generous open-handed way and and so this act of giving

191
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:33,679
contains within it this two these two sides of going through the

192
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,240
door uh if you gave something with your own hands you have to relinquish it Let

193
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:45,480
It Go renounce it with your hands by giving it to someone

194
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:53,400
else but what happens then now your hands are free for the next task whatever life

195
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:58,919
comes with you can now free to do something else and you're so glad to not be carrying this thing around around

196
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:07,640
anymore that was such a you know limiting you you give it away maybe so so giving

197
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:15,039
has both these qualities in it's both a letting go and kind of in that letting go

198
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:23,400
there's a movement of freedom in the hands maybe freedom in the heart as well so back to this word

199
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:30,679
renunciation it has this positive Association that that uh that we gain

200
00:21:30,679 --> 00:21:36,360
what do we gain in this process and so back again to the analogy

201
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:44,840
at the beginning of the talk is um one of the things we gain is

202
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:52,120
homeostasis is a healthy inner life and that's we come into

203
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:59,520
balance and part of the purpose of surrendering or renouncing or relinquishing and all these powerful

204
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:06,799
English words is to enhance something about ourselves not to become less than

205
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:13,480
what we are to maybe come back into who we really are in a certain kind of way

206
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:20,200
in a healthy basic way free of compulsions Free of addictions free of

207
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:25,840
of hostilities free of the ways we're caught and to feel how good that feels

208
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:35,880
from the inside out to feel how we become better by it it because what's waiting in each of us is a healthy heart

209
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:44,799
a healthy mind that's and one of the strategies for coming back into that is

210
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:51,480
to let go of all the forces in the mind which are unhealthy which keeps us tense

211
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,600
Keeps Us in hostility Keeps Us reactive and one of the means of doing

212
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:03,240
that that's I think is a for those people who meditate is um is to

213
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:11,400
meditate and meditation is one way at times where you don't have to do the

214
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:17,240
renouncing it does it for you if you sit quietly and peacefully with time

215
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:22,400
everything that's being held on to will release will

216
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:30,440
settle but there's nothing wrong with you helping out so from time to time you might want

217
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:36,480
to consider letting go and certainly let go enough so you can

218
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:44,080
meditate I know some people who have a hard time getting to the meditations uh to their meditation because there's that

219
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:51,400
phone or all the things that are like that like I have to do I have to you know and the momentum of you know always

220
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:57,880
checking the device or the momentum of certain kind of attachments and preoccupations makes it really hard to

221
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,919
slow down and stop and so when it's really really hard

222
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:10,919
to stop that's when maybe renunciation becomes an act of

223
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:18,279
Courage okay I kind of really have to I really have to do this let me at least

224
00:24:18,279 --> 00:24:23,600
let go physically of what I'm doing I don't know if I can do with my mind but

225
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:30,200
at least physically I'll be sit down it'll be a little bit like being in the rodeo I know the wild

226
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:35,640
Bronco but I'm going to sit there and see what happens and chances are

227
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:43,120
something will settle in quiet chances so

228
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:50,679
renunciation so is that make it a little more popular a little bit more welcome and um I thought it was kind of

229
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:57,200
funny to give this talk because today because um right after Thanksgiving the

230
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:03,200
neighbor started putting up Christmas lights preparing for Christmas and I thought oh good I'll give a talk

231
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:09,720
preparing us for Christmas [Laughter]

232
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:14,880
renunciation so so do we have a few minutes before the end if any of you

233
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:21,480
have any comments or questions or testimonials I see it someone's hand way

234
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,080
out in the back

235
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:42,880
thank you for this talk uh Gil um I have a question about the topic of

236
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:50,440
renunciation uh and that is what is the difference between renunciation and surrender or is there

237
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:56,880
no difference it's not your exactly in your

238
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,840
question not in your question but um I love the word sacrifice uh because it has the word sacred in it it literally

239
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:11,000
means in Latin to make sacred and uh though a sacrifice the way it's used is often again a diminishment or often like

240
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:18,880
you kind of have to give something up and get nothing in return but there is something about giving doing the act of

241
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:26,520
Letting Go or uh that can make something sacred for ourselves so surrender I don't know you

242
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:32,240
know um uh I oh so uh again not asking your

243
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,159
question direct answering your question directly um in terms of um

244
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:43,240
renouncing the Buddha said um when

245
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:48,039
renouncing something is

246
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,840
unhealthy if if renouncing something makes unhealthy State stronger and

247
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:59,640
healthy States decrease that kind of s renouncing you

248
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:05,279
should not do when renouncing makes healthy States stronger

249
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:11,559
and unhealthy States go away that's the kind of renouncing you should

250
00:27:11,559 --> 00:27:17,640
do so ex your question is a good one is you know how do these two compare I

251
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:23,360
don't know how to answer that question because it's a little bit of a linguistic semantic question but this

252
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:30,520
what the this teachings of the Buddha applies to both of those if surrender ing makes things healthier for you and

253
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:37,080
the unhealthy inner life go down do it surrender but if it's not it's the

254
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:42,279
opposite don't do it and you can ask both and maybe then you don't have to compare the two that each thing can be

255
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:47,600
its own thing in your vocabulary thank you yeah is okay that I

256
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:55,039
not quite answer directly um so the way I interpret this is that it is not um it's not a

257
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:02,360
vocabulary question but it's it's something you have to feel within yourself perfect okay thank

258
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,360
you yes so it's more like a testimonial so I came here few weeks ago I was very

259
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:14,919
disturbed and uh I spoke to you I said that I'm being tired of being my own cheerleader and you said you'll be my

260
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:21,360
cheerleader that meant a lot and I said I want to give up before that you know that was one sentence before that and

261
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:26,799
you said don't give up so thank you for doing all this for all of us thank you

262
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:30,120
thank you very much

263
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,840
here in back in the corner here

264
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:46,399
now so this brings a memory of mine that I haven't thought about for a long time

265
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:52,519
um I was um before my husband and I got married we took a trip to Nepal as an

266
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:59,600
experiment to see if we could get along well enough for in that kind of you know camping and you do that after getting

267
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,799
married no before before getting married so we

268
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:11,720
before we got married we went to Nepal um to you know as a test to see how we

269
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,960
could be together in that those circumstances and um two things happened

270
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:26,519
that were um Remar we were in the the kumu area going up towards Everest and there

271
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:33,320
my husband is um he he's just fascinating he's he's he loves anything to do with Nepal and the

272
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:39,399
Everest area and everything um he he studies it he reads you know just absorbs everything and there is this

273
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:46,000
book that he that of that had a picture um of this one from the from one this

274
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:52,320
run Monastery up towards Everest that he wanted to replicate so we were hiking by and he took this

275
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:58,039
picture and he um then I said oh can I borrow your camera you know this is this

276
00:29:58,039 --> 00:30:03,600
this is in um

277
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:11,440
198 86 so we you didn't have phone cameras right so um so I borrowed the

278
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,200
camera and I took some pictures and I put the camera down and we started hiking again with

279
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:26,720
the group it was a small group and I'm a little ways away I'm oh my God I forgot the camera and we dashed back and it was

280
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:32,279
gone um and with the picture that my husband really

281
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:40,960
wanted and he said it's okay and that was such a pivotal moment

282
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,200
in our relationship that he relinquished gave up that

283
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:52,960
picture and in that stepped into you know this basically an expression of

284
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:58,039
love for me and forgiveness um

285
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:03,880
also on that trip I had this was later on we were I we were we had gone into

286
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:09,720
the tent i' taken you know i' always like to put my boots outside the tent

287
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,639
