1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,040
so so [Music]

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,559
so for today's practice i'd like to bring in the theme

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,920
of something that we do at the end of every practice session

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,640
as the expression of meta so what if you have noticed at the end of every session

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,360
we dedicate the merit and what and the dedication of merit you

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:42,079
know sounds kind of big dedication of marriage whereas it's just a sense of you know when we say may

7
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:47,120
all beings be well may all beings be happy and basically offering

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,399
offering the goodness any any goodness that has been generated uh trusting that that there has been

9
00:00:54,399 --> 00:01:00,160
goodness generated from our practice even if we um

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,600
judge it to be shoddy oh my mind was distracted i i wasn't really here i was

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:11,840
only mindful for one split second but trusting trusting that even sitting

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,720
uh first for mindfulness for a split second or just sitting just just the act of coming together and sitting

13
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,920
in the community cultivating and for those who listen to

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,479
the audio dharma later for example or any form of practice this this this practice that we do this

15
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,960
cultivation that we do trusting trusting that there is goodness here that there is goodness generated that we're

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,920
aligning our lives with goodness and then when we trust that

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,280
what does dedicating merit really do well one is

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,399
that it it uh connects us with that

19
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,640
um goodness with reaffirming that yes there is goodness even if i was sleepy even if

20
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,920
the body was in pain today that there was goodness but just coming together

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,520
coming or coming sitting and practicing there is goodness so it reaffirms that

22
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,800
when we dedicate the merit at the at the end and we share it with others so it

23
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,400
reaffirms goodness our own goodness it's a sense of trust a sense of

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:33,120
confidence confidence in our own goodness which is beautiful it's it's a reaffirmation of

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,319
of our own goodness and

26
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,840
another dimension another aspect of this cultivation this dedication of merit

27
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,200
this dedication of goodness that we trust has been generated

28
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,720
is an act of generosity it's an act of generosity

29
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:00,239
instead of oh okay i'm doing my self-improvement project oh i'm getting

30
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:07,920
calmer i'm getting better i'm getting kinder eye there's an act of generosity oh i share

31
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,920
this goodness i don't just keep it for myself i acknowledge the interdependence

32
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,800
of all beings i share it with everyone else made serve may be

33
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,400
of benefit maybe of service to my awakening and all being's

34
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:35,200
awakening and their happiness and well-being so so it's an act of generosity and in that act of generosity

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,560
it's also an act of meta it's an act of kindness we're just

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,560
sharing this goodness like ah here's here you go all beings everywhere

37
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,680
i'm sharing my goodness i trust there is goodness number one number two i i share

38
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,879
it generously with all of you yay love to you all it's like a love note to

39
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:05,519
all beings everywhere yay here is my goodness i share it with you yay

40
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,799
as a blessing so in that way this this um

41
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:16,000
dedication of merit is such a beautiful act it's really an act of generosity an

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,000
act of meta an act of trust and confidence also in our goodness so

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:29,600
there's so many dimensions in in this and i wrote a little article which showed up

44
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,240
in lions roar some years ago so later uh i'll send a pointer i'll i'll

45
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:44,400
ask neil to send a pointer about this uh this sharing of merit so

46
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,960
so so here for our practice today

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,960
tapping into trusting that there is goodness sharing it with as an act of meta

48
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:03,120
and generosity with others and i want to bring one more aspect here

49
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,560
today into today and that is and this is something that i learned

50
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,160
from a a good friend of mine uh who's been a

51
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:19,840
monk and pride has practiced in asia for

52
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,280
four decades almost and and

53
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:31,039
when when he did the dedication of merit and kind of traditionally in the buddhist

54
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,320
censors that the um dedication started with dedicating the

55
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:43,600
goodness to people to our benefactors to our parents to people who have supported us who have

56
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:50,560
been kind to us in any way well basically our benefactors whether they're alive or whether they

57
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,680
have passed away and there's and also just to say that connects with

58
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,199
my culture the persian culture there's this idea of generating merit and

59
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:08,000
sharing it with the deceased and i know it's the same way in japanese culture and many other cultures around

60
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:13,440
the world so sharing it with our benefactors and

61
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:19,039
then sharing it with other beings in in in

62
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,160
concentric circles opening more and more with more generosity

63
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:31,039
so so with all of that we'll bring

64
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,560
these into our practices of metta today

65
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,840
so let's begin let's formally begin our sitting sitting

66
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:48,520
ah and landing

67
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,400
blending in this body

68
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,919
in this moment in time

69
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:37,759
feeling the connection of our toes

70
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:44,919

71
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:53,759

168
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:57,039
automatically grow immediately so the more you gave away the more generosity

169
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:02,159
the more goodness you gave away may all beings

170
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:09,679
be well be happy be healthy

171
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:18,960
have ease have safety the more you give away goodness

172
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:23,278
ah the more goodness

173
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,480
becomes available in your heart in your garden

174
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:38,480
sharing trusting there is abundance in your heart

175
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:47,360
trusting there is abundance even if it may not be readily visible right now trusting there

176
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:52,398
is more abundance in your being

177
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:59,919

183
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,560

with others and many times it has been mentioned in

210
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:31,520
this community in the sangha when someone shares something it's it's

211
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:38,800
inspiring for others whether it's a question whether there's a challenge you have or there's something you realized

212
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,480
your mind found a new way to work with something so

213
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,880

215
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:03,760

218
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,400
but if you're willing you're welcome to say more if you like what what came up

219
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:29,200
for you um i i i was concerned that when you mentioned

220
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,480
about focusing on people that are no longer there that it would maybe get out of hand it got emotional

221
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,720
but it you know i didn't have a true meltdown so that's good um

222
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:50,319
but it was it just it's very emotional experience it was good so thank you

223
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:58,560
thank you bill yeah thank you for sharing that in what you shared i i hear a connecting

224
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:04,920
and a heart opening experience of appreciation especially with those who are deceased which can sometimes become

225
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:11,599
overwhelming with grief but in this case it didn't sound like okay it was emotional but oh it was more supported

226
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:17,599
with meta and appreciation instead of the grief and sadness that's what i'm hearing

227
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,520
powerful beautiful bill lovely great that's a great opening in that

233
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:03,280
at the beginning of the pandemic two weeks into the lockdown so she's pretty much on my mind all the

234
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:09,839
time but today i brought her into focus

235
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:16,319
to thank her for 44 years together i thanked her parents

236
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:22,760

244
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,400
were very supportive that one has a warm connection with

245
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:27,200
especially in childhood and things like that then it's easy to send loving kindness to them but what surprised me

246
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:33,599
was how easy it was to send loving kindness to people who had been difficult in my

247
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:41,680
childhood or in my younger life um people i'd had very contentious

248
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:49,078
situations with and it was easy and i was grateful for that

249
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:59,119
thank you abraham ah i feel so much joy as you as you say

00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:40,960
the flowers that you give away instantly replenish and grow in your garden and

256

thank you barbara i appreciate you highlighting the the imagery because sometimes

258
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,960
imagery can really help us again we sometimes it doesn't but sometimes it can really work

259
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:12,000
in ways to as well as metaphor there's something about embodiment of these experiences

260
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:20,160
that we have that oh flowers we give flowers to people as an expression of thanks of kindness of just like oh yes

especially tenderly today with this practice that we have done

279
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,880
um and starting as always with 15 seconds

280
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:25,119
of silent compassion silent meta compassion for ourselves for others

281

and sharing as much or as little as you like about your practice

282
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:38,400
supporting each other holding each other we don't do this practice alone as you know

283
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:46,079
we support each other um so see what needs to be held for you

284
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,680
and what needs to be held for others these beautiful beings who have their

285
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:57,359
own gardens their own flowers so

286
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:06,000
created the rooms and now they are open take care of yourself and each other

287
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:13,040
okay the rooms are closed everybody's back and uh we have a couple minutes for

288
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:18,800
reflections violet please

289
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:26,880
hi nikki hi everyone hi um in our group we talked a bit about

290
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:32,480
fear that arises during this practice so when

291
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:39,359
so this idea of like giving love and i don't know like this garden that keeps producing flowers or this infinite

292
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:45,280
source of love that you can keep giving and it doesn't run out but when i am trying to

293
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:53,599
cultivate that and other people in my group also had this experience this like very raw fear comes up in

294
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:59,680
terms of like this is not a good thing to do this is not a wise thing to do to give your heart

295
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:06,800
in this way this is unsafe this is not good and yeah just a lot of like fear and

296
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:12,319
terror that comes up so i was wondering like where do you find

297
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:18,720
like stability and safety in the practice like when you're sort of opening your heart in this big way for

298
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:24,880
the whole world yeah yeah so

299
00:50:24,880 --> 00:50:31,040
thank you first of all thanks so much for bringing this up and and um

300
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:36,400
from the reflection reflection from your group especially um

301
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:43,520
so so when the sense of primo you know the sense of fear comes up that this is this

302
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:49,680
is not mean um in that case what i would suggest actually working with it

303
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:55,920
with the ways different two different ways one is the ways we work with with fear

304
00:50:55,920 --> 00:51:03,760
with uh with meta right because actually meta is an antidote to fear so some

305
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:09,359
comforting yourself said some it's okay sweetie it's okay it's safe it's all

306
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:14,880
right it's all right so making your fear feel safe instead of pushing the fear

307
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:20,559
away or trying to push through it like i'm gonna do this because then the fear doesn't

308
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:26,720
feel safe or acknowledged it will just throw a tantrum so it becomes rather difficult

309
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:33,200
to do the practice so acknowledge the fear it's okay sweetie it's all right it's okay it's okay

310
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:39,200
and and and turning the meta to yourself so there's enough stability to then like

311
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:45,520
okay there's more stability there's more trust it's okay and then tap dipping your toes into the practice

312
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:52,880
again in this way you can expand further and further and further so that at some point maybe the fear comes up but it's

313
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:58,319
not believed it's like it's okay sweetie you can be here it's all right for your darling you can be here too and and

314
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:06,000
there can be a trust in the abundance both of them can be together so little by little but definitely not

315
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:13,520
trying to push through the fear but trying to see the fear of just being kind kind to yourself kind of here and

316
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:18,559
not necessarily believing it it's it's you know when the child that has a

317
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:25,119
tantrum you you comfort it and you don't say well you're just having a tantrum like get up and

318
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:31,920
you know go out playing like oh sweetie i know this is hard darling it's okay sweetheart but yet you're older wiser

319
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,119
you know that the sky isn't falling right but at the same time you are very

320
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:44,839
kind and compassionate to the child who's having a tantrum so with the same attitude does that make sense

321
00:52:44,839 --> 00:52:50,400
violet yeah so send the meta to the fear and then eventually

322
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,920
can hold the fear and abundance at the same time and at some point i think

323
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:03,760
the fear will will be laid will be laid over time but

324
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,520
but for now yes holding the fear with metta and i'd love

325
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,960
to hear more uh if as you practice with this i'd love to hear what comes up for

326
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,720
you and and what and others too to to navigate this

327
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:28,520
yeah but not turning away thank you thanks yeah

328
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:35,200
so so one last question over time but i just want to say so is the fear seen as

329
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:41,839
protective and welcomed as part of mecca not so much it's not

330
00:53:41,839 --> 00:53:48,400
it's not you know it's it's um so i wouldn't see it as a part of metta

331
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:55,359
but i would see it again as a part of us part of our patterning

332
00:53:55,359 --> 00:54:01,599
that's having a little tantrum so it's it's not necessarily a supportive

333
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:07,040
helpful aspect of of our psychology in that way i think

334
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:15,359
that's i think that's what your question is but for perhaps for scarcity in the past or or fear in the past uh something

335
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:20,720
that arises anyway i feel like this is a much bigger

336
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:27,920
um conversation and we're already over time so maybe we'll we'll come back to this

337
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:33,280
later everyone maybe we'll come back to this so

338
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:38,559
so so i'll stay tell you what i'll stay a few minutes extra tonight

339
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:45,359
how about that i'll say a few minutes extra for anyone who wants to stay uh after we're going to close formally

340
00:54:45,359 --> 00:54:52,960
but i'll stay afterwards if anyone wants to continue and discuss this so thank you all for showing up for your practice

341
00:54:52,960 --> 00:55:01,200
may all beings be well may all beings be happy including ourselves

342
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,920
thanks everyone
