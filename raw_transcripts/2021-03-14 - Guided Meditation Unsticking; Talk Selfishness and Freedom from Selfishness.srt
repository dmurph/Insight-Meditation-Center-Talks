1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:04,960
hello everyone and

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,799
happy to be here to uh share this meditation time with you

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:21,600
and i have been thinking this morning how meditation is um maybe it's helpful to think of

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,359
meditation as a way of both stepping into the middle

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:35,680
of our lives right smack in the middle as it is and also stepping out of our lives to take a very

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:42,239
different perspective for what's happening and one way to bring those two together is the idea

7
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,559
that we sit in the middle of our lives to

8
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,800
unstick ourselves from our lives to so we don't we don't get caught

9
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,840
caught or stuck in whatever is happening in our lives and meditation is an

10
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,400
unsticking process de-sticking ourselves and this thinking doesn't mean

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:14,799
that we reject anything but it does mean that we're simply not stuck we're not glued to it

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:21,200
and that process of de-sticking helps if we think of meditation as not

13
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,320
being business as usual not going along with however it is that we

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,880
usually are the attitude the approach the focus the orientation

15
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:40,560
and to be willing to have be open to a different way of being

16
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,200
so sitting in meditation

17
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,798
and taking a posture assuming a posture

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,798
that as if you're sitting in the middle of your life

19
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,880
everything is included

20
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:09,840
and if it's comfortable for you to gently close your eyes

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:23,120
and then to relax a little bit initially maybe taking a

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:31,359
few long deep breaths and really letting go and relaxing on the exhale

23
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:38,080
so we're letting go of some of the preoccupations and concerns and tensions we have

24
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,480
so we can better sit in the middle of it all we can feel ourselves really here in this body

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:53,440
in this heart this mind without the centrifugal force outwards

26
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,040
into thoughts and concerns

27
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:08,480
and then letting your breathing be normal again and continue for a minute or so

28
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,200
a process of physically relaxing

29
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,480
especially on the exhale softening the face

30
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:47,840
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders

31
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,440
and softening the belly

32
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:01,840
and perhaps to do things a little different than usual

33
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:09,760
feel your way into your heart your mind your body especially maybe your body

34
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,120
to a place that you associate with well-being

35
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,400
a place you associate with contentment and ease

36
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,160
maybe joy and happiness

37
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:34,880
maybe kind of a well-being that feels deeply satisfying quiet contented

38
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,800
and even if you don't feel that now where in your body do you most associate

39
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,918
with those feelings

40
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,840
and if you breathe with that place breathe through it

41
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,360
maybe even feeling some of the contentment or ease or well-being

42
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:11,840
even if it's just hints of it

43
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:24,320
and if you even if you don't feel it to be have the breathing arise

44
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:29,360
out of the place that you associate with well-being

45
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:39,840
or have the breathing move through it or accompany it

46
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,840
so as you breathe in the middle of your life sit here in the middle of your life as

47
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:53,840
it is you're breathing

48
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,880
maybe arises out of a place of well-being

49
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:07,840
your breathing somehow breathes through it or with it

50
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,319
perhaps it's a quiet place of tenderness of contentment

51
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:23,840
of a simple ease or peacefulness

52
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,639
well-being

53
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,520
and with that as a gentle reference point for breathing

54
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:41,199
the rhythm of breathing breathing in and breathing out

55
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:48,720
can help you unstick help you sit in the middle of your life

56
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:56,880
and let go of the stickiness the grasping the holding on gravitational pull

57
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:06,400
and the breathing with well-being breathing with contentment

58
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:17,360
as a support that helps the heart the mind to dissolve

59
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:24,000
the stickiness of preoccupations concerns

60
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:32,560
resentments and fears desires and expectations

61
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:39,440
here content to breathe in the middle of it all

62
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:47,440
making your home be the breathing breathing from the place of

63
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,759
contentment and well-being in the midst

64
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:58,960
whatever discontent you might feel

65
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,520
not being not setting the two up in opposition

66
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:13,840
but breathing sitting at the middle of it

67
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,639
and every time you return to your breathing every time you ride your breath

68
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:27,840
it's like a massage

69
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:38,079
for dissolving the stickiness of life the holding the clinging the resistance

70
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:46,320
softening opening relaxing further here

71
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:55,839
and now

72
00:31:54,799 --> 00:32:00,480
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

73
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:09,120
are you in some ways have you in some ways unstuck yourself through the meditation

74
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:17,679
have you loosened up a little bit the momentum of the mind the clinging

75
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:25,279
no wanting the spinning have you dissolved or softened the glue

76
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:32,480
the stickiness keeping you wedded to preoccupations and

77
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,120
concerns

78
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:47,760
and what is it like what would it be like to be unstuck no

79
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:56,559
stickiness and to bring into your heart now

80
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:02,000
the people of your life those you know those you don't know personally

81
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:07,039
neighbors and store clerks and people in the streets

82
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:13,039
and just the whole range of people that you might encounter or think about

83
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:22,000
and what would be like to just take bring these people to mind

84
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:28,240
at the end of the meditation and to continue to unstick

85
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,519
de-stick yourself

86
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:41,200
to loosen the ties the entanglements just to breathe with others breathe with

87
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,640
the people the beings around you

88
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:52,000
nothing to do and nothing to you need to say for these few minutes

89
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:59,360
just to breathe with these people

90
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:11,118
and in such a simple way can you now maybe

91
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:20,480
have thoughts of goodwill thoughts of well-wishing for others

92
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,158
from this from your inner sense of care and

93
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,398
kindness compassion

94
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:40,398
to have thoughts about how wonderful it would be if others could be happy and safe

95
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:49,838
peaceful and free

96
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:54,878
and the less sticky we are in those relationship

97
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:02,800
the more we're going to support the happiness and well-being and peacefulness

98
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,200
of others and the more sticky we are

99
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:13,200
the more complicated these relationships

100
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:22,880
become in whatever way that you have

101
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:30,000
more unstuck may the benefit of that be

102
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,760
shared with others so you engage and talk and communicate

103
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,440
with others with less stickiness

104
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:49,359
less entanglement more contentment more ease

105
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:54,480
more breathing with others

106
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,880
so that you don't so easily get stuck again

107
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:13,838
may all beings be happy and free

108
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:28,260
[Music]

109
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:26,400
so a couple of announcements before i begin the talk first is that um

110
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:34,480
i'll have a community meeting on zoom tomorrow morning after the 7 a.m sitting in dharma talks it'll be

111
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:40,000
at 7 45 or so and it's partly to commemorate the one

112
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,720
year anniversary of of uh starting the seven a.m sittings

113
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:55,760
and it's also for many of us marx commemorates also the one-year anniversary of

114
00:37:55,760 --> 00:38:01,920
sheltering in place where our life has changed dramatically

115
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:09,839
a year ago and different places of course went into shelter at different times but at least here in california

116
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:15,760
to a year ago it's been a big year and i almost was going to give a talk today

117
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:20,880
about grief and maybe i'll do that in a couple of weeks but

118
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:28,400
i wasn't quite ready for that and and then next week i won't be here

119
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:36,800
next week a wonderful teacher amana johnson is going to speak she is

120
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,960
she graduated a year and a half ago from the teacher training for at spirit rock so she's a local

121
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,160
dharma teacher and um and uh very happy to have her come

122
00:38:48,160 --> 00:39:01,838
and and spend sunday morning with you

123
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:08,960
so imagine

124
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:16,320
that you're in a beautiful place in nature that maybe someplace you've been

125
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:24,000
and found inspiring and maybe far away from buildings and roads and a lot of people

126
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,040
and it's just an expanse of a natural setting beautiful comfortable

127
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:38,320
safe inspiring place to be and maybe it's so inspiring maybe you

128
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,000
visit regularly to appreciate and feel the freedom of just roaming around and

129
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:49,839
the trees and the skies and the hills and the rivers and the lakes

130
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:55,440
whatever it might be just a vast space that's wonderful to be in

131
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,640
and um so after visiting many times you think this is special and you want to

132
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:08,640
kind of mark the specialness of it some some nice way and creative way and so uh

133
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:16,960
you bring a um with you into the wilderness a glass door with a frame

134
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,880
it's a bit of an effort to bring it in there and you install that door right in the middle of

135
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,160
the wilderness this glass door swings open very nicely at its frame

136
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:33,200
and there it is this door middle of the wilderness some people might think it's an art

137
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:39,680
installation and but it's your door and uh

138
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:44,880
kind of marks that this space this place is so special for you it's kind of like marking it as being special

139
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:52,560
and and that uh you know symbolically it's a door into a different landscape and different place and but

140
00:40:52,560 --> 00:41:00,000
now when you go visit in this big vast open space there in the middle there's a door

141
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,640
and and you put happen to put it right in the middle of a trail so that when you go in the trail you

142
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:13,359
have to open the door and step through and so the door is there and

143
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:21,359
you like this door and sometimes it gets locked by mistake and you have to go home and get the key to unlock it and

144
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,800
sometimes it gets rusty being in the weather and you have to oil it so that it can open and close and

145
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:34,000
some being a glass door sometimes it gets dirty and you have to clean it and you care for this door and after a

146
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:39,680
while you think of this door as your door and um and you want to protect your door

147
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,280
and so you because the door represents this openness to

148
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,760
into this wilderness and this freedom that's there and so you decide that the thing to do is to put a fence around the door to

149
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:58,800
really protect it so the moose doesn't come along and knock it down and and break the glass so you put the fence

150
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:05,119
around it and you come out there and you feel my door is protected and after a while

151
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:10,240
the um you start feeling you look around say well this incl incl this place where i enclosed the

152
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:16,640
feds it's not really big enough for me it's that you know really you know i'd like more space to be able to come in

153
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,319
and and just kind of be spacious and open and and so you expand the fence make it

154
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:27,440
bigger and bigger and after a while you don't want to really see the fence you make the fence

155
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:33,359
really big and goes around the hills and outside of you and so you go inside you

156
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:38,720
know just you and the door and the doors kind of maybe sometimes

157
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:44,079
gets branches fall on it and break it and you fix it and

158
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:50,160
all kinds of things happen to the door and eventually you would wonder about

159
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:57,280
the door and then you remove the door

160
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:05,040
and then there's vast open space again then you remove the fence and it's just like it was before it's

161
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:13,119
still beautiful beautiful location inspiring a peaceful wonder wonder wonderful to roam around in

162
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,960
and then you think what was i doing with the door what was i doing with a fence

163
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:28,160
so this may be a little silly story is introduction to the topic today

164
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:34,480
which is the buddha's teachings on selfishness

165
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,280
the earliest teachings of the buddha as best we know he did not teach anything about not-self

166
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,760
this you know famous teachings of of the buddha

167
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,720
it wasn't his focus but rather he was focused on

168
00:43:53,359 --> 00:44:00,880
talking about their problems and their suffering around being selfish and how a wise person let go selfishness

169
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:07,119
and as he developed his teaching he described three different ways of being

170
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:12,640
selfish or self-focused or self-preoccupied in some way and one

171
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:20,880
was through craving one was through conceit and the other is through

172
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:26,799
metaphysical opinions and views beliefs that we hold on to

173
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:35,440
so the craving uh idea of selfishness he associates with possessiveness

174
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:42,720
possessing things these are mine this is mine the conceit

175
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:48,000
is associated with the idea of i am um

176
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,960
you know that i am something that i am this i am that so it's a row identities that we take on

177
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:02,880
and hold on to and um and the third is um um

178
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:09,119
um this is myself that this is a true self now i know what

179
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,480
the self is and this is what the self is what my true self is my essence is

180
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:20,160
and in pali these little expressions appear a lot in the suttas it's

181
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:29,040
me and eso

182
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,000
eso and it's kind of close to what we say in

183
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,480
english of me myself and mine he kind of says it in reverse this is

184
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:47,920
mine this i am and this is myself

185
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:54,880
this is the self so um and the reason to

186
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:00,960
notice this and pay attention to it it's the domain the the qualities of selfishness of being

187
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:08,480
caught up in excessive excessive preoccupation with oneself a strong attachment clinging

188
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:14,960
self-centeredness that can happen and and this movement towards selfing and

189
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:21,839
getting holding on to self is uh is uh limits our freedom

190
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:28,000
it uh does something which is not really necessary to cling to the self that is a

191
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,200
comparable to this idea if you will if you allow me of putting this door right in

192
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:39,839
the middle of the wilderness the wilderness was beautiful and wonderful by itself and it was a wonderful place to visit

193
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:45,599
and peaceful and relaxing and it was so much more less complicated to be there when

194
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:52,640
you didn't have to take care of the door and protect the door and repair the door and build fences

195
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:58,079
around the door and um so the same thing the natural

196
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:04,880
kind of a natural state of being that um can be quite open and peaceful

197
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:11,680
and inspiring to experience for oneself uh that um it doesn't require

198
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:20,160
placing uh something in the middle this is mine this is who i am this is myself

199
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,400
that movement is kind of an extra movement that that places something in the natural

200
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,599
setting which more often than not does not need it especially if what we're doing is

201
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:38,240
clinging and holding on to to these things so conventionally that we might say

202
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:44,000
things are mine and um and you know it's a lot we say

203
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,440
it's so you know things are mine things are legally mined there's ownership there's things which

204
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:57,040
we allow each other to have but but the selfishness around that

205
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,319
is when we cling to mind we hold on to it for dear life like it has to be this way

206
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:10,000
and this movement towards possessiveness and claiming things as mine but this belongs to me is a recipe for

207
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,200
suffering the uh one famous kind of

208
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:20,800
origin story in buddhism that the beginning of the one of the beginnings of the downturn of

209
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:28,160
the of society was private property and then people started uh

210
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,839
hoarding in their private property and stealing and things got out of hand in

211
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:41,440
this mythic story so the idea of it's mine and holding

212
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:47,599
holding it tight not realizing that possession possessions of all kinds anything we can

213
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:53,760
say is mine is fragile it's temporary is uh there's no guarantee that it's

214
00:48:53,760 --> 00:49:00,240
going to stay around that i read recently about a

215
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:05,760
meteorite or asteroid that kind of landed in the driveway of someone in i think in scotland i think it was

216
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:12,640
or somewhere and um the rare rare mineral that

217
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:19,200
came in this asteroid and um but there's no you know guarantee that lighting's not going to strike us

218
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:25,040
or strike our things like our car or bicycle and asteroid's not going to fall and something we

219
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:30,880
own and then we don't own it anymore it's gone you know it just becomes a squash piece of

220
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:36,480
burnt stuff and uh the idea that it is me myself and that

221
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:45,760
it's mine has disappeared um the um you know i've

222
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:52,000
recently i broke a bowl ceramic bowl that my son had made

223
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:57,040
and beautiful bowl and i broke it in the kitchen and it was ours belonged to our family but

224
00:49:57,040 --> 00:50:03,280
as soon as i was broken i didn't really think about think of it anymore as mine or i didn't think of it as belong to my

225
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:09,200
family i rather unceremoniously just kind of put it in the trash and

226
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:14,400
off it went and um

227
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:20,480
the the um

228
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:29,200
so mine as i love the story that's suzuki roshi i've told him many times of

229
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,240
suzuki roshi is um there's a photograph of him actually

230
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:39,680
saying this taken just as he was saying it so it's kind of more poignant he was photographing him

231
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:45,680
holding up his glasses like this and he says these are not my glasses

232
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:51,920
but you know about my old tired eyes so you let me use them so that's a very different relationship

233
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:57,839
to my glasses and so

234
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:03,760
certainly it's convenient to have things that we use and know they're there and they're reliably going to be there next

235
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,880
day when we find them and so we're seeing their mind but you might reflect a little bit

236
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:15,520
about how much extra attachment there might be possesses in this fear fear of safety

237
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:22,559
fear of not being safe attachment to to status attachment to all kinds of

238
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:28,400
things that come we say something is mine it gets more kind of interesting when you look at

239
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:33,920
that we take as mine of traits of our personality or

240
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:39,760
qualities of our physique and our body and ways that we are in the world

241
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:46,079
opinions my opinions and and if we hold on to those and cling

242
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:52,079
to those and think they're unchanging we'll suffer so there's suffering of taking things as

243
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:57,359
mine and for the buddha it's very explicit even taking this body

244
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:04,880
as mine is a recipe for more suffering and and so you know isn't it natural and

245
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:11,520
normal take this body as mine i think it's natural normal conventionally to take it as mine my

246
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:18,319
body but uh but to do so with an open hand not clinging to it just

247
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:26,000
lightly provisionally but as soon as you say my body that i you know them then i have to be

248
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:31,440
in charge of it and i can't change and it has to always stay the same

249
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:38,400
maybe the second form of selfishness is conceit and this

250
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,480
is the idea of over evaluating oneself it has to do

251
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,800
with how we value ourselves in relationship to other people and the common way in english the word

252
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:56,400
conceit refers to thinking that we're somehow have a higher value than others

253
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,839
we are better than others in some ways and and so it's a form of comparative

254
00:53:01,839 --> 00:53:10,079
thinking and as soon as we get involved in comparative thinking with other people this is really a amazing source of

255
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:16,319
suffering uh comparative thinking um you know things are constantly shifting in the

256
00:53:16,319 --> 00:53:21,520
social world and between us and our abilities and other people's abilities and so

257
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:28,000
um you know if we expect to always have a higher evaluation other people will meet someone else who's going to be

258
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:33,440
better if you know i'm pretty good at basketball for someone who you know compared to

259
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:39,119
the six-year-old next door but not compared to most adult men at this

260
00:53:39,119 --> 00:53:45,200
point and so do i hold on to that do i have a conceit around i'm a good basketball

261
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:50,720
player better than everyone else uh you know i'll probably just suffer

262
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:57,760
around that kind of idea and so this comparative thinking is

263
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:03,119
an unnecessary glass door in the wilderness in the natural setting

264
00:54:03,119 --> 00:54:08,319
it uh it mars the situation it limits it it becomes something then that we need

265
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:13,839
to protect we put fences around it we want more and more fences and control for it

266
00:54:13,839 --> 00:54:20,160
and now it actually is a form of of limiting ourselves rather than

267
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,760
freeing ourselves there's a wonderful cartoon from calvin and hobbes

268
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:31,760
where calvin is um in the snow building a fort and it can make him feel safe in this

269
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:38,640
fort and he's building up the wall so it just goes above his head and and he's making it really tight and

270
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:46,240
compact and and he surrounds himself with all the snow to make a good safe fort for himself but it's uh

271
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:52,640
basically he's made a round little cone around himself and once it's all finished he's trapped

272
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:58,640
inside and he says help help because he can't get out anymore

273
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:04,079
so so this idea of conceit is a can become a trap we've kind of

274
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:09,680
protected too much and we kind of can't breathe even me myself and mine

275
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:14,720
the conceit of being better than and in the ancient buddhist language

276
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:20,960
buddhist teachings a word which was closely related to

277
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:28,319
mano mana the word for conceit is the word mada and the

278
00:55:28,319 --> 00:55:34,559
means to be intoxicated totally confused and wrapped up in things and sometimes

279
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:40,319
it's translated as pride but the english word pride maybe has a variety of different

280
00:55:40,319 --> 00:55:45,680
meanings these days and sometimes they're positive but since the original meaning of in

281
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:51,760
talks of this word mada is pride is intoxication

282
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:58,400
one translation of ancient abhidhamma text is to list all kinds of things people

283
00:55:58,400 --> 00:56:03,839
are intoxicated intoxicated by so in intoxicated by

284
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:10,880
their birth by their caste basically intoxicated by their clan

285
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:18,799
intoxicated by their health by youth intoxicated with life

286
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:26,880
itself intoxicated with gain and acquisitions intoxicated with honor

287
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:33,359
with being respected with fame with having followers with wealth

288
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:42,839
with skin color with learning with intelligence with not being despised accomplishments

289
00:56:42,839 --> 00:56:49,680
popularity with being ethical with meditation attainments and the list

290
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:55,359
goes on and on but each of these is seen as a kind of pride they kind of conceit

291
00:56:55,359 --> 00:57:02,880
and conceit that we get intoxicated by or get caught by and it's so much easier

292
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:09,680
to be in life in the world without getting caught by these comparative

293
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:14,799
thinking with others one form of comparative thinking that in the buddhist idea of

294
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:21,200
conceit is also the idea of thinking that we're less than other people that we have less value than others in

295
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:26,880
some way and that's also a conceit because it's also an attachment to an idea of self

296
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,880
attachment to a comparative way of thinking and and the solution is not to figure

297
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:38,720
out a better way to compare and even the idea of comparing ourselves as equals to others

298
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:46,000
and buddhism is considered to be partly are you still playing the comparison game but rather freedom is found by not

299
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:52,240
comparing by allowing ourselves and others to be just as they are

300
00:57:52,240 --> 00:57:58,160
and much more and so removing the door and the fences in the middle of the wilderness and letting that

301
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:03,760
natural setting be itself the third kind of conceit

302
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:09,599
is the conceit of views of philosophical opinions beliefs about

303
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:15,040
what is the true self the essential self and the buddha said there's he he knew

304
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:20,240
of his time no belief in an essential self a true self

305
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:26,559
that doesn't bring suffering and i don't haven't done the analysis myself to see if that's really the case

306
00:58:26,559 --> 00:58:32,480
but it's certainly a provocative idea that um and certainly we can say that anytime we

307
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:37,920
crave or cling to something we will suffer and so if we're clinging and claiming

308
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:44,640
craving clinging or craving to a view an idea my true self is my soul my true self is

309
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:50,559
my is my you know inner goodness my true self is my is my

310
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:55,680
um you know whatever it might be my consciousness

311
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:02,240
um is that going to give birth to suffering does it bring suffering when we're not

312
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:07,280
in touch with that true self when it's not evident and present does it just remain

313
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:15,359
an idea that we have and so the idea needs to be reinforced needs to be reasserted in order to keep

314
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:20,559
staying in touch with it because maybe you can't be really feel and felt

315
00:59:20,559 --> 00:59:26,480
and experienced or what about deep meditation whenever we feel or experience as

316
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:32,559
the essence of who we are falls away then some people get really frightened

317
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:38,880
by this um because the deep deep peace of meditation where things just let go we

318
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:43,920
let go of all clinging it's remarkable how wonderful that

319
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:50,880
that piece is i want remarkable how liberating it can be and how ordinary reference points for

320
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:56,960
anything we have as we experience as myself dissolve and then if but some people get

321
00:59:56,960 --> 01:00:03,280
really frightened because that's who they think they are i am this and i have to be this

322
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:09,040
so so selfishness

323
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:15,280
and the antidote to selfishness in buddhism it certainly

324
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:21,839
is to see the suffering of it and sometimes it's only by seeing how painful it is and how

325
01:00:21,839 --> 01:00:29,280
fragile it is and how much energy goes into being selfish that people begin to loosen up and let

326
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:35,359
go but the other the other antidote

327
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:41,839
is happiness is uh to experience deep abiding sense of

328
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:49,599
happiness well-being contentment that doesn't require being selfish and so to

329
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:57,440
that's one of the functions of meditation practice is not only to become calm not only be mindful but to acquire a

330
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,720
sense of deeper contentment satisfaction ease

331
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:08,400
to be able to breathe easily freely without any clinging to selfishness any kind of

332
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:14,880
idea of me myself and mine at least to give ourselves a radical break from it

333
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:20,799
so we don't come into meditation and hold on to these ideas of me myself and mine

334
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:27,200
often the the source the fuel for a lot of our preoccupied thinking is

335
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:34,880
me myself and mine and to let go of that so we can experience something really wonderful

336
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:40,319
and to value this wonderful beautiful natural setting that we have

337
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:48,799
the natural capacity for ease and freedom and peace and to learn how to wander freely openly

338
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:55,680
in our own hearts and our own minds and our own life without the glass door in the middle of

339
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:03,359
it all without the fences all around it so it's unobstructed by it all

340
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:11,520
where we don't need to advertise ourselves or promote ourselves or should explain to people who we are and

341
01:02:11,520 --> 01:02:18,319
and assert ourselves on people as a form of clinging

342
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:27,359
and a sense of well-being and one of the benefits of discovering

343
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:32,559
such kind of well-being and peace and ease and letting go of all this is that

344
01:02:32,559 --> 01:02:37,680
then it also might be easier to

345
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:45,119
to stand up for oneself when society around you

346
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:51,359
defines you when society around you says you can't be that how you how you are

347
01:02:51,359 --> 01:02:56,480
you have to be different or you are in this kind of way if we don't get

348
01:02:56,480 --> 01:03:03,520
if we have our own stability inside and peace inside that we know and we're not wrapped up

349
01:03:03,520 --> 01:03:10,079
around our identity issues and then in the way that this clinging is involves clinging

350
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:17,680
then it can be quite powerful to stand up for ourselves and say no to people not not go along

351
01:03:17,680 --> 01:03:25,119
with what people are how people are defining us how other people's me myself and mine

352
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:32,880
you yourself and and yours is really oppressive for many people

353
01:03:32,880 --> 01:03:39,520
and and so the idea of really looking deeply at selfishness

354
01:03:39,520 --> 01:03:45,760
and how it works with me myself and mine is also a gift so that we don't

355
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:52,559
project you yourself and yours onto others in ways that makes

356
01:03:52,559 --> 01:03:58,799
makes them oppressed imagine if we can live in a world where

357
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:03,920
we don't put any fences around anyone we don't put any glass doors that block

358
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:09,440
anyone's path where we allow the

359
01:04:09,440 --> 01:04:14,640
the people to be how they are we allow the natural world to unfold in a

360
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:20,319
beautiful way without the limitations

361
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:26,799
and the problems of our clinging especially the clinging to selfishness

362
01:04:26,799 --> 01:04:31,839
may it be that this meditation practice shows us the limitations

363
01:04:31,839 --> 01:04:38,559
shows us the suffering of our selfishness so that we become

364
01:04:38,559 --> 01:04:44,880
more open more free more generous more kind more forgiving

365
01:04:45,039 --> 01:04:51,760
and more in a certain kind of way natural the

366
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:58,000
kind of naturalness is there when there's no clinging so i hope that gives you something to

367
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,200
think about and to reflect on and and hopefully you're forgiving of

368
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:09,359
yourself if you happen to have some conceit or some me myself and mine

369
01:05:09,359 --> 01:05:15,280
but you might want to take a deeper look at this this this topic and make it a study for the week and

370
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:20,799
and it's this is uh this list that i read from the ancient texts

371
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:27,520
about intoxicated intoxicated when i saw this list i was kind of delighted

372
01:05:27,520 --> 01:05:34,559
that they being intoxicated preoccupied caught up in things like health and youth and

373
01:05:34,559 --> 01:05:41,920
gain honor being respected fame having followers our learning

374
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:47,440
accomplishments popularity all kinds of things it's been going on for thousands of

375
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:54,720
years this is kind of what humans tend to do especially when they come together

376
01:05:54,720 --> 01:06:01,760
so if you have if you're involved in some of it as well you have a lot of company and you have

377
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:07,119
the company of the buddha of freedom you have the company of yourself

378
01:06:07,119 --> 01:06:14,640
perhaps in meditation where you're beginning to loosen up and unstick yourselves from all forms of

379
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:23,119
selfishness may you be may you let go of selfishness

380
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:33,839
and find out how to be really happy in this life thank you
