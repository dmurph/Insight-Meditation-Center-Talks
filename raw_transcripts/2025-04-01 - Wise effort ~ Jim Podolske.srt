1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,960
well good evening everyone welcome my name is Jim Podolski i'm

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,400
filling in for Diana tonight as she's u off on

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:24,760
retreat over the last couple weeks she's been giving a number of talks that have included talking about the um five

4
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:31,399
hindrances and so I wanted to give a talk tonight that included

5
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:36,480
that um if you've been around this

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,879
dharma scene a while you've probably heard about the the eight-fold

7
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:49,520
path it's a foundational paradigm for our the

8
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:57,239
Buddhist tradition that we practice in the Tarvadan tradition um it's kind of a way of

9
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,359
organizing the most important practices that the Buddha

10
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:09,240
taught so that one if one is interested in

11
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:18,880
um experiencing uh liberation freedom from greed delusion and hatred greed uh

12
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,720
freedom from um duca which is sometimes translated as

13
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:34,159
suffering or dissatisfaction or in maybe common terms just the

14
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:41,920
bummerness of life um then these practices that the Buddha

15
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,520
um described that are in the eight-fold path um are really the way to get

16
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:57,759
there uh the first uh these all these eight path elements

17
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,880
are all interrelated and so it's not like you cultivate one and then

18
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,840
cultivate the next and cultivate the next

19
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:17,280
um but for purposes of talking about them it's easiest to to kind of make them into a a linear pattern so the

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:25,760
first two are um right view or the wisdom factors right view which is

21
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:32,360
uh really starting to look at your experience through the

22
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,160
um frame of the forable truths which is

23
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:46,720
seeing that there is suffering in your life seeing that there is dooka that there is um either just mild discontent

24
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,879
all the way to just out and out

25
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:57,519
um you know uh sort of almost unbearable

26
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,760
uh conditions and that it's important to

27
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,560
see what what's that coming from you know that it's coming from our clinging

28
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,920
to something and that there's a possibility

29
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,040
for the ending of that and then the fourth noble truth is the eight-fold

30
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:25,040
path this is the way to achieve

31
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:36,360
freedom so that's the first of the path factors the second one is right intention having intentions of being um

32
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,599
uh letting go of greed letting go of ill will letting go of harming of others um

33
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,480
that those those intentions really kind of set us

34
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:56,720
um uh on a path to be able to be free you know if we're trying to be free but

35
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:04,200
also um harming ourselves or harming others uh that's not going to

36
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:11,040
work uh the next set of the next part of the eight-fold path

37
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,160
are what they call the the ethical part developing right right speech right

38
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,040
action and right livelihood and those mostly have to do with how we

39
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,759
interact with others how we interact with uh other people one-on-one or in

40
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,240
communities or um you know in

41
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:45,199
groups so those all involve cultivation of uh

42
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,759
appropriate action towards others and then finally the the the

43
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:59,680
third set is the samadei set which involves wise effort wise mindfulness

44
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,759
and wise concentration

45
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:10,199
um and in this

46
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,479
um um center often people start with

47
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:23,639
right mindfulness and right concentration you know kind of wanting to develop

48
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:30,039
um a mind that is aware of what's happening as it's

49
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:36,400
happening and a mind that can be steady and focused so that it's not jumping all

50
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:40,080
over the place

51
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,680
um so tonight I'm going to talk about wise effort

52
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:57,600
um because the eight-fold path is so uh foundational to this practice uh IMC

53
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:05,080
offers a course every year a nine-month course going through each of these eight

54
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:13,039
um path factors and it just so happens this month they're doing wise effort so

55
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,720
that's why that's on my mind

56
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:27,639
um I was inspired by something that Gil said yesterday morning

57
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:36,478
um when you start the practice with something like developing mindfulness and

58
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:42,160
concentration there is a cultivation going on and often and most of it is

59
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,039
around observing most of it is about no you know developing a sense of awareness

60
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,680
of what's going on as it's going on um and being able to stay with it in

61
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:03,759
a very steadied steady and settled way or at the very least noticing that

62
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:09,680
you're not in a stable and uh steady way that the the mind is

63
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,080
jumping around and at least noticing that so those two really involve

64
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:23,639
primarily observing wise effort really involves

65
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:30,479
cultivating so it's not just noticing what's going on but it's

66
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:37,360
also making some effort you know uh actually using

67
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:42,440
whatever um

68
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:50,880
uh agency we have whatever choice we have to make to choose what we pay

69
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:56,560
attention to what kind of mind states

70
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:08,680
you know or states of the heart and the mind that we're um cultivating and which ones were um

71
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:17,639
uh eliminating so right effort really

72
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:25,360
um is much more of the kind of the active cultivating part of this practice

73
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,400
although it also includes the observing part you know you have to observe what's

74
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:38,279
going on so that you know how how to do the cultivation uh one of the descriptions

75
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:44,519
for wise effort is it's kind of like gardening right you know

76
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:50,480
you things start to grow up out of the ground and you have to decide which one

77
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:57,279
which of these things are what you want to develop what

78
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,480
you want to cultivate and and which are the weeds which are the things that um

79
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,519
really um are going to sap the the nutrients and the strength and the light from

80
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,279
those things that you want so so there are weeds that need to be pulled up and

81
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:23,639
in the same way we can think of our heart and mind as being like a garden

82
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:35,080
um so the first thing we need to be able to recognize is what are the

83
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:42,480
plant what are the things that are weeds and what are the things that are the plants that you want to

84
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:52,000
grow the the weeds are often referred to as unh wholesome mind states you might

85
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:58,360
also call that um unbeneficial or

86
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:05,399
afflictive you know what are you know the mind states that are like an affliction to

87
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:12,920
us and which are the which are the ones that that we want to uh encourage

88
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:23,120
so in some ways we have to we have to figure that out for ourselves you know

89
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:31,560
you you have to figure out which which you know which which which states of mind really

90
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:37,600
um aren't helpful to my development and which ones are

91
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:44,519
some of the guidance on that comes from this book by uh Bonte

92
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:51,079
Gunaratna see this one is called Eight Mindful Steps to Happiness

93
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:57,279
um and one of the one of the um

94
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:03,720
characteristics of the unh wholesome states um are that they

95
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:10,640
include the five hindrances and you may have heard Diana

96
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,360
talk about the five hindrances over the last couple weeks the first one is greed you know

97
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:26,240
that sense of um not just wanting but sort of in a

98
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:29,279
wanting in a

99
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:38,120
um afflictive way in in sort of a

100
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:47,160
uh you say sort of addictive way so uh greed sensual desire

101
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,279
um lust are some of the stronger forms of

102
00:11:52,279 --> 00:11:58,600
that um when those are

103
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,640
operating it's hard to see what's going on right you know

104
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:10,360
they they become so enticing that all we see is what we

105
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:17,440
want and we don't necessarily see the harm that's coming to us or

106
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:26,680
others as we try to grasp for um more and more

107
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:34,399
the the second let's see

108
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:41,120
yeah the second hindrance or family family of hindrances it's it's really a

109
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:48,480
spectrum is um aversion or ill will or hatred

110
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:55,279
and whereas with greed we're trying to hold on to something usually something that can't

111
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:01,880
be held on to i mean pleasant only can be pleasant for so

112
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:07,519
long um with with aversion it's really trying

113
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:15,720
to push away those things that oftentimes can't be pushed away

114
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,959
and so there there can be a lot of

115
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:28,240
um a lot of suffering that that's generated from trying from being in that

116
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,120
state of um

117
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:39,360
aversion so those are the two biggest hindrances

118
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:46,880
the other three um the next two come in pairs the the

119
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,839
next one is sloth and torper that's where

120
00:13:52,839 --> 00:13:58,720
there's little or no energy either one of them is little or no energy in the

121
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,639
mind you know sort of a dullness or little or no energy in the body you know

122
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:12,000
sort of drowsiness and when we're in if one or

123
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:18,440
both of those is operating then it's it's hard to see what's going on

124
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:24,720
um because we just we we don't have a a bright enough awareness a strong enough

125
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:33,199
awareness of what's going on the fourth hindrance is again is a

126
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,560
pair for body and mind which is uh restlessness and worry

127
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:44,880
so restlessness uh unlike sloth and torper restlessness

128
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,800
and worry is an overabundance of energy you know so the body just you know can't

129
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:55,839
sit still and worry is often the mind can't

130
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:01,320
sit still right it's just it's going all over the place and so when that's

131
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:08,360
operating again it it's it's hard to imagine that you can really

132
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,120
um settle down and and find

133
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:23,199
peace and then the fifth hindrance is doubt

134
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:31,040
and or skeptical doubt and and doubt keeps us going around in circles

135
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:37,360
you know it's kind of like a dog chasing its tail it's just you know should I be doing this or should I be doing

136
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:45,600
something else and it never resolves uh what it reminds me of is

137
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:52,920
when I learned computer programming in the early 1970s the program of choice was

138
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:59,440
Forran and it was possible to write a program that would have a loop in it

139
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,800
that would never reach a termination criterion it would just go

140
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,519
and go and go until the operator showed that your job

141
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:19,199
had run out of resources it had run out of time and then it would just get terminated so doubt can be kind of like

142
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,279
an infinite loop it just never

143
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,480
um on its own it can just keep

144
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:39,079
going there are some other more subtle forms of uh these unh

145
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:44,959
wholesome mind states that are called the 10 fedters and that's too long of a

146
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:52,560
list for me to go through tonight but if you look up the ten feathers it's it's on the internet they they tend to be

147
00:16:52,560 --> 00:17:00,639
more subtle um experiences that keep us from being

148
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:05,798
totally free but some of them only

149
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:13,120
um are totally resolved when you become an arot so I I wouldn't start there i'd start

150
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,520
with the

151
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:26,839
hindrances yeah so So the first thing is to to learn for

152
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:33,799
yourself what are the unh wholesome mind states and what are the wholesome mind states

153
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,840
and it occurred to me as I was uh thinking about this

154
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,720
that in my mind one of the things that distinguishes wholesome mind states from

155
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:52,000
unh wholesome mind states is that wholesome mind states tend to be

156
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,520
associated with uh letting go and opening

157
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:06,760
up and unh wholesome mind states tend to be around closing down contracting and

158
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:12,480
grasping so that's a kind of a general criterion but you know when when you

159
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:18,880
find yourself you know kind of getting more and more contracted either physically or

160
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:27,039
mentally or holding more tightly grasping things more tightly that may be a sign that that

161
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:33,200
that the mind state that you're in um isn't going to lead to a life of peace

162
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:39,600
and freedom right so and likewise when you're in a state where

163
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:45,919
um you know there's a an openness a letting go some sense of generosity and

164
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:52,559
kindness um that you're on the right track so

165
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:59,160
that's that's kind of a general way to describe those two categories

166
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:06,799
right effort then consists of four activities the

167
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:13,520
first one is um preventing the arising of unarisen

168
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:20,200
unh wholesome mind states so how do you do

169
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:26,760
that well I think for me it starts

170
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:32,440
by falling into a lot of unh wholesome mind states and then over time you start to

171
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,760
recognize what caused that unh wholesome state to arise what are what are the

172
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,280
causitive factors what

173
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:46,720
um what triggered

174
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:57,600
it and then as you start to see what the causitive factors are that

175
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:04,480
bring forth that kind of a state you have a better chance of catching it before either before it

176
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,799
starts at all or before it gains much

177
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,480
momentum so I I probably have told this story before when I was

178
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,600
about 3 years old my father was doing a home

179
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:26,200
improvement job on our house

180
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:31,960
and when he would get frustrated when something would go wrong he would start to

181
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:39,600
swear and I was in the bedroom watching him work and all of this stuff and then at

182
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,280
some point I walked out of the bedroom into the living room and I started repeating some of these words I heard my

183
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,960
father use i had no idea what they meant i was telling my mother all of these words all these swear words and she was

184
00:20:52,960 --> 00:21:00,120
a ghast um but I realized that

185
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:07,200
nowadays or for most of my life when I would do something where frustration would start

186
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:12,720
to arise where something would start going wrong almost immediately one or

187
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:20,240
more of those words would come out of my mouth and when I wasn't aware of that if

188
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:26,400
if I just let that go it would go from just being a mental

189
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,559
activity to my whole body would start to get agitated you know I I you know that

190
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:38,200
frustration could really could really build you know I'd just be ready

191
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:46,600
to I don't know you know throw a tool or something

192
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:52,679
nowadays i mean recently I was doing a plumbing project at home

193
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:58,000
and if you've ever worked underneath a sink and it's not much room and sure

194
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:03,559
enough one thing went wrong and I found myself you know swear word coming out of my

195
00:22:03,559 --> 00:22:10,880
mouth but nowadays when I hear that I could go "Oh yeah that's a sign i must be

196
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,159
frustrated there must be frustration here." And so I stopped what I was doing

197
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:21,919
i thought about it i reread the instructions and I was able to proceed

198
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:28,320
without having to go through this really contracted agitated state of

199
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,320
frustration

200
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:42,080
so for the first one for the preventing really requires us to get to know what

201
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:47,440
are the warning signs what you know what you know it might be that you have to go

202
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:55,320
and talk with some particular coworker that just seems to trigger you

203
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:02,480
um you know or or anger or

204
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:10,200
um or what what triggers desire you know I mean I can sit on

205
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:15,919
on the website of Apple and look at this one particular laptop and it's like oh

206
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:21,520
god if I had that laptop you know I mean it's got 64 gigs of memory and it's you

207
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:29,679
know it's got 24 cores and all this other stuff um it's useful to look at it

208
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,600
and if it makes sense to buy it but to just sit there and look at it over and

209
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:41,880
over again and and you know kind of obsess about it uh you know

210
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:51,320
that's after a while it's actually kind of tiring and um doesn't feel very good

211
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,640
so for preventing that that one really requires

212
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:03,200
getting to know getting to know how your mind works

213
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:10,000
so that you can get those warning signs but you can't prevent all of them

214
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:15,120
you know things get through you know some some unh wholesome minds they just

215
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:20,799
they come so fast that before you know it you're you're in it they've arisen

216
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,679
and so the second one is abandoning un arisen unh wholesened mind

217
00:24:26,679 --> 00:24:34,320
states and that there the Buddha gave some well number one was mindfulness is

218
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:43,159
always helpful being mindful really can help but for arisen on on wholesome mind

219
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:49,480
states he had a five element strategy the the first one

220
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:55,760
was if possible see if you can just ignore it like okay yeah yeah that's

221
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:04,559
right yeah that's anger or that's greed and then just drop it now you

222
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:10,799
might be able to do that if it isn't so strong the second one is to divert your

223
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:19,559
attention from that thought to some better thought you know so just

224
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:25,919
um you know yeah anger is here but I can also here's some other things I can

225
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,159
think about and so just divert your attention from what's unh wholesome to

226
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,440
something that's more wholesome

227
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,159
the third one is replacing the unh wholesome

228
00:25:43,159 --> 00:25:49,400
thought with its opposite

229
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:55,880
so for example if greed is is arisen in your uh

230
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:02,720
mind you might think about generosity

231
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:09,440
you know you might try to replace those thoughts of greed with thoughts of

232
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:16,240
generosity uh the fourth one

233
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:22,880
involves the two parts one is it it can involve deciding well let's just

234
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:29,360
investigate what this unh wholesome um mind state is like how does how does

235
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:36,960
it feel in the body um and is this something that I want is

236
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:42,440
this where I want to hang out

237
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:48,640
and you can also look at what are the what are the causes that came together

238
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,080
for this to arise and notice that all of those causes are impermanent that they'll

239
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,360
arise and pass and so this whole unh wholesome mind state is also impermanent

240
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:07,200
so it's not like when anger arises it isn't that that's going to be there for

241
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,960
the rest of your life it's just it's arisen it's temporary and it and it'll

242
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:20,000
pass and then the final one which I thought I' always was kind of surprised it

243
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:26,559
sounds kind of harsh is there's sometimes when there's an unh wholesome mind state where you just have to use

244
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:33,080
force of will to kind of like wrestle it to the ground and

245
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:42,320
um I thought well that doesn't really is that what the Buddha said um you know but I started to think

246
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:49,440
you know there are times when people are just overcome with some really harmful

247
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:54,760
destructive impulse you know think of you know

248
00:27:54,760 --> 00:28:00,960
well somebody harming another person you know injuring them or even killing them

249
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:06,159
and often it's just a spontaneous thing where the you know the state of mind is

250
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:12,000
is is strong and so it's in those cases it's really important to be able to have

251
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:20,279
a strong enough practice and strong enough effort to to be able to tell yourself no no I'm not going to do

252
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:26,720
this no I'm not going to tell a boss you know what a you know blankety blankie is

253
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:32,240
you know I'm just you know that may seem like you know it would be

254
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:41,080
so satisfying but it would only be satisfying for you know a few seconds and then you'd realize that

255
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:49,440
um it it harmed a relationship it harmed who knows what it harmed but um so being

256
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:55,120
a you know as a as a last gasp there there may be times when an

257
00:28:55,120 --> 00:29:07,240
unh wholesome mind state really has to be dealt with with as much force and energy as as as possible

258
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:17,279
so then um so for unh wholesome mind states

259
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:23,880
there's the preventing and the abandoning and then for wholesome mind states there's the cultivating the

260
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:29,640
unarisen wholesome state

261
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:34,679
and one of the ways the the first thing that comes to my mind when I think about

262
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:41,480
cultivating a wholesome mind state is practicing some of the uh loving

263
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:48,080
kindness the Brahma Biharas um cultivating uh well-wishing for

264
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:57,000
others uh sympathetic joy uh compassion equinimity

265
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:06,679
um again those those qualities of mind that um are expansive you know that are

266
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:15,760
open-handed um there's also the uh the paramese some

267
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:22,880
of the foundational practices for for this for this um school of

268
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:29,039
Buddhism things like uh generosity you know being generous both

269
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:34,440
to yourself and to others um

270
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:43,080
uh offering safety to people through living an ethical

271
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:46,080
life

272
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:56,279
um being patient truthful

273
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:03,960
all of those all of those are some of the wholesome states of

274
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:10,880
mind uh and there's there's more it's it's really up to you to to discover

275
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:16,960
them for yourself which which ones really seem to support you give you a

276
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,320
sense of uh well-being a sense of uh

277
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:27,000
living in harmony and happiness

278
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:39,039
and then the final one is um maintaining so maintaining a risen

279
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,279
wholesome mind states so once you've

280
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:48,880
cultivated you know something like loving

281
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:57,240
kindness how do you maintain it you know that it that

282
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:04,159
it there may be a some momentum to it and that's great and it may also require

283
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:10,360
you know some continual effort to keep it going

284
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,720
one of the practices that I was taught many years ago and I've I've used

285
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:24,000
um when I travel is when when I go to an an airport you know you're often sitting in the waiting area you know for your

286
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,320
flight to be called and your group and so forth

287
00:32:30,919 --> 00:32:34,880
um and for me it can

288
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:43,240
be a little stressful even though I've got my ticket everything's lined up I've got my

289
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:50,960
baggage still there's um you know strange people I don't know and uh who

290
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:56,640
knows what's going to happen and so one of the practices since I have nothing

291
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:02,519
else to do is I sit there and as people walk by on the

292
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:09,679
concourse I um I wish them well you know somebody

293
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,559
I've never met just walking by you know may you be safe may you be

294
00:33:15,559 --> 00:33:21,279
happy may you be healthy may you be peaceful i don't say

295
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:26,679
it out loud but you know it's just it's just

296
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:33,919
um why not you know it's um it may or may not affect them but it

297
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:41,200
definitely affects me you know I go from feeling like I'm sitting in a group

298
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,799
of strangers who may or may not be hostile

299
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:54,159
I don't know to feeling like I'm I'm sitting with other I'm surrounded by other human

300
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:00,679
beings that I can wish well for and

301
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:06,360
that's it's easy to maintain that um you know

302
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:13,440
for 20 minutes or however long it you know it takes from when I get to the gate to when I get on the plane and of

303
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,679
course even once you're on the plane it doesn't have to stop

304
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:29,520
um I think as you start to feel how good it feels to

305
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:37,839
be in one of those mind states then there's more of a natural tendency to just want to stay there to just um keep

306
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:41,079
it going

307
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:51,919
i remember years ago Gil have saying this thing and I'm I can't remember it exactly the way he said it but it was

308
00:34:52,280 --> 00:35:00,720
like when you have a sense of peace and ease what is important enough for you to

309
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:06,720
give that up like why would you what would you give that up for what would be so

310
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:14,800
important that you'd say "Okay well I'm okay i'm going to get rid of my peace of

311
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:21,480
mind." So I think the maintaining part you know also

312
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,880
takes effort um I suspect that there are

313
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:33,520
people who have practiced long enough that it's just kind of second nature it just keeps going but for those of us

314
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,280
that are still

315
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,920
um still affected by unh wholesome mind states

316
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:53,680
it's something we need to do

317
00:35:54,920 --> 00:36:01,200
um over the last year or so I've I've been finding that um I don't sleep so

318
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,000
well at night and when I wake up in the morning the first thing when I wake up

319
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,880
is I feel kind of groggy and kind of averse to getting out

320
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,720
of bed and I could just lay there and go

321
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:25,800
"Oh poor me." You know why isn't life better and

322
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:33,920
uh you know why you know why didn't I get a better night's

323
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:41,200
sleep but instead what I do nowadays when I wake up the first thing I do is

324
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,560
that I notice that's the kind of mind state that's operating that's that's

325
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,359
what's going on and so rather than trying to do anything at all

326
00:36:52,359 --> 00:36:57,760
complicated I just start by paying attention to my breath i just lay in bed

327
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,240
and I just I just do breath meditation

328
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:12,119
and one of the things that that does is I notice

329
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:18,320
um my breathing slows down and also my heartbeat slows down

330
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:23,920
i've had some stances put in a few years ago and so I notice sometimes when I

331
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:30,320
first wake up my heart beats seems a little fast and a little erratic and by

332
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:37,280
just doing breath meditation my breath and my heartbeat just really

333
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:43,920
um even out so there's a physiological component of doing breath

334
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,400
meditation in the morning um also some of that drowsiness goes away i I start

335
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:58,640
feeling more energy so doing so starting the day with

336
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:04,920
breath meditation really seems to make a difference to the mind

337
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:11,520
states and to the body and then then I may also then go

338
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:19,280
into loving kindness practice just um you know kind of see whoever whoever

339
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:26,079
comes to mind first just okay it doesn't really matter just who who comes to mind this morning I start doing loving

340
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,040
kindness for them and

341
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:39,520
then I don't set a particular amount of time I just decide to do it

342
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:47,560
until it's clear to me I'm ready to face the day i'm ready to get out of bed and I'm ready to

343
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:53,760
um you know face whatever uh the day

344
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:59,480
holds and it sets a tone you know it kind of sets a tone that

345
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:06,400
okay you can start your day by doing by applying right effort it isn't something

346
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,800
that you can wait till the end of the day till 9 at night after your last television

347
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,760
program is over and it's like okay well now now I'll do right effort or wise

348
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:24,760
effort you can start your day with it you can

349
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:32,400
um find creative ways throughout the day to to tune into what's going on in

350
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:40,040
my mind right now and is is this what I want or is there some way that I could

351
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:47,760
um change it i mean a lot of what happens in our lives is just habit it's just you know

352
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,000
it's it's it's not it's not necessarily something that

353
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:00,079
we can change instantaneously but we do have some agency we do have some choice

354
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:06,160
and by using the choice that we have we can cultivate

355
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:14,720
uh a more wholesome uh state of mind

356
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:18,400
and then the final thing that I'll say

357
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:28,200
is the practice only is effective if you do

358
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:35,599
it so you can hear as many talks as you want about right effort or any kind of

359
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:43,680
practice you can listen you can read books you can hear podcasts everything else all of that's very useful all of I

360
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:52,640
know all of that cognitive learning is useful but it's not enough you if you

361
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:59,359
want the practice to make a difference you got to do it

362
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:09,240
so I think that's the the the key take-home about um right effort is is

363
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:16,480
um you have to start paying attention well if you want the benefits you need

364
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:23,440
to uh make the effort so thank you

365
00:41:25,480 --> 00:41:31,040
all we've got a few minutes if anyone has any

366

367
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,280

368
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:51,280
and then push push the button until the green light comes on

369
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,720
so I'm just going to add on uh what you said about just doing the practice um

370
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:01,760
I've found out that through through my personal journey that um when I'm

371
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:08,560
practicing in person so like with multiple people but doing it with consistency um maybe getting a little

372
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,920
bit obsessive with it uh that's when I found it to be most beneficial so just

373
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:22,440
adding on what you you said okay thank you find it useful thanks okay anyone
