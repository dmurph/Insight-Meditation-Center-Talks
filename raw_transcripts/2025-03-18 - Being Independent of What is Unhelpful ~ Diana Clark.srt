1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,520
good evening welcome

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:12,840
welcome I so appreciate meditating together there's something just really wonderful about it no matter what's

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,839
happening there's just I don't know so thank you for

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:26,160
that so I had the great Good Fortune uh these past few days last week to be

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,558
doing some hiking in uh Southern Utah and and it was just so beautiful it

6
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:39,360
was just so wonderful and U there's a number of reasons why I thought it was wonderful

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,280
but you know part of it is just being away you know being away from being on

8
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:52,199
screens you know being out hiking or some of my usual responsibilities but

9
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:59,559
also just to be outside with a trees and rocks and

10
00:00:59,559 --> 00:01:06,520
nature quote unquote and um and I noticed though even

11
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:12,040
though there was like so much appreciation and I don't know just so much happiness about just being outside

12
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:17,960
and walking you know so simple just uh

13
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:24,280
walking but I noticed that I felt a little bit more of this

14
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:30,320
ease when I was on those Trails when there was less people like when there

15
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:35,840
was a lot of people and then crowded on the trails and stuff like that it was I

16
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,280
was so happy to be outside happy to be doing that but when I was on a trail where there weren't so many people there

17
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,159
was another little set of certain set of uh ease it maybe a

18
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,799
little bit easier to tune into maybe some of the beauty or the

19
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,520
quiet the Simplicity this sense of maybe this

20
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,600
naturalness too for me there was a maybe when there weren't so many people I'm

21
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,080
just right now thinking about it maybe there is a certain amount of ease that could

22
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:16,920
arise I tend to be more of an introvert maybe some of you that are extroverts are being that doesn't sound fun that's

23
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:25,720
okay too right we don't all have to be exactly the same but maybe there's this way that uh

24
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,800
being like outside in a way that feels easeful

25
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:39,280
is similar to being inside when there's a big storm going on rain or hail and

26
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,239
wind or something like that and you're inside feeling cozy maybe there's a fire in the fireplace or hot chocolate or

27
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:53,000
something like this a feeling of coziness or maybe there's this feeling

28
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:01,920
that when you're in a like at a setting which there's a lot of people a conference or maybe a big a party or

29
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,920
wedding or something like this and maybe it feels like sometimes it's really loud like oh wow this is a lot and then you

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,560
step outside maybe you just feel like you just need a little bit of quiet before

31
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:23,640
you go back inside or something so I'm pointing to this idea of like you know separating ourselves

32
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,760
sometimes doesn't have to be all the time but removing ourselves like

33
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:36,360
separating our our El from whatever is

34
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,400
happening even we might say that this is part of what Retreat practice is is

35
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:47,799
about is to kind of like separate yourself and that's a big that's part of the power and the potency of retreat

36
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:53,120
practice is that we're away from the usual distractions there's no electronic

37
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:58,599
devices on Retreats and there's no so few decisions to be made and things to

38
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:04,799
take care of but I even when I was on I've done a lot

39
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:10,319
of retreat practice and when I was on Retreats I was also like trying to figure out where can I be away from all

40
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,959
these people so it's kind of funny it's just something that I would do and uh

41
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,759
and what I'm just remembering a friend of mine unbeknownst to me also had the same idea kind of like oh I want to be a

42
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:29,039
little bit more isolated a little bit in a little bit more quiet place and I I

43
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:35,600
would think like okay well after lunch I'm going to go in the meditation hall because nobody else is in the meditation

44
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,919
Hall after lunch that's usually a time when people are doing other things resting or helping take care of the

45
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:48,120
dishes or whatever it might be and I thought it was funny that a good friend of mine I would like find there also

46
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,199
like oh you're here and then I think oh well maybe I'll do Walkin meditation over here nobody goes over there and

47
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:01,120
then I'd be over there oh there's my friend you know so just this recognition that some of us just have this uh

48
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:07,039
tendency not everybody has that I'm just sharing some of my own

49
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,840
experiences but I'd also like to say that the Buddha talked about this or he

50
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:20,080
pointed to this this idea of you know sometimes not all the time sometimes to

51
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,400
like be a little bit more separate to be a little bit more

52
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,000
isolated from what's Happening and can imagine that in Ancient India from what

53
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,039
we know from primarily from the Buddhist literature is that people lived in large

54
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:45,440
groups right commonly right big family groups multiple Generations living

55
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,600
together or the monastics live in monasteries a lot of the time and they

56
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,240
also didn't live in monasteries they also were would be wandering and would be off on their own too so I don't want

57
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,039
to say that's exclusively what happening but there's a number of times

58
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:12,479
in which the Buddha would give kind of like this instruction you know don't delay the there are the roots of trees

59
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,039
there are empty Huts go meditate the roots of trees being in India there was

60
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:23,919
be trees that have these really large root systems that would be kind of above ground and' be really big so they' kind

61
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:32,080
of like big a big root here like a big root here so you could have your own little space or something like

62
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,360
this so his encouragement on occasions to go

63
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:44,199
to sit meditate be separate from

64
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:52,520
others so there's a poly word that's uh no that's this denotes this and no need

65
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:59,199
to remember this poly word don't worry the word is via and the reason why I'm bringing it

66
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,400
up is because there's a few different ways in which we could understand this word and um I'd like to talk about that

67
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,680
tonight this idea of separating or to to separate or being

68
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:19,720
separate or separation something like this I like this idea of maybe thinking

69
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:26,840
of VCA as like being independent of what is

70
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:34,400
unhelpful being independent of what is unhelpful it's kind of you know clunky

71
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:42,360
language but maybe we could understand it of not being Tangled Up in

72
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:47,479
entanglements being uh separate from difficulties

73
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:53,120
being separated from difficulties so just this way in which

74
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,759
maybe we can find some distance between and not get lost in what's unhelpful

75
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:06,039
and one of these examples could be as just as I described as finding a place

76
00:08:06,039 --> 00:08:12,400
that supported a meditation practice and sometimes that place might be you know

77
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:19,319
separate from others out in the woods and in your room here at IMC maybe it's

78
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:25,840
we're not all separate from one another but maybe you're separate from what's happening at your workplace or your home

79
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:31,440
or whatever it might be on the freeways whatever it might be

80
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:39,200
so in the same way like there might be like this physical separation is finding a location that is more quiet and

81
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,480
settled but there also can be this mental separation creating the

82
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,880
conditions that are also allows for this more quiet and settled finding a place

83
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:55,360
in the heart and mind that is quiet and

84
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:03,079
settled maybe being separated from these difficulties that of course they arise when we

85
00:09:03,079 --> 00:09:08,880
meditate when we sit down it's not always uh unicorns and rainbows you

86
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:16,560
don't need me to tell you that so the classically there's this or

87
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:23,519
traditionally this idea of being separated from mental difficulties points to the

88
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:31,600
hindrances these are this uh five obstruct ctions difficulties things

89
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,440
that are like getting in the way of being even more settled of being even

90
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,640
more having some calmness these hindrances these group

91
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:50,079
are five are said to be the doorway the gateway to samadi samadi we can understand is like

92
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:58,079
the sense of collectedness with a sense of well-being the sense of being unscattered

93
00:09:58,079 --> 00:10:07,279
undistracted and and with a sense of well-being like oh yeah this just being

94
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:14,519
here so I'll just say a few words about these hindrances for me when I first learned

95
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:20,720
about them I was like so happy it made me so happy because it felt like such a

96
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,519
relief that thousands of years ago somebody was talking about the

97
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,200
difficulties I was having in meditation this meant like oh this is just a human

98
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:39,920
thing this is just what happens when humans try to sit down and meditate it doesn't mean that any of us are failures

99
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:48,959
it doesn't mean anything about us as meditators it just means that we're meditating so there's this way we with a

100
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,240
really broad brush we could say the hindrances are these we might say energy

101
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:02,680
states or forces in the mind there's this uh typical list of five the

102
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:10,639
first two relate to what I like to say kind of like pushing or pulling this can be uh show up in so

103
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:20,120
many different ways but there's this kind of like pushing like get away from me I don't want this you know get

104
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:28,240
away aversion maybe there's some little bit of hostilian there to a little bit of ill wh like just get away or there

105
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,959
can be this pulling I want more I want more give me more I need more of this

106
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:42,480
experience and more of some experience that I'm thinking about so this is we could say is desire so this a pushing

107
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:49,600
and pulling and sometimes when we meditate you can see sometimes people are lean forward a little bit if they

108
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:56,519
really are in their meditation practice and they really were wanting something this can be uh shows up in our

109
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,880
body as well as what the mind is happening I haven't seen aversion show up as much

110
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:07,639
as people pulling back but there can be this sense of like oh ew I don't want that you know like that that's kind of

111
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:16,639
the feeling so those are two of the entrances pushing and pulling we could say aversion and desire

112
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:23,199
also there's also uh two more entrances that are related to the amount to the

113
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:29,959
sense of a settledness or energy so one is this feeling

114
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:36,279
of not enough energy this feel right kind of like this

115
00:12:36,279 --> 00:12:43,000
falling asleep isn't obvious when you feel like you're going to fall asleep this is not so uncommon in meditation

116
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:49,880
practice and then the other one is like oh my gosh if I have to sit here any longer I'm just going to go crazy

117
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:55,320
there's this sense of you know I just want to jump off of my seat and do

118
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:03,560
anything go organize the sock you know something like this that feels like it's more important or more urgent so there's

119
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:10,720
these two that low energy and high energy low energy is given the

120
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,760
expression sloth and torper and high energy is given the expression

121
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:22,399
restlessness restlessness and worry and uh I've given a whole series

122
00:13:22,399 --> 00:13:27,800
of Dharma talks on these I'm just doing a broad brush right now I know I say

123
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:34,360
this some often when I'm giving DH oh I should give a whole series on these and uh I often don't do that even though I

124
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:40,079
have that idea but I think maybe I will I'll spend a little time these are good things to really

125
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:46,959
explore so that's four and then the fifth one is this sense of velation like

126
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:53,360
I don't I don't know maybe I should do this well I don't know maybe I should do this over here well wait wait maybe I'm

127
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:00,680
not sure this kind of like this indecisiveness this vacillation this

128
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:07,880
hesitation not really engaged and and um sometimes that shows up as like okay I'm

129
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:13,399
going to be mindful of the breath oh but my knee hurts okay I'll be mindful of the knee oh I really don't like this the

130
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:18,839
knee okay I'll do M I'll do loving kindness practice oh but this is hard okay well maybe I'll do visualization

131
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:27,519
practice so or just you spend your whole meditation practice going from Bing Bing Bing just jumping from uh practice to

132
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,920
practice that is um this vacillation this hesitation to really just settle

133
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,320
in um is often called doubt and there's a lot that can be said about doubt I

134
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:47,800
think I gave a talk not too long ago about it so there's this way in which these

135
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:55,199
hindrances these five uh desire ill will sloth and toror

136
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:01,040
restlessness and worry and doubt they they are operating whether we are aware

137
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:07,920
of them or not but it's maybe helpful to think of them as as a Spectra it's not binary

138
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:15,279
either you have them or you don't they're just um can be really subtle and sometimes

139
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:20,959
our meditation practice as the Mind does start to uh settle down we start to see

140
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:28,120
oh yeah there's a little bit of restlessness that was subtle that we hadn't noticed before or maybe there's

141
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,279
this desire that we hadn't really noticed before and so part of meditation

142
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:39,839
practice is just to see all these uh the the obvious versions and the not obvious

143
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:46,120
versions of these hindrances we don't have to take them

144
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:53,279
personally just means that we're humans sitting down to meditate but they they don't happen only

145
00:15:53,279 --> 00:16:01,199
in the meditation happen in all of our lives so these are obstructions that happen in all these different

146
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:10,040
ways so then this idea of separation and VCA as being a doorway

147
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:17,199
into samade settledness with a sense of well-being is that as they start to

148
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:22,399
soften these hindrances these five Universal qualities everybody has them

149
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:27,560
to some extent unless you're completely awakened I don't know what a completely awakened

150
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:34,800
person has I maybe imagining they don't have these as this separation this seclusion

151
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:43,000
happens then there's this way in it can be just

152
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:49,399
this sense of maybe ease and contentment

153
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,519
just a real sense of a deep sense

154
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:02,920
of that kind of a feeling so separation from these hindrances is of

155
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:07,558
what we might call a different type of a

156
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:16,600
via this mental V mental separation separating from these

157
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:25,000
hindrances but there's this also way in which we vea or even this word separation we could say is like to

158
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:30,320
separate or separate there's this way like separate

159
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,640
is this recognition oh there's can be more than one like there can be put

160
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:44,360
things in this pile and put things in that pile we can't separate it's not just one thing and in this case what's

161
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:49,760
being pointed to is can we separate can we distinguish can we

162
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:57,760
discern what is helpful from what is not so helpful I talked about this uh VCA as

163
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,880
being like this independ dependence from what is unhelpful it helps to know what is not

164
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:10,960
helpful and this uh we learn right with practice sometimes

165
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:17,000
um it's obvious and sometimes it's not so obvious and so we could say helpful

166
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:23,280
helpful for what we could say helpful for finding greater happiness Finding

167
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:30,559
finding greater peace ease and freedom what's helpful for Crea in

168
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:37,240
suffering oh you know just it's helpful to know these types of things too right what leads to

169
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:43,400
suffering reading all kinds of news right before meditating probably not so

170
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:49,440
helpful right then there's just the mind is going or something like this and

171
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,880
right and you learn that maybe if you find yourself do Doom scrolling oh yeah right I'm supposed to go meditate and then you meditate and you realize the

172
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:05,919
repercussions of the Doom scrolling or whatever it was you were doing I think we've all have uh done our

173
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:12,760
share of these types of things I remember that uh early in my

174
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:18,480
meditation practice when I I would be like driving to The Meditation Center to do something just like what we're doing

175
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,919
tonight A sit in a talk I would like play the radio like really loud and sing along and you like

176
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:31,159
in my car but then when I noticed it's as soon as I sat down all those songs

177
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:37,360
just showed up again in my mind and I'd be meditating just Oh no just these words of the songs I'm trying to get rid

178
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,200
of them but they would stay or something like this so I stopped listening to the

179
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:49,159
radio when I was uh before as I was driving to go meditate just to see if

180
00:19:49,159 --> 00:19:54,840
that could help not have all those songs playing in the mind while I

181
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:01,919
sitting so there's this idea of you know via as to separate what's helpful and

182
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:07,400
what's not helpful we can say that's part of a Right View part of uh the

183
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:12,679
Noble eight-fold Path I'll just say briefly that kind of

184
00:20:12,679 --> 00:20:18,919
again broad brush of that is knowing what leads to suffering and

185
00:20:18,919 --> 00:20:25,120
what leads to the ending of suffering and to use that as a

186
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:30,799
perspective as a framework as we move through our days through our lives just

187
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:37,200
this sensitivity to oh yeah this is causing suffering this leads to suffering and

188
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:44,840
this this one isn't this doesn't for me spending time hiking

189
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:50,760
didn't lead to more suffering it brought a lot of uh

190
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:59,320
happiness so there's this idea of a discernment but there's also something else that this uh this

191
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,919
separation or distinguishing or something like this that the Buddha

192
00:21:04,919 --> 00:21:12,279
talks about and that is to notice the contents of the Mind what is present in

193
00:21:12,279 --> 00:21:19,480
the mind and what is absent in the mind some of you might be familiar with

194
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:27,440
this it's the third foundation in the Sati patan suta if you don't know what that means perfectly fine it's just this

195
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,799
um pointing to how there's these UNH

196
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:37,960
wholesome Roots we might say some of these foundational like really I like

197
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:45,640
this word roots often unseen and underneath but they're like allowing all kinds of stuff to sprout

198
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:52,159
up greed hatred and delusion are the classic traditional

199
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:59,440
Roots greed hatred and delusion you'll notice that I talked about the hindrances like for that desire is an

200
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:07,480
expression that we we could say the root is a desire and it shows up as a hindrance as I'm sorry greed as the root

201
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,760
and it shows up as a hindrance of Desire we could also say that there's

202
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:20,440
this uh this hatred and maybe shows up as a hindrance of ill will but could also be anger it can

203
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:26,360
also um be disdain for others it can

204
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:32,919
also be um a certain amount kind of arrogance you know so there's these roots that give Sprout to all kinds of

205
00:22:32,919 --> 00:22:39,200
things that turn out to not be so helpful and then delusion we can say there's a number of ways we can talk

206
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:46,320
about this but delusions is sometimes just being disconnected from whatever is

207
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:55,080
happening so the Buddha points to can we notice when greed hatred or and or

208
00:22:55,080 --> 00:23:01,000
delusion is present but often it's not it shows up in so many Myriad of ways

209
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:08,679
it's maybe not so obvious to us so this is there is this way in which

210
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:15,480
can we get to know when it's greed is

211
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:21,039
present hatred is present these are strong words delusion these are strong

212
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:29,000
words nobody wants to say oh yeah I had a lot of greed today I had a lot of hate today

213
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:36,320
like nobody wants to say this I was diluted for some time

214
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:41,480
today but there's this way if we can recognize the way these three different

215
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:49,000
Roots show up in our lives the experience of them this can be

216
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:54,880
transformative because this is part of the key of finding more peace finding

217
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,080
more freedom finding more ease is getting to understand like what is it

218
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:07,480
that isn't peaceful what's that experience like for example what is the experience

219
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:14,159
of like really wanting something like really really wanting something and this

220
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:20,400
can be a fantastic practice in your daily life on the cushion just recognize

221
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:28,760
oh I really want my coworker to you know do something or not

222
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:35,679
do something and I know sometimes I would find myself please let XYZ happen

223
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:41,159
you know not rain tomorrow or you know whatever it might be please don't let it rain tomorrow please don't let it rain

224
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:46,480
tomorrow you know there's this sense of you know really wanting something but it

225
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,720
can be fantastic to just notice what is that experience

226
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:58,480
like how does it feel in the body

227
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,760
could be this little bit of Leaning forward but there's also this tightness and there's this oh I really wanted this

228
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:10,600
to happen there can also be the certain amount of energy associated with it this the mind it can be like maybe repeating

229
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:15,840
please make this happen maybe we don't have a clear understanding of who we're

230
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:22,559
asking or saying to this but there's just this sense I really want this please let it

231
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:32,000
happen it's uncomfortable it's uncomfortable able these expressions of greed hatred

232
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:38,080
or delusion it's uncomfortable to experience them in some ways there might feel nice

233
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:45,720
that there's energy associated with them but uh in the big picture it turns out to be agitating really

234
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,720
agitating and it's uncomfortable to recognize that we have these within us

235
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:58,399
because what happens is it's this little it's a kind of like a delicate uh

236
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:05,399
experience maybe to say oh yeah okay there's a lot of hatred you know

237
00:26:05,399 --> 00:26:12,640
aversion it will and then often what happens the next beat and I'm a bad person because I

238
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:19,919
have that this is often what's happening so it can be really helpful to

239
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:28,559
discern differentiate separate discernment from judgment

240
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:34,320
can we make this distinction between these two discernment is

241
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:40,000
helpful it is this clearer cleaner way in which we're seeing Oh yeah this is

242
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,799
not so helpful this is helpful if we want to clean dirty dishes

243
00:26:45,799 --> 00:26:51,799
it's helpful to use soap rather than just adding more grease to the to the

244
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:57,559
dish water right this is something that's obvious there's not a lot of judgment about it like oh yeah I grabbed

245
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:02,799
the wrong thing and didn't add soap to it okay but when we see something in

246
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:08,320
ourselves can we just have the same type of discernment oh yeah

247
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:16,600
that's this is uh maybe a cleaner way clean using D soap I don't know

248
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:23,760
sorry this is a discernment is like a just a clean way of noticing this is

249
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:29,000
helpful and this way it leaves us room for this greater

250
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:35,480
perspective for this maybe seeing the big picture and we can start to see

251
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:42,440
oh yeah yeah okay I could see how that's not helpful and it just feels kind of

252
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:50,120
clean or I can see how I thought maybe it would be helpful but now it's

253
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:56,880
not in contrast to judgment which is this quick reactive and kind of this

254
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:02,640
closed way and it has this value Laden quality to

255
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:10,480
it and it's often associated with the inner critic this inner critic that shows up and might say something like

256
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,919
well why did I even bother trying to do something I I can't do something new I can't even meditate I don't even know

257
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:23,519
why I'm trying or I can't change the way my life is

258
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:30,440
going it's I'm useless I can't do it this means that I'm because I'm having

259
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,760
these hindrances or whatever experience this means that uh I'm

260
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:43,880
just lazy or I don't know these things that uh we we say about

261
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:51,840
ourselves so discernment is maybe Forward Thinking is open and it

262
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,480
recognizes maybe that things didn't turn out the way that you had hoped or the way that you had planned but then

263
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,159
discernment like considers oh how did maybe there's some Alternatives here and

264
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:12,360
so there's like a Way Forward whereas judgment is like this is bad I'm bad and

265
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:17,919
then it's kind of closed loop of just these stories that just perpetuate it

266
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:26,200
it's this way that we kind of like gets bogged down and mean and nasty the things that we

267
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:33,880
say to ourselves can be really awful sometimes or this uh judgment can also

268
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:39,399
be towards other people but that inner critic sometimes the

269
00:29:39,399 --> 00:29:44,480
Judgment of other people often we notice that but the inner critic often is under

270
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:51,559
the radar because it feels so familiar it feels like oh

271
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:57,399
yes and then there's a sense of shame we hope nobody knows this about us it's

272
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:05,679
just really toxic and painful so part of this VCA this

273
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,799
separation is for us to maybe not to get

274
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:16,840
bogged down in the inner critic but maybe to like separate to be able to

275
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:24,399
notice oh yeah the inner critic is here it's telling me that I'm a terrible

276
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:30,320
person it's reminding me of all the things that I've done wrong [Music]

277
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:37,440
it's uh discouraging me from trying anything new or trying to expand my

278
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:44,120
capabilities in any particular way so I'll here I'll just say here's

279
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:49,480
something to do if you find yourself bogged down lost and weigh down with

280
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,639
this inner critic if you have this feeling of uh

281
00:30:55,639 --> 00:31:01,279
this is really strong or present and is pushing you

282
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:08,720
around you can just ask yourself how am I feeling right now

283
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,080
that's it that's all you have to do how am I feeling right

284
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:21,399
now I feel awful okay how does awful feel how am I

285
00:31:21,399 --> 00:31:29,159
feeling right now this awfulness I feel stuck I feel like it's heavy

286
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:37,159
I feel like nothing's ever going to turn out I feel terrible but then you can say well how

287
00:31:37,159 --> 00:31:42,679
does that feel like how are you feeling right now is away it starts to

288
00:31:42,679 --> 00:31:50,639
feel um maybe it turns your attention towards the uncomfortableness of the

289
00:31:50,639 --> 00:31:58,960
situation but then it also is a way in which it brings mindfulness in how am I

290
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,960
right now I'm

291
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:10,440
feeling confused not sure what to

292
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:17,399
do and then there's this way of which bringing mindfulness in is can bring a

293
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:25,518
certain amount of disruption of the

294
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,080
momentum instead of like maybe just to keep on checking in like how it feels in

295
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:39,559
the body and how it feels in the mind is a way that instead of this uh um

296
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:48,000
inner critic running the show if we can kind of like say yes but how am I right

297
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:54,760
now is this this movement towards how we are with some

298
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:01,639
care with some kindness is a way that interrupts not only the momentum of the

299
00:33:01,639 --> 00:33:08,679
inner critic but it's also inserting some different energy some different uh

300
00:33:08,679 --> 00:33:17,039
flavor it's introduces some care how am I like it's like with care like how you

301
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:26,159
would ask somebody that you could see like oh my goodness how are you is this you know way to connect with

302
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,519
and see how they are so when you find that this inner critic is up and

303
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:37,039
running way that we can just like tune into the

304
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:43,559
experience not in in with care maybe I should say this with warmth and care as

305
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:51,039
best you can as best you can because often what will happen is kind of the aversion will

306
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,919
have a certain momentum and it'll start like how the

307
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:09,638
how the F am I I don't know right we could have this you know

308
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:14,878
this uh aversion will kind of follow us uh into

309
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:23,040
that so there's this way inner the inner critic can get us spog down whereas this

310
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,240
discernment allows us to just see things yeah this is not helpful and maybe it

311
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,280
helps us to see here are things that can be done these are issues to be looked at

312
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:40,280
or situations to be managed or something like this so discernment has this movement forward whereas this judgment

313
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:46,960
in particular this inner critic has this sense of uh being stuck and so part of

314
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:53,358
this separation is to be able to distinguish discernment from judgment

315
00:34:53,359 --> 00:35:00,480
and then can we separate ourselves from the judgment and allow that discernment to still be

316
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,680
there between what's helpful and what's not helpful and I mean we do this all the

317
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:12,599
time often right with judgment that and discernment that we're kind of flitting back and forth without um even

318
00:35:12,599 --> 00:35:18,000
recognizing that we're doing that but it can be helpful to notice and

319
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:23,960
to tune into okay what is this is there a way that I can separate what's helpful

320
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,000
from not from what's not helpful here

321
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:35,880
so this VCA with the mind I talked about knowing the contents of the mind and

322
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:42,240
also in terms of what's present but also what's absent this turns out also to be

323
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:49,240
not kind of tricky like to notice what's not there we often dwell on difficulties

324
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:55,880
or dwell on things that are uncomfortable and we Overlook some of the beneficial Pleasant states of the

325
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:03,040
mind that are there also might be they're just a small amount but they are

326
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:10,160
just um often ignored or dismissed but when some of these difficulties start to

327
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,240
diminish when we start to become maybe a little more separate from

328
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:21,119
them they we can start to really notice and feel some of these uh beautiful

329
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:26,560
states of Mind here's a very short poem from

330
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:33,920
analo some of you might know analio B analio he's a premier I would say maybe

331
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:41,319
the foremost uh uh academic who kind of like studies uh this tradition and he's

332
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:46,480
also a premier you know meditator and uh

333
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:55,319
he's written books and books and books both on the academic side as well as how to practice so p and alio and uh here's

334
00:36:55,319 --> 00:36:59,040
a very short poem

335
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:06,240
such Joy it can be when the mind is

336
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,200
free even if only

337
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:21,319
temporarily such Joy it can be when the mind is free even if only

338
00:37:21,319 --> 00:37:28,359
temporarily I kind of love this it's kind of this Whimsical fun playful way to think about it but just he's pointing

339
00:37:28,359 --> 00:37:34,880
to the power of uh what it can be like when we notice some of the absence of

340
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,599
some of our difficulties if there was a strong sense of really wanting something and just kind of like seeing oh yeah

341
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:47,560
that faded away I didn't satisfy or uh or maybe you did and that then the

342
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:52,960
wanting went away but this sense of noticing when some difficulties are are

343
00:37:52,960 --> 00:38:02,359
not there can be really helpful and supportive so this idea of VCA this

344
00:38:02,359 --> 00:38:09,599
separation to and to separate is both like separate ourselves physically move

345
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:16,480
ourselves into a place that supports some ease and settledness and also mentally to

346
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,920
separate ourselves often What's called the hindrances and then this whole idea of

347
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,480
just to even be able to recognize that things can be separated and maybe put

348
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:35,599
into helpful and unhelpful as well as to notice well what

349
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:42,000
is going on in the mind what is present and what's not present what's helpful

350
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:49,359
what's uh not helpful and then I uh made this this uh

351
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:56,839
clunky little expression of being independent of what is unhelpful I kind

352
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:03,760
of like this idea of Independence you know this you know it's a way of feeling like okay I've doesn't

353
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:09,960
mean I don't know what's unhelpful but and I can interact with it and maybe be

354
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:15,960
with it but I'm independent of it I can separate myself if need

355
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:21,880
be so thank you and I think I'll open it up for some uh questions or comments

356
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,078
thank you

357
00:39:30,319 --> 00:39:34,440
does anybody have uh something they'd like to

358
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:46,119
say is sloth and torpor different from feeling sleepy while I'm

359
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:54,160
meditating so there's a um two different ways we can Define feeling sleepy one is

360
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:59,880
feeling sleepy due to lack of sleep and there's one that's feeling sleepy as a

361
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:05,119
way in which the mind kind of does is like trying to avoid something so it

362
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:13,359
kind of uh shuts down or it just hangs out in this foggy place so it can't be

363
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:20,599
with what's over there it's very common both because we're sleep deprived so but

364
00:40:20,599 --> 00:40:25,680
and we often want to avoid things here's how you can tell the

365
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:30,880
difference if you're doing a meditation period And if the and you're feeling

366
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,160
like oh my gosh I can't stay awake and you even find yourself you know doing this type of

367
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:42,280
thing if like the Bell Rings into the meditation period you're like oh great okay now I got to go do this I got to

368
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:49,200
take care of this I got to do this if there's all of a sudden energy returns it's not due to lack of sleep it's due

369
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:55,359
to just the way the mind is uh wanting to not be with some uncomfortable

370
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:03,359
experience and it's okay this happen to everybody this I've done a my a lot of this myself

371
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,400
so anybody else have a question or

372
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:20,800
comment thank you um when you were talking about VCA

373
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,079
initially um after your uh hike in the

374
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:32,800
in Utah um it sounded more like um it was

375
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:39,000
related to taking Refuge oh very nice and um so I and then when you were

376
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:44,440
talking about it further and it became more about discernment it seemed somewhat different

377
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:51,720
but is there a relationship between VCA and taking Refuge are they like the

378
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,240
Opposites of one another or in furtherance of taking Refuge just not

379
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:02,720
not sure how to yeah yeah thank you Nancy for this this is a nice

380
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:07,760
idea um so one way like I kind of like

381
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,160
think about it is uh sometimes you know taking refuge in the Buddha Dharma SAA

382
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:19,040
but we also use this word refuge we kind of like create Wildlife refuges right

383
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,480
where Wildlife we separate them from other things out there that are going to eat them or poachers or whatever is

384
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:32,359
going to happen and we put them uh in uh you know in an enclosure of some kind or something like this so in

385
00:42:32,359 --> 00:42:40,480
the same way I would say they're kind of they're related this way of uh yeah I'm separating and orienting

386
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,200
towards what's

387
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:52,599
helpful Diana we have we have one question online uh what is the difference between

388
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:59,400
VCA and renouncing yeah so there's a uh a

389
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:06,079
similarity but uh renunciation is more about uh

390
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,200
Simplicity and it's more about

391
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:19,960
um yeah I would say it's more an emphasis on Simplicity and of course there's uh a relationship between um

392
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:27,119
separating out what helpful and unhelpful and just being with what's helpful and renunciation so there there

393
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:35,119
there's a relationship but I would say there's a maybe a distinction maybe renunciation has the

394
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:40,359
goes up maybe a step further it's more like maybe letting go of what's

395
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:46,160
unhelpful whereas I'm just pointing to uh recognizing that you can make a

396
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:53,400
difference or or dis distinction or discernment and um and to do so maybe

397
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,680
renunciation is you could say maybe it's the next step after

398
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:04,160
N I think is the poly word for renunciation they don't have any similar

399
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,119
atmology but thank you for the

400
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:16,319
question yes we're we're at time so I'll answer this one quickly but if you have can ask it quickly I'll be I'll be quick

401
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:22,760
um the word that came to mind for me or a couple of different words was

402
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:29,920
Solitude um which to me has a very positive con ation um and then also I

403
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,760
was thinking about protection and I know that the the Buddha um every day would

404
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:43,359
take time out from meeting with people and take time out during the year to to

405
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:49,520
be um to be separate and that that that feels like that's a way to be more

406
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:56,480
balanced is to take time away um to kind of recharge one's one's

407
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:02,200
batteries and Solitude um and I I value that a lot and Nature's a great place to

408
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:10,480
do that yeah thank you thank you via sometimes gets translated as Solitude and sometimes as seclusion also yeah

409
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,119
yeah thank you okay wishing you all a lovely rest

410
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:25,400
of the evening and safe travels home if you'd like you come up and talk to me otherwise I wish you well thank you
