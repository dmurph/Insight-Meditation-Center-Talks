1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,200
so good morning everyone and welcome to imc and

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,000
in person and online just to say if you do some brief words

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,039
about the meditation practice one of the

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,279
wondrous miraculous aspects of being a human being

5
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:32,398
is having an equal ability to perceive what's happening

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,399
externally to ourselves as it is to uh perceive what's internal

7
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,320
to ourselves and i like to think of mindfulness sometimes

8
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:53,280
as sitting at the interface between the outer world and the inner world

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,480
and either one of those or both of them can be agitated can be challenging

10
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:06,880
but the meeting place the bridge the interface between

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,159
the inner and the outer the mindfulness that's a place where perhaps we can sit

12
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,360
calmly we can sit peacefully

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,840
in our capacity to be mindful

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:34,000
that to explore what it means to be mindful what it means to be aware

15
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,680
peacefully even if what we're aware of is not

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,439
peaceful and we have this ability because

17
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,040
mindfulness sits not in the world and not in

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,079
the outer world not in the inner world but this magic place

19
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:03,439
between the two and with that kind of image and idea

20
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,840
maybe you can experiment today and sit here for the next half an hour

21
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:17,280
with seeing what it's like to be aware of whatever is happening internally and externally

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,959
for the awareness the perception of it the mindfulness of it

23
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:29,040
is peaceful even if the rest of you does not feel peaceful

24
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:36,519
so assuming a upright posture

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,599
into some simple way that's easy maybe setting your body at ease

26
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,040
taking a few long slow deep breaths and relaxing

27
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,239
setting your body at ease

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:15,280
perhaps relaxing the face

29
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,319
the shoulders

30
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,239
the belly

31
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,400
maybe there's something about your mind you can set at

32
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,080
ease relaxing the pressure to think

33
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:06,640
and setting your heart at some peace moving towards ease

34
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,239
no matter what challenges you have

35
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:33,280
and when we get preoccupied with the inner world preoccupied with the outer world

36
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,600
there's a way in which awareness attention becomes narrow

37
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,000
when we were when they were sitting in that interface the meeting place of inner and

38
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:58,560
outer world and we're mindful they from there

39
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:08,680
sometimes the mind can become broad wide

40
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,479
aware of all things

41
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:28,080
but with awareness not troubled by any of it

42
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:35,120
you might be troubled but mindfulness does not have to be

43
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:42,638
just aware what is that place

44
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,840
of peaceful

45
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,638
awareness of what is

46
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,960
so

47
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,879
so

48
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:20,759
so

49
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,240
foreign

50
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,600
so

51
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,399
so

52
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,880
so

53
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,880
so

54
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:11,320
[Music] so

55
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,279
uh

56
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,720
so

57
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,160
so

58
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:47,559
so

59
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,880
so

60
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,080
so

61
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,880
so

62
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,440
uh

63
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,840
so

64
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:57,880
so

65
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:48,679
so

66
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,880
so

67
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:40,559
mindfulness can be aware of the outer world

68
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,720
it can be aware of the inner world

69
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:54,679
in a sense mindfulness sits at the middle

70
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:02,559
in that middle place

71
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:10,559
mindfulness is also connected to our actions

72
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:16,799
what we do in response to our inner world what we do in response to our outer

73
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:19,799
world

74
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,559
and if awareness is agitated

75
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:38,320
so will our actions if our awareness is peaceful

76
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:47,640
our actions will come out of that peace carry with it qualities of the peace

77
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,200
may it be that whatever peace

78
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:09,360
that we have from this practice that it inspires us to act in the world

79
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,320
with kindness

80
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:22,640
with wisdom with compassion and care

81
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:36,080
may whatever peacefulness that we encounter

82
00:31:36,399 --> 00:31:43,840
support us contributing to a better world for everyone

83
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,559
may all beings be happy

84
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:59,799
may all beings be safe

85
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:05,279
may all beings be peaceful

86
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,559
may all beings be free

87
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:21,610
[Music] so

88
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:25,690
[Music]

89
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:19,440
so i spent the last two weeks teaching a retreat at our retreat center

90
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:25,600
and it was a peaceful life

91
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:32,880
it was nice to be there and i was very aware that

92
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,960
there was lots of absence of peace the opposite of peace in many places

93
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:42,960
around this country and around the world

94
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:52,399
and that one of the concerns that exists especially in this country

95
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:58,000
but all over is the presence of hate

96
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:06,720
and so some people are now preoccupied with the amount of hate that exists

97
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:10,800
some people are preoccupied with hating

98
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:22,480
so i thought i would talk a little bit about buddha's teachings about hate

99
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,878
and maybe it's a bit of a

100
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:35,440
reflection that supports us as we consider our relationship with

101
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:41,598
the hate and the violence that exists in our country and elsewhere

102
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:52,638
and it's not a incidental topic

103
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:59,440
for buddhists or for the teachings of the buddha the buddha placed

104
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:07,040
the understanding hate and overcoming hate

105
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:16,680
the destruction of hate at the center of his message of his teachings

106
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:25,440
and it goes together with two other afflictive mental states mental states

107
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:32,800
that harms the person who has them and uh greed

108
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:38,480
and confusion delusion

109
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,760
so great hatred and delusion it's often those three come off the tongue of

110
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:52,480
buddhist dharma teachers very easily and

111
00:35:52,960 --> 00:36:00,240
the buddha said that someone was asked how do you uh know the dharma how does one know the

112
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:07,119
dharma for oneself and if dharma means the teachings of the buddha the great wonderful philosophies

113
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,599
of buddhism and great books are written that you could study what the dharma is

114
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:21,520
but how would one know this know the dharma surprisingly he defined it

115
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,960
as understanding great hatred and delusion and

116
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,400
the ending of it he talks of one of the

117
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:40,400
great little phrases describing the dharma is that it's directly visible here and now

118
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,720
and how is it directly visible here and now in seeing the ending of greed hate and

119
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,720
delusion so you know we have all these you can read

120
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,800
philosophies of buddhism and all the stuff and you know great philosophies of

121
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,079
emptiness and consciousness or all kinds of explorations

122
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,520
but the heart of it is this you know is this ending of great hatred

123
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,839
and delusion what is the goal of the buddha's teaching the buddha said

124
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,839
the goal is the ending of great hate and delusion so

125
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:29,520
when i first encountered this frequency in which this is being taught my mind started to glaze over it

126
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:34,839
and and it kind of was a little dismissive of it that this part of the

127
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:42,880
teaching uh it also seems so reductionistic it's like where's the great spirituality

128
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,040
where is great spiritual states and spiritual kind of realities and whatever you know like there must be you know

129
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,920
that that can't be it but apparently it is

130
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,000
it might be disappointing for you to hear

131
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,160
but uh the um but as long as there is

132
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,320
hate in the world i think it's pretty wonderful to have a

133
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:19,838
religion that's based on coming to the end of hate front and center

134
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,640
other religions have other things front and center center and then the virtues and how you live maybe is a

135
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,240
little bit on the edges of it of that center but

136
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:39,599
for the buddha front and center was the end of greed hatred and delusion

137
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:49,760
and uh and so the dharma practice becomes understanding how hatred works

138
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:56,800
lessening our hatred not acting on hatred enough so that we can find our way find

139
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:03,920
a path that takes us to a time where it comes to an end for us

140
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,400
and but that and that that includes not just hatred it's a big word and some people maybe feel i don't have

141
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:18,240
hatred i'm just irritated with my neighbor or there's bitterness

142
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,240
there is resentment all those are considered to be forms of

143
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:31,040
hatred there's also hostility and the hostility and hatred and the

144
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:36,320
buddhist teachings are closely connected like almost synonymous to

145
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:43,838
whatever hatred is it always involves some degree of hostility as part of it

146
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:49,839
and does irritation always have some quality hostility in it

147
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:54,960
does frustration have some degree of hostility in it

148
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:03,599
i don't know maybe maybe you know it depends how we define these words but if you're frustrated with your computer

149
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,359
and you throw it across this room then there's hostility

150
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:16,560
in it right so for the buddha even the mildest

151
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:23,520
irritation and frustration is a seed bed for hatred

152
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:29,040
so as we begin looking at this you know the ecology of hatred

153
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,760
the frustration irritation all these things are part of it and part and parcel of it

154
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,960
there's a uh uh i like to think that uh

155
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,920
the buddhist scriptures don't have like a formal beginning like the bible has the book of genesis and it's kind of

156
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,119
like you know it has a clear beginning but i'd like to think of the big the

157
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:01,520
dhammapada this is a collection of verses it's such a popular text one of the most

158
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:07,520
most read scriptural texts from the time of the buddha that

159
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:14,880
kind of at the beginning of that i think of this little bit like you know the beginning

160
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:22,319
and what's interesting about it is that uh you know the bible begins with

161
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:29,920
reference to god like god created everything in contrast to that if i'm allowed to

162
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,200
contrast it which maybe i'm not but it may be just you know

163
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:40,800
provisionally that uh that

164
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:46,640
the buddhist beginning dhammapada at least is not nothing to do with god or

165
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:53,359
anything outside of the individual it's more like it all begins in our mind

166
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,800
it says all experience is born of the mind made of the mind

167
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:04,079
creative the mind the mind leads the lung

168
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:12,160
so it's quite it's quite a contrast between pointing towards god or pointing towards one's own mind

169
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:19,119
and after saying that the text then goes has it in two verses and then it goes on to the next one

170
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:21,760
and it says

171
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,240
he attacked they attacked they attacked me

172
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:37,760
the emphasis is important they attacked me they abused me

173
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,720
they defeated me

174
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:50,480
harboring hostility like this hatred does not end

175
00:42:51,119 --> 00:42:56,800
they attacked me they abused me they defeated me

176
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:01,920
not harboring ill will hostility like this

177
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,960
hatred comes to an end hatred does not end

178
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:14,640
through hatred hatred ends by non-hatred

179
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:21,119
this is the ancient truth and some translations like to translate

180
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,960
non-hatred as love which makes it a little more inspiring for some people

181
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,240
hatred does not end by hatred hatred ends by love

182
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:40,240
but i like i like to translate it as non-hatred which is a literal translation because there's more than just love that

183
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:46,000
can end hatred generosity care uh

184
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:52,640
friendliness there's all these kind of range of things that oh they're they are the alternative to

185
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:59,440
hatred and so here we have this text you know that here again we find this emphasis on

186
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:05,359
hatred front and center emphasizing the importance of the mind

187
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:11,520
and then being careful with your mind because what you do with the mind has consequences

188
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:18,400
and uh those beginning verses go like this something like this all experiences

189
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,240
born of the mind rooted in the mind created by the mind

190
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:32,240
speak or act with a corrupted mind

191
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,520
and suffering follows like the cart a heavy cart

192
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:43,440
follows the oxen that's pulling it along so this burden you carry along

193
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:52,000
and then it repeats at the beginning again it says all experience is born of mind

194
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,760
made by mind as mined as a forerunner

195
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,640
speak and act with a pure mind and happiness follows

196
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:10,240
like the shadow behind you more or less i'm paraphrasing the verses

197
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,519
a shadow has no weight let me try weighing your shadow

198
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:21,760
and uh and so the difference between a burden this weight that you carry with you

199
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:29,119
versus there's something that has no weight that comes along everywhere you go happiness follows like a shadow

200
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:37,040
and that's this you know wonderful descriptive descriptive difference between suffering and happiness

201
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:44,000
and uh and so what we do we say and what we do are consequential

202
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:49,920
for our happiness for our suffering for the burdens we carry

203
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:55,920
and for the happiness that we that float along that easy for us to have

204
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:00,200
and then that goes on talks about hatred

205
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:06,400
hatred is considered to be a fire it burns us

206
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:13,040
it's sometimes referred to as uh it's kind of like a

207
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:19,920
if you hold a liquid poison in your hand but you have a wound in your hand a cut

208
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,640
then the poison can go in and they can you can get poisoned so so having hatred is like having

209
00:46:26,640 --> 00:46:33,760
poison in a injured wounded hand open an open wound in that

210
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,079
hatred is considered a kind of bondage people who are caught in hatred are

211
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:47,599
caught in bondage so it's clearly the tradition buddha understands that hatred harms the person

212
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:53,359
who hates but to tell that to someone who hates

213
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:58,880
or someone tells you when you're full of hate following doesn't help

214
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,680
it's you know so but to understand hatred one of the things to understand i think

215
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:11,599
is very important is that hatred creates a strong sense of

216
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:16,480
separation between oneself and others

217
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:22,400
hatred narrows the broadness and the openness of the mind

218
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:27,839
and it creates creates definitions creates very strong definitions or

219
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:34,480
boundaries are between who i am and who someone else is

220
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:41,280
and whereas the absence of hatred loosens and dissolves some of these

221
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:47,359
strong definitions strong boundaries strong ideas of me my people

222
00:47:47,359 --> 00:47:53,760
you those people or something but is is that reasonable to point out

223
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:00,559
to someone probably not i was struck by how much the news

224
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:05,599
they read the popular news concerns things that relate to great

225
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:11,680
hatred and delusion violence lots of it

226
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:18,079
and it was not violence you know that from people with hatred i mean i don't think the hurricanes and tornadoes

227
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:23,520
hate us but uh they impact us with a lot of you know very

228
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:28,800
challenging and so it's very evocative people read about the challenges

229
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:35,200
how often do you have headline news that uh you know

230
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:42,000
someone loved someone else someone cared about someone else

231
00:48:42,079 --> 00:48:50,319
you know or you know i wonder i i haven't read any news about how many people have been mobilized

232
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:56,079
to help the ukrainian refugees i heard a friend of mine recently the

233
00:48:56,079 --> 00:49:03,599
other day told me that she has a friend who um

234
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:10,400
bought an airplane ticket for eastern europe and told friends and told whoever may

235
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:17,520
had a gofund fund me page that i'm going there to help the refugees and if you want to give me money you can

236
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,839
i paid my own ticket my own way there and so he went there and just on his own

237
00:49:23,839 --> 00:49:30,800
initiative and he spent three weeks driving people from the ukrainian border to wherever they had to go refugees

238
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,680
that's what he did and so that didn't make headline news

239
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:45,920
maybe it doesn't deserve that but the question is why do we why does the news focus on problems always and

240
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:52,240
expressions of violence and hatred and i think that one of the i suspect

241
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:59,440
that one of the reasons is that human beings have a strong survival instinct

242
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:06,000
very strong sense of wanting to survive wanting to exist as an individual as a person

243
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,200
and so things that threaten our survival get our attention

244
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,440
and and as we get as we read about things and learn about things or have

245
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,640
experiences that threaten seem to threaten our survival in some way

246
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:29,200
directly or indirectly it strengthens the sense of self

247
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:35,760
it strengthens me who has to respond do something protect myself and all that

248
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,520
and the focus becomes increasingly on me and my people

249
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,640
in order to be safe or get our way or be able to have our

250
00:50:46,640 --> 00:50:51,760
be fulfilled in some way and that's what and so when we read

251
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,800
about these things these things are born from self-concern

252
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:03,200
conceits selfishness sometimes we read about it and get horrified or be

253
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:08,240
upset or get angry it points the attention back for many

254
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:16,000
people back to themselves now i feel terrible now i'm worried about climate change and what's going to impact me and

255
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,480
now you know all these terrible things happening you know something has to happen and you know and

256
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:29,520
so this self gets involved in a way and one of the ways that gets involved

257
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:34,559
is um now apparently in here in this country

258
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:41,440
is astounding amount of conspiracy theories astounding amount of speculation about

259
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:47,280
all this and i read recently that um some idea that that whole movement

260
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:53,040
towards conspiracy theories had its birth with the the aftermath of the assassination of

261
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:58,559
john f kennedy i remember when i was i was i was a kid then

262
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:04,960
i remember my parents and their friends would read all the books that got published right after the assassination

263
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:10,160
about all their theories about what really happened there and i remember my listening to my

264
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:17,119
parents friends and having these conversations about what could have happened

265
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:22,960
and of course people want to understand what's happening it's how we protect ourselves or how we find our way but

266
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:30,400
also understanding ourselves and standing the situation often reinforces again the conceit

267
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:35,440
i'm right i figured it out now i know i need to know

268
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:41,440
and there's those who don't know and those are no and in a confusing world where it's hard to know

269
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:49,279
it can be the confusion is frightening is you know how do we survive how do we manage ourselves this way

270
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,280
and so the whole spectrum you know of political spectrum are full

271
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:02,800
of filled with conspiracy theories ideas theories coming up with ideas and and uh

272
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:08,960
you know i was it's quite something even you know to have these conversations with good friends and

273
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:17,200
feel going down a rabbit hole you know with people presenting with great certainty this is how it is you know or

274
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,720
and you know in some ways sometimes it is how it is in some ways but what's the context for what they're saying what is

275
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:29,839
the wider view and what's useful and how do we find our way with all this

276
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,839
so buddhism doesn't have a final answer to this

277
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:43,359
i don't think buddhism ever expected the buddha never seemed to have offered

278
00:53:43,359 --> 00:53:50,480
a recipe to solve human problems the world

279
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:58,079
is that maybe that's disappointing what he offered

280
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:04,960
was how to solve us as individuals

281
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:11,359
so that we could be forces of good in the world

282
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:17,920
we can change rather than looking for god as the creation of the world

283
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:23,520
we look at ourselves being the creators of the world the world that comes from out of us the

284
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:31,040
world that will grow from how we live this life and one of the core principles

285
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:36,559
of this is don't succumb to hate

286
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,920
don't live with hate work to end hate

287
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:48,720
in yourself and promote the ending of hate in the world

288
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:54,079
speak up when there's violence

289
00:54:54,079 --> 00:55:00,319
make a refuge for people who are suffering the violence of the world

290
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:06,440
be a refuge for the people who are struggling and afraid

291
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:12,720
move in the direction of love of care and compassion

292
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:18,960
not not in the direction of excessive self-concern and self-preoccupation that narrows the

293
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:25,280
scope of our attention and how do we do that when so much

294
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:31,200
reinforcement is to get narrow again back to oneself my concerns my needs and everything are

295
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:36,240
my opinions and i am in these conversations with people

296
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:44,240
sometimes we're talking about what's happening in the world and they get people get opinionated

297
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:52,079
and as they get opinionated i get this feeling like i'm supposed to have an opinion

298
00:55:52,079 --> 00:55:58,880
i'm either supposed to agree with them or if i disagree like like then i have to assert myself and

299
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:05,359
and then i'm kind of like now i'm caught up in this whole thing you know who's right who's wrong my

300
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:10,960
opinions correcting people them wanting to correct me or tell me

301
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:16,799
this is how it is and and you know the focus is on me you know it's it's not a comfortable world to be

302
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:22,960
in i don't think it leads to that to be in conversations but that's the

303
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:30,119
kind of the consequence of the conversations doesn't lead to peace

304
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:36,559
so what leads to peace if we ask the question what leads to

305
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:42,480
world peace we might be missing the point we might

306
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:48,880
be missing where we can make the most change which is in ourselves

307
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:56,960
can we not narrow our scope narrow our attention narrow focus can we not be caught

308
00:56:56,960 --> 00:57:02,160
in self-preservation self-protection in a way

309
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:08,400
that creates a strong separation of self and others creates the other and defines ourselves

310
00:57:08,400 --> 00:57:14,318
in relation to others and the people who are a threat and people who are not

311
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,319
in one passage in the teachings of the buddha it said that the buddha brought

312
00:57:20,319 --> 00:57:27,359
an end to greed hatred and delusion and then lived

313
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:33,280
with courage bravery and taking a stand

314
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:38,960
kind of powerful language to live with courage bravery and taking a stand so this is not

315
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:44,240
you know being peaceful for oneself and ending hatred and therefore just kind of being

316
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:51,520
passively and disappearing into some nice meditative meditation state

317
00:57:52,400 --> 00:57:59,359
to then what does it mean to live with courage and bravery out of non-hate

318
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:06,160
non-hate does not mean we become passive but what is a state of friendliness of

319
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:12,000
love of care of goodwill that we're capable of capable of

320
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:19,920
which those are all states where the the focus is not on

321
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:25,440
excessively predominantly on oneself one's own survival

322
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:32,640
the doors of attention are open and the attention is concerned with others

323
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:41,520
and this ability to open up the doors of concern out into the world

324
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:48,640
um can be frightening because aren't we

325
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:53,200
supposed to take care of ourselves how are we gonna manage then

326
00:58:54,640 --> 00:59:03,119
and that doesn't and that that movement doesn't get a lot of uh press in the paper as i said the news

327
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:08,799
because it probably doesn't people don't click to read a lot about love

328
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:13,680
because it doesn't trigger their self-preservation concerns

329
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:19,520
or artilation concerns i mean how many times do we read because

330
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:26,079
we're kind of titillated by it all maybe i think uh there's a there's this uh it

331
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:33,838
may i don't know i i don't i just read headlines and some people talk to me about it this amazing um

332
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:42,240
libel trial that's going on and on and on between these two actors

333
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:47,760
i mean i'm just blown away at that public resources courts and judges are

334
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:53,040
being used for such an amazing amount of time

335
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:58,559
for this crazy libel thing and uh

336
00:59:58,559 --> 01:00:03,839
and then you know is this and why are people so interested why is

337
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:09,599
it in the news every day why isn't such a big deal so i haven't read the articles i don't

338
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:15,200
know maybe it's really central to the progress of humankind

339
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:20,960
and i'm missing something here that uh

340
01:00:20,960 --> 01:00:26,559
um but what about the you know the news

341
01:00:26,559 --> 01:00:35,760
about love with the news about care and support and what's the news that inspires that in us

342
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:44,559
where's the news there's news about the art the size of armies and how many soldiers are killed

343
01:00:44,559 --> 01:00:50,319
what about the news of all the many people who are helping you

344
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:54,160
and all the lives they're saving him

345
01:00:55,359 --> 01:01:00,400
so this movement towards opening up to ourselves

346
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:06,480
to the wider world and in buddhism it's not about only

347
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:12,799
focusing externally we have this amazing ability to be aware

348
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:19,760
at the meeting place of others and ourselves the outer world and the inner world

349
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:25,200
and buddhist practice is to have that awareness open and broad

350
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:30,480
to be encompassing both so we can be careful with what's going

351
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:36,960
on inside come to a resolution around our own hostilities and resentments and

352
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:42,559
bitterness as we have to bring those to an end

353
01:01:42,559 --> 01:01:48,640
while also being open to the wider world so the non-hatred that we

354
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:55,039
grow in then can meet the world with all these wholesome and positive

355
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:58,720
ways with goodwill

356
01:02:01,119 --> 01:02:04,359
and so

357
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:13,039
so now we have in this country you know that it's horrific with the violence that's happened just these last months

358
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:20,480
and that number it seems like phenomenal number of mass shootings going on like a record

359
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:25,520
number in terms of frequency in a short period of time

360
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:35,838
and uh if you read a little bit the statistics of hate crimes in the united states

361
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:44,880
the numerically the greatest number of hate

362
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:50,078
crimes are directed towards blacks

363
01:02:50,319 --> 01:02:58,280
and then the second greatest is people who are lgbtq

364
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:05,920
queer people people who have you know other gender orientations or sexual orientations

365
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,319
it doesn't get the same level of um press the violence against

366
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:20,400
lgbtq as other violences except maybe the shooting in orlando some years ago

367
01:03:21,359 --> 01:03:28,000
and and then it's hispanics

368
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:35,039
in terms of frequency in terms of um per capita for the different population

369
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:43,520
size of these different groups of people the greatest amount of hate crimes

370
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:49,520
per capita of is uh in this country is against jews

371
01:03:49,520 --> 01:03:55,839
there's about five six million jews in this country but the disproportionate amount of violence

372
01:03:55,839 --> 01:04:02,640
or hate is directed towards jews given their population size

373
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:10,720
and then blacks and then lgbtq and hispanics

374
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:17,520
and now we have this growing amount of hate for against asians

375
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:24,720
it seems to just be increasing seems like the whole pandemic and how the pandemic was

376
01:04:24,720 --> 01:04:31,039
how certain people blamed chinese for the pandemic

377
01:04:31,039 --> 01:04:38,839
was kind of the catalyst for a whole new level of violence against asians

378
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:46,480
so so i think we have to i think you'll

379
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:51,520
have to be very careful not to have that kind of reaction to all

380
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:56,640
this that were horrified maybe

381
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:02,480
but to continue the movement of different groups in this country

382
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:09,440
seeing each other as being separate and distinct the care that goes into

383
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:14,480
recognizing the individual horrific horror

384
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:20,240
problems and being careful not to not to exact

385
01:05:20,240 --> 01:05:25,760
exaggerate or extenuate the separations of people and the

386
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:31,440
hostility between people and is that possible is it reasonable to do

387
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:37,359
that so not to have to include but rather keep opening up

388
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:45,200
and imagine that if each of us could be a refuge for anybody who comes into our

389
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:53,039
view could we be a friendly

390
01:05:53,920 --> 01:06:00,799
presence with goodwill for anybody who comes into our purview

391
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:09,039
what would it take is that reasonable is it

392
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:15,760
and how do we do that how do we keep how do we make room in people for our hearts even when people

393
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:24,079
do violent things even when we have to oppose the violence and say no and try to stop it

394
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:29,440
but but you know there's this that you know never succumb to hatred

395
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:35,440
is the message of the buddha work for the end of hatred

396
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:41,599
in your in yourself promote the end of hatred in the world

397
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:49,760
and perhaps with an open heart live with bravery with courage

398
01:06:50,480 --> 01:06:56,559
and the teaching was that the buddha took a stand and what do you take a stand in

399
01:06:58,079 --> 01:07:04,160
one of the things to take a stand in that the buddha talks about is taking a stand in peace

400
01:07:04,799 --> 01:07:09,760
taking a stand in non-hatred

401
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:14,760
and then living in the world

402
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:21,039
living with love and good will and kindness

403
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:31,039
supporting our hearts peace supporting a possibility for other people to have their heart at peace

404
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:37,599
what does it take so we might not have the solution for

405
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:41,720
what our society needs

406
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:47,920
but in my mind

407
01:07:51,440 --> 01:07:57,000
if we can be friendly to people

408
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:07,359
who knows what that impact of that friendliness has on someone we meet

409
01:08:07,359 --> 01:08:15,200
one of the sources one of the one of the prime conditions for a certain degree of violence in our society and hatred

410
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:20,480
is people who are bullied people who feel marginalized people who

411
01:08:20,480 --> 01:08:25,838
feel that the door has been closed to them

412
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:33,040
who knows if you're friendly to the little kid down the street

413
01:08:36,960 --> 01:08:45,600
you might never know how how significant that was because that act of friendliness

414
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:51,120
might have prevented someone growing up to have all kinds of

415
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:54,560
horrific violent tendencies

416
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,600
what if someone had

417
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:10,238
been friendly to someone like hitler when he was a kid could that have changed history

418
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:16,880
i don't know is it naive to say so we'll never know how many

419
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:23,520
hitlers have not become hitler's because they had

420
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:30,400
a loving grandmother or a neighbor who believed in them and supported them and

421
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:37,600
gave them kindness and support we might not have the solutions to the

422
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,600
world of today

423
01:09:42,799 --> 01:09:49,199
but it's possible that each of you has a solution

424
01:09:49,199 --> 01:09:54,000
for the world what it's going to be like in 50 years

425
01:09:54,239 --> 01:09:59,760
you'll never know it but maybe you are kind

426
01:09:59,760 --> 01:10:05,280
to a small child or to grow an

427
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:10,239
older child or a teenager or an adult

428
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:16,719
maybe you showed them that they were lovable or

429
01:10:16,719 --> 01:10:24,159
you showed them that they were worthy you showed them a different way

430
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:30,400
that people don't see too many people don't see in our society too many people are ignored and

431
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:36,239
forgotten and marginalized

432
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:42,960
it's possible that each of you one of you not each of you maybe i met all of you

433
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:48,080
but maybe even if it's just one of you and we don't know which one it's going

434
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:54,080
to be yet one of you and you will never know actually

435
01:10:54,080 --> 01:10:59,679
but turns out that one of you here today is going to be responsible for the

436
01:10:59,679 --> 01:11:05,840
fact that in 50 years

437
01:11:06,719 --> 01:11:12,880
someone did not become hitler but became

438
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,560
the force of goodness and support

439
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:24,840
we don't the cause and conditions of how things evolve where do they

440
01:11:24,840 --> 01:11:32,159
begin like to propose they always begin here with us with our actions just like the

441
01:11:32,159 --> 01:11:38,080
beginning of dhammapada it begins with our actions what we do

442
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:41,840
that's the beginning for the future

443
01:11:46,960 --> 01:11:51,840
i trust it i trust that we can live

444
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:58,640
in wholesome supportive ways with love and care and compassion

445
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:04,159
i trust it and i don't need to know

446
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:12,480
what the consequences are in 50 years for doing so because i believe in it now

447
01:12:15,840 --> 01:12:22,760
so may you each be a force of good in this world

448
01:12:23,199 --> 01:12:30,800
so in 50 years it's a better world so thank you

449
