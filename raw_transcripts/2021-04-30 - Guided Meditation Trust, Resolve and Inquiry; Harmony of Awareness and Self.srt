1
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,960
there's a dharma teaching that expresses the activity

2
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,840
of awareness with with it it says there are three

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,440
factors the first factor gil was talking about

4
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:42,239
yesterday confidence in the

5
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:49,360
the dharma bird in pali is sada in in sanskrit shraddha

6
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:57,280
and it it covers the territory between trust and confidence

7
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:05,600
maybe the way when you are very thirsty and you drink some water

8
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:13,840
and you taste how drinking water quenches thirst

9
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,159
you trust that activity

10
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,040
so we in awareness

11
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:32,320
sati mindfulness zazen [Music]

12
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,880
the activity of being aware

13
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:47,920
we entrust attention to the activity of the moment

14
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,600
and we discover we realize

15
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:01,280
that when it's met with non-grasping when it's allowed to be

16
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,719
what it is something trustable

17
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,599
in that form of experiencing rises

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,520
second teaching second attribute of this threefold teaching of the

19
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,160
activity of awareness is resolve

20
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,760
when our intention

21
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:42,000
ripens it finds expression and activity

22
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:50,080
through resolve

23
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,440
and and the third attribute often called benzene

24
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:02,000
great doubt but maybe another way to understand it is

25
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:10,319
inquiry that doesn't conceptualize

26
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,040
what's experienced in that inquiry

27
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,800
allows it to be dynamic

28
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,959
it allows it to be we could even call it the truth of the

29
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:35,519
moment the truth of the moment this appears to

30
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,080
be happening

31
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,519
so confidence trust resolve and this kind of

32
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:52,159
inquiry

33
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:02,879
this is how it is in this moment and it's dynamic

34
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,560
so as we start to sit

35
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,720
the confidence the trust in your own body

its stability finding the stability of posture

how you're sitting

on how you're sitting and letting your body

become upright take its place in the world of being

42

within uprightness and openness

00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:23,680
you know so be it this body

00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,070
is part of all being [Music]

45
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:38,479
sitting in the midst of all being

46
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:45,680
and when we trust what's happening would be trust own

47
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,840
being we have nothing to prove

48
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:07,840
there isn't anything in particular that we need to assert become

49
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:21,840
we just trusted as it is

50
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,560
and when we trust the breath

51
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,840
we let it happen

52
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:48,000
and such as the nature of the breath we can notice as we allow the breath

53
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:54,160
how is that how is it to allow the body to breathe

54
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:03,199
it has a physical expression

55
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,919
and as we contact the sensations of the breath in the body

56
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:16,319
they instruct us those sensations instruct us

57
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:31,199
on the activity of allah

58
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,880
candid nostrils in the area behind the nose

59
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,639
can it soften and open

60
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,199
can the throat relax

61
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,440
can the chest

62
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:05,120
open can the abdomen soften

63
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,440
sometimes it's helpful in the first breaths

64
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:20,639
like one one teaching you can try on you can experiment if you breathe

65
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:29,680
in fully you hold the inhale and you just gently push down

66
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:36,349
with the diaphragm it's almost like you're opening up the

67
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:41,839
[Music] abdomen

68
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:56,480
and then release and you can experiment doing that a couple of times

69
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,360
and then allow the breath and just notice

70
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:09,200
is there any change maybe there is maybe there isn't

71
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:23,519
but trusting the body and breath to find their own rhythm

72
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,080
it's in the realm of sensations the thinking mind doesn't have to take

73
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:37,839
charge knowing what should happen

74
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:51,839
it's like trusting the being that we are in a very visceral way

75
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:07,680
there's resolve but in many ways

76
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:18,320
it's gentle perceptive and steady

77
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:27,120
and as we trust the breath to breathe the body we we're introducing those factors

78
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,839
the factors are resolved

79
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:46,399
it's gentle it's consistent persistent

80
00:10:46,399 --> 00:11:01,839
with the steadiness

81
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,839
as we open all the senses

82
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,760
seeing hearing

83
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:30,880
sensations in the body maybe smelling and tasting too

84
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,279
as if we're enlivening

85
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:57,839
the world of awareness

86
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:05,040
but not resisting the constructs

87
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:11,839
of conditioned being

88
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,040
how it will present

anticipations

91
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:53,839
that ripple through us reverberate in our conditioned being

92
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:11,760
can there be a non-grasping inquiry

93
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:21,120
the activity of awareness expressed as

94
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:35,200
in inquiry what's happening now

95
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:48,079
before i expressed it as notice acknowledge

96
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:54,000
not so much as a doing as an opening to

97
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:09,759
being similar to how the breathing bees in the

98
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:17,839
body

99
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:42,839
[Music]

100
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
um

101
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,839
okay

102
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:27,839
so

103
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:14,720
can attentiveness illuminate what's being constructed

104
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:23,839
by the senses by thought and feeling

105
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:51,839
non-grasping inquiry and attention

00:16:58,790 --> 00:17:04,168
[Music]

107
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,880
[Music]

108
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,320
can the resolve express itself

109
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:25,760
as a confident invitation to awareness

110
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:39,840
there is nothing to prove trusts what is

111
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:39,499
[Music]

112
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:09,279
[Music]

113
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,640
the inquiry of awareness

114
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:23,840
has an energy to it

115
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:36,400
that's balanced by the trusting

116
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:39,679
what's happening now

117
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,840
nothing to prove

118
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:51,840
assert

119
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:05,840
[Music] accomplish

120
00:26:05,970 --> 00:26:13,609
[Music]

121
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,840
so

122
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:52,140
[Music]

123
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,640
how is the interplay between awareness

124
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:34,639
and the activities of the self how is that interplay right now

125
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:50,640
the expression of awareness definitive are the expression

126
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,679
of constructed self with all its issues

127
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,640
and intrigues

128
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:14,639
can they dance together with nothing to prove

129
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:27,840
or accomplish

130
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:41,840
in a moment i'll ring the bell

131
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:48,000
play a game with yourself try to track

132
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:56,960
as carefully as possible isabelle rings

133
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:04,080
something in your disposition shifts how is it all

134
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:09,840
what's happening

135
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:28,768
so [Music]

136
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:37,179
[Music]

137
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:45,979
[Music]

138
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:54,869
[Music]

139
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:20,720
so this interplay between the world of awareness

140
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:33,840
and the world of constructed being

141
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:40,720
the deeply habituated world of constructed being

142
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:49,919
and this maybe we could even say revered

143
00:31:51,760 --> 00:32:00,080
world of awareness

144
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:06,398
and then as we're discovering in practice

145
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:16,640
part of the challenge is is not to stop the world of constructed being

146
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:29,840
but to not let it make invisible to dissipate the world of awareness

147
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,880
and that interplay

148
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:47,360
you know the challenge of our practice is to make the interplay between the two

149
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:55,600
harmonious you know just the same way we we call this intensive the harmony

150
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:04,280
of vipassana in zen like right in the title there's

151
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:09,840
[Music] clues about what the challenge we're

152
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:16,559
picking up is you know the interplay between the world of awareness

153
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:19,679
and the world of the self

154
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,559
and then as buddhism developed their developed a uh

155
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,360
different aspects of practice

156
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:44,320
we're acknowledged as their own the term would be its own kind of buddha field

157
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:50,880
or another term would be a kaya a realm of existence

158
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:58,159
so the world of the karmic self is its own realm of existence

159
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:03,679
and the world of awareness is its own realm of existence

160
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:11,280
and the world of the interplay between the two is its own realm of existence

161
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:21,280
and so a few days ago i wrote i i mentioned zen's story

162
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:26,638
with the monk asked the teacher duncan he asked some which of those realms of

163
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,078
existence do you uh live in

164
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:39,040
or do you you know you attend to

165
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:47,679
dongshan says that's the inquiry

166
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:54,878
that i stay close to you know the inquiry that's exploring

167
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:02,000
what's happening now you know is the world of the self dominant

168
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:08,880
in fact is it totally convincing and dictating

169
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:17,599
what is is the world of awareness sort of

170
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:23,279
in its demeanor rebuking the world of the self

171
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:34,800
monkey mind you know self-centered all caught up in yourself

172
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:49,280
and and these three realms in buddhism each of them was acknowledged as kind of

173
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,640
buddha field and then they had their own buddha

174
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:02,780
they had their own name as a significant realm of experience

175
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:10,640
[Music] and then they each had their own

176
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:18,079
designated attribute the realm of awareness

177
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:22,640
went beyond any fixed ideas

178
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:32,320
the realm of itself was definite objective

179
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:40,400
the this is how the stuff of being becomes tangible

180
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:48,800
you know and then very interestingly the interplay of the rule of the two

181
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:58,480
was designated as the realm of bliss the realm of ease the realm of

182
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,160
harmonious existence

183
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:22,000
the interplay between the karmic and the dharmic is the realm of harmony

184
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,119
and as we bring awareness to the self

185
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:37,440
not not simply an awareness oh there i go doing my stuff again you know

186
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:45,200
or maybe we flip it and and we we become puffed up

187
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:52,078
well i think my ideas are

188
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,720
the awareness helps us bring some very supportive qualities into the realm

189
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:05,838
of the self

190
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,280
it helps us start to see the way we think and feel

191
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,480
and interact

192
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,640
and that's an enormous teacher for us there's so much to learn i mean we've

193
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:30,640
learned about our own conditioned self and we learn about the human condition

194
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:36,079
each of us is a specimen of the human condition

195
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:44,560
there's a repertoire of emotions that each of us

196
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:51,440
plays jazz with you know we take that repertoire and we create

197
00:38:51,440 --> 00:39:01,838
all sorts of amazing and wonderful uh variations on a theme

198
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:09,680
each of us in our ingenious of creativity

199
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,839
you know adds value significance

200
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:23,920
to different ways of thinking about the self about life you know

201
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:29,839
and when there's awareness of it it's so instructive

202
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:36,480
sometimes it's helpful to say to ourselves after there's been a significant

203
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,880
experience in our life what did i learn from that

204
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:50,720
you know like in a way we're inviting the noticing and the acknowledging and

205
00:39:50,720 --> 00:40:00,160
the inquiry what did i learn from that not so much to grasp that okay now i know but more

206
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:11,839
that's really helping me see the interplay between awareness and self

207
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:19,599
so it tutors our conceptual mind and then there's an

208
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:26,400
another extraordinary valuable thing as we feel it

209
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:35,520
and rather than have the emotions um sort of extend out

210
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:40,960
objectify the world and attribute emotions to it

211
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:47,520
we feel the emotions and as we feel them and

212
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:54,400
acknowledge them there's a kind of integration

213
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,880
it's kind of like an emotional integration oh anger

214
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:07,839
oh sadness oh gratitude

215
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,280
oh love [Music]

216
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:19,520
and we can feel how some emotions have a kind of disturbing contraction

217
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:25,280
and some emotions have a soothing expansion

218
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:36,480
i once heard someone describe god as opening the greater being

219
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:44,880
you know and how certain emotions

220
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,838
open us to greater being

221
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,720
and maybe if we're inclined we call it a religious experience

222
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,079
or maybe we're just grateful

223
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:16,240
and then the teachings that the mind is being given and the

224
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:24,560
teachings that the heart the emotions and the integration you know they stimulate

225
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:32,720
our trust in the buddha dharma they stimulate our trust in the practice of awareness

226
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:37,599
and yet almost paradoxically

227
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:45,599
[Music] they invite us not to cling

228
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:52,720
to what's being revealed what's being illuminated

229
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,839
they invite us and remind us that it's an activity

230
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:05,599
not a fixed state that you attain and then you own it and then you have a

231
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:13,599
better me you know you have a me that's so wonderful that

232
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:22,319
it can conquer the very process of being alive you know

233
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:29,440
in some ways rather than attaining and having that the process stimulates

234
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:36,560
us in a confident and trusting way to give over

235
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:44,160
okay this is how it is this dynamic interplay

236
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,000
of the stuff of being human

237
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,920
in the mysterious wonderful way of being aware

238
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:15,359
and learning how to harmonize yeah learning how to be patient

239
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:23,520
with your own clinging and diversions and others clinging in aversions

240
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,720
ah this is a human condition

241
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:37,680
each of us trying to navigate and sustain our very life

242
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:44,160
in this moment this is this person's best effort at

243
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:50,400
being alive

244
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:56,720
i don't know why they're so angry are so afraid

245
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,520
but i can bring patience i can bring

246
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,400
a acceptance a permission

247
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:18,160
and i can bring positive attributes this is the resolve

248
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:25,520
no the energy of attention

249
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:33,839
and commitment and engagement

250
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:42,640
and dongshan stays i stay close to that i stay close to studying all that

251
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:51,039
you know and maybe all i'm trying to say is this

252
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:55,680
that it's an activity yeah

253
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:03,359
it's not like do this and then everything in your life

254
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,160
will be perfect

255
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:15,440
and i would suggest you that would be kind of boring

256
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:23,839
you know you know if it takes on

257
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:31,440
a kind of steady state you know

258
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,000
and yet the constant activity of life

259
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:43,839
it is a challenge

260
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:57,440
and it asks something of us but asking something obvious

261
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,520
is part of what keeps us alive

262
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:13,680
just imagine if you had a good friend and they never asked anything of you

263
00:47:15,140 --> 00:47:21,760
[Music] versus how each of us our life goes up

264
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,760
and down sometimes we're the giver sometimes we're the receiver

265
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:33,839
and that's what enhances the

266
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:42,960
relationship so dangshan's saying i stay close to this

267
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:48,480
this is what i'm attending to this is what i'm engaging

268
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:57,760
this dynamic interplay okay sorry i've run over

269
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:04,839
thank you very much and enjoy your day your evening

270
00:48:04,839 --> 00:48:14,000
and may you have wonderful discoveries
