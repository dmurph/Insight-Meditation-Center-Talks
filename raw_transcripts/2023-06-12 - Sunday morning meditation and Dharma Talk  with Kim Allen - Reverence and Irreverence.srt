1
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,080
so there was once a cave meditator

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,820
who wanted to practice you know by himself up in seclusion in some

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:21,420
mountains and he finally got together the conditions to be able to do that he had

4
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:29,519
some benefactors who were supporting him by having food and other supplies dropped

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:36,180
off at some place nearby that he could get to so he didn't have to go the several days to get back to the village

6
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:44,300
that was nearby so he had support and in his little cave he had a nice

7
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:50,460
altar set up you know with a Buddha image and some

8
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:55,860
other sacred items and he would make you know he would light incense and make

9
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:01,260
offerings every day and he practiced very diligently

10
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:06,840
in the in the cave and he did that for some years

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,939
and found it deeply beneficial it was often

12
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:19,020
grateful to the manufacturers supporting him and then one day he heard that they were

13
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:28,080
going to come visit him in his cave and his response at first was to

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,659
Spruce everything up and you know sweep it out really well and clean off the

15
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:39,299
Altar and make it so beautiful so that for them when they came

16
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:48,360
and then this thought came into his mind what am I doing and you know I've been meditating to let

17
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:54,479
go of the ego and the self and all of this and here I am putting on a show

18
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,180
and so he picked up a handful of dirt and he threw it on the altar and

19
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:05,820
later he um he said he was recalling that time and

20
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:12,500
he said that that was the finest offering he made on the whole retreat

21
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:19,440
so the topic for today is reverence and

22
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,319
irreverence and it may be that one or the other of

23
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,959
those is very meaningful to you and you've practiced it or you consider it

24
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,540
part of your life or maybe they're not so clear maybe that's not don't feel as

25
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:42,840
relevant to you but the suggestion for today is that

26
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:50,040
both are important ingredients in our practice and on our path and it's worth

27
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,580
getting to know both reverence and irreverence

28
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:03,840
so we may see ourselves as definitely having one of those and not the other

29
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,920
that that gets a sort of a common pattern but um reverence and irreverence are

30
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:18,840
actually just both practices that we can do and as such each one can be done

31
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:26,159
skillfully or unskillfully each one of those can read unskillfully or unskillfully and we'll probably

32
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:33,560
sometimes need each of them in their skillful form along our path

33
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:39,840
and if this idea of reverence and irreverence isn't

34
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,440
something that you think about very much or maybe something that you kind of avoid thinking about then this talk

35
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,440
might be even especially relevant for you so

36
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,680
we can start by asking you know what is reverence what are we

37
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:05,159
talking about and I would say it's a a range or a spectrum

38
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:13,220
and on a on a basic level it means taking something seriously

39
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:19,440
early in my practice I was talking with someone who had practiced much longer

40
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:24,660
than me and he was a person who often spoke very

41
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:30,419
directly I was a little bit his character and he said to me

42
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:35,520
Kim you know you don't take yourself very seriously

43
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:42,060
and he meant that in a particular way he meant that

44
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,520
I wasn't um taking so seriously my spiritual longing

45
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:54,660
or my interest in the Dharma my path my deepest aspirations you know early in my

46
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,060
practice I didn't quite know how to relate to that I didn't feel up to that

47
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,300
I didn't I felt I don't know what I felt but from my background I didn't have

48
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:11,340
maybe the qualities to be able to take that seriously and bring that forth in

49
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:16,560
myself that came later and so um I felt maybe a little

50
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:23,820
uncomfortable about acknowledging how much I cared about the practice how much I cared about the Dharma

51
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:29,820
and how I might even have Awakening as an aim I wasn't really ready to say that and he

52
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,759
picked that right out I'm grateful for that and when I reflect back on this older

53
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:40,979
friend I realized that he was he's one of the

54
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:48,000
most reverent and the most irreverent people that I know he has both of those very well developed

55
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,060
and it's admirable it's admirable

56
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,979
so the spectrum of reverence starts with taking something seriously

57
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:05,520
and it extends out to even feeling awe or wonder

58
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,560
being willing to devote one's heart or one's life to something that feels

59
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,600
valuable meaningful so there's a real strength you know

60
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:20,780
there can be a real strength to this quality of reverence

61
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,819
but at times maybe even often

62
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:33,000
our reverence can get a little bit misdirected there is

63
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:39,120
as I said before they're skillful and unskillful reverence and irreverence so

64
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,280
there's four combinations and I want to talk about all four of them so we get

65
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,300
kind of a map of this space and they're not merely opposites

66
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:57,479
so it is there are four distinct things to talk about so these four quadrants and we'll start

67
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,319
with the quadrant of unskillful reverence actually

68
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:10,740
cases where our reverence is somewhat misdirected if we even have it

69
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:16,800
so what is it that we're taking seriously in our life

70
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,280
what is that are there things in our life or our mind or our heart

71
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:29,460
that we are in some way paying homage to that maybe don't deserve that level of

72
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:35,520
devotion I want to read a a couple of lines from

73
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:40,919
a verse and then I'll we'll talk through what it means

74
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:46,560
this is from the 37 practices of the bodhisattva

75
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,319
locked up in the prison of their own patterning whom can ordinary Gods

76
00:07:52,319 --> 00:08:00,539
protect so it's a little bit poetic it's talking about the ordinary things in life that

77
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:06,479
we place our trust in so pleasure you know the things that we

78
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,440
like and enjoy maybe wealth maybe power

79
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,720
maybe health and fitness you know our body is feeling good right now

80
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,759
our relationships learning

81
00:08:23,940 --> 00:08:30,000
physical safety ethical purity even meditative Bliss or meditative

82
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,959
enjoyment now many of these things are good that's where it gets entangled confusing

83
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:45,540
these are good things that are worth having in human life all of them actually but they become

84
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:52,260
problematic when they rise to the level of being revered don't they

85
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:58,560
yeah so that is when things become Gods they're ordinary Gods they're just

86
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:05,040
ordinary things but we can make them into gods in some way and if we do that what we're doing is

87
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,240
buying into the world view or the psychological pattern that they uphold and we're trying to use that to protect

88
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,519
us you know if I just had enough money then

89
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:22,560
I would be safe that's a world view

90
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:29,700
it's not that we shouldn't have any money but that world view is dangerous to buy into

91
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:36,779
or you know my physical health is who I am very dangerous to buy into

92
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:42,120
so we've done this maybe in some ways and the problem is that all of these

93
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:49,200
things are are transient they're not true protection and they're not really totally in our control are they

94
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:54,959
so there's always a little bit of stress if we've made these into gods

95
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:02,339
so these are the ordinary gods that most of the world reveres at some level

96
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:08,820
so ordinary Gods can also be more subtle they can be psychological patterns in

97
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:15,720
our in our mind or our mental habits you know for example we also get stuck

98
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:22,200
in various views and opinions and ways of perceiving things we may be very

99
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:30,180
attached to our political perspective or some

100
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:35,399
ways of seeing the world and sometimes we're not even aware that that's it

101
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:40,860
that's that's what we've done but meditation will eventually if you do mindfulness meditation you'll eventually

102
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:48,420
see some of these patterns in the mind we can also get stuck in stories about

103
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:53,820
our life stories about how we got to hear stories about who we are stories

104
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:00,300
about what we're doing and again those are things where we wouldn't want to have none of that we have some sense of

105
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:08,339
who we are and in our life and so forth but again these things are so easy to

106
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:15,180
get hooked into and they shouldn't really be taken so

107
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:22,560
seriously that they're made the foundation of our well-being it can be humbling when we realize what

108
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,880
we have allowed our heart to get entangled with and there are many people who come to

109
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,779
meditation practice and to Buddhism because there has been some kind of a shocking event in their

110
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:41,820
life that revealed that these gods were only ordinary and

111
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:49,640
were not protecting them loss of a job death of a loved one a change in our health

112
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:57,300
maybe some of these things resonate for some of you in this room of as to why practice became meaningful to you

113
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:04,980
it's not always like that but they can jolt us into seeing our misplaced reverence so they have a way of bringing

114
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:09,560
into Focus what's really important for us

115
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:19,680
so let's shift then toward the quadrants that are associated

116
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:26,100
with irreverence so they're not just quite opposite

117
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:32,579
um each quadrant is distinct not just the negation of the others so you know if we decide that we're not going to

118
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:40,620
Revere bodily health and financial success and those kinds of things

119
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:47,220
learning education that's one for me that I find valuable

120
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:54,540
it's not that we would turn around and reject these things say all right none of this matters it's not about nihilism

121
00:12:54,540 --> 00:13:01,740
or that kind of cynicism so we've looked at unskillful reverence

122
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:09,800
let's turn to what skillful irreverence is a little bit the opposite so

123
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:19,800
Dharma practice and especially mindfulness practice helps us to see through things that that

124
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:26,760
we might have been stuck with if we if we continue with the practice we have to see more and more it's just how it works

125
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:33,060
the the mind gets drawn to seeing because that's what we're practicing we're practicing paying attention in the

126
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:40,740
moment to what's going on in the ma in the body in the mind in the heart in the emotions and eventually if we continue

127
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:46,980
to take data in that way if you will moment to moment a moment we watch what's going on the mind is going to

128
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:52,139
start to see patterns in that and mindfulness has a way of breaking things

129
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:57,540
open or differentiating experience so that we see different aspects of it

130
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:03,360
different parts of it not be fooled by the solid seeming nature of it that we

131
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,519
saw at the beginning so one term that's used for this in the

132
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:14,639
practice is disenchantment nibida and Pali but it's not a it's not

133
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:20,160
a bad kind of disenchantment a negative kind like that word sometimes has that

134
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:28,500
implication in English but it actually means that we're no longer Charmed or Enchanted as if a

135
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:35,339
spell had been cast on us we it's a it's a minor form of waking up to see through

136
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:40,920
things and realize oh wow I was really caught up in that

137
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,079
so it's a positive term

138
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:53,639
and once we have some experience with seeing through things like just as an example it's fairly

139
00:14:53,639 --> 00:15:00,839
common for people to come on retreat spend a few days like a meditating so a

140
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:06,079
little bit more immersive than usually at home and realize in that time

141
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:12,540
that they view everything through a certain lens like maybe the lens of fear

142
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:18,300
it's fairly common for people to say I had no idea that this was underlying so

143
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:23,459
much of my life and that you know that's like a it's a seeing

144
00:15:23,459 --> 00:15:29,820
through it's a moment of no longer being in the spell caught under the spell of the fear but you wake up to it you see

145
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,339
it doesn't mean it's over but seeing it is so important that moment

146
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:42,079
and once we have some experience with seeing through in certain ways then we gain the ability to be

147
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:47,160
skillfully irreverent of some of the mind's tricks some of the mind's

148
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:53,300
patterns and also some of the cultural patterns that are out there in the world

149
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:00,360
Jack cornfield says that he was going through a period of seeing a lot of

150
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:06,480
patterns in his mind and he started naming the different ones that he would

151
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:14,279
that he that he found like you know he had a certain voice in his mind that was critical of everything he did you know

152
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:21,660
oh you're probably going to mess that one up too and you know he couldn't necessarily stop that voice from coming

153
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:28,199
we don't necessarily get a choice about that but when it would come he would say he

154
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:36,120
would like bow to it he had a name for it and he would say thank you for your opinion opinion and move on you know so

155
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:42,899
there's um there was a way that he could lighten up a little bit be a little bit irreverent toward that voice because it

156
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:51,540
wasn't helping him so um I also think about Sylvia vorstein has a a nice little set

157
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:58,740
of phrases that she says that are useful words that are useful for how to practice she says we should practice

158
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:04,020
with gentleness precision and humor

159
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:10,020
and I think that the order is important but also but the humor part you know she

160
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:16,079
says you have to just sometimes laugh at what the Mind comes up with wow

161
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,360
where did that come from you know where did that thought come from where did that idea come from

162
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,760
so it's very freeing to be able to smile a little bit at the antics of the mind

163
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:33,059
at least sometimes I know we can't do it all the time we're still practicing we're still getting caught up

164
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:38,100
but when we have those moments to be able to be skillfully irreverent

165
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:44,960
of some of some of what the Mind comes up with just based on habit

166
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:54,360
and then this um this can extend even into some of the conventional Norms

167
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:00,000
out in society we see that they're just conventions and again it's not that we wouldn't

168
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,100
have ways of doing things in society but it's nice if we can see through those a

169
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:13,260
little bit um there's a fellow who drives around Santa Cruz in a sort

170
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:20,400
of a custom camper kind of thing very large actually and it had it's painted in his you know

171
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,299
clearly his own work artwork it says you know Peace and Freedom in big letters on

172
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:33,600
it and it has streamers and decorations you almost you can't miss this thing when it's driving

173
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:40,620
around and you know it's all done in in kind of a humorous and and yet serious

174
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:45,900
way of poking a little bit of fun at um people just going about their

175
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:52,020
conventional lives you know he has this way that wakes people up a little bit

176
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:59,039
it is tricked out camper let's say

177
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:07,080
it can even extend into the spiritual or religious realm you know I think about how the Dalai Lama

178
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:15,480
laughs at the pomp associated with his position I mean he takes his position seriously he he you know he acts as the

179
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:21,179
bodhisattva of compassion for our world but you know the price of that in a

180
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:29,220
sense is that when he comes places there's gold brocade and these fancy things and people are always attending

181
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:34,799
to him and he has a way of very gently showing that he sees through that you

182
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:41,400
know he's going to go and sit on the throne but I remember watching a a video of him where he they had some very high

183
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:48,600
seat for him to sit on to give a teaching and it was very beautiful and you know he came and he did his vows and

184
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:55,500
he got up on the seat and he noticed that it was it had been padded it was very soft for him and he's he realized

185
00:19:55,500 --> 00:20:01,260
it was a little bit bouncy and he paused and he and he bounced on and you know

186
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:09,179
just for a moment and then you know and then he went back but you could see him like oh look at that bouncing I bounced

187
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:16,320
when I was five years old on a chair but you know so he he takes his position lightly in a skillful way this is

188
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:24,660
skillful irreverence of seeing through things certain lightness lightness of being

189
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:31,980
there's a prayer in vadriana practice where one asks give me energy to see through life's

190
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:38,640
illusions wouldn't that be nice if we could always see through life's Illusions beforehand

191
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:45,620
yeah so

192
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:54,480
here in the United States I would say that we have a culture of celebrating certain types of irreverence

193
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:00,500
it's a little bit in our nature that we um

194
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:07,980
have that quality somehow but we can pay a price for that and

195
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:14,520
sometimes sliding in let's say to the quadrant that we could call unskillful

196
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:21,919
irreverence okay so we talked about skillfully irreverence but we can go too far

197
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:28,620
often we can be cynical we can have sarcasm

198
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,020
about our approach to life

199
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:39,299
my father says that um perhaps when he was in his

200
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:44,880
twenties um he was once told around that time by an

201
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:50,039
older Mentor that he was not quite mature yet because he still sometimes

202
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:58,620
used sarcasm and he never forgot that um to be told by you know this older guy

203
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:05,760
that he wasn't quite mature yet he was thinking he was Hot Stuff being a 20-something guy

204
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:13,460
and but he and he he realized over time yeah sarcasm doesn't always serve

205
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,100
other aspects of unskillfully irreverence

206
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:26,539
include that we don't often take some elements of spirituality seriously so

207
00:22:26,539 --> 00:22:33,780
devotion prayer um here in the west the Western version of

208
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:38,880
Buddhism those were actually deliberately stripped out when they were brought here

209
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:48,419
because the teachers thought that westerners wouldn't like that sort of thing might be true but if you go to Asia

210
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:53,520
people are so devoted many times at least in the places that

211
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:00,179
I've been and seen there there's a lot of devotion there is even the acceptance of using prayer

212
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:05,520
and it's there's a lot of heartfulness and you can feel it in the energy of the

213
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:12,000
temples there um and there can be a way that we don't honor that

214
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:19,679
quite in our version here sometimes we also feel

215
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,080
too irreverent to be willing to surrender in our practice

216
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:31,200
this practice ultimately asks us to give up quite a lot

217
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:37,799
and you know renouncing aspects of our

218
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:43,380
attachment to self renouncing some of what we thought was

219
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:50,400
so important earlier in life those ordinary gods if we have too much irreverence too much

220
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:57,480
there's even some ego sometimes in your reverence we may not be willing to give up what this practice asks us to let go

221
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:02,899
of to be truly free so

222
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,760
we might be irreverent toward things that are really quite beautiful

223
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:15,299
if we were willing to open to them and that can leave a hole in the heart

224
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:21,000
it doesn't allow our heart to be completely filled by our practice something would be lacking in our

225
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:27,659
spirituality some juice not quite there if we're not willing to touch Into the

226
00:24:27,659 --> 00:24:33,740
Heart Dimension the Letting Go the giving up the surrender

227
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:42,600
there are times every few years I don't know if we've done it for a while but every few years

228
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:48,299
here we have a refuge ceremony probably it didn't happen during the

229
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:55,980
pandemic but it was it's a time when um people who want to you know who are

230
00:24:55,980 --> 00:25:01,140
interested to do so can come and formally take refuge in Buddha Dharma

231
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:07,380
and Sangha and there's a little ceremony that Gil does with that and

232
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:13,760
I was not too keen on this idea I did the ceremony I think in

233
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:19,740
2008 something like that and I wasn't too keen on it but I was getting more

234
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:26,580
involved in IMC and felt like I was I had joined the board at that time and I

235
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,620
felt like um somehow it felt right and so there's a little class you take a few

236
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:36,779
sessions and then there's a ceremony at the end and I kind of thought in my mind

237
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:44,159
well okay I'll do this thing you know the thing to do here at the center and

238
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,159
I I don't think I was you know disrespectfully irreverent but

239
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:56,640
nonetheless I was taken by complete surprise that I was deeply moved by the

240
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:01,799
simple act when it was made formal and the lights were dark and we lit candles

241
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:07,740
and offered flowers and then sat in meditation and took the refuges and

242
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:12,900
precepts officially that I just my my body just felt light

243
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:19,500
it was flooded with this spiritual quality called PT Joy and it was

244
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:26,039
probably better I think that I had no clue that I was capable of that kind of feeling

245
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:31,080
um because it took me by surprise and it was so delightful

246
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:36,420
um it opened something in me yeah probably better that it was a surprise

247
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:44,580
[Applause] so the remedy if you will for unskillful

248
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:51,419
irreverence where we've gotten a little bit into that sarcasm ego I'm not gonna

249
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:56,760
let go is the is to open to healthy skillful

250
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:04,080
reverence some people move toward this kicking and screaming and others Discover It others

251
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:11,360
have it naturally which is nice but that's the last of our four quadrants so we're now moving to

252
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:18,179
skillful reverence so we had skillful and unskillful reverence and irreverence

253
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:26,940
so let's get to skillful reverence so one basic form is Refuge as I as I

254
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:33,539
talked about with the ceremony so refuge in the triple gem Buddha Dharma

255
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:41,100
and Sangha and when we started back four quadrants ago in the quadrant of

256
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:46,140
unskillful reverence I read two lines from a verse about the

257
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:52,080
ordinary gods and I want to read you the whole four-line stanza now the whole four line

258
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:58,559
verse locked up in the prison of their own

259
00:27:58,559 --> 00:28:05,279
patterning whom can ordinary Gods protect who can you count on for Refuge

260
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:12,419
go for refuge in the three jewels this is the practice of a bodhisattva or

261
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:20,159
we could say this is the practice of a sincere practitioner so we can start out doing this at you

262
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:27,299
know kind of a surface level but then we'll find that on unfolds over time you know we have to unfold it more

263
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:33,720
and more maybe we just say the words at first like if you go to a retreat for example often on the first evening

264
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,360
everybody is invited to take refuge in Buddha Dharma and Sangha and say the

265
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,840
five precepts as a creation of the the container of the community container there and if you've never done that and

266
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,620
it's a little bit of a surprise when it's happening you might just say the words and move on

267
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:58,100
but then eventually there's a way that they can start to work on us

268
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:03,840
you know recalling my experience with the ceremony I had said the refuges before that but

269
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,940
suddenly it came alive when I did it at the ceremony so they woke me up to looking more

270
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,880
carefully at Refuge so skillful reverence includes taking

271
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,340
seriously the beauty of Our Own Heart everybody's heart has Beauty in it

272
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:25,440
even just for wanting to do the practice or for starting to practice mindfulness

273
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:34,260
there's Beauty right there but there's also so many ways in which we are living ethically ways in which

274
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:42,360
we're offering meta or gratitude or care to and to people to the world to animals

275
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,520
everybody has something perhaps we have something deeper perhaps

276
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:53,659
we have a spiritual longing that's bringing us to practice in some way

277
00:29:53,659 --> 00:30:02,778
there's a word for this in Pali samvega sense of spiritual longing

278
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:09,539
Gil tells a story of a man who came to a temple and he was

279
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:15,720
not too sure about practice but somehow he was drawn to coming to the temple and

280
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:23,100
he saw a statue um outside the doors maybe and he

281
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:30,059
sat and looked at it for a while and he was sort of debating you know should

282
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:35,340
I really open to practice I don't know

283
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:41,159
and this this was a statue that had some magical qualities

284
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:47,840
through the power of this Temple and it said to him why not

285
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:53,640
and he was very shocked and um and the stat and the statue just said

286
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:00,740
again why not and the man was so scared he ran away

287
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:10,740
have we done that why not why not so you know don't dismiss don't

288
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:15,840
dismiss those deeper feelings in your heart you don't have to speak them you

289
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:21,960
don't have to share them but at least for yourself please open to them at some

290
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,360
level don't brush them under the rug

291
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:32,399
there's a suta where that's about a it's actually about a dream that somebody has

292
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:39,720
but it's a very mythological and allegorical dream if you will and in the

293
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:46,440
dream he has a series of choices you know like he he's digging and he finds

294
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:52,440
things along the way and he you know he's digging and he finds a fork and

295
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:58,020
um the advice that he's given is throw out the fork and keep digging so he throws

296
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:03,720
out the fork and he keeps digging and he finds he finds all these things I don't remember all of them one of them's like

297
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:09,899
a chopping block with a piece of meat on it it says throw out the chopping block and keep digging with the knife and so

298
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:16,140
he keeps digging and eventually after eight or nine things he um he finds a

299
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:23,039
Naga serpent which is a powerful mythical beast in Buddhism generally

300
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,080
benign um meant to represent great power

301
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,360
that can come from practice or even big things in general are just called nagas

302
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:40,080
like elephants are called nagas and sometimes arahans awakened beings they're called nagas so he finds a Naga

303
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:47,460
Serpent and then the advice is pop stop digging honor the Naga serpent

304
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:52,799
and the sense is that we keep digging and digging in our heart in our life in

305
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:59,039
our practice in our path and we keep finding things where we have choices and we let go of the things that

306
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:05,880
are not useful the fork is doubt don't need that The Chopping Block sensual pleasure we don't need that we don't

307
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:13,740
need to pursue that make it a god eventually we find something very beautiful an August serpent in the heart

308
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:19,039
don't throw that one out I'll enter that one

309
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:26,460
there's also a suta about the monastic Sangha but we could just think of it as

310
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:33,360
a spiritual community where there's a new monk who is you know they have so many

311
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:38,820
rules for monks to follow you know like over 200 little rules that

312
00:33:38,820 --> 00:33:44,820
they have to some of them are big some of them are little that they have to follow as they go through their day

313
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:51,960
their life and there's a new monk who is continually making mistakes on the rules

314
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,380
and you know you're supposed to in some way admonish among who is not fulfilling

315
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:03,980
the rules so that he can benefit from them but there's a

316
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:10,858
asuta where the other monks sense that this Monk who keeps having trouble with

317
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:15,898
the rules is actually just proceeding from very deep love and faith of the

318
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:21,419
Buddha and that that's that's filled his heart and that's why he ordained and

319
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:28,800
that's all he cares about and he can't get the details but he has this love and this faith and when they see that they

320
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,940
decide not to admonish him right away because they worry that that will dampen

321
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,060
his faith actually and it would be it would be more un beneficial for him to

322
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:48,480
to to have that happen than to you know keep going and and so and eventually he

323
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,980
sort of grows into being able to manage the rules but it's so compassionate right that they saw his love and his

324
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:02,099
faith and they you know let him find his way so we might consider that for

325
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:09,480
ourselves also as we move along with this practice skillful reverence for

326
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,720
our effort our best effort that we're bringing

327
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:22,020
so in light of all this we could say I think it's fair to say

328
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:31,579
that spiritual maturity includes skillful healthy reverence of some type

329
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,880
do you dare so we have to discover I think for ourselves what this is we can't borrow

330
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,000
it from someone else or imitated um

331
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,460
I would say that it even matters in secular ways also you know out in society

332
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:57,000
there's a way in which we've lost touch with being reverential

333
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:06,000
and daring to acknowledge what is worthy of reverence out in the regular conventional world

334
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:11,099
and that may have something to do with the challenges we're seeing in our society

335
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:19,339
and in our world we may not take seriously things that are worth taking seriously

336
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:29,400
even the Buddha felt moved to express reverence he's the Buddha right but there's a suta

337
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:37,380
um a discourse where the uh it's I think soon after the Buddha's Awakening and he

338
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:43,020
says this is what the line is he says it is painful to dwell without reverence

339
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:48,660
and deference the Buddha says this and

340
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:55,260
um the word translated as reverence is which is probably most closely resembles

341
00:36:55,260 --> 00:37:00,300
our idea of respect so the Buddha was looking around for

342
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:06,599
something to respect he had just woken up and he um

343
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:13,560
he couldn't find any being in the world who was his Superior in terms of Ethics in terms of meditation in terms of

344
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:21,839
wisdom in terms of liberation and yet he still wanted to offer something

345
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:27,900
you know those waking up didn't take away that wish in his heart

346
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:35,820
and so what he decided to do was he he said that he could still feel reverence and deference to the Dharma

347
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:43,140
isn't that sweet and you know this was before he had done a lot of teaching so I don't think he's referring to all of

348
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:48,660
the stuff he said because he hadn't said it yet I think what he was referring to

349
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:54,119
is Dharma as nature you know Dharma as the way things work

350
00:37:54,119 --> 00:38:01,200
the order the way things unfold which he awoke to completely and waking up he saw

351
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,020
how it all works and that he could offer reverence to

352
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:14,339
the beauty of the universe I find it quite touching that the Buddha

353
00:38:14,339 --> 00:38:19,560
still wanted to dwell in reverence and deference so I would think it's really it's

354
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:25,140
appropriate for us also so I look for this in people as they

355
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:30,660
practice you know does it seem that they've found something that's worth

356
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:36,240
taking seriously or feeling awe for I look for that as people practice over

357
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,940
time have they discovered something worthy of reference reverence

358
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:49,440
what have you found just reflect for a moment what have you found that might be worthy

359
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,800
of that

360
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:03,900
so there's an important change in people when they shift from wondering how the Dharma can fit into

361
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:09,180
their life to wondering how their life can fit into the Dharma

362
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:15,480
it's a shift spiritual maturity might also include

363
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:21,240
healthy ear reference a certain lightness of being

364
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:27,300
bouncing on the seat like the Dalai Lama you know so we don't want to take ourselves too

365
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:32,540
seriously in all of that there should be a little

366
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:39,960
irreverence toward the silliness of the this predicament we're in laughing at

367
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,260
our foibles laughing at our eccentricities being willing to be wrong

368
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:51,680
yeah willingness to let go

369
00:39:53,940 --> 00:40:02,220
so to end a few practical tips you know how might we act on some of what's been

370
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:09,359
said today a very simple way is to invoke an

371
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:17,339
attitude of sincerity at the beginning of your sit so maybe just acknowledging as you sit

372
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:23,579
down on the cushion acknowledging that what you're doing matters why are you doing this why are you

373
00:40:23,579 --> 00:40:29,339
sitting still on a cushion or a chair for half an hour or 45 minutes or 60 minutes

374
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:35,160
so feel the sense that you care about your inner life in some way or you have

375
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:43,020
a spiritual longing or you you just know it's beneficial even if you can't articulate anything that's fine

376
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:48,859
so feeling your sincerity that it makes a difference to sit

377
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:54,900
and maybe sometimes that simple sincerity or respect will

378
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:00,839
open into a bigger perspective having a sense of the

379
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:06,420
the lineage that brought this teaching to us and that we're participating in at that

380
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:12,180
very moment of sitting you know we don't take ourselves so seriously sometimes we think oh yeah you

381
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:17,700
know Buddhism and these ancient wisdom texts and the Insight Meditation Center

382
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:23,579
and all that but I'm just I'm just a person who sits a little bit sometimes

383
00:41:23,579 --> 00:41:29,940
no you're participating in something big something that's been going on for 2600

384
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:35,280
years and um you know the dharma's vast and profound

385
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:40,980
and it's amazing that we found it think of all the people who didn't find it or think of all the other things you could

386
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:47,640
have found some of which are great some of which might be just as good who knows but you found this and it's quite

387
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:54,260
good so there can be a sense of being part of something larger

388
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:04,040
so we can practice skillful reverence we can practice skillful irreverence

389
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:12,180
maybe we'd even get to the point of being willing to throw dirt on our altar

390
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:19,200
if we wrote that we were getting attached to it in some way But first you have to have the altar

391
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,260
and be revering it then you'll learn

392
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:32,820
how to lighten up on that so reverence and irreverence

393
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:40,140
which one might need more work which ones have are skillful which are unskillful there's some some ground to

394
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:46,920
play with there and I hope all of you might find a something something amid all of that

395
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,540
that connects were you

396
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,119
these are my thoughts for today and may they be of benefits and if any of it

397
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:06,619
wasn't you can just leave it here I'm not attached

398
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:15,260
so I think we're right at time so we'll end but if anyone has any questions I'll stay here for a few minutes thank you
