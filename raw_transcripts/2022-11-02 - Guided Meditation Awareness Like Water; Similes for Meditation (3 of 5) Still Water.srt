1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:11,780
hello and welcome and uh

2
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:22,740
so it's a time to perhaps be a bit quiet internally

3
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,920
sit and meditate and to bring mindfulness to our experience

4
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:35,399
to bring awareness attention and it seems that in the teachings of

5
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:42,780
the Buddha water is used as a simile metaphor for

6
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,800
awareness and when we begin practice

7
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,440
maybe there are capacity to be mindful to be consciously aware

8
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:02,940
are brief and maybe it's more like moments that we sprinkle into the situation

9
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,820
so sprinkling awareness into our life and and that maybe that's also kind of a

10
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:13,979
nice image that uh that is kind of

11
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,560
I've been in places where Buddhist monastics have sprinkled waters

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:28,200
on people's heads and is a blessing kind of sprinkling Awareness on our experience

13
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,780
as uh the as the moments of awareness become more continuous

14
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:42,619
awareness becomes more like flowing water and it flows over and through and around

15
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:48,960
our experience or our experience

16
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:58,040
um yeah it's kind of being washed by awareness or floating in awareness

17
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:03,960
and uh that you have flowing water it doesn't that's you know it doesn't stop

18
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,179
for anything if it's a dam it builds up to the top of the dam and Spills over

19
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:16,680
but eventually it finds its way downhill and it can be soft but over time it's

20
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:22,920
very powerful wearing a ray wearing away the hardest granite

21
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:28,200
wearing away the hardest attachments we have as we

22
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,680
let the water flow through and with and water doesn't complain about things

23
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,140
it just flows water doesn't attach to anything it just

24
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,900
flows and then at times water becomes uh

25
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:53,400
enters into a large large lake where the water becomes really still and quiet

26
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,500
and peaceful quiet transparent water

27
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:05,280
is how mindfulness awareness can become when it becomes well developed

28
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,680
when all those moments of continuity really come together and there's no more

29
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,739
um reinforcing or bringing more attention and energy to it it just the

30
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:25,200
awareness just there and to abide to dwell

31
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,260
in this kind of lake-like oceanic-like awareness

32
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:38,040
is uh also possible and so these in other ways as well the

33
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,599
Buddha uses water as a simile metaphor and so as we sit today

34
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:51,239
perhaps you can keep close by

35
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:57,780
the simile at the metaphor of water for the awareness that you

36
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:04,560
are evoking bringing forth for this present moment experience

37
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:12,420
water flowing along with the breathing

38
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:19,880
water sprinkled in water as the vast

39
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:26,880
space space spaciousness vast Stillness in which everything floats

40
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,979
everything floats in its own way

41
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,720
and when everything individually floats in the vast space of awareness

42
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:48,020
for the Buddha there's a lot of equanimity that comes along

43
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:57,360
and so being equanimous about all things so with that that's kind of the idea for

44
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,199
today mostly will sit quietly

45
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:11,120
and um so you might if you haven't already gently close your eyes

46
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:30,120
and if your mind awareness heart is

47
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:36,660
like agitated water taking a long deep

48
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,280
breath and in the exhale let it all settle

49
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,880
let it all settle

50
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,259
letting breathing return to normal

51
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:23,940
okay bringing awareness to your body

52
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:29,280
breathing if

53
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:36,120
sometimes intermittently like water or sprinkled in blessings on

54
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,360
yourself other times more continuous and flowing

55
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:48,419
moving than other times

56
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:55,919
everything floats allowing to be as it is

57
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:04,639
in a vast body of water vast body of awareness

58
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:03,960
if you find yourself agitated

59
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:13,340
or caught up in thoughts or feelings or Body Sensations

60
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:21,980
imagine that it's floating in an ocean a wide Lake of water

61
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,720
it's allowed to be there

62
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,380
but it's allowed to float all by itself

63
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:46,760
it doesn't have to influence you or affect you

64
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:55,140
doesn't have to go away but it's held in a wide

65
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:01,880
vast field Lake of awareness

66
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:22,220
as we come to the end of the sitting

67
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:30,500
to again give some thought or image to water

68
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,900
maybe and how if you put your hand touch your hand into water

69
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:41,659
the water doesn't resist the hand

70
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:48,960
but it does surround it in a sense the water touches the hand

71
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:56,299
completely thoroughly but offers no resistance

72
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:07,220
so when sounds come Sensations come feelings thoughts come

73
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:14,880
it's possible to have no resistance allow them to come and

74
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:19,580
the water changes its shape to receive

75
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:27,600
whatever comes into it at the same time

76
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,559
so your water your your your awareness receives

77
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,399
doesn't resist but it also can be intimate with everything

78
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:45,480
non-resisting and in contact

79
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,140
touching

80
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:06,059
and to go into the world without resistance but with a heart

81
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:13,620
that can shift and shift and change and adapt and

82
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:18,500
move with whatever comes

83
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:24,860
doesn't resist but doesn't

84
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:36,000
lose itself and remains in a certain way connected

85
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,500
connected at the heart

86
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:47,059
and may it be that this practice that we do teaches us

87
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:53,480
how to care for ourselves and others by not resisting

88
00:29:53,940 --> 00:30:01,080
while staying connected teaches us how to be saved by not

89
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:09,080
resisting but staying warm and kind and friendly

90
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:15,260
teaches us to be peaceful

91
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:24,380
by not contending and complaining and grasping

92
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:32,340
and may it be that this what we learn

93
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:40,700
about being present can be a benefit for this world

94
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,620
may it be that our ability to attend to be mindful

95
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:54,000
is for the welfare and happiness of all may all beings be happy

96
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,919
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

97
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:06,320
may all beings be free

98
00:31:12,030 --> 00:31:23,800
[Music]

99
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:09,960
so good morning and good day so here we come to the third talk about

100
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:16,080
the Buddha's use of similes to augment his instructions or to provide

101
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,980
instructions in meditation and some of the instructions have to do with um

102
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:30,200
also describing what can happen as we meditate and so we can recognize it and somehow

103
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,140
in recognizing it Buddha talks a lot about abiding

104
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:42,440
inexperience in entering and abiding in this idea of abiding

105
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:49,559
resting in or dwelling in or living within I believe it's supposed to have

106
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:57,840
connotations of um being at ease being somewhat still

107
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:06,440
kind of just content and happy to be present for what's here as a place of abiding a place of

108
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:13,440
resting standing being and um so to recognize the states that

109
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,340
are useful to abide in and um and these abiding quality it's a

110
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:27,659
metaphor to abide or to dwell but I think it has a connotations of being at home in the experience being where one's

111
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:35,760
supposed to be and being at ease there and so by recognizing the these

112
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,399
experiences when those were to abide and to convey those experiences of

113
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:50,120
meditation the Buddha and to provide instructions the Buddha uses similes

114
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:57,600
and as I said in the in the meditation there's a lot of similes that the Buddha

115
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:02,700
where the Buddha uses water and in different similes water represents different things

116
00:34:02,700 --> 00:34:09,658
but often in the context of meditation it seems like water represents awareness

117
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:15,419
and uh mindfulness and uh and so depending on how strong

118
00:34:15,419 --> 00:34:21,358
the meditation is how centered we are um the mindfulness feels differently

119
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:26,638
when we begin practice mindfulness is awareness that we bring

120
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:32,940
to our experience might be intermittent and we might have a moment of being Mindful and then we want to draw find a

121
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:38,480
moment again and so the Buddha talks about sprinkling

122
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:43,919
water into maybe from the simile from Monday into

123
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,560
the powder but if they have sprinkling and as I said earlier I love the idea of

124
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:57,000
sprinkling because it's kind of a hot day it's kind of refreshing to be sprinkled with water to have a water

125
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:02,339
sprinkler kind of kind of touch you and cool you down

126
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:09,180
and uh or standing in a shower it's kind of lots of sprinkles pouring through pouring down it can be very nice to

127
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:15,119
stand there and in the shower sometimes or the way that the Buddhist monastics

128
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,880
will sprinkle water that's been blessed so they're doing blessings and

129
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:29,880
sprinkling it on people's heads it's kind of a really fun ritual ceremony that they do and so they're sprinkling and so you

130
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:36,359
know it's not just simply bringing attention back bringing attention back I wonder who I bring you back but it's

131
00:35:36,359 --> 00:35:41,839
bringing it back in this nice way we're kind of like sprinkling our blessing

132
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:48,599
refreshing our experience with awareness the best we can as these drops become more continuous

133
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:54,240
and come together then the metaphor is that of a lake that

134
00:35:54,240 --> 00:36:00,480
has a current flowing through it delightful current flowing through it from the under underwater spring

135
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:06,440
and here there's still activity and movement in the awareness where maybe still applying ourselves we're still

136
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:11,940
there's kind of an active way in which awareness is functioning within us and

137
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:18,540
and we kind of feel the dynamism of it maybe the dynamic quality of it

138
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:24,560
and then but then as the as the um we get more concentrated more settled

139
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:31,140
resting abiding more deeply in the experience then uh the um

140
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:36,720
the metaphor the simulated Buddha uses is that now still of a lake but this

141
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:43,920
time the lake has no current no movement in it so there's uh the lake now is

142
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:49,440
completely still and and I think of this lake is very clear

143
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:57,300
and very still very peaceful I've seen I've been Mountain Lakes early

144
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:04,320
in the morning before the birds are up but the light is up and um that Dawn and

145
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:12,900
and being on the edge of these lakes and before the wind begins and seeing the water the top of the water so still and

146
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:19,200
quiet maybe reflecting the mountains in a distance and there's something so peace generating

147
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:26,640
and by watching that I just love sitting there just looking at this peaceful quiet morning setting scenery where the

148
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:34,079
day hasn't begun and everything is so quiet and still so the Buddha uses this idea of a still

149
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:40,140
Quiet Pond Lake for how sometimes meditation can be

150
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:46,560
experienced and and so the mind has no sense of movement anymore

151
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,839
and awareness has no sense of movement and it's not being applied or brought to

152
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,440
anything or flowing through us and it just is and things occur within it and

153
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:05,520
the metaphor that Buddha uses for this the he talks about this still very still

154
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,940
quite like and he says that within it lotus flowers of different colors and he

155
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:17,940
specifies I forget white and red and blue and black and

156
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:24,300
I don't know what the colors are that lotuses can have but these lotus flowers are floating and not

157
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:31,079
just the top of the water but in his metaphor they're floating underneath the water so I don't know if lotus's flowers can

158
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:36,780
float underneath the water maybe it's the buds before they've opened um

159
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:44,099
but because the water is clear these lotus flowers are just floating there each one separate from the other kind of

160
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:49,200
just floating by itself in this beautiful body of water

161
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:56,160
and this represents the different colors represents all the different experiences we can have as we're sitting in

162
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,420
meditation that each experience each individual detail kind of is allowed to

163
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:08,820
exist there by itself each thing is allowed to be just itself

164
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:14,820
without any reference or tied to or caught up in the past the future about

165
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:21,240
comparisons to other things that are not it and it just allowed to float

166
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:27,140
and so agitation can just float there and be a lotus flower

167
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:33,119
sensations of the body kind of feeling just floating there and um

168
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:40,320
and everything just seems to float just each thing by itself and we're not doing anything with it or tying and connecting

169
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:47,820
it to anything else is just allowed to be itself and this kind of idea of allowing each thing to be itself the pristine self as

170
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:53,460
it actually is I think for me it gets conveyed in this simile of the lotus

171
00:39:53,460 --> 00:40:01,260
flowers floating in this very still Lake the water here is not just awareness but

172
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:07,339
it's also awareness saturated or filled with a kind of joy and Delight

173
00:40:07,339 --> 00:40:13,859
and so um if you have joy and Delight joy and happiness the

174
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:19,680
um they're you know their strong awareness that comes along with it and the distinction between This Joy and

175
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:26,460
delight and awareness maybe is not so obvious or maybe it is maybe joy and Delight is

176
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:32,400
some of the lotus flowers and but the idea is that the water the

177
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,740
water touches everything and the lotus flower

178
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:43,260
no part of the lotus flower is not touched by the water and in this metaphor the Buddha says no

179
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:48,480
part of the lotus flower that is not touched by the um

180
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,119
the peace the Tranquility the contentment The Joy the happiness

181
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:02,119
of um of that's a present in this state

182
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:08,280
it's not easy to just suddenly feel and experience the mind the awareness our

183
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:15,300
being as a stale quiet Lake but when it does happen

184
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:21,060
then the instructions are twofold is to abide in it rest in it and very gently

185
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:27,180
allow the the well-being The Joy the happiness the sometimes the Rapture the

186
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:33,599
Bliss that's there to allow it to spread and suffuse throughout the body

187
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,540
throughout everything so nothing that occurs is not touched by awareness by by

188
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:46,220
this well-being that can be there so um

189
00:41:48,300 --> 00:41:53,780
so the Buddha provides these metaphors

190
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:59,180
these similes and and they're kind of pointing to

191
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:04,800
they're illustrating the kind of experience that can come as the mind

192
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,640
gets settled focused quiet still when we start living in Awareness rather

193
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,740
than having to only sprinkle awareness remind ourselves to bring more to it and more to it

194
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:23,640
and so um it is a kind of points to a possibility a potential we have that and

195
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:31,619
these beautiful similes maybe it's inspiring uh to think about this to the

196
00:42:31,619 --> 00:42:38,460
possibility of abiding resting in awareness not contending with anything not

197
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:43,800
resisting with anything but meeting everything with clear awareness

198
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:50,700
and letting that build and develop over time of the sprinkles that we do slowly

199
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:56,700
increase the metaphor the similarly before was that of

200
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:03,720
you know the soap powder coming together and holding together another uh assembly that Buddha uses is

201
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:11,339
also drops is the rain falling on the Mountainside and if the rain becomes large enough you

202
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:17,579
know continues long enough and the water kind of sits on the surface of the soil

203
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:22,680
um it starts to roll and the drops meet each other and become stream little

204
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:29,220
streamlits and then the stream the streamlits become streams become Creeks becomes Rivers but as they go down the

205
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:35,579
mountain side they they first go into a small Lake and then a bigger Lake and

206
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:40,680
then the river goes into a bigger Lake and each Lake it gets bigger it gets

207
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:46,980
quieter and Stiller because there's uh you know uh the lake

208
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:55,140
is so big compared to the amount of water coming in until finally the water ends up in the ocean which is in this

209
00:43:55,140 --> 00:44:02,280
assembly is the greatest peace most peaceful place if you go a few feet under the surface of the water

210
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:08,579
so uh so the sprinkles the drops drop by drop

211
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:13,859
we practice our mindfulness that's our job is to provide the drops and if we

212
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:21,720
keep doing it the drops join and come together and we start getting a sense and a feel for something vast and large

213
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:28,319
and beautiful so um that was my attempt to make these

214
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:35,480
similes come alive for you a little bit so maybe you can um

215
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:43,260
um see if something in your experience corresponds to these similes and that

216
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:48,480
maybe there's something about water that's evocative and interesting as a

217
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:54,900
simile for awareness for for mindfulness that kind of can change

218
00:44:54,900 --> 00:45:00,000
the quality the characteristics of how you practice awareness how your practice

219
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,359
mindfulness practice as if you're bringing um moist

220
00:45:06,359 --> 00:45:12,359
flowing what water to your experience where there's no resistance

221
00:45:12,359 --> 00:45:18,839
to what is um but it's there's a flowing around and through and over and under

222
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:25,020
or or if it's not flowing maybe it's still and

223
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:30,140
just holds everything in the Stillness of a quiet mind

224
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:36,780
so thank you and there's more more similes that the Buddha gives so we'll

225
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:42,200
continue um tomorrow thank you
