1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,680
so hello

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:19,320
welcome as the good mornings were coming in in the Stream or the hellos the good

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,680
days good moments I could almost

4
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:33,599
um sense us in a circle I can imagine such AIG group we would make a big

5
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:40,399
circle um sometimes at the end of Retreats at

6
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:49,520
IRC at Insight Retreat Center everyone will gather in a more like an oval and say we've been

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,600
practicing together for a week or something in silence and then there's a there's a

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:01,559
moment of appreciation where we we scan the room and make eye contact with

9
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:08,960
many of these people for the first time or the first time in a week and I had I had a similar similar

10
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,200
feeling of connection and and Community as we're getting

11
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:18,600
started thank you for taking this time for your

12
00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:25,040
practice the theme of the week is

13
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:36,360
compassion compassion in our medic meditation compassion in our daily lives on and off the cushion they

14
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:43,640
say let's start today with on the cushion and begin with some

15
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:51,520
meditation we'll do a meditation that I I consider one of the one of the ways we take care of the

16
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,640
the the foundation stones of compassion it's a it's a simple

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:07,000
meditation of uh knowing the quality of the mind and if there's anything

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:13,959
hindering compassion and well-being Wishing Well we release it it's that

19
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:21,440
simple knowing and releasing so let's find our our way into

20
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:24,200
our meditation

21
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
posture

22
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:59,000
letting our awareness move its center of gravity as

23
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,360
it were from the

24
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:09,239
eyes or the face back into the whole

25
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,680
body

26
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,200
and letting Let There be let there be a measure of settledness

27
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,360
here not there and then But Here and

28
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
Now

29
00:04:53,639 --> 00:05:01,560
Here and Now where the senses live

30
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:23,800
letting the attention gather here and

31
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,400
now the sensations of here

32
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,160
the body the

33
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,919
breathing the

34
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
Earth

35
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:41,399
settling here with a clear

36
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:48,800
awareness here with a breathing

37
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:00,600
sensing as we settle you may become aware of some

38
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,880
inner companions

39
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:16,760
maybe influences in the mind that are drawing you

40
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,160
away from here and now to there and

41
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
then

42
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,600
our innocent companions asking for our

43
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
attention

44
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:22,079
is there a simple way [Music]

45
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:27,360
available to recognize and

46
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
release

47
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:54,399
returning and resting Here and

48
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
Now

49
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:10,160
and when our inner companions take us by the hand pull

50
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:14,160
us to there and

51
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:21,639
then to respond with

52
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,680
kindness a tiny inner smile

53
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:39,519
and we let go

54
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:42,959
releasing and

55
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
returning

56
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,880
is the body starting to

57
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,440
soften the skin starting to

58
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:30,240
relax La in the muscles

59
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,279
is the heart moving toward

60
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
tenderness

61
00:22:23,559 --> 00:22:29,960
again and again returning to here

62
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,679
releasing there and

63
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:52,520
then with the groundedness the

64
00:22:53,000 --> 00:23:00,360
fullness the presence of Here and

65
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
Now

66
00:28:10,279 --> 00:28:14,080
in our last minutes of this

67
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
sitting

68
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,599
studying Here and [Music]

69
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:53,919
Now inclining toward tenderness

70
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,799
peacefulness by all

71
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:11,640
beings everywhere come to know that measure of

72
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,760
peace that comes from letting

73
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
go

74
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:18,719
[Music]

75
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
that

76
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:30,799
so welcome again to this um second day on the topic of

77
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:38,919
compassion yesterday we um we talked about practicing with this distinction

78
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:45,240
between um contemplation of suffering so dwelling and suffering taking it

79
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:51,120
on and the fullness of the practice of

80
00:31:51,399 --> 00:31:57,960
compassion in short a practice that's both sensitive to suffering

81
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:05,799
and has this wish for others to be free a sort of practice that entails a a

82
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:13,799
vision of a life that's free from suffering that inspiring

83
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,240
potential so today a little shift to

84
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:29,080
um a question that comes up a fair amount and maybe maybe the this group

85
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:36,159
doesn't need so much convincing on this question but um it comes up often enough

86
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:43,279
that I'd like to address it and that is um

87
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,240
is meditation and Retreat particularly is that

88
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:58,320
permissible like with so much so much to care for so much going on do we do we even do

89
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,639
we even dare uh

90
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:12,600
so that's the uh that's the question I'd like to turn this um this morning I'd like to open with a

91
00:33:12,679 --> 00:33:17,799
story regarding um someone I've known in

92
00:33:17,799 --> 00:33:24,000
uh who worked with Doctors Without Borders so I was surprised to read that

93
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:30,440
Doctors Without Borders uh as the as the name might suggest they're a collection of

94
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:36,159
positions and support uh that um that give Medical

95
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:41,320
Care to um to some 70 plus countries in

96
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:49,679
2021 63,000 people working on this together to bring Medical Care to those who need it often in places where the um

97
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:55,159
medical system is um not not so

98
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:01,360
strong so this person uh this person I spoke with is both a doctor and a Dharma

99
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:08,679
practitioner so both both a physician and a longtime longtime um

100
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:13,919
meditator so uh we could say she was she was sort of on the on the front lines

101
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:20,398
with this she was seeing seeing patients just day after day caring for them day after

102
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:27,480
day and she started to notice that she would she would finish she would go back to her room and in so many words she

103
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:33,398
would she would just break down so to speak she was so

104
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:40,240
upset uh and she realized I can't go on without

105
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,878
rest and the words that I remember her saying I knew it was time to go on

106
00:34:47,240 --> 00:34:56,040
Retreat so she knew she needed seclusion in order to continue and needed to rest in

107
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:02,720
order to continue you offering care and this uh this points to one of the essential skills for us when we're when

108
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:10,720
we're practicing compassion and that is mindful monitoring how much is too much and how

109
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,400
much is enough how much can we give wisely but we might

110
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:25,000
um how do we how do we recognize that for ourselves and I I believe we all have a sense often we know when when our

111
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:30,200
pushing has gone too far for too long I think I think there's there's really

112
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:36,720
something to be gained in um practicing with the sensitivity of

113
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:44,800
recognition um so this this friend this physician notice she she started to lose

114
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,000
the ability to function as well and so needed seclusion needed

115
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:57,640
rest I think for many of us one of the way one of the ways that we recognize too

116
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:05,800
far is by the upwelling and the prevalence of the hindrances these states of mind that are

117
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:12,119
uncomfortable in themselves and are um called hindrances

118
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:17,960
but they're also called obstacles and for the sake of our conversation this week we can think

119
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:25,920
about how these how these might be obstacles to our compassion obstacles to our uh to our

120
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,599
own wellbe and our ability to care for others uh it may be that when the when

121
00:36:32,599 --> 00:36:38,040
the hindrances are active that we can't see clearly we can't see as clearly

122
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:44,359
anymore what needs to be done for others we can't help quite as well and

123
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:49,440
we can't see quite as clearly what's going on for us how to help

124
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:56,680
ourselves so this is where seclusion comes in Meditation Retreat that sort of deep rest that we

125
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:05,119
we give ourselves in a way giving ourselves time for Stillness and awareness and

126
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,039
attention to work on us to work in

127
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:17,520
us and what we what we see what we see when um when we when we take up the

128
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:27,040
practice of seclusion meditation and Retreat over time what we see is an unhindered mind an unclouded mind or a

129
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:32,839
heart that's free of obstacles I'll say in a few words that a

130
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:41,400
a mind that's free of hindrances is very closely associated with a concentrated mind and a concentrated mind is very

131
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:49,480
powerful very powerful so this deep

132
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:56,000
rest the one of the influences of meditation and Retreat is we know we uh

133
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:01,400
we know well from just even beginning the practice is

134
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:08,960
the mind starts to feel at home with itself it's a it's a state in which

135
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,720
we're resourced enough nourished enough to be able to see clearly inside and

136
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:20,040
offer ourselves to others so this is one of the one of the

137
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:27,400
functions of retreat such a simple practice isn't it

138
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:32,800
taking time complex to take time challenging to take time that's so much

139
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,960
so many um so many needs and responsibilities but it's worth

140
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:44,680
reflecting on how we can bring this into our lives then once we once we have

141
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:49,839
um taken the time to to uh meditate just as we did this

142
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:57,240
morning such a simple practice just as we did settling ourselves here settling

143
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:05,040
ourselves here and then when a hindrance arises to know it and let it

144
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,119
go can be really beneficial can sort of help our practice of being here to to

145
00:39:10,119 --> 00:39:15,760
get familiar with these five entrances you may know them well one is sense

146
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,800
desire that is the sort of compulsive desire that has a a grip and a lean in

147
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:29,119
it the second is ill will if uh if sense desire is a lean in ill will is that

148
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,200
push against sloth there's a great met

149
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:41,240
metaphor in the text for sloth and torper and that is um uh like algae has

150
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:46,880
grown over water so you can get this this visceral sense of sort of thick

151
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:52,800
slimy mckiness of how how sloth and torper can cover over the

152
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:59,760
mind and then the fourth is agitation if sloth is too little energy agitation

153
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:09,200
might be just a little too much and then doubt uh is um the fifth doubt about how

154
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,599
the practice should unfold what what should I be doing in the practice or doubt that I can do the

155
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:20,400
practice these different manifestations of Doubt so these these are like the big

156
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:26,640
five they're not the only only things that call us out of here and now in to

157
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:33,280
there and then um but getting to know getting to know these five we get to know a lot of

158
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,680
the territory of the mind and how do we do this with this

159
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:44,160
simple practice um remarkable that mindfulness

160
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:50,119
mindfulness is regarded as a medicine for all five of these sort of qualities

161
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:56,160
and conditions of the mind just by feeding mindful attention

162
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:02,480
we we undermine all five of these hindrances one of the principles of how

163
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:08,560
how the hindrances work is they don't survive without feeding they don't they don't sustain

164
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,599
and grow without feeding so in a way if we instead of

165
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,240
feeding our compulsive desire or ill will or doubt let's say we give our

166
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:24,560
Focus to mindfulness mindful attention and just that is

167
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,440
enough and we can come home home to ourselves you might find some other

168
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:37,440
creative ways to uh to relate to the mind uh in relate to the

169
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:42,560
hindrances I think one can be characterized as a sort of

170
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:50,920
self-compassion that um that knows a hindrance as a hindrance and then just allows that

171
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:57,200
hindrance to be there not uh not getting pushed by the hindrance not getting pulled by the

172
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:05,240
hindrance not pushing it away not pulling um just sharing the space Oh

173
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:10,560
there's a hindrance there it is let's see how long it

174
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:19,440
lasts because if it's not if it's not being fed it it um soon enough it won't

175
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:24,880
sustain sometimes our creative response to the hindrances might be might be just

176
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,960
that just allowing it to be there at other times a hindrance a hindrance

177
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:37,119
calls for a response that's more firm more strong where we in a in a in a manner of speaking set a

178
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:46,240
boundary and we say no not now not now now is for here not for

179
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:53,280
there and then and there's a little more firmness in the way we respond there may be other other

180
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:02,319
creative ways that we that we do this but the the point of um the point

181
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:08,000
of practicing with the hindrances is

182
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,599
um to remove those obstacles from Clear Vision the vision

183
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:20,599
that knows what we need the vision that knows how we can best help

184
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:26,839
others and it might be fair to say that the more we become skilled with our own hearts

185
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:31,400
the more options become available for supporting

186
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:39,720
others and then it's quite natural as the unhindered mind the concentrated mind settles that the heart grows tender

187
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:46,280
the heart becomes open for compassion when it's not being pulled and

188
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:53,520
pushed so seclusion

189
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:02,079
Meditation Retreat taking time for deep rest my uh my proposal for the day is

190
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:08,920
when thinking about compassion we can give it we can give it all of our best

191
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:14,800
effort and then as I said yesterday when it's time to rest really really rest

192
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,280
really rest and in our practice of mindful awareness giving deep rest to the body

193
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:27,520
the heart the mind coming to know the ways that we get we get uh clouded over

194
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:36,800
so that we uh can best give this heart to the world best give this heart to

195
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,280
ourselves may it be may it be that mindfulness supports

196
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:50,160
compassion tomorrow we'll look um we'll look at what's considered the root of

197
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:58,880
compassion and we'll turn our attention a bit to meta loving kindness practice so may you enjoy this day of

198
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:02,400
practice please take

199
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:07,559
