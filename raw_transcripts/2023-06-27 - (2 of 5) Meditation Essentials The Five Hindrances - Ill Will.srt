1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
well hello everyone welcome back my name is May Elliott and this is day two of

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:12,120
our five day series on the hindrances getting to know the five hindrances in

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,640
our meditation practice is really essential for learning how to settle the mind

4
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,859
um and as a reminder the five hindrances include sense desire

5
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:30,480
will will also known as aversion for restlessness sloth and torpor and doubt so today

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,540
we'll be exploring the second hindrance ill will the traditional antidote to the

7
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,879
hindrance of ill will is meta or loving kindness so I'll offer some instructions

8
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:48,480
for meta during the sitting today um and while ideally we might send meta to

9
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:55,980
the person we're angry at if we're you know if we're feeling ill will this is a tall order for most of us so instead

10
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:02,940
we'll start where it's easiest we'll start by sending Metta to someone that's easy to love and then this helps grow

11
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,960
the capacity for kindness in a way that's not quite as challenging so it's a little bit more like starting with the

12
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,720
five pound weights or the one pound weights at the gym rather than the 50 pound weights

13
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,240
um so so during our meditation we'll Begin by Landing in the body and then

14
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:27,000
we'll shift our Focus to doing meta for someone who is easy to love and then for ourselves

15
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:32,759
um and we'll just sprinkle in The Meta a bit you don't have to do it for the whole period if it doesn't resonate with you

16
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,799
um but I'll try it on if it feels like something that you're interested in and

17
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:45,439
know that there are many many ways to do meta and this is uh one of many approaches

18
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,360
so go ahead and take your meditation posture whether that's sitting standing

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,460
or lying down the Buddha taught meditation in all postures so whatever

20
00:01:56,460 --> 00:01:59,479
works for your body

21
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:08,819
and connect with a um a landing point for your meditation

22
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:15,180
um some aspect of your present moment experience that anchors you here

23
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,540
that might be the breath it might be the soundscape or it might be a global sense

24
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,659
of the body sitting whatever works for you

25
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,239
thank you

26
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:36,860
so connecting with your anchor

27
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:51,140
setting the intention to land here together this morning releasing thoughts of past and future

28
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,260
inviting the mind and the body to relax

29
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:16,580
even if it's helpful maybe taking a few deep breaths

30
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,760
resetting reconnecting

31
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,819
and taking some time now to be devoted to your primary anchor

32
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:01,220
maybe the breath the soundscape global sense of the body

33
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:36,258
Landing here with a felt sense of the now

34
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,860
all right we'll start by bringing to mind someone that's easy to love

35
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:19,879
that might be a parent a grandparent maybe an aunt or an uncle

36
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,919
Kwan Yin the Dalai Lama a cat

37
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,960
a dog your fit your favorite pet

38
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:36,440
or any of these beings are suitable for meta practice

39
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,599
and what we'll do is we'll take a moment to reflect on their goodness so this is

40
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:48,680
an opportunity to consider the goodness of this being

41
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:57,120
um you might bring to mind a memory or just a general sense of this being's goodness

42
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:03,420
maybe reflecting on a time they were particularly generous or compassionate

43
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,320
or patient

44
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:14,839
something that you love about them

45
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:22,800
so reflecting on one's goodness is the proximate cause for meta to arise

46
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,540
so we're warming up the heart

47
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:45,060
and you might picture them sitting in front of you it doesn't have to be a photographic

48
00:09:45,060 --> 00:09:47,540
image

49
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,839
and connect with the heart that wishes them well

50
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,800
so having touched in on the goodness of this being will now offer The Meta

51
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:50,100
phrases so I'll say a phrase and you can repeat it back in your own mind

52
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:57,000
when we do this it's almost like dropping a drip of water into a pond and

53
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:03,420
just letting it Ripple out so we're letting the phrase drop into our mind and body and then

54
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:09,240
just seeing what happens letting it Ripple through we're not demanding that the heart

55
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:17,360
respond in a certain way we're just seeing what happens so this is a mindfulness practice

56
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:26,839
may you be joyful and happy

57
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:41,420
may you be strong and healthy

58
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:55,880
may you be safe and free from harm

59
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:07,160
and may you be peaceful and at ease

60
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:33,720
and if the phrases feel a little too cumbersome you might try it like this

61
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,680
just saying a single word and directing it towards this person

62
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,160
happy

63
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:50,480
healthy

64
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:01,920
safe pre

65
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:37,279
may you be joyful and happy

66
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,860
may you be strong and healthy

67
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,639
may you be safe and faithful however

68
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,839
and may you be peaceful and at ease

69
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:11,279
during this practice it's okay if there's not a sense of Love or kindness

70
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:17,699
it's enough just have the wish to send loving kindness

71
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:23,779
love can be an action instead of a Feeling

72
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,860
and in saying the phrases we're just planting a seed that seed will Bloom on its own time

73
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:39,360
it'll Sprout on its own time so we don't demand that the heart feel

74
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:46,699
warm or light or open however it feels is how it feels

75
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:19,399
so we'll turn the tables now and reflect on our own goodness

76
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,560
taking a few moments to reflect on ways that you've been

77
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:34,260
generous or kind forgiving patient

78
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:53,360
this reminds the heart that you too are worthy of love

79
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:24,438
and even if it's just very small amounts of kindness not sufficient

80
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:38,460
so rather than sending the phrases to ourselves we'll keep that person with us the one

81
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:45,120
that's easy to love we keep that being with us then we'll imagine them sending us the

82
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,640
phrases such that our grandmother or the Dalai

83
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:57,480
Lama or our our pet dog whatever being it is is actually

84
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:04,200
directing the loving kindness at us so we're leaning on their compassion on

85
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,919
their kindness

86
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:17,900
you might imagine them looking at you with a sense of warmth or love

87
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,919
sending you these phrases

88
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:31,580
may you be joyful and happy

89
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,039
may you be strong and healthy

90
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,139
may you be safe and free from harm

91
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,500
and may you be peaceful and at ease

92
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:21,980
allowing yourself to receive the meta from this being

93
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,500
may you be happy

94
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:02,240
may you be healthy

95
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:15,559
may you be safe

96
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,279
may you be free

97
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:46,260
we can take you in next few minutes just to see how that feels in the body

98
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:55,220
in the mind continuing with the phrases if you'd like or resting back with your primary anchor

99
00:20:57,419 --> 00:21:01,880
doing whatever is most nourishing for you

100
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:35,179
may all beings know happiness and the causes of happiness

101
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,100
right welcome back hello to those of you who are just

102
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:27,419
arriving my name is May Elliott and today we'll be focusing on the second hindrance ill

103
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:32,419
will sometimes referred to as a version

104
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:39,020
uh ill will in poly is vyapada

105
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:45,780
and this hindrance of of ill will can manifest as anger

106
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:51,659
not liking judgment resentment discontent

107
00:23:51,659 --> 00:23:58,080
denial fear boredom Etc so yesterday I spoke about the first

108
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:04,260
hindrance of sense desire so these these first two hindrances are um come as a

109
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:10,020
pair they're two sides of the same coin they're the forces of wanting and not

110
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:17,520
wanting and with each there's a wish to change our experience in some way to create a

111
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,039
better moment at the base of both of these mind States is this sentiment that

112
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:28,919
the moment isn't sufficient as it is I need more of something or I need less of

113
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:34,080
something to be okay and something that both desire and

114
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,480
aversion share is that they tend to be spellbinding not the narratives we tell

115
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,760
ourselves about what we want and what we don't want they really transfix us

116
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:51,980
um but at the heart Beneath The Narrative there's simply dissatisfaction

117
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:58,200
so so where does it come from where does ill will come from so aversion or ill

118
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:04,260
will are born from unwise attention to unpleasant experience

119
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:10,500
so aversions born from fixating on that which is unpleasant and when we meet

120
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:17,400
something that's unpleasant that's exactly what the Mind does it tends to fixate so ticknot Han used to talk about

121
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:23,520
uh the phenomenon of the one chipped tooth so if you've ever shipped a tooth

122
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,919
you may notice the way that the tongue goes to that chipped spot over and over

123
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:34,980
and over again there's almost an obsessive quality to it and in the same

124
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:43,460
way the mind fixates on what's unpleasant and from that fixation aversion is often born

125
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:51,539
so then how do we meet it so yesterday I introduced a very simple two-step process process or practice

126
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:58,679
that you can use for all of the hindrances so we'll play with that with a version right now so we start by doing

127
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:07,200
step one which is recognizing the aversion you know rather than just being fixated on the Noisy Neighbor or on the

128
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,039
bad traffic we recognize well this is aversion

129
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:18,299
then we drop the fixation on the object we let go of thinking about the Noisy

130
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:25,140
Neighbor for the bad traffic and instead we turn 180 degrees to feel the inner

131
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:30,919
experience so step two is that feeling the inner experience

132
00:26:30,919 --> 00:26:36,720
there's a quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson that goes like this

133
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:42,600
if a dog is chasing you hear and whistle for it

134
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:49,020
if a dog is chasing you turn and whistle for it when there's something unpleasant we're

135
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:56,760
in contact with that's causing aversion all we typically want to do is get rid of it or make it stop but more often

136
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:02,159
than not we really can't change it the other version is already there

137
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:08,360
so when a dog is chasing you rather than running from it can you turn

138
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:13,860
180 degrees and whistle for it can you choose the experience rather than

139
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:20,159
fighting it it's like great I successfully recognized a version what a

140
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:25,980
victory this is a great thing um so so can we meet the moment in that

141
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:31,919
way can we meet our aversion with that mind [Music] um

142
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:39,059
I do want to acknowledge it can be hard to do the first step of recognizing a version because it's so easily hidden by

143
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:45,960
our Narrative of judgment rejection or disliking so in your meditation practice if you

144
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:51,900
notice yourself lost in thought yeah or maybe having repeated thought patterns

145
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,360
occurring you might just ask the question what's underneath this

146
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:04,860
what's underneath this and that might illuminate if aversion or maybe one of the other hindrances is

147
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:10,020
present actually fueling that thought pattern and it's not uncommon that we'll find

148
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:15,380
ourselves ruminating about something if we're feeling aversion towards it

149
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:21,480
the zen teacher Leanne shut talks about the hindrance this hindrance as

150
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:27,600
the parable twos as in t-o-o-s so if you're thinking a lot and you notice

151
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:33,840
yourself wanting to change or fix experience you might notice the mind that the mind is saying uh something

152
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:40,940
like too messy or too cold or too many bugs too itchy too loud

153
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:47,760
so when we're at this first step of recognizing the hindrance if you notice that sort of story playing in the mind

154
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:54,740
to this to that it's a likely sign that aversion is at work

155
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:02,400
so once we recognize you do that 180 degree turn and we feel

156
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:10,860
the aversion in the body we bring some curiosity to it so um as we discussed yesterday we might

157
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:17,940
be noticing if there's a temperature or pressure or contraction or tightness and

158
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:23,820
often aversion has an intense tightening in the body sometimes heat but see how

159
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:28,860
it is for you you might notice the energy in the body sometimes a version

160
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:34,140
has a lot of energy to it like anger is a very activating energetically because

161
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:39,240
there's often great motivation to fight or attack or to push away or expel

162
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:46,140
something so we can notice this energy in the body and sometimes noticing what's happening

163
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:53,760
in the body with some um it's kind of like a wide angle lens some sense of spaciousness I'm kind of

164
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,299
noticing what's happening happening in an expansive relaxed way sometimes I can just create a little bit more space

165
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:06,059
around the aversion we can as we do this step of feeling we

166
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:11,700
can also feel the hindrance in the mind what's the emotional tone the mind and

167
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:17,700
the Heart the cheetah what's the emotional tone what does it make you want to do are there repeating thought

168
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:24,139
patterns so that's our practice of recognizing and feeling

169
00:30:24,179 --> 00:30:31,260
there's a story about vajan cha the great Thai Forest master who is one of

170
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:37,799
the lineage holders in our Western Insight tradition and in it ajan chav who is known for his

171
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:43,980
tremendous strength of practice I've been his peacefulness and good-heartedness he was sitting and

172
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:50,159
teaching as often happened under his little cootie and during one of these times a palm

173
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:55,679
reader an astrologer came to visit him many people came to visit Adan Chan so

174
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:01,200
he was one of many sitting around listening to tell stories and teach the Dharma

175
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,260
yeah so this Palm Reader was just activated by ajan Shah's humor and his

176
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:13,860
warmth and he knew that it would you know ajan cha might look down on him if he asked to read ajan Shah's Palm but he

177
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:18,899
couldn't resist so he finally summoned the courage to ask atancha if he could

178
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:25,080
look at the lines on his heart and of course teased him and said oh am I going to win

179
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:30,419
am I going to win the lottery but ajan Chao was willing and he offered his hand

180
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:36,480
to the reader and the palm reader 's hand

181
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:42,299
and after a little while with a good bit of confusion and some surprise he said

182
00:31:42,299 --> 00:31:50,580
um excuse me the lines on your hands you've got a lot of anger

183
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:57,679
and ajan Cha smiled and said yes but I don't use it

184
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:04,200
so when we've learned to meet a hindrance over and over again and we can

185
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,320
do so with with clear recognition and a willingness to feel the hindrance in the

186
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:16,320
body without resistance we actually learn to divest from that hindrance and

187
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:21,419
we no longer need to be hijacked by it as ajan Shah said we don't need to use

188
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:28,799
it so as we do this practice of recognizing and feeling the hindrance of ill will

189
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:35,100
we end up undercutting the compulsion to use our anger in unskillful ways so the

190
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:40,640
more we're able to train in meeting this hindrance with mindfulness with patience

191
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:46,860
with non-judgment the less power it has over us we don't need to use it in

192
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,820
unskillful ways

193
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,299
so everything I've shared so far recognize and feel this should be the

194
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:04,140
typical approach to working with this hindrance however if the mind is overwhelmed if you really just can't

195
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:11,279
practice mindfulness with it that's when you might shift gears and apply the antidote and as mentioned earlier during

196
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:18,720
our meditation the traditional antidote to to anger to ill will is loving

197
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:24,419
kindness is the meta practice so the friendly mind of kindness can

198
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:29,580
actually obstruct aversion the sense of anger or disliking actually can't arise

199
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:36,480
when that's present so so this is something that we can engage if it's supportive to us

200
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,820
and we can lean on on the well-wishing of others you know we can bring to mind

201
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:48,299
and have somebody um that's been loving to us send us the loving kindness

202
00:33:48,299 --> 00:33:57,860
so that actually still that grows the heart muscle that grows the strength of our of our capacity for kindness

203
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:05,760
I also want to mention um another antidote for aversion in daily life and that's the practice of

204
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:13,138
restraint all right so if the the um you know we we often really want to do

205
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:19,080
what the ill will tells us to do um but to practice restraint is to not

206
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:25,080
do that thing as in don't say the snarky thing to your partner uh or drive

207
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:31,378
aggressively or hurt someone um and and this this allows us to keep

208
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:36,898
our ill will from causing harm so practice restraining okay so those are a

209
00:34:36,899 --> 00:34:43,520
few possible antidotes and then lastly as with all hindrances

210
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,080
notice moments when the mind is free of aversion so notice when it passes away

211
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:56,878
you know you might be totally consumed by anger and then at some point that that anger Fades away and the mind heart

212
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:04,380
is free so really let that absence register enjoy it when the mind is kind and at

213
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:09,680
ease really let that take that in

214
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:15,839
so today um if you'd like to take to pick this up as

215
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,880
a practice you might just notice any moment small or large where you

216
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:28,800
experience ill will or aversion so you might notice any moments where you feel frustrated maybe maybe it's while

217
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,099
watching the news um or maybe you don't get something that you had hoped for

218
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:40,260
or you might notice if you're internally judging yourself or another person so

219
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:45,480
just uh taking a moment to see if aversion is present throughout the day

220
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:52,320
and if you do recognize it recognize it as a version rather than just being fixated on the on

221
00:35:52,320 --> 00:36:00,420
the storyline of what's Happening that's a great Victory right so this moment of recognition can

222
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:05,460
actually be a catalyst for gladness so in the midst of aversion you can

223
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:11,160
actually have a feeling of gladness like wow look at this I'm clearly seeing a

224
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:17,480
hindrance that's a great thing so so today

225
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,980
if the dog is chasing you I hope that you are able to turn and whistle for it

226
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:29,300
I hope you have a wonderful day thanks so much everyone take care
