1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:08,320
hello everyone and welcome to our meditation and as we go into the least

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,120
least uh evoking or exploring considering the second Janna

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,560
uh one of the features of it is that uh characteristics of it oops is hello

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,920
everyone is a feeling of uh experience

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,040
of unity or unification the word is

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,440
ecody which uh loosely can be

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:47,840
uh described as uh weaving into one bringing everything into a oneness

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:58,920
of sorts and um and so it's a feeling that uh of

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:06,080
inclusion that everything is included in such a way that we're not apart from

10
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,560
anything and nothing is apart from us everything in a certain way becomes

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:20,520
subject there's no object for the experience and what's operating here is the word

12
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,799
inexperience logic understanding common sense can give us a subject object

13
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:32,759
distinction there are things we focus on which are objects and that's part of normal

14
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:42,400
consciousness but we experience the world very differently in very deep meditation

15
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,799
and it's not meant to be a metaphysical uh statement or provide us with

16
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,880
philosophical truths about stuff it's just a nature of

17
00:01:53,880 --> 00:02:00,240
experience and um if uh you're absorbed in reading a

18
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,320
good book or uh you be you could say you become one with it there you're it's all you're

19
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:12,800
just so fully in it that you're not you're not really this there's not the book is not the object the letters are

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,879
not the object out there you're in the story there's a unification with the

21
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,000
story in a sense so this kind of not holding

22
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:33,120
ourselves apart from anything not resisting anything not judging it not um

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:41,599
trying to make something happen that's different than what's happening uh a kind of a kind of becoming one a

24
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,080
kind of becoming I like I like the word whole quite a bit and uh a feeling of

25
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,160
subjective sense of wholeness where nothing is

26
00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:01,319
excluded and so it's uh quieting the m mind enough that the activity of the

27
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:09,200
mind that objectifies the activity the thinking the way of the mind operates that has a

28
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:17,480
there and a here that has that and this that has me and

29
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:25,360
mine has you know my breath versus

30
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:33,760
um just being breathing my body is a objectification

31
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:41,000
of the body just being the body closer to just being it's all

32
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,640
subject now this is not something we have to do as an objective thing it's

33
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:54,000
something that we settle into we relax into as we get more and more absorbed

34
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,319
immersed centered settled in our present moment

35
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:08,120
experience centered here so this is the world that we swim

36
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:15,560
in in the second Janna and the world I use the word swim

37
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:20,560
intentionally because

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:29,400
floating is the metaphor for the second Janna

39
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:37,440
so to assume a meditation posture and

40
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,800
to gently close your

41
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:59,080
eyes and to give some care with your Eyes

42
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:05,960
closed to your posture not as an objective thing

43
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:14,720
from the mind thinking about what the good posture is but from a subjective sense of being

44
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:20,039
inside the posture to feel what would be

45
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:27,120
nice what would be a nice adjustment almost as if what does the

46
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:33,080
body want it might be very different than the

47
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:41,400
ideal the instructions you've had what posture does your body want to

48
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:48,360
have in order to be centered

49
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:52,918
alert in the meditation

50
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:11,240
the body in a sense wants to breathe will breathe without

51
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:18,360
your thinking about it directing it the body just breathes

52
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,560
can you now sense and

53
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:31,280
feel the way that the body wants to

54
00:06:31,479 --> 00:06:35,840
breathe whatever way that

55
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:45,120
is putting aside ideals how it should

56
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:53,720
be just allow the breathing to breathe

57
00:06:53,720 --> 00:07:01,440
itself in whatever way it happens to be

58
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,360
breathing and within the experience of

59
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:18,199
breathing what is it in that experiences those sensations

60
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:25,520
that wants to be known wants wants to be

61
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:37,400
felt what is it in breathing that reveals

62
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:44,039
itself to a mind which is present and clear

63
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,160
experiencing your breathing within the wider

64
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,319
field of your body body

65
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:34,880
sensations and is there anything in your body that wants to relax as you

66
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:47,279
exhale and don't do relaxing but let there be a open

67
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:54,120
allowing for relaxing or softening

68
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:28,720
and might there be somewhere in the body the experience

69
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:36,600
of breathing a center point for breathing

70
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:46,320
center of gravity the beginning point of the

71
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:03,680
inhale and in that center point of

72
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:13,040
breathing is there any feeling of calm however weak however

73
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:24,279
brief let yourself touch into the calmness of breathing

74
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:57,000
and as if the calmness of breathing is like a soft pillow for your

75
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:06,160
head allow your thinking mind to relax and settle

76
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:10,879
into whatever inner tranquility there

77
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,720
is no need to be

78
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:29,160
thinking the gift to the mind is to let the thinking mind rest

79
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,839
and together with a calmness that's

80
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:55,680
here might there be some experience of clarity

81
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:03,200
the clarity however brief however

82
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,440
small clarity of

83
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:20,000
awareness that's in between your thoughts beyond the edges of your

84
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,000
thoughts

85
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,880
may be at the center of your

86
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:42,040
mind that makes more room to receive experience the breathing

87
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:35,760
do I have this sense of yourself as the experiencer the

88
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:41,519
subject of objects of experience

89
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:47,440
is to hold yourself apart there's a little bit of work

90
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:53,920
effort in the mind to create the subject object

91
00:13:54,519 --> 00:14:03,680
distinction that interferes with everything being

92
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:13,160
subject interferes with a oneness a unity a wholeness

93
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:40,399
and whatever sense of wholeness there might

94
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:48,399
be could it be permeated with tranquility with

95
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,600
calm

96
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:12,920
could the very atmosphere in which it exists be clear

97
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:43,440
and breathing intimately

98
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:54,279
part intimately continuous with calm

99
00:15:54,279 --> 00:16:01,800
clarity and unity breathing

100
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,600
in and breathing out

101
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:36,600
relaxing the mind the thinking mind and relaxing into the

102
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,158
middle of your experience

103
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,880
becoming your experience of

104
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:53,640
breathing becoming the calm the clarity

105
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:15,440
like someone floating on the surface of a

106
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:25,720
lake forgetting all concerns and becoming one with the lake

107
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:36,440
unified in the floating relaxed tranquil clear

108
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:39,080
we can be floating in the middle of our

109
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:45,278
experience and be so absorbed in it so centered in

110
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:51,080
it on one hand we're not aware

111
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,679
of the world beyond our

112
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,400
body on the other

113
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:06,320
hand we're completely

114
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:13,000
open to the wider world

115
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:21,520
the experience of unity

116
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:32,639
wholeness where the boundaries of our body boundaries of our sense of self

117
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:39,919
dissolve so all things are included in our

118
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:46,880
hearts a heart which is relaxed

119
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:52,840
tranquil clear

120
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,840
whole

121
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:10,919
undisturbed radiating out warmth and kindness care and love

122
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:16,960
like a heater that's undisturbed by the cold

123
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,919
around it but which radiates out warmth out

124
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:29,200
into the wider world without

125
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:35,320
reservation without a boundary to that warmth

126
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:44,480
so may our kindness our love our compassion our heart's care for this

127
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:50,080
world radiate from us peacefully

128
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:04,720
calmly letting everything exist within a calm home

129
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,600
so that the deeper

130
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:17,279
non-anxious the deeper nonself

131
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:22,679
preoccupied attitudes of love and care and

132
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:28,799
goodwill can flow from us into the world

133
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:37,000
may all beings be happy may all

134
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:45,320
beings be safe may all beings be

135
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:50,158
peaceful and may all beings be

136
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:57,600
free and may we experience each of these things for ourselves

137
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:05,840
so that we can better wish it for others may all beings be

138
00:29:22,520 --> 00:29:26,760
happy thank you

139
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:17,880
so so welcome to this third talk on the second

140
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:23,840
Janna and it takes a lot of settleness it

141
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,120
takes a lot of capacity to be at ease to have let go of so much of our

142
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:35,760
preoccupations and agitation takes so much healing and

143
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:41,600
settling to come into the wholeness that allows for the second

144
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:48,840
Janna and um and

145
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:56,039
so but one of the things that can get in the way of it is a mistrust of

146
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:03,200
it somehow a feeling that it's uh uh that if we drop into these deep states

147
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:09,200
of meditation that we won't it's a betrayal of the world around us we won't

148
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:15,360
um we won't be able to take care of this world others somehow we won't be able to

149
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:22,320
take care of ourselves and sometimes what happens is that people are quick to judge these

150
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,559
deep meditation states uh in a particular way and that is they

151
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:35,760
judge them as if this is the true way of being like once I go into this I have to

152
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:41,600
be this way all the time that somehow I tap into this I won't be able to

153
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:50,640
function in my ordinary life and so there's a resistance there's a reluctance there's a um fear that uh I

154
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:59,080
won't be able to you know be an acceptable person or a caring person or um responsible

155
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:05,240
person and this is um you know if that's the case it's a little

156
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:13,200
unfortunate and But what it helps to understand is that these are temporary states that are cleansing that clean us

157
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,480
that provide us a sense of deep sense of wholeness satisfaction peace

158
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:24,960
well-being and it isn't that we come back into the world with all the

159
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:33,039
qualities characteristics of this these deep states but we are we do come back uh

160
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:39,200
refreshed we do come back more connected more grounded more calm we do come back

161
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:46,159
more able to connect to people and to our responsibilities in a wise way in a

162
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:52,399
good way rather than being anxious rather than being uh ambitious or full

163
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:59,200
of our preoccupations and so it's not a betrayal of life to go into these deep

164
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:07,840
states um and any any any bit more than it's a betrayal of life to um you know

165
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:12,919
sit down to have a glass of water when you're thirsty when you're just drinking

166
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:19,840
water you are you know you're not talking you're not caring for someone else you're not doing other things for

167
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,080
people you're not uh taking care of your worldly

168
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:32,000
responsibilities you're allowed to sit there and just drink your water and doing so makes you so much better able

169
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:38,399
to engage in the world in a good way uh you know if we're parched uh you know

170
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:47,799
things don't go so well so um so so to be able to trust this

171
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:53,120
processes and when people finally come into the second Janna there's a kind of

172
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:59,519
confidence and trust in it partly because it just feels so right so good

173
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:07,039
and there's so little required from us in the first genre there's still something required from us this ongoing

174
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:13,200
movement of uh applying and sustaining the attention the needing the massaging

175
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:19,040
of attention and their experience and the breathing just be there come back stay

176
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,280
uh but in the second Janna that those kind of the intentional efforts to be

177
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:33,760
and stay to come back and stay here kind of the um it comes to a rest and um so

178
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:39,040
you you can you know if the analogy of the scooter makes sense for you that

179
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:45,520
I've used a few times you know in flat ground you might need to um you know

180
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,960
push on the scooter every once in a while to keep the momentum going on a push scooter but if

181
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:57,280
um and uh and you can and if it's a little bit of a slope you're going down

182
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:04,160
maybe you don't have to push uh kick off so often um but when the slope gets a

183
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,280
little bit steeper you don't have to push off anymore now we can just rest

184
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,480
and and keep yourself centered keep yourself focused on you know staying

185
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,800
going down the hill but you don't have to the legs don't have to work the legs can rest and both legs can be on the

186
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:27,119
platform of the scooter so in the second Janna we're kind of like in now we don't

187
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,400
have to make any effort anymore and so there's a deep feeling of ah I'm arrived

188
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,040
I'm at rest I'm just here and um and one of the uh

189
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:45,359
characteristics of this is a sense of unity or unification or wholeness

190
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:50,520
there's a variety of words that come into play with samadei that uh can mean

191
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:59,520
unification some people will say that even the word samadei means to gather together to unify uh eagata a word

192
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:07,040
that's sometimes translated as one pointedness um also can mean a a coming into one and

193
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,200
then this echo also has the word eka in it meaning one um many years ago I read

194
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,920
that it meant something like the the odi of ecody uh can mean to weave i love the idea of

195
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,440
weaving together weaving into one into a hole and um sometimes when I've

196
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:34,680
meditated I've imagined that the breathing are like is like the the warp and weft of a of a of a

197
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:40,880
weaving and uh and some is just gently with you know the weft i guess the weft

198
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:48,560
is the the the what puts puts go the the the warp I think um I used to weave but

199
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,880
I don't so long ago 50 years ago and so uh just I've imagined kind of

200
00:36:54,880 --> 00:37:01,839
uh moving through the strings of the warp and and you know weaving things together with the breath and that's kept

201
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:10,480
me nicely engaged um because a sometimes a little bit of an image a little bit of a imagination of what adds a little bit

202
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,000
of kind of engagement or interest help me sometimes to get concentrated and

203
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,320
then some point I let go of the imagination because it's no longer needed for that

204
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:30,560
so weaving together into a hole and um so this quality of wholeness

205
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,119
uh I I I love the word wholeness more than uh unity or

206
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:43,359
unification um because uh um just somehow unity or unification seems a

207
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:51,079
little bit more complicated in my mind but wholeness just seems to hold all everything it's like you know there's

208
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:57,280
a it's all things included in a harmonious way it's all things have a

209
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:04,160
space everything no no outside and one of the things I've come

210
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:11,760
to appreciate as being for me one of the most sacred things is uh the awareness

211
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,599
that is whole the awareness that has no outside uh there's nothing which uh is

212
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:23,680
intentionally excluded or treated as unacceptable in the wholeness of

213
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:31,040
awareness and um and this inclusion of everything the good bad and the ugly is not a

214
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:36,800
condoning or approval of anything except the idea

215
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:45,200
that it's possible to hold everything in a tranquil clear and unified heart mind

216
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:51,040
and in doing so we're not making the situation worse

217
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:58,240
from the point of view of deep meditation to to start living in the world where

218
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:03,359
there's an an object and a subject you know that thought is

219
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:11,440
unacceptable I don't like that thought that thought has to go even like I have to let go of that thought all that is uh

220
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:16,960
the mind is activated it's oddly enough the the it's work for the mind to have

221
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,320
those thoughts in ordinary minds means it doesn't feel like work it just seems

222
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:27,599
like what's happened but in deep meditation we start seeing that that

223
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:34,720
kind of activity is a work or strain it has a kind of coarseness to it

224
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:41,680
it's kind of unsatisfying for the mind to be involved in kind of this making a subject and object distinction there's

225
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,000
something out there and and the alternative is um everything becomes

226
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,680
subject or everything becomes um some people would say everything becomes object and there's no subject um

227
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,160
but maybe these two things comes to the same

228
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:07,800
um and uh and so the um

229
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:14,720
um and so it allows the mind to become quieter and more settled all this so

230
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,839
there are these five different characteristics that are primary in the

231
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:25,720
second Janna there is uh a

232
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:31,280
calm and this now this calm is a calm that has no boundaries no edges it's

233
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:39,760
kind of it feels a little bit more like it it's the atmosphere there is a a clarity uh the

234
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,880
mind is clear the heart's clear there's a clarity within which all things are

235
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:53,200
occurring and there is inner clarity it's called and then there's a a oneness or a

236
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:59,119
wholeness or unity that uh is experienced with it all without this

237
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,240
subject object distinction those are the first three and then the last two which

238
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:11,680
we'll talk about a little bit more tomorrow is um uh the joy and happiness

239
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:19,040
born from concentration so even though there's not exactly a subject object there's still

240
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,760
in a way please forgive me there's the object of of uh concentration there's

241
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:30,800
the the center there's a place where the whole is centered on and if it's the

242
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:38,079
breathing which is the object then that's the um um that's the place where

243
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:47,200
um uh we're kind of um um the scooter is h or the or you

244
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:53,200
you're happily rolling down the slope and

245
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,640
there's a kind of a a thrill and a happiness contentment

246
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,800
uh a sense of happiness goodness uh with

247
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,400
being on that slope being in that space being with the breathing at the center

248
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,000
of all things and um so I know I'm contradicting with this word object

249
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:23,200
but I don't know how else to talk about it that in this state that there's all

250
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,280
subject and the the heart of the subject is the the center of the meditation the

251
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:35,440
centering place of the meditation um in uh in this case the offerings mostly

252
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:41,200
these days is the breathing itself but then with that can come this joy and

253
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:48,640
happiness this pity and suka sometimes rapture and bliss that can come on and

254
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:53,800
uh and that also that is part of this wholeness that's also kind of saturates

255
00:42:53,800 --> 00:43:01,760
everything but it does it has a sense of movement to it especially the pity especially the the thrill or the joy way

256
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,560
it has a cleansing uh sense of being of um of movement or a

257
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:14,400
showering through us or a flowing through us or a tingling or a vibrating

258
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:23,280
or a sparking um or we can feel like waves moving through us in a nice way and um and

259
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:31,440
maybe with every breath there's kind of a wave it's kind of a rhythm of this great pleasure that can be there

260
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:36,880
and um so those are the five kata qualities that are mainly there in the

261
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:45,400
that highlighted in the second Janna so there's calm clarity unity joy and

262
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:52,319
happiness and that can't be too bad and um not only is it not too bad it's

263
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:59,599
actually quite healing it's uh provides a reconditioning to us that uh many of

264
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:08,240
us are conditioned growing up and through life with a lot of challenges and um and this is a very wholesome

265
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,440
conditioning that now that can can really shift things in a very very deep

266
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:23,480
way more than a lot of other ways that we try to change ourselves so to drop into this calm

267
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:30,319
clarity unity joy and happiness and allow it

268
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:38,800
to help us grow so thank you and um this afternoon

269
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:48,000
I'm driving up to the Spared Rock Meditation Center up in the countryside north of here and um I will uh do the uh

270
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,280

271
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:59,440

272
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,240
