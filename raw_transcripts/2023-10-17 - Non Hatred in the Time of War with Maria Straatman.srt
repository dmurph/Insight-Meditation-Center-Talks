1
00:00:01,159 --> 00:00:06,279
so good evening uh so I'm Maria

2
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:11,960
strotman and I'm sitting in for Diane and I'll be here for a couple of more

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,960
Mondays um I am uh a retired scientist

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:26,279
businesswoman I've been around IMC since oh I don't know a little over 25 years

5
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,320
and it is a delight to be back here in the in the in the

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,640
hall and I feel very strange to actually be here without a mask

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,280
tonight but isn't it wonderful so

8
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:52,440
um I'm going to begin by telling you a story a brief story I was last uh Sunday

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:01:00,559
well I guess that was yesterday seems sometimes the days seem very long so I was at Stanford mall and I I had just

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:07,560
come out of a a place where my husband and I had brunch and there were these two little blond-headed kids they were

11
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:16,200
about five or and seven and they came rushing up and they were running around a car playing some kind of Chase me game

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:21,360
and they had pastel clothes on and everything was sunny and their parents

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,720
were maybe 20 or 30 feet away and so I immediately looked out to make sure there weren't some cars that were going

14
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:34,439
to hit them as they were running around this car and thought how bright and sunny everything was and and the thought

15
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:40,200
arose they're not afraid they're not acting paranoid

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:45,680
they're not worried about whether they're safe they're not aware of their

17
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:51,320
surroundings they're not looking around they're not listening to bombs fall they

18
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:58,840
don't feel the noise and the Thunder and the dirt in the air and all

19
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:04,119
of a sudden everything in that picture became very dark and I felt the stabbing

20
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,200
in my heart and the thoughts of

21
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:16,160
the and I was very grateful for them that they were able to run around that

22
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:22,080
car and participate in the sunlight and not be

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,239
afraid and I was grateful for me that I could be there watching them run around

24
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,920
that car and and Delight in them running around in that

25
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:42,440
car and be happy they're not in the Ukraine or Israel or

26
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:50,360
Gaza and I thought about how that burden is entirely different for so so many

27
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,959
other

28
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:04,879
children and that led

29
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:11,799
me to say and I'm here I'm here thinking all these

30
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:19,080
thoughts I am in touch with just being here thinking these

31
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,680
thoughts and it reminded me of of the beginning of the

32
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:35,640
dhap all experience is preceded by mind led by

33
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:43,840
mind made by mind speak or act with a corrupted mind and suffering

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,680
follows like the wheels of the cart behind the hose of the ox all experience is preceded by mind

35
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,480
led by mind made by mind speak or act with a peaceful

36
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,879
mind and and happiness follows like a never departing

37
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:26,600
Shadow he abused me attacked me defeated me robbed me for those carrying on like

38
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:33,680
this hatred does not end she abused me attacked me defeated me

39
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:41,800
robbed me for those not carrying on like this hatred

40
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:51,880
ends hatred never ends through hatred by non-hate alone does it end this is an

41
00:04:51,880 --> 00:05:00,120
ancient truth many do not realize that we here Must Die For for those who

42
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:03,880
realize this quarrels

43
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:16,039
end one who recites many teachings but being negligent doesn't act accordingly

44
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:21,360
like a cow herd counting others cows does not attain the benefits of the

45
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,400
contemplative life one who recites but a few teachings

46
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:33,280
yet lives according to the Dharma a abandoning passion ill will and

47
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:40,759
delusion aware and with mind well freed not clinging in this life or the next

48
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:46,080
attains the benefits of the contemplative

49
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,000
life how how do we live a life of non-h

50
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,880
hatred how do we live a life of of non-h hatred how do we see how do we

51
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:08,000
live how do we bear the

52
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,520
unbearable it is not my intention to be in any way political

53
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:23,720
tonight so if you hear anything political be sure it is in your

54
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:31,400
mind it is not in mine

55
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:42,280
one of the one of the chief intentions in my life has been to be openhearted

56
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:48,680
from from the day I first walked in here my intention has been to be openhearted

57
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:54,319
and I can assure you that 25 years ago or more when I first walked in here that

58
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:01,759
was not readily available to me the heart was not open the heart was

59
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:09,400
very much closed and scaled over and protected and

60
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:17,960
unavailable unavailable and what practice has done

61
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:26,000
is made it very possible for me to be hurt thinking just the thoughts of the

62
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,639
suffering of those children who I don't even

63
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:41,360
know and practice has led me to a place where I am eternally grateful for the

64
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,879
practice for the ability to see the possibility of non-h hatred to see the

65
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:54,520
benefits of a contemplative life to live in the place where it's

66
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:01,159
possible to open my heart and not be consumed

67
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:08,720
Med in who's right and who's wrong and who's we and who's

68
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:21,400
they I'm going to read you another story yesterday um Gil gave a talk on

69
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:28,879
non-harming if you didn't hear it I really recommend that you listen to it and he was he was also very careful to

70
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,719
talk about non-harming and not about what you ought to do and the

71
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,399
interesting thing about the way he spoke about non-harming was that it really had to do with action he took the point of

72
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:48,200
view of action and my intent is is very much

73
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,519
parallel to what he had to say but I want to come from the place of

74
00:08:53,519 --> 00:09:01,200
what do you hold in your heart because what you hold in your heart is what you will produce in the world

75
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:07,480
world what you hold in your heart is the condition for the next moment it is the

76
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:13,320
condition that the Mind uses to create the next moment it precedes leads and

77
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,360
makes your experience what you hold in your

78
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:30,640
heart so this is uh this book is a book of poems by Naomi shihab naai she is um a

79
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:37,959
poet who lives in uh San Antonio Texas she is half Palestinian her father is

80
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:42,440
Palestinian and uh half

81
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:50,440
Latina so this this story is a story about her

82
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:55,760
son see if I can hold it here it's right in front but sometimes I can't find it

83
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:03,200
and it's titled someone I love someone I love so someone I love so much cut down my

84
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:10,240
Primrose patch it looked like an oval of of overgrown weeds to him in the front yard

85
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,360
near the Black Mailbox on the post he did not know that for weeks i' had been

86
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,440
carefully tending and watering it as a few primroses floated their pink heads

87
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:27,880
above the green Mass unfurled their delicate bonnets with dozens of buds waiting to shine we were on the brink

88
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:34,399
everything popping open despite the headlines all sweet flower beings from under the ground remembering

89
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:40,760
what they were supposed to do he mowed it down with the old push lawn mower I

90
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:46,519
was out of town he didn't ask his father who knew how precious it was to me his

91
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:52,320
father was in the back while this was happening and didn't see there wasn't a second thought why would we have had

92
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:59,279
such a tall patch in the yard what does my mother do when she comes out here with the old shovel in the butt bucket

93
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:06,480
in the mysterious sacks of Rose food food in her pocket bending to the wild tangle of Jasmine on the fence the

94
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,839
Dutchman's pipe the happy oregano the funny cacti crowded together in

95
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:18,120
complicated profusion like a family the miniature chilies what does she do why

96
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:25,000
is this here he just cut it down it wasn't easy

97
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,160
he must have pushed really hard to get it to go when I stood outside in my nighty the

98
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:38,279
next dreamy sweet morning at dawn after returning home on the midnight plane watering my blue bonnet Snap Dragons

99
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:44,200
butterfly bush Lantana wanting to feel tied to Earth again as I always do when

100
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:50,639
I get home rooted in soil and stone and old the kishan bamboo and trees a 100

101
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:58,200
Years of memory in their trunks and bushes we didn't plant and the healthy esparanza never losing her hope and the

102
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:03,240
banana Palm just poking out their fine and gracious greeny Greenery when

103
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:12,160
suddenly I saw what was gone what wasn't there not there impossible I was so

104
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:19,600
shocked I let the hose run all over my bare feet the cold stun of Fury filled me

105
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:27,880
sorrow rising and pouring into questions who could do this why how could

106
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:33,079
anyone I thought of the time my daddy came home to find every head cut off his

107
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:38,120
giant sunflowers right after they had opened their faces to the sky only the

108
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:43,480
empty stocks remaining his disbelieving sorrow as he went to his rooms and laid

109
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,519
down on the bed and closed his eyes and thought I will not mention this I am too

110
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:55,680
sad to mention it this is the pain of people everywhere the pain this year

111
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:01,680
deserves but at breakfast I went a little strange like the a lady down the street who shows up at people's doors

112
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,160
with a snarling dog and a hammer in her pocket I went wild and Furious and he

113
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:13,120
swore they just looked like weeds to him why hadn't I warned him why did I only tell

114
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:19,320
Dad I pointed them out to you weeks ago I said he said I don't remember flower

115
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,959
things like that and it was the season of blooming and

116
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:31,560
understanding it was the season of hiding from headlines wondering what I would do if the whole house had been

117
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:37,160
erased or just the books and paintings or what about the whole Reckless Garden

118
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:44,560
or then it gets Unthinkable but we take ourselves we let ourselves think it now and then to stay human the child's arms

119
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:53,759
or legs what would I do if I did not love him who could I

120
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,759
become if I did not love him who could I become

121
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:12,000
if I if I don't allow myself to love who could I

122
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,000
become if I don't allow myself to feel who could I

123
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:27,040
become if I callous my heart over and say those

124
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,839
people who could I become how filled with hate could I

125
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,160
be how righteous and angry could I really

126
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:44,680
become the answer is pretty righteous and

127
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,680
angry and it's a little

128
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:02,639
frightening we are always all the time becoming something know we like to think

129
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:09,680
that we are something I'm this person I'm that kind of person I want to be that kind of person I'm going to be

130
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:17,480
better I'm going to be but the truth is we're always

131
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:24,480
becoming we're always different than we were but we're never who we think we

132
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:32,560
need to be or what we want to be we're always just this person this person that shows up in this

133
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:40,399
moment that is created by Our intention and what we hold in our

134
00:15:40,519 --> 00:15:46,920
hearts which makes what we hold in our hearts really important really important

135
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:52,720
because all of life is a becoming it is a process breathing is a

136
00:15:52,720 --> 00:16:01,360
process thinking is a process we are not nouns we're

137
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:08,120
verbs we're verbs we we're we're action we're

138
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:12,199
happening we're not finished

139
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,800
products so how can we respond how can we respond when what we

140
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:30,519
see is not what we want to see

141
00:16:38,319 --> 00:16:43,519
how can we call for and demand Justice we

142
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:52,120
Americans when we can't even pass we we have a totally dysfunctional House of Representatives because we can't even

143
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:58,800
vote for a speaker really we can't we can't pass any laws because we can't agree age on

144
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:05,918
who's going to be in charge which is about power and not leadership anyway I mean that what is this

145
00:17:05,919 --> 00:17:11,760
about we can't seem to do that and before you say well I'm not those people

146
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:17,880
right away you hear those people in me it's that division of that that we

147
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:24,798
that we buy into of those people and we that somehow we have to break we have to

148
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:31,200
break that cycle of putting other people in some giant box where they're all the

149
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:38,799
same there are those people and they're my people and me and we're all like this

150
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:44,600
and they're all like that which we know isn't even true we know that but the

151
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:51,039
emotional connections that we make around usually just one

152
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:58,159
thing that varies what that one thing is and all of those people are those

153
00:17:58,159 --> 00:18:03,880
people people and my people are over

154
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,720
here we even do that within

155
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:16,799
ourselves there's there's that person that I don't really like and then you

156
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:24,440
know there's this ideal person that you know someday I'm going to be and we get consumed with

157
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:31,880
self-criticism and and non-acceptance of oneself and anxiety over who we're

158
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:41,559
not so the truth is nonh hatred really doesn't begin on a global scale it

159
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:50,360
really begins right here in our own hearts in the way we meet every moment

160
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:55,000
in the way we meet the news that we

161
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:01,760
hear just before I left home my husband and I for some crazy reason

162
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:08,200
were watching CNN and you know all of the particular

163
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:16,840
Talking Heads were talking about the war in Israel primarily and

164
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:26,159
uh I bet it wasn't uh 30 seconds in before I was in

165
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:32,919
tears and I thought well you know buck up here can't be crying you

166
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:39,880
got to be ready to meet the world and I said no no I want to meet the world with

167
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,320
that heart I want to meet the world with someone in 30 seconds can cry because

168
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:52,120
this is too painful I want to meet the world with

169
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:59,080
that person because there are different kinds of pain you know there's physical pain

170
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:05,600
there's psychological pain there's emotional pain and and what is pain you know pain

171
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:12,559
isn't a now nether it's it's it's another one of those processes it's it's a concept pain is a concept and it's a

172
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:20,880
signal something needs to be paid attention to something needs to be paid attention

173
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:27,400
to and how we meet that pain what do we what do we do with that pain do are we

174
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:36,320
do do we resist that pain do we say no well usually what that does is just

175
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,279
get make the pain stronger in some

176
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:49,320
way you the the people who research pain at Stanford have discovered that there

177
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,000
are two neuros circuits associated with pain one is the physical reactive

178
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,960
circuit where the physically you react to whatever uh or the body physiologically reacts to

179
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:08,880
whatever the source of pain is the physical Source but there's also an emotional neurocircuit associated with

180
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:14,159
every pain you know if you slam your hand

181
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:20,320
there's an emotional neurocircuit connected with that well that's kind of interesting so

182
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:28,880
when you when you think about that you realize that there is always some minor or very large

183
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:34,519
emotional compound component to every pain that you

184
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:43,480
experience so the question how am I every time you experience pain is a

185
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:50,200
very useful question it turns out the answer to what

186
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:57,120
do I do in the to respond to what is unbearable is exactly what the Buddha

187
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,440
said you do to avoid all suffering to put an end to

188
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:07,600
suffering you establish mindfulness he didn't say you sit down and meditate

189
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:13,320
although he advises that that's a good way to establish mindfulness he says establish

190
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:18,600
mindfulness establish mindfulness there are four things you know mindfulness of

191
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:25,440
the body mindfulness of of emotions mindfulness of the Mind mindfulness of

192
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,640
Dharma establish mindfulness here I am there's pain I'm sitting here

193
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:36,840
watching TV I'm disturbed by this it's hurtful for me establish know that

194
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:44,480
you're here know that this is happening don't just gloss it over or try to get rid of the pain know that it's here see

195
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:50,720
it because in seeing it you're better able to say I see

196
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:59,960
things clearly here I see what's happening here I understand what's happening here it leads to understanding

197
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:07,320
you're less likely to misinterpret the emotional content of what you're

198
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:20,720
seeing you're more likely to get to the place where you begin to trust

199
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,520
yourself which to me has been one of the most important an benefits of my

200
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:39,080
practice after 25 years that I am beginning to trust

201
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:46,080
myself Hallelujah who

202
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:53,000
knew I get these uh I don't know how often they come actually I get so many

203
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,400
emails that it's better if I don't know how often some of them come I had I was

204
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:03,600
recently on a 3-week retreat and I came back to 1,500

205
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:10,120
emails and I finally got through them after two weeks but one of them that I found was

206
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:17,200
one from Jack cornfield and this is a little brief present uh piece

207
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:24,720
of one that was in the last few days actually mindfulness is the means by

208
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:29,799
which we can bring our full caring presence to the

209
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:36,760
world with balance and understanding we can experience gain and loss Pleasure

210
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:43,559
and Pain War and Peace the joys and Sorrows that make up human

211
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:51,559
life the open and compassionate attention of mindfulness liberates us from reacting to and being caught by all

212
00:24:51,559 --> 00:24:58,480
things in the world instead we offer the world our peaceful heart we we respond

213
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:03,880
with care and courage and in doing so we embody the

214
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:10,640
presence and Liberation we wish for all sometimes this is called

215
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:17,200
mindfulness sometimes it's called love that's his

216
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:23,240
quote mindfulness is the means by which we can bring our full caring presence to

217
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:29,919
the world full caring presence so it's

218
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:35,120
another way of describing just what I began with with the dhap the opening of

219
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:41,679
the dhap if all experience is led by the Mind heart mind here if we think of it

220
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:49,919
as heart mind then showing up becomes an

221
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:56,880
act of mindfulness of Faith Of Love of caring for ourselves and the

222
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:04,240
world showing up just as we are not the ideal us but just showing up as us

223
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,720
that's what presence is it's showing up and knowing that we're

224
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,960
there who who is here I'm not over there I'm right here

225
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:29,080
this person Maria is here and she's had a really weird day

226
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:34,240
she so some of the things have been you know good and some of the things have been kind of

227
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:41,760
weird and here she is fairly stable fairly stable

228
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:50,000
mind and knowing that I am here on this DS and I'm speaking with

229
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:56,399
you and I see you and I register I am here speaking with

230
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:04,440
you and I'm aware that you are here it's not complicated the

231
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:13,880
mindfulness doesn't have to be intense or psychologically clear I just have to know what it is I'm here with

232
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,399
you and what am I feeling how am I feeling those who well I'm stable I'm a

233
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:25,520
little shaky about that not so good about this I'm pretty good about

234
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:32,080
that we grow to understand the difference between the triggers that set us off thinking about something that

235
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:37,320
isn't that takes us away from this moment into the past of the

236
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:44,120
future the difference between triggers and signals pain is here oh no not again

237
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:50,840
this is the same as last time I thought this was over and off we're we're we're off doing something else with the

238
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:56,799
mind and or pain okay do I need to move

239
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:05,720
oh this is a about oh yeah it hurts it hurts to be open to this I get

240
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:13,039
it totally different or I can say oh that makes me

241
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:18,480
so angry anger is here but it isn't me I

242
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:24,080
can just see anger I can put it up here and and okay anger is going to be over here in the left hand corner of my

243
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,279
visual anger is here I got it got it I'm just not going to spend all

244
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:36,440
my attention there because it hurts when I'm angry it hurts when I'm angry and I

245
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:43,399
don't particularly like that yeah but I'm still angry well okay just sit there for a

246
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:48,480
minute and I'm going to look outside at this oak

247
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,200
tree or I'm going to notice this tape going down here is kind of crooked wonder who believe that tape down that's

248
00:28:54,200 --> 00:29:00,559
interesting look it's the same color as that air freshener all of a sudden the anger doesn't have

249
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:07,960
as much power still there just not as much power I don't have to become as

250
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:14,320
entangled in it I can see it it's just seeing

251
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,559
it knowing what kind of pain is there seeing what the pain is I don't have to

252
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:24,518
be different I don't have to not have any

253
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:35,000
triggers the there's a there's a book uh called

254
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:40,360
lessons in chemistry I don't know if any of you have read this book but it it is

255
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:45,919
it's a novel uh have any of you read it yeah okay I love this book it's about a

256
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:52,279
woman chemist who runs a fowl of her male advisors and you know of course she

257
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:59,840
gets fired and she's brilliant right and she ends up teaching uh uh cooking on television but

258
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:05,799
she treats the women who are taking this class with a great deal of respect and you know some of them go off and become

259
00:30:05,799 --> 00:30:12,919
microbiologists and stuff but apple is doing uh a series of

260
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:18,880
this book and the first it just started this weekend so of course I'm watching it because I loved this book because I

261
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:25,679
totally identified with this woman and she gets triggered this this

262
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:31,240
scientist and watching this happen and watching my own reactions and seeing the

263
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,960
trigger come up in me and go you know but I did a lot of work that that

264
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,559
trigger doesn't trigger me anymore and I could sit there and just

265
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,360
go wow

266
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:55,799
wow wow and the pleasure that came from just not being

267
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:59,638
entangled with that Ang anger

268
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:09,840
anymore is just unspeakably wonderful took a long

269
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:14,799
time took a long

270
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:25,159
time so the question is how do you meet pain well you don't know if you don't

271
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:30,200
watch it if you constantly try to get away from it you don't have to analyze

272
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:36,559
the pain dig into it you know there are lots of people who give you instructions about sitting with the pain and you know

273
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:44,320
becoming befriending you don't have to befriended just know it's there figure it out watch it see how you react to it

274
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:49,799
what kinds of pain do you react to so that you know yourself so you know

275
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:55,240
how that works so that it doesn't hold you it doesn't tangle you

276
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:02,960
up so that you're free of entanglement so that you're free and then you can trust yourself and

277
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,799
you can trust your heart to be

278
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:16,200
open it's always a good idea to check whether today's pain is associated with

279
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:22,000
the present the past or the future that's how you recognize a

280
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:27,600
trigger or you know something that leads you into the fantasy ideal self of the future

281
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:37,158
kind of just look at that what happens is we slowly develop

282
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:44,039
Faith or confidence call it confidence we slowly develop

283
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:52,279
confidence and confidence leads to ma to to more effort and effort leads to more

284
00:32:54,519 --> 00:32:59,960
mindfulness it's it's really it's a wonderful Circle and mindfulness then

285
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:06,278
leads to a a steady stable mind which

286
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,320
Sade and then you begin to understand things as they are it leads to

287
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:22,200
wisdom which leads to confidence which leads to more effort it feeds

288
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,960
itself these are the benefits of a contemplative life

289
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:49,320
I brought with me I couldn't decide so now I've decided what poem am

290
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:55,960
going to read you this poem is by uh aah leemon who is a current poet Laur

291
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,840
laurate and this was written to her poetry students I'm sure it's called the

292
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:10,679
end of poetry but it actually fits the life of a mindfulness student like

293
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:18,158
me enough of OAS and chicky and sunflower and snowshoes Maple and seeds

294

Samara and CH enough carcuro enough of

00:34:36,919 --> 00:34:42,480
Frozen Birds enough of the will to go on and not go on or how a certain light

298

299
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:58,400
gun the drama and the acquaintances suicide the long lost letter on the dresser enough of the long and the ego

300

303
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:22,480
desperate enough of the animals saving me enough of the high water enough of

304
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:27,560
the sorrow enough of the air in its ease I am asking you

305
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:30,280

316
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:51,720
was in progressive radio and I've always been

317
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:57,280
I um

318
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:04,280
a news freak and a political junkie and I'm having a diff

319
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:10,240
very and I haven't even for me not to turn on the news every day is just it's unheard

320
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:16,359
of and I I haven't turn the news on in the last three or four days because I can't deal with

321
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:23,520
it I feel like I'm uh and I'm a very sensitive man and I I feel like I'm

322
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,720
living in an uncivilized world I love children and when I heard what

323
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:35,440
they were doing to the children I'm very easy to cry like you I

324
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:41,319
I just I I can't I don't know how to deal with it and you know your your reading

325
00:37:41,319 --> 00:37:49,880
tonight was wonderful but I just it's just so hard it's so hard to be present and deal

326
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:55,960
with this and how do you do that how do you do that I mean it's just so far

327
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:02,319
removed D from what I am you know and it's just I'm having a difficult time I

328
00:38:02,319 --> 00:38:08,599
really am and and I uh I don't know how everyone else feels but

329
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:15,279
um this craziness is just it's I don't know how it's going to stop but

330
00:38:16,359 --> 00:38:24,000
um there is um there is no question

331
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,920
that um it is crazy and that there is brutality in the

332
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:39,119
world and I will not defend it ever and

333
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:46,160
uh and I also know

334
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:55,040
that if if we point to

335
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,359
anyone they can point

336
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:07,200
back there are no Heroes they're no Heroes right

337
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,520
now uh I read a couple of days ago that that the US had appointed a former mid

338
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:20,800
East expert whose name unfortunately I don't remember uh as a

339
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:26,200
humanitarian Aid Ambassador sent him off to the Middle East and I thought well at

340
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:31,359
least were appointing somebody that besides sending the warships you know

341
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:38,560
and uh and The Invasion That was supposed to happen two days ago hasn't happened yet which is probably because

342
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:48,640
they don't know how to deal with the underground tunnels and um Biden is going to uh Israel on Wednesday and you

343
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,359
know it's it's like things are moving but the last number I saw of

344
00:39:54,359 --> 00:40:02,280
children that were killed on both sides was 749

345
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:10,599
children for what for for craziness for for making a

346
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:18,040
political Point nobody was served by this nobody

347
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,720
was served and

348
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:28,838
um nobody will be served by an Invasion

349
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:36,440
either one of one of the things that that Gil talked about somebody asked him a question at the end about well you

350
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,880
know what do you think about this I I don't remember exactly the nature of the question and he referred to tikot Han

351
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:47,760
and and the this what he referred to is written in up in tikn Han's

352
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:55,079
book being peace and the uh tikn Han was uh in

353
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:02,520
Vietnam and and supportting both North and South Vietnam peoples and refused to take sides and so

354
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:08,280
he wasn't trusted by anybody and his monks were called killed by

355
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:17,599
both uh but he refused to take sides and what gilded yesterday was neither take sides

356
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:24,599
or not take sides he basically said I I

357
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:30,599
just I just want to talk about non-harming

358
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:40,800
and where we find ourselves is in dealing with the

359
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,319
unforgivable how do you keep yourself from developing

360
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:56,480
hate so the approach I took was I'm not going to solve this by

361
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:05,839
choosing somebody to blame and so what I can do is come

362
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:12,400
here and talk to you about keeping your heart

363
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,599
open that that when you make a one degree

364
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:24,400
turn it looks like nothing until you get far enough

365
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:33,720
out you know that's all I can say about it it is

366

392
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,240
around Albuquerque uh Airport terminal after learning my flight was

393
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:45,079
detained 4 hours I heard the announcement if anyone in the vicinity of gate 4A understands Arabic please

394
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:50,359
come to the gate immediately well one pauses these days gate 4A was my own

395
00:45:50,359 --> 00:45:55,960
gate I went there an older woman in full traditional Palestinian dress just like

396
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:02,079
my grandma wore was crumpled to the floor wailing loudly help said the flight service

397
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:09,280
person talk to her what's her problem we told her the flight was going to be 4 hours late and she did this I put my arm

398
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,440
around her and spoke to her

399
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,800
haltingly sewe the minute she heard any word she knew however poorly used excuse

400
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:30,040
me she stopped crying she thought our flight had been cancelled entirely she

401
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:36,319
needed to be in El Paso for some major medical treatment the following day I said no no we're fine you'll get

402
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:43,480
there just late who's picking you up let's call him and tell him we called her son and I spoke to him in English I

403
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:50,280
told him I would stay with his mother till we got on the plane and would ride next to her Southwest she talked to him then we

404
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:56,880
called her other Sons just for the fun of it then we called my dad and he spoke to her for a while and Arabic and found

405
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:04,160
out of course they had 10 shared friends then I thought just for the heck of it why not call some Palestinian poets I

406
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:11,359
know and let them chat with her this all took about two hours she was laughing a lot by then telling about her life

407
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:18,559
answering questions she had pulled a sack of homemade mimu cookies little powdered sugar crumbly Mounds stuffed

408
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:25,960
with dates and nuts out of her bag and was offering them to all the women at the gate to my amazement not a single woman

409
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:32,440
declined one it was like a Sacrament The Traveler from Argentina The Traveler from California the lovely woman from

410
00:47:32,440 --> 00:47:37,599
Laredo we were all covered with the same powdered sugar and smiling there are no

411
00:47:37,599 --> 00:47:44,240
better cookies then the airline broke out the free beverages from huge coolers non-alcoholic and two little girls on

412
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:50,200
our flight one African-American one Mexican-American ran around serving us all apple juice and lemonade and they

413
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:57,200
were covered with powdered sugar too and I noticed my new best friend by now we were holding hand hands had a potted

414
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:03,680
plant poking out of her bag some medicinal thing with green furry leaves such an old country traveling tradition

415
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,920
always carry a plant always stay rooted to somewhere and I looked around that

416
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:14,280
gate of late and weary ones and thought this is the world I want to live in the

417
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:19,319
shared world not a single person at this gate once the crying of confusion

418
00:48:19,319 --> 00:48:25,680
stopped has seemed apprehensive about any other person they took the cookies I

419
00:48:25,680 --> 00:48:31,480
wanted to hug all those other women too this can still happen anywhere not

420
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:36,960
everything is lost thank you

421
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:41,960
all may you all enjoy a warm open

422
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:45,559
heart
