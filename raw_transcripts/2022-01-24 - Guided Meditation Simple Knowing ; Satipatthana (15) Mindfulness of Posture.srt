1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:10,160
so good morning everyone good day it's my pleasure to welcome you this

2
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,839
today to the insight retreat center in santa cruz i broadcast from here a few weeks ago on

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:22,160
a monday this week uh this week i'll do all the days here i'm here teaching a seven-day

4
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:30,480
retreat and um and i really wanted to be able to continue this series on sati patana

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,360
so i'm delighted to be here and to share this wonderful place with you you don't see too much of it but

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,520
then you certainly see the altar and and one of the things

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:51,360
that i could say just to get a sense of what irc is like um the altar was built by a

8
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,360
practitioner here uh a woodworker and beautiful altar that

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,039
he spent many months building and uh and that was his uh

10
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:11,840
his uh inspiration his generosity to the center and the buddha was a gift from um

11
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:17,119
practitioners here at imc and people who love the irc and

12
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,600
and so um this little little picture of you know how and you see the paint on the wall that

13
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,920
it's you know the color the paint maybe it's nothing particularly special but there were volunteers here and i was

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:37,600
part of a team the aesthetics team that was uh considering every color and what would work for meditation hall and

15
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,720
for retreat center so it's all there's all this

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,680
it imbued this place with this wonderful dharma dedication of many many people to

17
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,920
make this possible volunteer set so you get a small taste but if i look

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,399
around irc i see this replicated a thousand ten thousand times of all this wonderful things that support

19
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,840
that people have provided for the center

20
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:10,640
um

21
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,040
when we started this at the breath exercise in sati patana the

22
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,720
instructions are when breathing in a long breath no you're breathing in a long breath when

23
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:30,959
breathing out a long breath know you're breathing out the long breath and the same with a short breath

24
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,840
and i take that as being shorthand for when you breathe know the characteristics the qualities know

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,920
the experience of breathing and and the operating word here is to know

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:53,040
and the most common verb most common activity that we're instructed to do in the satipatana is actually to know

27
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,800
and one of the ways of understanding this that i like is that the knowing is a kind of

28
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,239
recognition and it's a moment of recognition

29
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:11,280
and there's something very special can be discovered in just a simple act moment of the

30
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,400
recognition and if you kind of spend some time experimenting with the act of knowing

31
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,480
this recognition knowing uh you might be able to find

32
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:29,200
that uh that there's a some quality of freedom clarity

33
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,480
spaciousness perhaps non-identification non-reactivity

34
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,319
in the simplest way in which we can recognize what's happening

35
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:47,040
so uh and so it doesn't take too long to uh you know the mindfulness doesn't

36
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:54,080
you know the idea that mindfulness takes a while you have to kind of do it for a while to um is certainly

37
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,879
true that there are benefits that come as you continue to do it but to have too much focus on the future

38
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,040
and what you're going to how it's going to develop you miss the opportunity to discover how wonderful it is just in a

39
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,840
moment of knowing of presence

40
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,000
excuse me so if um

41
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:25,680
you would just maybe for a moment close your eyes and as you are

42
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,560
and find some neutral but clear sensation

43
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:40,240
that's happening that you're experiencing it could be a sound it could be a sensation in your body it could be breathing

44
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:47,360
and and recognize it with a a word like

45
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,720
hearing sensing or touch warmth

46
00:04:52,720 --> 00:05:00,560
coolness movement whatever it might be and and uh say that simple word

47
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,199
in a very simple easy going relaxed way but with some kind of uh

48
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:14,240
like this is what this is really what you're doing you're like you gather yourself around just the simple act of

49
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,880
verbal recognition in your mind in an easy pace

50
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,039
um either continue with the same sensation or continue with whatever sensation it

51
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,160
comes to you very very easily just like there it is and you recognize it

52
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,759
and um and experiment with having that act of recognition

53
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:43,520
feel free free ill kind of not sticky not

54
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:50,720
reactive to the experience not judging it and um

55
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,680
and the just just the clarity of oh

56
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:04,000
this is hearing as you hear my voice hearing

57
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:12,319
if the chest moves moving just really really simple but but see if you

58
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:18,080
can gather yourself so that you're not

59
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,720
that's what you're doing you're not kind of on the side in the background of that underneath it mostly

60
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,160
having commentary about it or commentary about this exercise and questioning it

61
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:39,600
just like give yourself over for one like a moment to recognize a sensation you're having

62
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:49,680
and see if you can find a way in your mind to do that recognition so that it's a

63
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,240
spacious receptive allowing open

64
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:01,280
maybe has some quality of the knowing

65
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:06,199
is free of what is known

66
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:29,120
and this might feel like a little bit of work if you've never done this kind of focus like this

67
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,240
but this is the direction that mindfulness meditation can go where

68
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:42,639
it becomes simpler and simpler more more easeful but it's a we're taking refuge or

69
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,160
resting ourselves in the mind's capacity to know

70
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,879
but not a knowing that's necessarily work it's almost like a natural knowing that

71
00:07:54,879 --> 00:08:00,960
the mind does the natural recognition we're recognizing recognition

72
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,400
so that that becomes clearer and stronger and we start discovering the freedom

73
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:14,720
the peace that's in that moment so to start the meditation

74
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:22,840
to assume your meditation posture

75
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:35,518
and gently take a few long slow deep breaths

76
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:42,719
on the exhale settling into your core settling into

77
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,839
the center of your being

78
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,279
letting your breathing return to normal and continuing with a normal breath as

79
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,040
you exhale to settle into your body

80
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:22,920
maybe as if you're relaxing and settling into your core

81
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,560
and then as you're breathing

82
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:16,000
no you're breathing know if your breathing is fast or slow

83
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,839
know it to be long or short

84
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:27,000
no it to be deep or shallow

85
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:46,160
and without working too hard at it see if you can recognize

86
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:54,760
the simplicity of recognition simplicity of clearly knowing

87
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:10,120
the simplest recognition that has no commentary no judgments

88
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:22,399
a recognition that's light useful

89
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:32,959
if the mind wanders off in thought see if you can discover the simplest

90
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:39,279
possible recognition that that's happening the recognition that

91
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:45,279
has some quality of being free of reactivity

92
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:48,640
free of preference

93
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,160
and then begin again with your breathing

94
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,399
as you make the simplest acts of knowing of recognition

95
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:55,360
do you have any sense that your mind is pulling away

96
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:00,560
or leaning into searching

97
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:11,199
and maybe it's possible to have the mind neither search or pull away

98
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,079
the mind itself can rest

99
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:23,839
trusting the simplicity of knowing just knowing

100
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:31,160
knowing in breath out breath

101
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,799
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

102
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:31,600
maybe giving us some contemplation

103
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:39,279
about what it's like when you feel really known by someone else

104
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:45,120
not necessarily they know everything about your history but even a stranger it takes five minutes to

105
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:50,799
get to know you and you feel somehow they really

106
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:58,080
knew you to the extent to which you were at those five minutes what is it like to be really known

107
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,158
and what's it like for you

108
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,440
to know someone else

109
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:23,120
if there's no words to be spoken and you're with someone

110
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:30,640
and you really know them recognize allow for some clarity of recognition of

111
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:35,840
the humanity of some other person

112
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:44,520
there can be an intimacy in knowing

113
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:59,720
the simplest and fullest knowing maybe has no barriers

114
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,440
maybe it has no judgments

115
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,080
there can be something clean about only knowing

116
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:29,159
but knowing well knowing clearly

117
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:40,799
and as we develop our capacity to know intimately clearly

118
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:46,640
may it be the channel by which we convey our

119
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:55,679
care for the world our love our generosity

120
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:59,840
our respect

121
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:08,679
may what we learn through this meditation practice

122
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:23,279
support us to be a

123
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:29,679
conduit of care and love and kindness

124
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:36,320
and may our good will spread across the lands

125
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,278
from person to person

126
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:48,880
a ripple of goodness out across the world wishing

127
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,000
may all beings be happy

128
00:29:55,520 --> 00:30:01,519
may all beings be safe

129
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:09,760
may all beings be peaceful

130
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:15,840
and may all beings everywhere be free

131
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,600
and for this morning i'm not sitting with the bell anywhere nearby

132
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:30,720
so i'll bow and you can join me that can be the ending

133
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:35,000
of our meditation thank you

134
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:29,279
okay so so today i begin the next exercise in

135
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:38,000
the discourse on the four foundations for mindfulness for awareness

136
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:47,480
and um it follows the same pattern as the first one in this in in that

137
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:53,120
it's going to describe another way of

138
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:57,600
observing the body in terms of the body

139
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,320
ardent aware clearly comprehending having a put aside

140
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,399
uh greed and distress about the world for the world

141
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:17,120
and um so this is a relatively you know mature mindfulness

142
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,440
state to be in to be able to observe the the simplicity of the body in regards to the body

143
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,559
ardent clearly comprehending and aware

144
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:33,679
having put aside greed and distress for the world

145
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,799
some people practice mindfulness so they cannot be caught in greed in distress

146
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:44,880
so but that could happen and when it happens then the practice can go from there

147
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,559
so that's kind of like a little bit the goal and then these 13 exercises are the means

148
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:58,559
so that's why i translate this text the four foundations for mindfulness classically it's called

149
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,240
of mindfulness but it's it's the purpose is for developing this clear awareness

150
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:10,960
which i call mindfulness and so how do we do that well we can also do

151
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,559
this with a second exercise if you do the second exercise well

152
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:23,600
that becomes a platformer foundation from which to go through the steps of the refrain

153
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:29,360
to have this more awareness that's open both to external and internal

154
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:35,200
uh to have this ability to see the inconstant nature of the experience

155
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,240
and with the help of that inconstancy of impermanent nature of phenomena

156
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,559
experiences to

157
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:53,600
abide in a very simple lucid awareness where there is no greed no clinging to

158
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,720
anything at all so this is the pattern now the second exercise is very simple

159
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,679
and because it's so simple it's easy to overlook it's you understand it immediately you know and so

160
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:14,560
you might feel like you're ready to move on to the next thing because it's you know just four or five lines and

161
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:20,240
you're done and um so it goes this way

162
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,398
when standing one knows when is standing

163
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:31,679
when walking one knows one is walking

164
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,800
when sitting one knows when is sitting when lying down one nose one is lying

165
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:44,000
down in whatever posture the body is in

166
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:49,440
one knows that so it's so

167
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:54,480
you know um deceptively maybe uh

168
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:59,920
simple uh you know just to know you're standing when you're standing okay you can do

169
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:05,200
that in a moment and then you're on ready to do the some more important things

170
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,240
and um but here we're talking about to really know and it's the knowing

171
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:16,960
pacianati and pali p a j

172
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:25,040
to know this is the important verb activity in that goes through much of

173
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,640
the satipatana exercises there's a number of different

174
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,680
instructions of what to do the verb to what we're supposed to actually do here

175
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,160
and then but the most common one is to know so there's a few things that make this

176
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:47,200
uh exercise you know really rich one is in fact

177
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:53,760
this emphasis on knowing and uh and this idea of clearly recognizing what's happening when it's

178
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:59,839
happening in the simplicity of it the most simple aspect of it in the moment

179
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:05,839
independent of any relationship to anything else so

180
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,400
at the moment i'm feeling comfortably but i feel a little bit cool

181
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:19,520
the windows are open here in this room it's a little bit cool outside so i feel cool so i know that i'm cold

182
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:26,800
i could add on top of that why is the cold in the room maybe the windows are too much open

183
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:32,320
i wonder how long the windows have been open how long should i sit here being cold

184
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:39,040
and maybe i'll get chilled if i stay here too long and so all that commentary and questions which might be reasonable

185
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,039
in some circumstances but what it does is that

186
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,440
it can take us away from the most simple relaxed

187
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:58,320
present moment awareness of the simplicity of just being feeling a little cool

188
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,920
feeling cool coldness and and feeling it in and of itself as if

189
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:09,119
it deserves or to be respected for what it is in and of

190
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,680
itself you know it is in a sense also can be seen as a message that i should pay attention maybe if i

191
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:23,040
was really cold but uh it just um uh but to be just to as if it's worth

192
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,800
worthy of just knowing for itself because what we're doing here in

193
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,240
mindfulness practice is going in a different direction

194
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:40,160
than the mind usually goes uh so all those concerns i have why is the

195
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,359
windows open how long can i sit here um you know those kinds of questions

196
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:51,280
imagine that those are like um the horizontal plane of life

197
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:57,839
and the in the mindfulness is the vertical dimension in

198
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:03,520
a sense that it allows us to penetrate and go deep so the simplicity of just knowing

199
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:10,880
something like cool coldness in and of itself is a doorway to a deeper entry into that

200
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,240
experience to really penetrate and see deeply into the experience

201
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,680
until we start seeing something that's liberating and freeing in that experience

202
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,280
and so the idea is to really be there with that in a but not to when i use the word

203
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,119
really being there i can imagine some people steal themselves up and they're going to try hard but this is meant to

204
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:39,920
be very trusting the very simple relaxed knowing

205
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,119
so to know when you're walking you're walking

206
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,160
means that you're not distracted you're not thinking about all kinds of issues in

207
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,520
your life and problems you have or wonderful things you can contemplate

208
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:00,720
as well the mind thinking is a fine thing to do

209
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,200
but there's also something wondrous about the times we can go really simple

210
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,200
and just know i'm walking now the in the in the horizontal mind

211
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,640
that has many concerns and interests that can get boring very quickly

212
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:25,440
but in the vertical mind that can go really deep it opens up to something really special

213
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,200
the first time that i experienced that in my life was uh really experienced in some

214
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,400
palpable strong way was when i lived for uh was about 20 21

215
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,240
i lived alone for a week on a farm and i'd never been alone for that long

216
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:49,119
didn't talk to anyone for the week and or see anyone really um and um

217
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:56,000
and uh i wasn't meditating but it was kind of like uh

218
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,640
as the days went along uh everything started to glisten everything started to be

219
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,640
this clarity to it and i would see something you know i see an object and it was like it was

220
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,920
shining if i had a thought the thoughts were just kind of like

221
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:19,520
um like a wonder

222
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:25,760
to see if there's a thought arise it was a clarity to it that i'd never experienced before it didn't really

223
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,000
matter what i was thinking it was just this clear thinking and there was all this space i guess and stillness and

224
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,240
quiet around which i can just have this very simple knowing of each thing

225
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:45,280
and it was life-changing for me it's one of the conditions that probably led to me being here and teaching

226
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:50,960
was appreciating and valuing this intimacy and clarity and simplicity and

227
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:58,000
brightness and vibrancy of just being present in the moment for this little thing

228
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:04,480
and knowing it and so that felt like maybe deep

229
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:11,039
and um so um the um

230
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,359
so to know you're walking as you walk to know where you're standing as you stand

231
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:26,960
to know you're sitting when you're sitting to know when you're lying down when you're lying down

232
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:33,359
on on coming out of meditation when maybe you're somewhat settled

233
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:39,680
that could be almost second nature to stay that simple or it's not maybe not second nature but

234
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:45,760
it's a way of staying that simple as a way of continuing to live in some of the benefits and

235
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:52,240
in the practice of mindfulness before you kind of automatically or quickly get into the complexity of your life in your

236
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,640
mind but allow yourself to stay calm and centered and simple

237
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,680
one of the you know i talked last yesterday about tiknot han who recently died and one of the things that many people

238
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:12,560
remember him for is when he did walking meditation and people there was sometimes long

239
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:18,560
lines of people walking with him down a country road and he would just

240
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:26,079
go really slow and steady and there's something compelling about when you walk just walk

241
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:33,680
when you walk just no walking when you sit just no sitting

242
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,280
so um so i'll talk more about this second exercise tomorrow but for today i

243
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:48,720
wanted to emphasize um this the knowing quality and i'd recommend that if you can today

244
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:55,200
to um experiment and as if you know you you all know things

245
00:42:55,200 --> 00:43:00,800
easily it can be almost subconscious that you know something and you open your front door

246
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:07,119
and uh you didn't have the conscious idea there's a door there's a knob

247
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,960
this is opening the door you know you're you're it's kind of done an automatic almost

248
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:19,119
but see if you can stop doing things those kinds of things that are almost automatic

249
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,800
see if you can uh just open up a little bit more mindful

250
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:32,400
of them and see if you can find a way of recognizing door handle opening

251
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:40,240
in a very rudimentary simple easeful way that you see that in the knowing itself

252
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:47,680
there is freedom and then knowing itself there's not entanglement with what is knowing

253
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,720
that there's no before or against it's not automatic the for and against

254
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:58,640
the entanglement can be so integral to the very act of knowing we can't tease it apart

255
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:05,839
but see if you can begin teasing apart and just just know eating just eating

256
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:13,920
hearing a sound just hearing a sound and see if you can find some places where you discover something very

257
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:19,680
precious and special about the the human your human capacity to

258
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:25,520
know to recognize because if you start appreciating the freedom the ease the

259
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,880
peace that's found in knowing then mindfulness becomes a lot easier

260
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:36,480
and and you start developing something easier to receive some of the benefits that come

261
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,319
from doing ongoing practice and i see that there's a note in the

262
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:48,640
chat about wanting to see a copy of the suta that i'm reading for

263
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:54,079
the reason i haven't posted my translation is i want to redo my translation for this and i

264
00:44:54,079 --> 00:45:01,520
haven't had any time to do that a version that i did many years ago is on the imc website if you look under the

265
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:08,480
resource um menu and at that top bar and there's uh the writings and i think

266
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:15,280
there's a suita translations is one of the categories in the menu and there you find the satipatanosuta

267
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:20,480
and when i have more time hopefully in the next couple of weeks i can or soon i can

268
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:27,680
post my updated understanding of the translation

269
00:45:28,079 --> 00:45:34,640
so thank you thank you for being here and being part of this and

270
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,400
um and as we go slowly and steadily through this i hope that this text

271
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,240
will become more alive for you and richer and more

272
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:53,240
