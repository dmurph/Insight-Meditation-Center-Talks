1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:06,299
good evening welcome welcome it feels like the volume's just a tiny

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,460
bit low can we make it just a little bit louder so I don't have to project my

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:17,460
voice and I have to keep on talking maybe just a tiny bit louder there we go thank you

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:25,980
thank you Jim no just a little bit this it feels funny for me to be saying no higher lower higher good just right

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:32,599
okay so welcome welcome nice to see you all

6
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,840
so there's different ways in which the Buddha's teachings are conveyed or you

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,100
know kind of like described of the ways that they've been preserved sometimes they describe a path of practice

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:52,140
and it can seem like it's pretty straightforward just do one two three

9
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:59,160
four then Bang You're awakened but you know I don't think that's anybody's practice unfolds that way in this

10
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,220
particular sequence and in a way that's like so clear

11
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,799
or maybe there's a way in which the practice is described as a the goal of

12
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:18,240
practice that is nabana you know what Jim before you leave can we make it just a little bit louder because

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,659
I waited I'm sorry wait till you leave but I've noticed that my voice will probably go out by the end

14
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:32,180
maybe there's just can be a tiny bit louder just so that I don't have to there we go thank you

15
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,159
so it can be the describing the path of practice describing the goal of practice

16
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,299
or maybe they describe what is an ideal awakened person like what do they look

17
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:50,939
like with somebody who is awakened so these are these three different ways in

18
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:56,939
which uh the teachings are conveyed and when there's these qualities or

19
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:02,460
characteristics of an awakened person there's this way we can feel like

20
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:08,880
wow I'm not like that I I don't think that I will ever be like that I'd like

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,720
just there's this sometimes the Buddha is described with lots of colorful languages or the our Huts you know

22
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:22,560
talking about purity and Perfection it might feel like there's a way in which it's easy to be

23
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:30,739
dismissive like okay well that was thousands of years ago and I can't even relate to what they're talking about

24
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:38,099
not only that there's this way if they describe the Buddha as the sometimes they call them the Seer or the sage or

25
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:46,019
the Kinsmen of the Sun or destroyer of the dart of craving this can just feel conceptual and not

26
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:53,519
really helpful at all that we can't quite relate to it and instead it might just be feeding our

27
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,720
inner critic like oh that's how they are but I'm not like that

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:06,239
for all these reasons it can be really helpful to this for me to look at some

29
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,080
of these characters that are showing up in the suit does as having a hard time

30
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:21,060
not following this perfect path and they still become awakened

31
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:26,519
so I'd like to start with uh this a poem by uttama

32
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:35,400
this was a woman who was having a hard time and here's some teachings

33
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:42,000
practices and then becomes a weekend so what are the teachings that she heard

34
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
like what helped turn it around I think this can be useful and helpful to look at you know this seems like maybe a

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,120
little bit more of a real life for example something that's maybe a

36
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:02,480
little bit more relatable less just this conceptual and something that's maybe inspiring and supportive

37
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:11,040
so in my mind um uttama is living in a cootie these are

38
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,180
like small just really simple dwellings I know they have them now in Thailand that meditators monastics they live in

39
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:25,020
these very simple maybe and that's where they would meditate or maybe even live and then

40
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:32,040
like the meditation hall or the regular Monastery from the dining hall and all that kind of stuff would have been another place

41
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:38,520
so in my mind she's living in one of these little huts and trying to meditate

42
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,540
and this is her Awakening poem so she becomes awakened and it was the

43
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:50,820
tradition for some of these poems to be preserved and this is what uh how she

44
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:56,600
describes her own process so it goes like this

45
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:05,880
you know what before no also I could say this afterwards so here's utama's poem

46
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:12,180
four times five times I left my dwelling

47
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,780
I had failed to find peace of mind or any control over my heart

48
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:25,500
I approached a nun in whom I had faith she taught me the Derma the aggregates

49
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:30,440
the sense fields and the elements

50
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:37,800
when I had heard her teachings in accordance with her instructions I sat cross-legged for seven days

51
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:45,539
given over to joy and happiness on the eighth day I stretched out my

52
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:51,139
legs having shattered the mass of Darkness

53
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:58,680
so she received these teachings that enabled her to shatter the mass of

54
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,900
Darkness the mess of Darkness sometimes stands for ignorance but maybe it also even

55
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,840
sounds can be like the darkness this feeling of hopelessness like I can't do

56
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,240
this nobody else can do and do it you know she leaves this her

57
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,240
dwelling like she keeps on leaving and then she finally just goes and asks for help

58
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:28,199
so what were these teachings that she received

59
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,900
this poem says the nun taught me the Derma the Aggregates the sense fields

60
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,039
and the elements and I'm going to talk just a little bit about these

61
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:45,660
so these are three different ways in which we might consider The Human

62
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:52,440
Experience in the same way that today we could have said that the weather was

63
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:00,240
warm or we could have said 78 degrees Fahrenheit or 26 degrees Celsius now

64
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,960
these are all pointing to the same thing but they're using different scales different vocabulary but they are

65
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,740
pointing to the same thing so not something completely separate or maybe in the same way that there's

66
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:18,919
these different perspectives of modern psychology and maybe there's the

67
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:24,660
psychodynamic perspective or there's this behavioral perspective or the

68
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:29,759
cognitive perspective or the biological perspective right there's all these different ways in which we think of

69
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:37,259
modern psychology and they're taking kind of like the experience of a human and emphasizing different aspects or

70
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:44,940
looking at them through different lenses but they're all kind of looking at the human psychology

71
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:52,259
so in the same way five Aggregates six cent spaces four elements or three

72
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:59,400
different ways in which we might look at The Human Experience so just briefly I would say the five

73
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:06,060
Aggregates I'm not going to go through the whole list but first one is Rupa which refers to form

74
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:13,440
which can be pointing to like the body like the physical body and the other form other four or

75
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,440
different aspects of the mental experience the five Aggregates has something about

76
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:26,280
the body but something about the mind The Sixth Sense bases there's the these

77
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:32,580
are what are the senses we have four of them or the often ones

78
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:38,760
that we think about seeing hearing tasting smelling one of them is the body kind of like the

79
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,459
tactile experience and the sixth one is the mind so again

80
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:51,180
another way in which to look at The Human Experience the mind and the body

81
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:58,100
and then the fourth one are the four elements and then we'll talk a little bit more about this one

82
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:04,260
but I'm going to introduce them as Elemental qualities

83
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:10,519
which might be like a better translation or a better way to understand it

84
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:17,459
so these different ways in which the experience of the body

85
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:25,620
so we might say look at the solidity feeling the experience of solidity

86
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:33,360
say that's the Earth element we might look at the feeling or the experience of fluidity

87
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:39,180
we might say that's the water element look at the experience of temperature

88
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:45,480
hot or cold it's the fire element we might look at the experience of

89
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:50,959
motion or movement as the air element

90
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:59,420
and so these four elements solidity fluidy temperature motion

91
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:05,880
or we might say earth water fire air they are all independent on each other

92
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:14,220
right they are like adjectives they're like describing their perspective in which to look at The Human Experience

93
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:21,959
so in that way that they are all interdependent they don't stand alone there isn't like solidity just we don't

94
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:29,040
have solidity right it's the solidity of something in the same way that we have fluidity

95
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:34,440
it's the fluidity of something but in the body there's

96
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:42,120
of course all of these and we can look at it with these different emphases emphasizing the motion or the solidity

97
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:48,660
or the movement or something like this and so there's a way even when we hear

98
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:54,000
this word for elements that this might think this is like

99
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,640
too simplistic anachronistic and like oh isn't that cute back in Ancient India

100
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,740
they had four elements I think we have like 118 in the modern

101
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:09,839
periodic table I think I have that right if we're going to think about the body

102
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:17,820
we might you know for me trained as a biochemist I'm like well I know there's four more more than four in the body so

103
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:25,380
there might be a way in which we kind of like want to be dismissive and think okay that's odd I don't want to practice

104
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,720
with it it turns out working with these is

105
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:36,120
really powerful and I like to kind of like explore and

106
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:42,660
talk about these a little bit today so some of you may know the Sati

107
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:50,880
patanasuta that look maybe the primary sutone which points to mindfulness

108
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:58,519
and it has mindfulness of the body as the First Foundation is the first

109
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:06,060
support for mindfulness and within mindfulness of the body we find mindfulness of breathing which we often

110
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:11,100
talk about in often is like the first instructions that we would give a meditator is

111
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:18,060
mindfulness of breathing but under that same heading of mindfulness in the body is also

112
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:24,839
mindfulness of the elements and it uh when the Sati patanas who

113
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:30,560
decodes like this so One reviews this body

114
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,720
however it is placed however it is disposed so in whatever

115
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:43,019
posture it's in or whatever is happening with the body One reviews this body

116
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:48,839
however it is placed however disposed by way the elements thus

117
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:55,620
in this body there are the Earth elements the water element

118
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:03,959
the fire element and the air element okay pretty straightforward just look at

119
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:10,920
these four different elements but somehow I'll just speak for myself I just couldn't relate to this I thought

120
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:16,680
this just sounds odd but there's a way in which it can be really powerful and

121
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:24,420
helpful and one way is because if we look at these ideas of the solidity

122
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:33,019
fluidity temperature and motion then this points to shifting our ideas

123
00:13:33,019 --> 00:13:38,160
about the body to the experience of the

124
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:45,000
body and so often the ideas we have about

125
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:51,060
bodies in general or our own body or other people's bodies whatever it might

126
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:56,880
be it's a lot of suffering a lot of suffering associated with the ideas that

127
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,000
we have some of the obvious ones some of the

128
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:10,380
ideas are that well the body should have a certain appearance they should look a certain way

129
00:14:10,380 --> 00:14:16,380
and we have this entire advertising agency or phenomenon in the modern world

130
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:23,760
right billions of dollars being sent to make sure that we all agree on how bodies should appear

131
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,540
so much suffering so much suffering associated with this

132
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:37,560
but there's also this way that um we might also think that our idea about

133
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,500
the body is it's somehow like stable or constant it's always with us whatever

134
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:48,899
we're doing so there's this way we can't think yeah this is my body and it's like

135
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:54,720
this I have that look at this thing in my knee because of

136
00:14:54,720 --> 00:15:02,459
that accident that happens when I sit a particular way it hurts it's painful this is you know my body or

137
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:08,180
we might think like okay this is mine and it's separate from everything else

138
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:14,459
so there's a way in which we might there's a kind of kind of subtle but it can have an impact this idea of

139
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:23,519
being really isolated and distinct and separate like nope there's this that's here and then there's everything else

140
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,579
and this body is trying to manipulate and control things out there and things

141
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:35,639
out there or having impacts on this body and there's can be some tension with that there can even be some suffering

142
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:42,660
without some duka oh with that or there might be this idea that okay

143
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:48,720
because this is my body I should be able to control it I can choose to move my arm

144
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:56,699
but it turns out right we don't get to control it but they're so right this is a whole nother industry out there like

145
00:15:56,699 --> 00:16:03,180
this health industry eat this don't eat the exercise this way don't exercise that way do this first thing in the

146
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:10,139
morning do sleep this way right wow there's a lot thinking that we can control it

147
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:16,139
and in some ways you know there are some things we can control but really our body is not controllable

148
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:22,079
it's get sick it hurts

149
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:28,320
it ages we can't control this

150
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:34,800
and so the ways that we can control other aspects we think that you know maybe we can we should naturally be able

151
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,880
to control these other aspects but yeah so much Duke associated with our

152
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,399
ideas about the body

153
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:54,420
and so this today's we start looking at the solidity fluidity temperature or

154
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:00,920
motion we can move toward the actual phenomenological experience

155
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:09,480
what does it feel like to be having this bodily experience as opposed

156
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:13,459
to what our our ideas about it

157
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,760
so for example instead of thinking the abdomen is rising and falling

158
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:29,240
with the breath or my knees hurt or my bladder is full

159
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:34,799
instead we could say things like expansion and contraction kind of like

160
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:41,340
feeling the expansion and the contraction stretching and the release of the

161
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:47,400
stretch or say things like tingling

162
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:53,220
pressure you know these types of words throbbing

163
00:17:53,220 --> 00:18:00,780
really different feeling right feeling but it's a different uh emphasis to talk about

164
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:07,140
these because maybe they're more like adjectives or expressions of what's happening in

165
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:13,980
the bodily experience and when something important really happens when we start to use these types

166
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:23,160
of words expansion contractions throbbing tingling stabbing warm cold

167
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:29,520
we notice it's changing the body is changing

168
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,520
intellectually we all understand this we know there's aging we know that we're

169
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:42,120
not the same that we were a decade ago see it like just

170
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:49,740
free day at the is the most mundane life experiences anytime we tune into

171
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:55,200
these different aspects we start to see oh yeah yeah there was some tingling

172
00:18:55,200 --> 00:19:01,919
there before it's not really tingling now it's a little bit more stabbing or maybe the area where it was tingling is

173
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:08,760
now shifting around and then so this impermanent inconstant

174
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,280
nature of the body starts to become more and more apparent

175
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,559
is that a way you start to notice oh yeah I can't control this as much as I

176
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:25,080
thought I could and when the changing nature starts to

177
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:32,220
become more apparent we start realizing yeah I can't hold on to my the sense of

178
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:38,700
how my body is it just doesn't really make sense it's always changing

179
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:45,960
and in this way there's a certain amount of letting go there's a certain certain amount of no

180
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:52,440
longer grasping or clinging or demanding that the body be a particular way

181
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:58,919
so our relationship to our body's shifts

182
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:04,799
maybe we've been disappointed and angry or something but now it can shift

183
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:11,120
when we start to pay attention more to this the sensations

184
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:21,440
and of course many of you know that impermanence is one of the three characteristics one of the qualities of

185
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:28,799
everything essentially and the real deep understanding of this

186
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,020
can lead to a really deep letting go that leads to greater and greater

187
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:38,179
Freedom peacefulness and ease

188
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,059
but not only does paying attention to the elements in this way solidity

189
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:50,280
fluidity mature emotion but it also emphasizes

190
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:56,760
that we are not our bodies and you might say well of course I know

191
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:03,419
I'm not my body but there's a way

192
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:09,059
well maybe I'll say first this simile that the Buddha offered of it's kind of

193
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:14,940
a gruesome simulated it's often a little bit surprising to find this uh in the suit does but

194
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:20,700
it said this was you know how life was in Ancient India so the similes of to

195
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:27,059
imagine that there is a butcher who Slaughters a cow

196
00:21:27,059 --> 00:21:33,720
and then Cuts up the cow into the different pieces of meat and you know maybe there's bones and meat and liver

197
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:40,500
and whatever else they would sell and take him to the market and sell them

198
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:46,380
so they're saying well before the slaughtering

199
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:53,039
the butcher considered this a cow they took care of the cow they fed the cow they gave cow the water they took

200
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:58,940
care of it and then as soon as you look at it in terms of its parts

201
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:06,000
meat or bones or liver it's like really different they no longer think of it as a cow

202
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:13,559
so there's this way and when we kind of are like teasing apart the different elements the different aspects there's a

203
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:19,020
way it just kind of like shifts our relationship to it it's no no longer a

204
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:25,620
body but it's solidity and one way that we might think about

205
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:30,780
this also in modern times is like to imagine like

206
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:37,440
whose body would you like to have you can imagine anybody it's like anybody's body alive

207
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,900
or dead like who's if you could you know have somebody's body

208
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:49,760
who's would you have I'll give you a few seconds to think about this

209
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,380
so it turns out this is a trick question because

210
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:03,720
even the whole idea that you

211
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,760
could be in a different body suggests that you kind of think that you

212
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:14,760
are you know independent or some like like you could exist independent of your

213
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:19,799
body you know that it's that there you could you could still be

214
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:24,900
who you are but in a different so there is a way in which we often are

215
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:31,799
identified with our body or we think that somehow we're separate and unique

216
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:37,860
and somehow the body is different I don't

217
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:44,340
know it's just that we're not seeing the like the interconnectedness of it all so there's these many subtle ways

218
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:50,520
which we identify with the body and there's

219
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,820
so there's another advantage of looking at the practice of looking at the elements

220
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:04,020
is that the when we look at the self in terms of the

221
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:10,500
elements it helps um maybe break down this idea that we are

222
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:18,600
separate and distinct because of course not only do human bodies have solidity or emotion but you

223
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:24,600
know so does everything else in some regard then we could even say if we if we

224
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:31,020
instead of using solidity and fluidity if we change the words and say Earth

225
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:36,480
element and we could say that it stands as a kind of a symbol

226
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:42,659
for any type of hardness or softness in the body just as the Earth itself can be

227
00:24:42,659 --> 00:24:48,720
hard or soft so there's a way in which we can

228
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:53,880
experience the body is hardness and softness for the solidity

229
00:24:53,880 --> 00:25:01,679
or the roughness or the smoothness heavy or light

230
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:07,020
so for example right now or maybe you could feel just like the

231
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:13,400
heaviness or the pressure of the body against whatever it is you're sitting on

232
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:22,140
or you could clamp your teeth together and to feel like the hardness

233
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:29,520
and the tongue has some softness in comparison to that or maybe you could clench one hand and make your fist and

234
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,059
if you have fingernails you could feel the hardness touching the softness

235
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:44,520
so as we get more familiar with this quality we start to recognize that just as their equality solidity hardness Etc

236
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:51,179
there are elsewhere and not only that

237
00:25:51,179 --> 00:26:00,360
that you know the words just as their solidity Etc out there just as there's Earth element out there

238
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,059
there's Earth element here and when we die

239
00:26:06,059 --> 00:26:12,299
all the Earth element the plants and animals if you eat animals all of those

240
00:26:12,299 --> 00:26:19,620
all the earthness you know went into this body and then when we die of course it's

241
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:25,260
going to get returned to the elements right there's I appreciate I think it was West nisker

242
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:32,400
who said we're all made out of star stuff it's all going to go back

243
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:39,059
it's not so separate and I was just teaching a retreat and I

244
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:44,159
appreciated uh my co-teacher she was giving a teaching

245
00:26:44,159 --> 00:26:51,299
and she uh went to the kitchen and I've got the ingredient list for the dinner

246
00:26:51,299 --> 00:26:57,419
or the lunch or some with a meal that we had all just had and she read the

247
00:26:57,419 --> 00:27:03,360
ingredients and said you know this this this isn't I'll use her example here is

248
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:11,720
not how she did it but you know this is all the Earth element too the the lentils the cheese the

249
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:19,320
onions you know the grapes the olive oil all these uh ingredients

250
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:25,919
so it was was Earth elements and it was out she got cultivated and grown

251
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:33,779
and in some way we could just say you know now it's here just in a different container

252
00:27:33,779 --> 00:27:39,900
as it gets uh metabolized and changed right so the Earth element is still getting converted but it's still the

253
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:47,460
Earth element going through transformation and maybe turns from solidity to

254
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:56,580
fluidity and as things get metabolized but just this recognition that what's outside is also what we're made out of

255
00:27:56,580 --> 00:28:03,539
so the water element has fluidity liquidity as well as the

256
00:28:03,539 --> 00:28:09,840
opposite kind of like cohesion or stickiness and you might notice the fluidity in

257
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:16,440
your own experience around the eyes like we have tears and we can move our eyes because there's

258
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:21,539
this fluidity that allows that or of course the saliva

259
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:27,900
in our mouth and the water inside the body is exactly

260
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:33,720
the same as the water outside the body of course it is water is water is water

261
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:40,799
H2O and so the water of the rain is the same

262
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:49,320
as the water that's inside of us and when we die the water within our bodies well go down to the Earth or evaporate

263
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:55,520
and go up into the clouds condense and rain and be part of the rivers

264
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,640
and then of course the fire element which symbolizes temperature heat and

265
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,700
coolness and in the bodies we think about it as metabolism and digestion

266
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:13,760
and some might even say it's a type of Life Energy

267
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:20,000
so we could feel in our body and we were some places of warmth

268
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:26,760
maybe where parts of the body touch other parts this is of coolness maybe where that's

269
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:32,778
feeling that air conditioning come out we can feel the coolness on the air

270
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:41,299
so there's this way in which everything has temperature of course it does

271
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:47,399
I'm sorry yes

272
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:54,179
temperature I looked at my notes and I got a little bit confused where am I

273
00:29:54,179 --> 00:30:00,659
Air element is next sometimes this is referred to as wind an

274
00:30:00,659 --> 00:30:06,120
air element of course it's like the breath in and outer

275
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:14,898
even the gas in our GI tract also symbolizes movement

276
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:21,960
and you know and the way that we're breathing in oxygen and breathing out carbon dioxide

277
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:27,360
so again we're exchanging the elements these

278
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:31,880
qualities with the environment

279
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:39,860
and when this body dies of course the air is going to go back to the atmosphere

280
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:48,380
so uttama's Awakening poem here's somebody who had some difficulties

281
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:55,320
and it was with some of these teachings of kind of like deconstructing experience is what helped

282
00:30:55,320 --> 00:31:01,860
her find her way and so often that when we give in

283
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:09,480
teachings here I know it often on Retreat and certainly here with the introduction to meditation

284
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:16,200
program there's a real emphasis on mindfulness of the body but but that's not always

285
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:22,399
accessible for people I would say

286
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:27,480
the clear majority of people if I'm having a practice discussion with them

287
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:34,200
will say I'm one of those analytical people and I'm not quite so connected with my body

288
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:40,260
this is like such a common way that people talk about their experience

289
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:45,659
and so I was thinking that maybe think about the elements the fluidity solidity

290
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:52,260
motion might be a way to be tuned in to the bodily experience

291
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:57,360
in a way that's a little bit different because sometimes we are thinking about

292
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:06,899
the body and so to have some way like use this as maybe a entryway in

293
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:13,260
and then with the body we can see the that's not self that can lead to Awakening we could see that it's

294
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:18,720
impermanent that can lead to Awakening and we could see that there's suffering

295
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,640
Duca associated with it because it is always changing and we can't control it

296
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:32,000
so I'll read utama's Awakening poem again

297
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,700
four times five times that left my dwelling

298
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:45,360
had failed to find peace of mind or any control over my heart

299
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:51,480
I approached a nun in whom I had faith she taught me the Dharma

300
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:57,120
Aggregates the sense fields and the elements

301
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,799
when I had heard her teachings in accordance with her instructions I sat cross-legged for seven days given over

302
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:11,940
to joy and happiness on the eighth day I stretched out my

303
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:17,419
legs having shattered the mass of Darkness

304
00:33:18,179 --> 00:33:26,840
I think I'll end there and I'll open it up to see if there are any questions or comments

305
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:47,580
oh hi there thank you for your dog I have two questions can I have two

306
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:53,399
questions yes first question is that I don't find it relatable to a person who

307
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:58,880
were sitting for seven days I can see for now

308
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,019
right yeah but she was she stretched the

309
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:10,980
legs on the eighth day hi I'm for myself I'm interpreting this

310
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:16,138
as that she didn't didn't sit Non-Stop

311
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,300
oh okay um and the second question may be more

312
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:27,658
serious is that so I heard this explanation about this here element

313
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:34,080
um like this tradition they say that pay attention to the rising and the falling

314
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:41,820
of belly instead of like between the nose and the reason for it is because of this

315
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:48,599
Air element do you like know or understand what this is about I like heard something but like I don't

316
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:54,599
quite understand maybe I don't know if you know maybe you can explain a little better

317
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:01,980
so this is my understanding and it has to do with more kind of like the uh I'll

318
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:07,740
use this word political I don't know if that's right so when mahasi said I said okay to watch

319
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:14,339
at the um at the abdomen I don't remember all the details of this but whoever like the

320
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:21,780
more senior leaders of the the I guess this is in Burma the um of

321
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:28,200
the meditation said no no uh mindfulness of the body has to be somewhere has to

322
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:35,280
be done a particular way maybe here at that per lip or it made somewhere and then mahasi said no no no this is the

323
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,579
elements we're doing elements practice we're not doing bodies practice and that's why it can be different

324
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:46,680
so it was a workaround so that's this is what I've heard but whether that's true

325
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:54,559
I don't know thank you and maybe that's not very satisfying but

326
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,020
yes maybe you can pass it back there

327
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:13,380
I'm wondering if you could reread her comment about control of the

328
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:19,200
heart because I had sort of a odd reaction to that

329
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,140
um what what what what she was struggling with there

330
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:30,540
yeah so the expressionist I had failed to find peace of mind or any control

331
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:36,480
over my heart and you might know that that word for heart is chitta and could

332
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:42,240
also be translated as mind so have any control over my mind or or

333
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:49,680
control over my heart so it could be either or it could be both you could say heart mind or so

334
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,140
if that is if that's helpful well it's just I guess I understand you

335
00:36:55,140 --> 00:37:01,260
know the struggle for control of the Mind more than I do the other you know the control of the

336
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:07,320
heart so I was just kind of puzzled by that yeah in my mind I was thinking that

337
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:12,780
maybe there was like feelings you like the heart is maybe associated with some

338
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:20,099
emotions or something but we can interpret it whatever ways we find okay well it's good to know that

339
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:26,339
the the the heart and mind in this instance is kind of interchangeable yeah

340
00:37:26,339 --> 00:37:29,480
okay okay

341
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,740
anybody else have a comment or question or something they'd like to share

342
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:51,060
okay okay well thank you for your kind attention

343
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:58,640
and I wish you a good rest of your evening thank you
