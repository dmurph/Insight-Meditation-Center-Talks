31
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:37,519
this time I change the settings so that unmuting oneself won't be possible so the space stays quiet I change the chat

32
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:46,000
settings so chats only come to uh the host myself but I ask you to keep uh the

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,519
chat Channel quiet otherwise it can be rather distracting for me to receive chats while I'm teaching I'll open it up

00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:58,400
later for Reflections and last but not least is

38
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:26,320
you so so um yeah maybe a couple of themes I want

39
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:35,400
to bring in today one is uh one is the theme that uh it's the theme about uh

40
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,680
spiritual friends spiritual friendships and uh about good friends

41
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:47,680
actually about good friends and this passage in the sua was shared with me

42
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,840
earlier today by my good friend uh Diana Clark you know Diana when Diana and I

43
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:02,080
used to hold happy hour together for a long time so um so this is the what she

44
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,919
shared with me and we're both delighting in in this um teaching from the sutas

45
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:16,320
that neither of us um knew uh in in its significance so so um and you'll see why

46
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,479
in a moment it can it's relevant and significant so so this is from angut

47
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:30,120
nikaya uh 1113 and and

48
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:37,319
as you might have noticed um if you've been practicing meditation and the Dharma for

49
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:43,080
a while often the teachings you know taking refuge for example taking trust

50
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:51,800
it's in the triple gem it's the Buddha Dharma and Sanaa so Buddha both Buddha and also the the um

51
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,919
external Buddha internal Buddha which is our own called uh um ability having

52
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:05,960
trust in our own ability to work wake up so thinking of that as the internal Buddha and the Dharma as the teachings

53
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,960
the both the the um d uh the Dharma with capital D the teachings of the Buddha

54
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,960
and the Dharma with small D which is the unfolding the lawful way things

55
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:27,400
unfold and usually the third one is the sa the community of practitioners the community of of uh spiritual friends and

56
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:32,560
and people who have supported who support us and we can think of the S not

57
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,160
just as the S of practitioners through the 2700 years passing on the teachings

58
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,599
but also people who are practicing together right now for example on Zoom as our

59
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:50,840
community um Etc and PE people who support us so so what's what's lovely

60
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:55,919
about this this suta um is is that the

61
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,160
Buddha um talks about Reflections their beautiful Reflections

62
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:10,199
that that he talks about and then and then uh he gets to the uh recollecting

63
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:17,280
the realized one recollecting the teachings and then with the third one we kind of expect the usual we expect the

64
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,360
Sanaa right the community but he actually says furthermore you should

65
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:28,319
recollect your good friends isn't that sweet you should recollect your good

66

80
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,880

81
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:08,000
establishing mindfulness in externally and internally in the body with vad a

82
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,519
feeling tone mind States as well as the Damas this is another way this is you

83
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:20,000

169
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:42,559
small group practice today here is the invitation in small groups that we each

170
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:48,120
um as we go around each person offers one thing that you appreciate about your

171
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:54,799
good friend one thing and it could be so um you know one person would say I

172
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:02,360
appreciate that my good friend I'm think thinking about right now they also practice they also love the Dharma and

173
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:07,799
then everyone appreciates that and the next person offers one thing what I

174
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:14,800
appreciate by my good friend is that oh they're very kind when I'm sick they call on me and check in to see if I need

175
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:21,280
anything we honor and appreciate that that goodness of the good friend and the next person offers something and then

176
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,118
comes back to you maybe you offer something again what do you appreciate about the same good friend or another a

177
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:34,280
good friend doesn't you don't have to name them and tell a long story but just what you appreciate yet your heart be

178
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:40,240
uplifted and other people's hearts uplifted there's so much goodness in the world

179

181
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:03,640
yourselves be kind to one another and as you already know please um not a good

182
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:09,200
not not appropriate to ask questions each person is offering basically for

183
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:17,720
their own reflection and if you didn't understand what somebody said it's okay Let It Go not offering advice or or

184
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,839
asking questions just let it be it's an offering it's a stone soup we're creating together in this Wholesome Way

185
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:30,920
but just honoring everything everyone says so um yeah let let your heart be uplifted

186
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:38,200
from what people bring in so I'm creating the rooms be kind to yourselves be kind to others and let's go in

190
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:00,920
so much and and I'm about to open the rooms here so

191
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,240
we have some time for Reflections about the practice how this

192
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:14,800
was for you and um either the practice itself if you noticed um anything you

193
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:22,319
want to share with the Sanaa both for uh their benefit and yours to be

194
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:27,880
held witness you can also type in chat if you like if you type your Reflections

195
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:34,800
to me privately I'll only uh read your Reflections not your name and if it's to

196
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:43,680
everyone I'll read your name I see three hands up okay lots of Reflections all right let's let's uh hear from Leo

197
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:49,520
first I was wondering if you could provide more insight into that

198
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:57,359
wording what was it develop mindfulness internally yeah what's the other kind of

199
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:05,319
mindfulness I mean was that externally so what does that look like

200
00:37:05,319 --> 00:37:11,480
you you give me two examples how many hundreds do you want

201
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:19,839
Oh My Goodness I'll settle for one of each so so um in the Sati

202
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:26,920
PTA where a really a lot of teachings on mindfulness are pulled from are taught

203
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:34,079
from um and satian is the the establishment of the four foundations of

204
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:40,640
mindfulness as I mentioned at the beginning I'll say it again there are the four parts there's

205
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:46,359
the body mindfulness of the body mindfulness of um Vena feeling tone

206
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:52,880
mindfulness of Mind States and mindfulness of the Damas which is

207
00:37:52,880 --> 00:38:00,280
there's um kind of processes and and and and um um let's just leave it at that

208
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:06,480
and for each of these four the Buddha talks about say mindfulness of body

209
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:14,040
internally and externally so every single one of them there's mindfulness to be established internally mindfulness

210
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:19,280
to be established externally and then internally and externally so that's

211
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:25,920
taught in the reframe of the satian you might you're actually reading the Sati patan I was going to say right that

212
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:33,240
didn't help much but it gave me a pointer so I will go look at them yeah but maybe one thing that I can say is um

213
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:40,240
you know in the west we especially think of mindfulness or awareness let's use the word awareness always internal

214
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:46,000
always internal but it's not just internal it's both internal and external

215
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:53,119
and internal and external so so for example if you're um interacting with someone you you want to be aware you

216
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:59,599
want to be mindful in your speech in your conduct and you don't want it to be entirely internal you want to be aware

217
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,599
of their body language what they're feeling their responses so your

218
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:10,880
awareness is also external and it's also internal and external so you get that

219
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:15,960
you know that so does that help it does

220
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:21,480
great you're welcome Megan

221
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,480
please thank you um I was just reflecting the gift of

222
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:39,640
friendship um I and I hope I'm able to explain this uh well um for

223
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,880
me what has been wonderful is this friend not just

224
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:53,280
um accepting me as I am but also allowing me to show up for her and the

225
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:59,440
gift that it is when she lets me be there

226
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,200
um and and that it's that it's both and and I was trying to tell her this today

227
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,920
um because she was feeling overwhelmed by by my how

228
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:17,400
much I've shown up and and trying to tell her but it's it's a gift for me as

229
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:23,680
well thank you Megan thank you so much for br this into the space it is a gift

230
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:31,240
when others allow us to be generous with our presence with our kindness um

231
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:38,760
accepting that gift is is another Act of generosity on their part so yeah thank

232
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:46,359
you in absolutely yeah Helen

233
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:53,040
please hi um I um shared in my little

234
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,240
group about uh uh a a very special

235
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,960
friendship or love in my life um which is you know I have a

236
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:11,880
dog and uh I I'm thinking of two aspects

237
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:19,760
why I would say so because uh first of all the dog my dog sets an example for

238
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:27,160
me because she's always in the present moment you know and uh the second thing

239
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:34,119
is uh uh my dog I'm sure everybody else dog the same thing uh has the

240
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:42,520
unconditioned love for me and for everybody she is in contact with and any

241
00:41:42,520 --> 00:41:49,839
little thing I do for her she shows great appreciation I just feel like uh you

242
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,359
know she's the love of my life and um

243
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:02,560
she does a lot of things for me and she's my comfort my love and I really

244
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:11,400
appreciate having her thank you Helen oh my heart is so

245
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:21,160
happy hearing your love and care for your dog and and uh hers for you

246
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:28,280
oh yeah and yeah the unconditionality of the love to and from

247
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,400
pets yeah such a lovely feeling to um

248
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:42,000
inspiring meta and the cultivation of loving kindness and gratitude thanks for bringing our furry friends

249
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:49,640
in um friended oops wait FR you disappeared

250
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:58,160
before I could click on you to ask you to unmute where did you go you read there here

251
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:07,079
thank you Nikki uh I was thinking of um you know a close friend who's really involved in um

252
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:14,680
you know in practice and Dharma study and how wonderful that is to to have somebody to do that with but then I was

253
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:21,599
also thinking of friends who would utterly reject this idea and who would um have

254
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:28,640
no no sympathy and interest at all in anything that would be called spiritual or certainly Buddhist or any of that and

255
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:35,319
yet they they are great friends for for who provide all the um the love and the

256
00:43:35,319 --> 00:43:41,960
consistency and the and the sort of prodding towards uh trying harder

257
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:47,559
directing towards me the there's just so many ways in which friendship can

258
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:53,000
be can be laed to in our lives and it's wonderful to have a lot of

259
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:59,559
variety um and to to not have any kind of external

260
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:06,318
requirements beyond what the experience of friendship early is and that it's you know as long as

261
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:13,800
it's is there at a at a deep level and a mutually sustaining uh Arrangement then

262
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:20,400
it's all great so thank you thank you Fred thanks for sharing your your words

263
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,599
of wisdom about friendship then and what you shared is really the uncondition

264
00:44:26,599 --> 00:44:34,280
acceptance of of the Care um and the friendship that's there yeah lovely

265
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:40,559
couple of Reflections coming through mimo I'll get to you in a moment

266
00:44:40,559 --> 00:44:46,160
um see uh one person privately says

267
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:53,480
appreciate relationships from the past that have given that have Arisen and passed away

268
00:44:53,480 --> 00:45:00,000
yeah we making us who we are and supporting us Jerry says being silent

269
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,559
with kind thoughts while looking at someone can communicate a great deal of loving

270
00:45:05,559 --> 00:45:10,720
kindness yeah and uh so reflection

271
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,079
about um small groups which um yeah I I

272
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:23,280
want to bring this in um we we really do appreciate we do we do ask you not to

273
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:29,800
cross talk and especially if you know small group someone says I know we're not supposed to cross talk and yet goes

274
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:37,400
ahead and comments on something someone has said you know let's let's not do that let's let's offer a um safe and

275
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:44,240
protected space to everyone so really appreciate you um not doing that it's

276
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:50,839
and then that uh restraint actually that pulling back that um restraint is very

277
00:45:50,839 --> 00:45:56,760
helpful for everyone to feel safe in in the small groups and we really ask you

278
00:45:56,760 --> 00:46:03,920
to respect that even though it's so tempting to comment on what somebody else has said just

279
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:12,200
don't yeah so thank you uh one of you says my cat radiates
