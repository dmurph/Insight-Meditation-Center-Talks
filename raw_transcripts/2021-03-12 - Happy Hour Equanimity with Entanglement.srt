16
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:29,199
ah so let's get started why not let's get started together

17
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,120
whether it's cold or hot wherever you are whatever the time zone let's get into

18
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,639
the field of practice together so it's a time when i change the

19
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,759
settings so one cannot so that unmuting will go

20
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:52,320
away and great i waited for neil just long enough to post information about happier google

21
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,280
groups before i change the settings so the chats will just come to me if there's anything urgent so there's

22
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:07,039
some more quiet in silence during the practice session and no accidental muting

23
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,160
unmuting rather and preliminary is recording

24
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,680
to this computer for audio dharma great so welcome everyone

25
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,800
welcome to happier so so for today's practice we're continuing

26
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:34,880
to expand in the ever-expanding circles of um equanimity practicing with upeka

27
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,280
the fourth brahmavihara and as many of you commented yesterday a

28
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:49,120
more nuanced practice more nuanced than meta vicari or a meta or compassion

29
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:58,400
or or sympathetic joy and equanimity the sense of equipoise

30
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:04,800
caring saying staying connected to the being that we practice equanimity with and yet

31
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:11,759
with the sense of spaciousness a bird's-eye view of all the causes and conditions that

32
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,800
have come and contributed to what is arising so a sense of peace and ease holding whatever is

33
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:26,000
happening in their life in our life depending on whom we're practicing with

34
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:34,639
and we've worked our way through the concentric circles and for today's practice we have

35
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,199
found our way to the category of someone we have some challenge with

36
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:48,400
so practicing equanimity with someone we have some challenge with

37
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:56,000
this is an interesting practice and we might find ourselves surprised as to what may

38
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,360
arise so the idea here is to establish a sense of

39
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,680
connection first well actually first during the guided meditation we'll spend you know

40
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:14,800
about 10 minutes just settling in the body with the breath as we usually do

41
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:21,039
and then after we tell the soil of awareness settling the mind calming the mind

42
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:28,240
then we turn we open up to this being

43
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,839
with whom we have some entanglement with whom we have some entanglement

44
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:40,640
and then feeling into the per the humanity of this person

45
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:46,480
connecting with with how they too want to be happy just just like me they're not so

46
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:52,720
different and then withholding them with equanimity whatever is arising

47
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:59,200
in their life and then for this uh variation we'll also work with

48
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:04,640
equanimity for this entanglement that we have with the two of us which is another way

49
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:11,760
and another way that connemity practice can work with with the person we have challenges with

50
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:18,320
there's so many different possibilities but this is what we'll try and see what

51
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,920
happens cultivating cultivating okay so ready shall we try it

52
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:30,959
yes yes let's so

53
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:38,720
i like to invite us all to get into our meditation posture shift and move

54
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,000
ah settle in this body

55
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,839
landing arriving

56
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:05,839
in this moment in time

57
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:20,079
and this body connected to the earth feeling your feet relaxing into our sit

58
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:26,640
bones relaxing our hands

59
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,839
ah shoulders neck

60
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:42,560
face muscles of the jaw

61
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,839
the internal muscles of the face

62
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:12,399
letting the entire body relax ah dropping dropping

63
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,839
holding tightness

64
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:24,640
softening relaxing and letting the breath be received

65
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:32,000
intimately by the awareness touched

66
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:43,839
by the awareness in the lower body in the abdomen

67
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:51,839
as if the abdomen is an organ of perception an organ of perception perceiving

68
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:57,839
receiving the breath the in-breath of the opera

69
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,639
if you know this if you notice thoughts arising

70
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:07,839
smilingly i wonder if this thought is necessary right now

71
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:18,160
and whether it can come back later if it's important enough it will

72
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:23,279
and without any judgment letting go

73
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:35,120
as if opening your hand letting go of this helium balloon of

74
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,480
thought ah feeling lighter coming back to the

75
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:47,279
breath organ of perception the abdomen receiving sensing the breath

76
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,839
intimately

77
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:09,679
here right here

78
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:20,960
here and now nudging

79
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:25,039
nudging lovingly nudging

80
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:35,840
awareness to stay close here now

81
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,840
now i would like to invite it to bring to mind

82
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,200
while we stay connected to the body to our breath in the body the

83
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:16,960
physicality the groundedness of the body bring to mind someone we have some

84
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,760
entanglement with relationally

85
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:31,840
not the toughest hardest one but some maybe lower on the throngs of

86
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:39,520
complications entanglements bringing bringing this

87
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:42,400
person to mind

88
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:58,080
allowing ourselves to feel into first and foremost their humanity

89
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:07,520
not condoning the harm the challenge but that just like us just like me

90
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:14,399
this human being this person wants to wants to be happy

91
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,640
they don't want to suffer just like me just as i want to be happy

92
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,440
and i have hopes and dreams aspirations

93
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:33,919
they too have aspirations just as i experience

94
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:42,000
joy and laughter happiness just as i experience sadness

95
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,240
just as i suffer this person too

96
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:54,559
feels happy at times feel feel sad at times they've experienced

97
00:23:54,559 --> 00:24:00,320
sorrow and loss pain just like me

98
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:09,519
their inner life is just as compelling and just as complex as mine is

99
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:19,840
just as i have a full inner life full world

100
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:29,440
internally so does this person and their life is very dear to them

101
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,559
as my life is dear to me my happiness and well-being

102
00:24:42,559 --> 00:25:01,840
we are not so different in this respect this person tonight

103
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:15,840
bringing to mind for a moment the entanglement we've had

104
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:24,799
and saying if this entanglement in this moment could be held with spaciousness with a

105
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:32,400
lot of equanimity instead of pointing fingers blaming it's

106
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:39,919
their fault they're this way my fault i should have done this just for this moment seeing if there can

107
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:46,880
be a perspective of just spaciousness seeing all the causes and conditions

108
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:54,840
so many of them out of our control that have led have led to this

109
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:02,000
entitlement as if we had a bird's eye view and saw all the causes and conditions

110
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:08,840
so many things predating us even historical

111
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:16,080
familial cultural art jeans or upbringing everything that brought us

112
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,440
that brought us to that moment

113
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:29,360
of this two beings me and them being entangled in this way

114
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:37,200
as if you were sitting on the proverbial top of a mountain you could see all the causes and conditions

115
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:42,720
past present and all the people

116
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,480
all the cause and conditions holding this entanglement within the context

117
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:58,000
in a bigger context of both of your journeys in life

118
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,520
and offering the equanimity phrases allow for a few see which one works for

119
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,840
you

120
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:31,360
whether i understand it or not things are unfolding according to a

121
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:35,840
lawful nature

122
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:05,120
staying connected with your body with your breath

123
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:12,240
with each offering of this phrase as if you're breathing this phrase

124
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,840
phrase of equanimity

125
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:45,840
may we accept things as they are may i may you accept things as they are

126
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:55,679
or may we may i may you be undisturbed

127
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:13,840
by the comings and goings of things

128
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:05,039
may i may you may we hold this entanglement with spaciousness

129
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:09,840
equipoise equanimity

130
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:07,200
or the traditional equanimity phrase all beings are owners all beings are

131
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:15,279
owners other actions heirs to their actions

132
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:22,720
their happiness and unhappiness depends on their actions

133
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,840
not my wishes for them

134
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:17,838
this

135
00:35:56,839 --> 00:35:59,839
um

136
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,000
all beings have their own journey

137
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:19,839
whether you understand it or not

138
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:37,838
and for the last couple of minutes of this practice period

139
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,320
allowing whatever rose or didn't arise whatever arose in past

140
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:57,838
during this practice period this 30-minute set

141
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,559
let there be equanimity equipoise

142
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:11,279
okayness with whatever happened or didn't happen

143
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,839
not resisting not pushing away not attaching clinging

144
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:28,560
to having a spaciousness freedom of heart it was like this

145
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:35,680
it was like this may i accept things just as they were as

146
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:43,359
they are ah releasing letting go sense of freedom in

147
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:49,520
the heart of the conditions in this moment with respect to this practice

148
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:57,839
right here right now may all beings everywhere

149
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,760
have peace may all beings everywhere

150
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:10,800
have freedom of non-clinging

151
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:14,160
spaciousness in their heart

152
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:20,960
may all beings be happy including

153
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:33,060
ourselves [Music]

154
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,480
thanks everyone thank you for your

155
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:57,920
practice so i'm changing the settings

156
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:04,079
so if you like to chat with your reflections questions when you noticed you can

157
00:41:04,079 --> 00:41:09,119
either send them to everyone in which case i'll read out

158
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:14,240
your name or you can just send them to me in which case i won't say your name but

159
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,160
read the question the reflection you can also raise your hand to

160
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:28,400
share your reflections what came up for you what did you notice how what was this like for you

161
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:36,240
this practice of equanimity in this way or form the person we have some

162
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:49,839
entanglement with

163
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:30,800
something that i notice sometimes with the practice of equanimity

164
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:36,480
sometimes there can be a lot of quiet and silence there's too much

165
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,119
like not no desire to even talk because the heart can feel settled and peaceful and kind of equinimity like ah

166
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:50,720
i don't have to say that i've noticed that in myself i have to say that it's interesting

167
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:56,720
equanimity kind of gets into the space of [Music]

168
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:03,200
our thoughts of course and murray christine says the person i have a major entanglement kept popping up so it was

169
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:09,920
really hard for me yeah it can be even though of course the invitation is to start where it's

170
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,760
easier and not a major entanglement but with a minor one but of

171
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,440
course the major one it can be and i do wonder i do wonder actually uh mark christine

172
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,119
as challenging as it was whether actually that is as you're it could be the edge of your practice

173
00:43:27,119 --> 00:43:32,640
can i have equanimity can i hold this with peace can i have a sense

174
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:40,319
can i hold this comings and goings of this entanglement with just spaciousness things are like this right now it is

175
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:46,800
what it is it is oh yeah yeah thanks for adding that it felt so weepy

176
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:53,440
do you want to say it is it okay you don't have to but if you want to say more about the challenge you're welcome to and if not it's okay too

177
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,560
but yeah it can be challenging and maybe also having equanimity oh yeah i see

178
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:03,839
you're unmuted yourself so please yeah it was difficult because i was trying to just um

179
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:08,880
focus on the person with a very very small entanglement but the other one came popping up and

180
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:15,839
unfortunately as the other one kept popping up the pain and the hurt kept coming up coming up and i was a real struggle and

181
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:22,640
it made me feel at one point i thought i'm gonna switch everything off and start crying and i thought no no keep with the practice um

182
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:29,520
so it's brought up a lot of hurt for me yeah a lot of hurt and i miss emotional hurt

183
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:35,839
from the second with the major entanglement exactly i was trying to focus on the one that was really easy but it triggered the other

184
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:41,680
one and i wasn't able to contain it yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you for

185
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:47,599
sharing that yeah yeah

186
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:54,160
yeah and in that case it becomes a practice of compassion for yourself self-compassion no sweetie this is hard

187
00:44:54,160 --> 00:45:01,440
right now this is hard this is good i should have done that yeah this is hard right now and it's

188
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,880
okay it's never too late marie christine so i'm so glad you're bringing this up uh both for

189
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:12,240
yourself and for others because whenever new chat work hurting challenge comes up

190
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:18,480
please please feel free to turn the practice to taking care of your own heart with

191
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:26,240
kindness and compassion and then if there is enough stability then you can turn back to whatever the guidance is or not stay

192
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:32,240
with self-compassion for this for the entire practice this is what's called for great

193
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:40,000
let it be that's what's needed because it sounds like there's a lot of hurt in this this entanglement so maybe

194
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,520
that's what's called for uh to practice with self-compassion right now

195
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:51,520
thank you for your pills of wisdom ah thank you mark christine for your pearls of wisdom for being here

196
00:45:51,520 --> 00:46:00,720
and practicing and sharing sharing yeah thank you

197
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:08,240
nikki do we have time for one more share we do please oh hi my name is dorothy and

198
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,839
this is the first time i've shared at group level but i wanted to say thank you so much for the reminder

199
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:21,359
that um the person that comes to our mind um that their actions is really what's the

200
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:26,800
cause and effect of how their life stands out and it's not our wishes for them because

201
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:34,000
i have a very very dear friend that i have a wonderful relationship but there are some entanglements and there's some wishes i

202
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:40,480
have for him just even a basic thing like he's able to be in the age range to get the shot

203
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:45,920
right now but he chooses not to and much bigger and deeper things that i wish for him

204
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:53,680
but that my risk wishes really have no um effect on

205
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:00,319
his life because it's his own choices so i want to just thank you so much for the reminder of that

206
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:06,960
yeah yeah thank you so much dorothy for bringing this up and sharing

207
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:15,200
in in community and really fleshing out how important this reminder this um

208
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:22,319
equanimity phrase really this this teaching equanimity that and that is the traditional phrase that i offered

209
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:28,480
how important that is that yes um people's happiness and their

210
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:35,200
unhappiness is dependent on their actions and not what they choose their actions their karma that's the

211
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:42,800
same word really it's it's what it's their their their actions in the world and no matter how much we wish for them

212
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:47,920
to be well it's part of the biggest bigger cause and condition so we can still

213
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,119
care for them we can still hold them with with care and dearness and

214
00:47:53,119 --> 00:48:01,200
not take it on as our responsibility um but but

215
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:08,079
yes it's it we must fix it it allows us to stick to stay in

216
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:16,480
relationship with them with care without toppling into it or or um yeah

217
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:22,000
letting them have the space they need on their journey so thank you so much dorothy

218
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,119
thank you yeah great

219
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,079
yeah great we do have time for maybe one more

220
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:48,880
reflection if anyone has any before we go into to turn turn into group practice

221
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:52,960
nicholas please

222
00:48:53,920 --> 00:49:00,480
oh there we go um yeah there there is a sense of happiness maybe kind of some some guilt

223
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,760
or i should have done something differently and considering the small entanglement

224
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:13,599
and it's just interesting that the impulse is to try to lighten the load but with equanimity there's a

225
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:21,200
sense of just having a more solid foundation that can carry the load underneath it instead yeah

226
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:28,640
nice beautiful well said equanimity really providing this

227
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:35,520
stability where this load can be carried without it kind of needing to be lightened up or analyzed

228
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:42,960
it's like oh it can be carried it can be just as it was in this moment and be held beautiful thank you nicholas

229
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:47,920
really appreciate your reflection yeah

230
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:57,200
great so dear ones let's turn our hearts to each other

231
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:04,319
and take this practice into small containers of

232
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:11,760
small sangha small group practice so the invitation is for the first

233
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:18,640
30 seconds to share meta just kindness for the other people

234
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:23,680
in the group in silence may you be well fellow human being just

235
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:31,040
like me have entanglements and you suffer we all do and feeling their meta for you

236
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:37,680
and then share as little or as much as you wish about your practice and support each other and what you

237
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:44,079
um again respectfully and what i mean by support is not to give each other advice that's not what i mean at all

238
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:51,520
you support each other by sharing from your own first person experience when you share this is what happened for

239
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:59,200
me that is the way you show up and you support each other um and when you just listen without

240
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:06,720
judgment without trying to fix it fix the other person or make it better for them but you just

241
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:11,920
listen you offer your ear with equanimity and care

242
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:19,040
then you're supporting each other so supporting each other in just showing up showing with meta showing with

243
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:26,160
equanimity with for each other which is profound practice really profound practice not trying to

244
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:32,880
get in there metal and just and that is the practice of equanimity so i'm inviting you to practice

245
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:38,960
equanimity for each other relationally with care

246
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:45,599
and just listening just listening just listening not trying to fix it

247
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:52,400
not turning away by jumping into just listening with care okay and as you'll

248
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:58,880
see this is profound practice it might push your edge you may want to offer something if the person says they were hurt

249
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:04,000
but stay on the edge and see if you can just hold it with equanimity and then you can

250
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:10,480
take it to your friends and relatives and just offer care without entanglement getting entangled into

251
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:17,040
what's happening for them so so let us practice in this profound way

252
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:22,079
together and i hope you don't hop off and

253
00:52:22,079 --> 00:52:29,520
here we go i'll create the rooms and they are

254
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,839

255
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:11,838
hi everyone welcome back so how was that what did you notice

256
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:27,838
i'd love to hear from you your reflections this way of practicing holding space with equanimity

257
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:39,839
and experiencing with equanimity and care space being held for you

258
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:47,359
emily says it's always amazing to me how much connection can happen in five

259
01:01:47,359 --> 01:01:56,319
minutes yeah yeah thanks emily

260
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:06,079
i see nods and hearts

261
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:11,280
of you are welcome to un unmute yourself bill says talking to others seems to be

262
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:17,920
its own type of therapy for me [Laughter] yeah there's nothing like practicing in

263
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:23,440
sangha it's so powerful so powerful

264
01:02:23,440 --> 01:02:31,119
so powerful that's why in buddhism it's one of the three jewels the three the third jewel

265
01:02:31,119 --> 01:02:37,599
is sangha is community so profound so important

266
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:44,240
anybody else wants to share today

267
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:49,599
nice to hear somebody else's voice pelosi says very grateful for this

268
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:56,640
community [Music] maybe someone who usually doesn't speak

269
01:02:56,640 --> 01:03:03,359
so much or hasn't shared in a long time would love to hear your voice how how

270
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:10,000
did you find it how was it anything what did you find about your practice

271
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:17,839
be lovely to have you share of yourself if you would

272
01:03:39,839 --> 01:03:46,480
susan says mammals need to connect i had an embodied moment where i realized any glimpse of

273
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:51,520
equanimity proceeds my having let go of something ah

274
01:03:51,520 --> 01:04:00,480
nice thank you susan thank you for sharing that insight beautiful

275
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:11,520
glimpse of equanimity proceeds my heavy letting go let go of something

276
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:16,640
and i also wonder whether it can happen the other way around too whether

277
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:21,920
equanimity can precede letting go or something so bring that up

278
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:27,119
as an inquiry

279
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:33,599
happening both ways yeah so dear ones we have come to the end

280
01:04:33,599 --> 01:04:41,280
of the hour of practice together always grateful so grateful for you showing up

281

282
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:53,280
