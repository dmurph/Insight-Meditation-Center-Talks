1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:09,240
good evening welcome welcome nice to see you

2
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:18,320
all so tonight I'd like to start with a setting a little scene that happens at

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,760
on the Buddha's deathbed he knows he's going to die so

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,759
he asks for a special bed to be made for him between these trees

5
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:38,360
out in a on the outskirts of a town and then right before he's ready to

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:43,600
die just moments before he

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,039
asks he has this question that he asks and the quote is from this if even a

8
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:58,920
single monastic has any doubt or uncertainty concerning the Buddha Dharma

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,400
or SAA or the Dharma I'm sorry or the path and the

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,799
practice ask do not afterwards feel remorse

11
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:15,280
thinking the teacher was there before us and we failed to ask him when we were in

12
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:22,880
his presence so maybe he was thinking like this is the real thing I am going to die this is your last chance you have

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,759
you have any questions there's so many things here that is you know it seems maybe mundane

14
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,880
but but it's kind of special in some way he's not saying okay I only want to talk

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:42,479
to my little Inner Circle as I'm dying right he's not saying that and later on that it talks about there's 500 people

16
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,680
there there's 500 monastics and he's saying is anybody out there have any

17
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:56,520
questions doesn't matter if they're just like a somebody who's newly ordained or the most senior he's like to have any

18
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:04,799
questions but then he also qualifies it do you have any questions about the Buddha Dharma SAA and the path and the

19
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:10,119
practice and I'll talk about this a little bit more like what are some of the questions that he didn't think were

20
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,920
so suitable at this time so he's kind of like confining it

21
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:22,440
to okay do you have questions about what I've been teaching what uh all this teaching has

22
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,840
really been about we could say you know suffering and the ending of

23
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:35,560
suffering Buddha said this on a number of occasions that was all his uh teachings were oriented this way and we

24
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:41,800
could say Buddha dmaa path and practice is about suffering and the end

25
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:48,159
of suffering and maybe in the fact that

26
00:02:48,159 --> 00:02:55,480
he's saying this on his deathbed moments before he dies makes it uh kind of like

27
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:02,840
highlights that he wanted there to be Clarity he wanted people to understand and it wasn't like he was trying to be

28
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,360
enigmatic and have secret teachings or anything like this it was more like okay

29
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:13,760
I've offered what I've offered is it clear do you did you get

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,400
it and then monastics in response to this question say

31
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:28,480
nothing it's silent then he asks it a second

32
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,720
time it's still silent and then he

33
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:44,080
asks perhaps you don't ask out of respect for the teacher so let a friend

34
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,519
tell a friend I kind of like this like I'm asking for a friend is this blah

35
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:56,959
blah blah right you know this goes all the way back to the time of the Buddha this whole idea and it also kind of like highlights

36
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,920
you know we talk about this you know having community and having friends in the Dharma and this is part of you know

37
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:09,000
we often don't think about this but maybe there's a way in which we have a question and we don't feel comfortable

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,159
asking but maybe one of our friends does and they could ask but I don't know I

39
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,280
appreciate this very much the Buddha saying okay maybe you're embarrassed or May for whatever reason just tell

40
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:25,000
somebody else and they can ask it like he really wants to make sure that people

41
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:32,000
understand he wants them to ask questions if there's anything that's not

42
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:40,000
clear and they're still silent so nobody asks a

43
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:48,120
question and then Ananda who was the Buddha's attendant um said wow it's amazing that

44
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,600
nobody asked any questions and the Buddha says to

45
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:02,120
Ananda which I it's for me is a little bit perplexing but we we won't get into that uh Buddha says to Ananda well

46
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:07,280
that's because everybody of these 500 people have at least the first degree of

47
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:15,560
Awakening which means that they no longer have doubt so that means they have enough clarity about all the

48
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:21,720
teachings that um that they don't feel like they need to ask

49
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:28,520
questions and then maybe in a subsequent teaching I'll say like the next sentence he says which is the very last sentence

50
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:34,919
he says and then dies but I'm not going to talk about that one to right now I want to stick with this idea that that

51
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:41,080
Buddha he was asking like okay what are your questions this idea that he's uh

52
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:47,400
supporting and encouraging this whole notion of asking questions and he's

53
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,960
pointing to one way we could think about it is saying that uh having some understanding on suffering and the

54
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:00,440
ending of suffering is important and it's important for all of

55
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:05,720
us to you know understand it in a way that we can

56
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,840
and if we don't understand it to ask questions or maybe

57
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:19,440
investigate because he didn't this in contrast is uh a teacher that might say

58
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,639
okay here are these Creeds uh memorize them and you're

59
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:30,960
good to go you know just like you know here's something memorize it and who cares if you understand it you you just

60
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:39,319
have to memorize these things no he's saying you need to understand and if you don't ask so this

61
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:46,080
is so different than just kind of like passively receiving information and then just buying it

62
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,360
wholeheartedly and it's so different than just being told okay just memorize

63
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:59,599
or believe these particular statements and that's sufficient it's a really different way of a a spiritual teaching

64
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:04,639
it's a really different way of uh engaging with one's spiritual life

65
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:09,680
especially at this time in India it was a radical

66
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,960
idea to really um discover for oneself and to engage with

67
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:23,360
oneself and uh in another uh Su the Buddha talks about that there's these

68
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,000
communities where there's a people who don't ask questions and people who do

69
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:34,879
ask question questions and he says those communities in which they ask questions of each

70
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:40,360
other is the foremost Community it's the community that's doing the best and he

71
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:47,000
says um they question and examine each other asking how is this what is the

72
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:54,280
meaning of this and they discuss what is obscure and elucidate what is unclear

73
00:07:54,280 --> 00:08:00,319
and dispel their perplexity about perplexing points

74
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,479
so if there's any confusion this encouragement to ask one another even if

75
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:13,000
not asking the teacher so as I was saying there's a way

76
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:20,240
in which having a question really points to some involvement some engagement with

77
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:27,759
the teachings in a way kind of like rolling up our sleeves and kind of like really thinking about it or getting into

78
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,440
it as opposed to just uh hearing maybe

79
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:41,279
is that is that right well just hearing things does often just touch our hearts too but there's like practices to be

80
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:46,440
done and um contemplations perhaps and

81
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,560
cultivations and you know so there's a certain amount of Engagement and questioning is part of it

82
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:58,880
but also questioning even if you have a question like underline that is this

83
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,519
assumption that there is a logic behind it like why

84
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:09,880
is that what is this that implies that there's an answer to those questions as

85
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:16,920
opposed to somebody saying okay well this is just magic believe it and uh you're good to go but if you're asking

86
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,959
questions is this uh understanding like okay well what what's the reason for

87
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:29,040
this and what led to that and what are the consequences of this going to be and how do you know and how can I know these

88
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,680
types of things which I appreciate very much of course right I'm trained as a

89
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:40,760
scientist so I love this kind of stuff like I kind of like to I don't know like

90
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:47,680
understand things it's a I come from a family of scientists so this is just you know kind

91
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,519
of the the way that I was socialized and so it feels comfortable and fun for me

92
00:09:53,519 --> 00:10:00,920
and familiar it doesn't have to be that way for everybody but uh for me it is

93
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,360
but also asking questions suggests that uh that you're willing to hear an

94
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:17,279
answer that is you're willing to learn something you're willing to say I I

95
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:24,839
don't know you're willing to be told something by somebody else I've known a number of

96
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:31,000
people and perhaps you have too who really don't want to learn anything from from anybody they already have it all

97
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,320
figured out and they're all happy to tell you all the answers but they're not

98
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:42,040
going to admit or even suggest that you know I I'm not clear about this point

99
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:48,600
here I have perplexity about this point let's talk about it do you understand it

100
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:54,120
I'm not sure and maybe I'll say that uh for me

101
00:10:54,120 --> 00:11:01,800
personally a big part big part of my kind of like path of practice is I had the Great Good Fortune to meet um a

102
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,800
number of people uh when I was first starting on this path of practice and we

103
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,839
sometimes would like go to Pete's Coffee that's not just a right over here and we would just like wow what what was that

104
00:11:14,839 --> 00:11:22,240
did you get it what do you think and we would just talk about it it was so much fun to kind of like just talk about these ideas and and I know here on

105
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:29,880
Sundays I think they do that on some Sundays that's done on Zoom I think it's done in person on some Sundays

106
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:36,120
also I'll play around if maybe we want to do that here in some of these days but sometimes it's just nice to talk

107
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,880
with other people about some of these ideas because it's different right when

108
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:48,600
you hear yourself saying things out loud like when you have to uh create a sentence and put a group of thoughts

109
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:54,000
together you realize kind of like where some of the gaps of the knowledge

110
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:59,120
is sometimes happens to me I'm reading the sutas I love reading the sutas and

111
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,880
um sometimes I'll say to somebody else like oh there's I discovered this new little teaching that's has X Y and Z

112
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:14,959
it's often it's skill I'm telling this to you and he'll say oh but what about a b and c I'm like oh H I didn't think

113
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:20,839
about that yeah and then just realize oh yeah put it in context and add it on to

114
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:27,120
some other teachings it's it's a way in which uh we make the teachings our own

115
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:33,399
and make them come alive instead of just passively receiving

116
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:39,600
information so this whole idea of asking questions maybe it's obvious but um I'll

117
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:48,959
say it explicitly it helps us with doubt like this hindrance of doubt doubt

118
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,639
can show up as a hindrance when it's a shows up as this vacillation or this

119
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:02,760
hesitation like I don't know I'm not sure I I I don't know what to do

120
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:08,160
and we find ourselves kind of stuck a little bit like some obvious examples or

121
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,279
if you sit down to meditate and you have this idea okay I'm going to do mindfulness

122
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:20,519
meditation you do a little bit of mindfulness and then you notice that that you're actually pretty grumpy and

123
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:25,720
then you think okay well I'll do some loving kindness meditation and then you do a little bit

124
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:32,560
of loving kindness you know a few minutes oh no that doesn't seem to be working well maybe I'll just do like listening meditation opening up and to

125
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:38,600
the sounds yeah okay I don't like that sound of that dog okay maybe I'll come back to the breath and this way of kind

126
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:44,720
of like this doubt is a way of which we kind of like hesitate and we don't know and we often are just like bouncing

127
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,759
around whereas if we had a little bit more I'll use this word

128
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:56,959
confidence that we could we would uh say okay yep the mind is a little bit uh

129
00:13:56,959 --> 00:14:02,880
busy right now and it's I'm grumpy and that's just how it is right

130
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:12,240
now and we would just hang in there and then we would have the opportunity to see how the mind just settles on its

131
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:18,480
own if we give it time sometimes we have to just give it time but often we have

132
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,880
this uh um impatience or it's uncomfortable what we're experiencing so

133
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,399
we want to do something else so that's one way that doubt shows up

134
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:35,759
another way that doubt shows up is like I'm not so sure about this lineage

135
00:14:35,759 --> 00:14:41,279
of Buddhism it seems like they're having more fun over there the Tibetan Buddhist people they have colorful things and fun

136
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:48,240
hats and different words and you know all this stuff and the Zen they have this beautiful aesthetic right with this

137
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:53,399
kind of like Simplicity and this beauty so there might be like this real

138
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:59,959
hesitation about even this particular lineage or this tradition that could be doubt also

139
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:08,000
there could be doubt in the teacher does she really know what she's talking about any teacher Dharma books me

140
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:15,959
sitting here you know whomever there can also be doubt about oneself like okay it seems like this is

141
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:22,240
a good uh tradition seems like the teachers seem

142
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:30,079
reasonable and it makes sense to me the teachings that I hear but I don't think I can do it I have to go find something

143
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:36,120
easier or something else that's another way that doubt shows up and the

144
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,920
teachings the teacher or in oneself and so this

145
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:49,040
um doubt so that's doubt as a hindrance but there can be doubt that's really

146
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:56,920
healthy and helpful and this kind of doubt it could be this one of hm I'm not

147
00:15:56,920 --> 00:16:04,959
sure and then there's a thing like a thinking of okay what is this specific question what is it that I'm not sure

148
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:10,839
about and to kind of like pinpoint the doubt or you know like uh make it uh

149
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:18,519
more specific instead of just a hesitation or a vacillation like do I have to believe in

150
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:24,199
rebirth for this tradition what do they mean when they talk about not

151
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:29,880
self or was a Buddha really awakened are there awakened people to day I don't

152
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:36,639
know I'm just saying these questions that sometimes people have but it can be helpful to really kind of like um even

153
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:44,440
like write down okay what are the questions that I have and then to go back and look at

154
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,519
those questions and and see okay which one of these questions if I had an

155
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,920
answer would really support my practice because some of the questions are maybe things that we would like to know but

156
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,680
whether we know the answer or don't know the answer may not impact us very much it's more of a

157
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,959
curiosity but is there a question that really has a impact on your

158
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:15,600
practice on you the way that you show up for yourself for this

159
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,240
practice which one is like the most significant for you

160
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:27,558
personally I know for me one that I had uh earlier I felt so touched by the

161
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:36,200
teachings and it uh really spoke to my heart and meant a lot to me and when I started to read the

162
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:41,720
sutas most of the uh individuals not all of them but most of them are

163
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:47,679
monastics and I really felt like oh gee okay if I want to be serious about this

164
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:54,240
I guess I have to shave my head and give everything away and go live in a cave or something like this I didn't really

165
00:17:54,240 --> 00:18:01,840
understand what monastics were but this was a real concern of mine like I I didn't want to you know shave my head

166
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:08,080
and become a nun and you know live in a monastic lifestyle somewhere and a

167
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:14,919
somewhere you know far away or something like this that just didn't really interest me I have a family and you know

168
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:22,320
to take care of and you know these types of things so I just asked do I have to

169
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,840
ordain is that how one is becomes a serious practitioner here and the answer answer was a really

170
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:35,400
resounding no at the at the time of the

171
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:40,919
Buddha it wasn't possible to attend a day long there were no like meditation

172
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:46,000
centers where you could go and meditate there weren't books that you could read

173
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:54,640
there weren't uh things that you could listen the only way that you can have the teachings is if you heard them by

174
00:18:54,640 --> 00:19:01,320
somebody and if you are a monastic you are more likely to actually hear them if you weren't a monastic you were most

175
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:07,600
likely busy all during the day doing what one did in Ancient India to

176
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:15,559
survive so it's just like very different now now we have so much more Leisure Time and we have a lifestyle that uh

177
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:21,039
allows people to go on Retreats or come to a meditation center in the evening so

178
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:27,159
just in case any of you had that question to you about the need to ordain some people feel really cold and want to

179
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:32,200
dedicate their life and want to ordain and that's beautiful but it certainly isn't

180
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:39,200
required and maybe I'll just say also as it happened for me I ended up spending

181
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,799
one year which I was spent more time on Retreat than off Retreat so this is

182
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:53,120
something that I could do not as a monastic right just as a lay person just a I had the great Good Fortune my life

183
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:58,240
at that time allowed me to do that so there's a way in which I think in modern

184
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:04,640
times if you're want to dedicate your life to practice there's many ways in which one

185
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,320
can do that but it might be you know worthwhile

186
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:18,840
to ask well in what way does doubt or questions or unresolved

187
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:24,880
questions affect my practice maybe it doesn't affect my practice or maybe it

188
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:31,880
does maybe there's a way in which it holds you back this could be a question to ask

189
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,679
oneself excuse me so then this whole notion of

190
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:43,039
questioning is we might say is part of Investigation D

191
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:52,080
Vaya some of you will know that uh investigation is one of the factors of Awakening so one of the elements that uh

192
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,799
is a part of the whole Awakening process it's a we might say a necessary part is

193
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:05,360
this investigation again it's the opposite of just kind of passively receiving or just

194
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:11,640
believing it's instead actually kind of being curious and being present for

195
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:18,640
what's actually happening and what is the meaning behind what's said what is

196
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:26,960
it what's what's being pointed to with the words with the sentences with the stories what's being pointed to what is

197
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:33,960
it that they what's the meaning trying to convey not just the exact words but what's the

198
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:41,400
meaning and so investigation is the second factor of Awakening it comes um

199
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:47,919
after mindfulness and so it's part of a helps lay the foundation that can lead

200
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:54,039
to it leads to equinity which is the seventh of the seven factors of Awakening I'm not going to go through

201
00:21:54,039 --> 00:22:02,200
the whole list here but which is a big part of help creating the conditions for these uh big Awakening experiences a big

202
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:08,240
shift in one's perspective a shift in

203
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:16,240
one's I'll just use this word perspective of have of the of uh the way

204
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,158
of viewing the world and viewing

205
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,840
oneself and so there's a way of which uh

206
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:34,559
investigation can be something like um just asking in meditation or in everyday

207
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:40,880
life just dropping in the question what is

208
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:47,840
this seems like a simple question like okay it's a a bowl or it's could be a

209
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:54,840
hat or it could be a bell or it could be a an ornament it can be a weapon you can

210
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:01,880
throw it right it it's all these things but this idea just to ask like well what

211
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:10,159
is this what or yeah what is this and then there's a way to just drop in the

212
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:16,840
question and then open up and an answer might Bubble Up it

213
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:23,559
might not bubble up but the point is to ask the question not to find the

214
00:23:23,559 --> 00:23:31,840
answer it's the being the open and receptive that uh changes the we might

215
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:38,120
say the ecology in the mind and the heart this this uh willingness to learn

216
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:43,400
something new this willingness to have a new understanding this willingness to

217
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:48,559
let go of the idea of like okay I got it all figured out I just have to keep on

218
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:54,919
doing this or something like that and to be sure often we want to feel safe and

219
00:23:54,919 --> 00:24:02,279
in order to feel safe we want to feel like okay I know everything I got it all figured out here I know what it is

220
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:08,240
or but there's a way in which we can be like closing down or shutting ourselves

221
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:15,400
off from maybe some surprises or some unexpected or some maybe settle things

222
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:21,159
that could be really helpful for us to understand understand about the world

223
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,919
understand about ourselves or maybe another way

224
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:33,080
investigation can show up is what's underneath this or why am I

225
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:40,799
doing this just not again not to find the answer but just to open up to having

226
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:46,919
some curiosity about what are some of our patterns it could be like I don't know

227
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:53,039
why I do I'm doing this I always do it this way or it could be well I now that

228
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:59,720
I think about it I guess I'm doing this because I really really dislike it and I'm hoping this is going to go away this

229
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:08,159
thing or this experience is going to go away so I'm bracing myself against it or I'm

230
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:16,480
uh yelling or I don't know whatever it might be whatever it might be so just to have some Curious curiosity about why we

231
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,640
do some of the things that we do it's kind so like asking this kind of

232
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:26,960
question why am I doing this because there's a way in which our

233
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:32,480
patterns I mean there's a reason why we have them but we don't have to be stuck with them

234
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:39,200
for our whole life they can be undone and that's part or loosened up and

235
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,840
softened and that's part of what meditation practice allows is for us to

236
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,320
allow the mind to get quiet and not being pushed around so much and then we

237
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,760
can start to see some of our patterns with more clarity and then we can start to

238
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:05,760
recognize is oh it doesn't have to be that way I don't have to respond with

239
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:13,720
anger every time that I'm feeling uncomfortable or I feel like I have to wait for something and my impatience

240
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:18,799
makes me feel angry at uh whomever it is I perceive is causing to make me wait or

241
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:27,399
something like this so there's this way that um

242
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:34,760
investigation is the factor of Awakening and it can also uh be a

243
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:42,799
hindrance in the sense that um it's a way in which a version often can hide

244
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:48,480
behind what is this you know this kind there's this tone that's okay I got to

245
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:54,600
figure this out so I can get rid of it there's this or I'm only asking what is

246
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:01,679
this so that it'll go away and maybe if I ask it enough times this thing will go away I've done a lot of that in my

247
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:09,640
practice thinking like okay I know what I'm supposed to do and and I was you know questioning or investigating and I

248
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,840
didn't even recognize how I had this little agenda I think uh Joseph Goldstein he told me this one time and

249
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:24,720
it was very impactful he h said well you're investigating with a in order to mind

250
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,320
you're only asking in order to make it go away or in order to have a different

251
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:37,200
experience there isn't a completeness of just asking for asking so this is part

252
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,679
of the way in which investigation can be uh just a way that aversion shows up or maybe greed shows

253
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:50,960
up maybe you're only asking because you want more of something else or something like

254
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:59,240
this so there's this way that can we just ask or investigate again just kind

255
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,279
of just for the act of

256
00:28:04,279 --> 00:28:10,640
asking instead of like always pursuing something where we feel like we have to find the answer we have to solve a

257
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:18,120
question we have to fix a problem there's a way in which just asking allows us to

258
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:23,760
just kind of like open up and be curious about what's

259
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:32,039
happening and then here's a a quote from Michael phen who actually I don't know

260
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:37,679
who this is because somebody else that I was reading quoted Michael thalen so

261
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:46,960
whomever Michael thalen is I bow to you but here's this quote answers don't arrive if you are

262
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,519
afraid of sitting in the empty Dark Room of not

263
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:59,399
knowing so there's this way of sitting in the empty Dark Room of not knowing

264
00:28:59,399 --> 00:29:06,640
that's when answers can arise and sometimes this empty dark room feels

265
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:12,880
uncomfortable but I think that's the invitation here is maybe to you know

266
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,799
find the spaciousness and the beauty that's present in not knowing all the

267
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:24,840
answers something different can arise something new can

268
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:30,679
arise something else about investigation is that it can turn into I sometimes

269
00:29:30,679 --> 00:29:37,039
like to call this like an archaeological dig like we're just trying to figure this out and maybe it's because that

270
00:29:37,039 --> 00:29:43,000
thing that happened when I was eight years old and then my mom did this and my brother did that or you know there's

271
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,559
this way in which we can really try to figure it out and do kind of like a psychological

272
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:54,480
dig that has value and it has its place but that's not what we're doing with

273
00:29:54,480 --> 00:30:01,919
meditation meditation is doing something really different it's just asking what is this and it's

274
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:07,200
allowing things to Bubble Up it's not digging trying to find them because

275
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,440
that's more rumination or or contemplation or something that's very

276
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:18,159
different than um investigation but because they're both questioning maybe

277
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:24,559
there's a way in which they can get conflated and we can feel like oh that's what I should be doing while my eyes are

278
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:31,880
closed and I'm quiet is trying to figure this out but I would say in this tradition that's

279
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:39,320
not what we do during our meditation we're just creating the conditions for the answers to find us we don't have to

280
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:46,360
find them and it's quite something it's quite something how this happens we all

281
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:51,840
have this experience where like in the shower like oh right and figures that

282
00:30:51,840 --> 00:31:00,799
out or out for a walk or something like that it's the same type of thing where things just uh the answers

283
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:12,399
arrives so maybe I'll also say that not all questioning is

284
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:18,600
useful not all questioning is useful there is

285
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:25,080
a in fact there's a these 10 questions that the Buddha he didn't even bother to

286
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:33,919
answer he just didn't even think that they were worthwhile and I I'll just say

287
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,360
um and he didn't answer them because he thought you know this has no bearing on

288
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:45,080
supporting one's uh suffering and the lessening of suffering if you want to

289
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:56,840
understand suffering and your particular suffering suffering in the world and how to alleviate or diminish or delete

290
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:02,799
suffering it wouldn't help with that and not only would it not help with that but

291
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:09,840
it also had these assumptions underneath it that would lead person the wrong way

292
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:18,399
it would just coming from a point of view that uh would not be supportive an example is something like

293
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:24,679
this do unicorns have green eyes or blue

294
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:30,399
eyes right it doesn't help you with your suffering or not and it just assumes that

295
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:35,639
unicorns have eyes that they exist you know all these kinds of

296
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:42,519
things and sometimes when we hear these 10 questions that the Buddha didn't bother answering we might not understand

297
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:49,120
these um or appreciate maybe some of the assumptions that underly them I won't go

298
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:57,320
through all of these 10 questions I have in some other talks and maybe I will again at sometime but um two of these

299
00:32:57,320 --> 00:33:04,279
questions are is the world Eternal is the world

300
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:09,919
infinite so is the world Eternal talking about time does it have a beginning does

301
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:17,320
it have an end and then implicit in that question is it only matters if there's a

302
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:22,360
self or a soul or something that would last forever otherwise it just is a

303
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:30,519
completely irrelevant question so there's this assumption underneath it that there's some continuity of a of a

304
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:35,760
of a being through time and the same with a infinite it's the same idea with

305
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:43,279
space too that's only a relevant question if it assumes that uh an entity could go

306
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:51,679
through all space or something like this so the Buddha he was pointing to

307
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:58,279
that uh some questions they're just lead there's like e

308
00:33:58,279 --> 00:34:03,600
help don't help uh with suffering and not only that that they we could spend a

309
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:10,200
lot of time worrying about them or thinking about them we trying to figure them out and they're not

310
00:34:10,200 --> 00:34:16,040
answerable and they might even be causing us more suffering and he really wanted to

311
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:23,040
highlight that going down that road isn't the road that's going to help us with our life and this is part of why

312
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:29,720
with meditation practice with this practice we're really focusing on What's happen Happening Here and Now like

313
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:36,320
what's knowable for ourselves here and

314
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,520
now that's the beauty and the power of this practice it's really about what all

315
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,599
of us as individuals can discover for

316
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:53,720
ourselves each of us for ourselves it doesn't

317
00:34:53,720 --> 00:34:58,159
require some special

318
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,160
um teachings or some special maybe it doesn't require

319
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:12,720
anything special it does require practice though I will say that it does require

320
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:18,599
practice so this whole idea of questioning AB

321
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:27,160
Buddha right on his deathbed was does anybody have any questions and he talked about uh in how

322
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,440
community that question one another and spiritual friends who support one another with questions are an important

323
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:40,599
part of practice and it's one of the factors of Awakening this investigation this questioning mind this uh approach

324
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:46,520
to not having the answers but some questions are more

325
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:53,200
worthwhile than others so it might be worthwhile for us to see are there some questions that we have some doubt that

326
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:59,119
we have that is affecting our practice is affecting our

327
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:05,160
engagement with the practice and if so you can read a book

328
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,640
listen to Dharma talks ask a teacher ask other people with these questions and

329
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,720
find some answers that hopefully can support you in your

330
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:23,760
practice so I'll end there and I'll open it up to see if there's some

331
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:28,040
questions thank you

332
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:45,880
let's see is this on oh yes um well thank you for this talk it

333
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:52,720
definitely uh feels like an invitation to ask something that I've been wondering about for a while but I

334
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:58,480
haven't asked because I didn't want to be like challenging or kind of come off the wrong way um I

335
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:05,079
think something that has given me pause at times has

336
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:10,520
been the conversations about um like desire and

337
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:16,119
diversion um because well I came to the practice um

338
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:21,760
feeling very like out of touch with myself at first um and found that as I

339
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:27,520
meditated I started to develop actually more awareness of my own uh desire

340
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:35,359
desires and aversions and uh you know the boundaries that I need to move in the world and things like that um

341
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:42,640
and I find those things important to know um

342
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:48,720
especially like as a feminist and things like that where where are those boundaries what do I say yes to you know

343
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:54,480
um and I guess I to distill it into a

344
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:59,800
simple question Maybe there's a part of me that's just like

345
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:05,640
what's wrong with those things what's wrong with desire or aversion uh or

346
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:10,920
both yeah do you have a sense or does it seem like they're all good or does it

347
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:18,560
seem like there's any downsides um I mean they can go too far

348
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:25,200
they can be um you know obsessional or sort of uh

349
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,640
compulsive um some aversions I would say I definitely ruminate about

350
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:38,640
you know my desire to avoid certain things um yeah so maybe there's a

351
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:45,079
line yeah so what happens often is that uh we have an experience and then we

352
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:51,680
have a reaction to that experience desire or aversion and then we're often moving through this like desire

353
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,480
inversion and we're completely lost contact with actually what the experience is but instead we're having a

354
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:03,000
relationship with I like this I want more of it therefore I got to do something this and then in the future I

355
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,079
got to remember to stop at this door and do this thing or like oh I don't want to make

356
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:14,119
this happen Okay so I got to make sure I got to do this and I got to do that so there's this way in which uh desire and

357
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:19,440
aversion kind of like disconnect us from what's actually happening can disconnect

358
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:27,079
us from ourselves and kind of like insulate us from what's happening in the world or that's part of it is is that

359
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:33,040
help yeah yeah that makes sense thanks yeah and then maybe I'll just say one thing

360
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:40,359
about desire there is a desire you know for greater Freedom less suffering that's really healthy and helpful and

361
00:39:40,359 --> 00:39:47,760
then there's desire you know to protect oneself and have boundaries really healthy and helpful and stuff like that

362
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,440
yeah hi I have a related question um

363
00:39:54,440 --> 00:40:02,760
that I've been wondering about which is well how do you let go of clinging or desire without any

364
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:09,079
aversion toward it yeah gets a little complicated doesn't

365
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:17,800
it no it's well it can it's not the it's not letting go out of aversion it's more

366
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:23,440
um letting go because this recognition that this isn't going to be a source of

367
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,359
lasting happiness just like oh yeah this isn't I thought that uh my having this I was

368
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:35,640
going to have the best Bell ever and it was people were going to be so impressed look at Diana she's a great Dharma

369
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:42,359
teacher because she has a good Bell so I better have this Bell but then when you realize oh no that's silly then it's

370
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:48,240
easier to let it down it's Let It Go and so there's a way in which our identities

371
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:55,920
are often I exaggerated it for that point but our identities are often associated with

372
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,400
um object things people and so the letting go is

373
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:08,040
more about um not having our identities uh associated with them does does that

374
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,440
make sense yeah that's helpful thank

375
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:21,520
you maybe I should have left more time for questions if I gave a talk on questions I didn't think about

376
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:28,160
that thank you I mean it's an interesting talk and and so I have a question about questions okay

377
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,800
uh so um uh assuming that uh it very rarely

378
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:42,359
happens that one asks a question and gets an answer and that's life-changing it can happen but as you pointed out in

379
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:49,400
your talk real answer sort of bubble up uh over time probably practice several

380
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:56,880
years and suddenly there is a one question is answered and two more years and another question something like that

381
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,920
uh however questions seem to be valuable for

382
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:08,599
practice and there are other traditions where students question each other or

383
00:42:08,599 --> 00:42:15,440
students and teachers question each other back not so much to get an answer but as practice and I wonder does IMC

384
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:21,839
have something like this I'm not familiar with the practices yeah well not so much in the mindfulness uh

385
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,640
tradition we don't as much but there is um

386
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:34,880
I that would be more like talking about a uh a topic and then the teacher might

387
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,680
say well um during your meditation drop in a question and they'll like suggest a

388
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:48,920
question that would be a support for whatever topic they're teaching about specifically so it's not often given as

389
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:54,000
a as a practice itself and certainly not like a practice there isn't uh

390
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:59,359
anything like that here but so sometimes questions are but it's more dropped in

391
00:42:59,359 --> 00:43:04,319
drop them in and then I'll see if anything bubbles up kind of

392
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:11,599
thing anybody else have a

393
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:22,680
question there's maybe back there and that will be

394
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:30,760
that um can you say a bit about what Buddha meant when he said uh you know

395
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:37,400
those 500 have reached the first stage like would there be any actual indicators one is you said no doubt

396
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:43,640
right no doubt about the uh are other specifics where one can say you I have a

397
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:50,040
similar question regarding also like you they say oh entering the stream right yeah at what point do you feel like I'm

398
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:55,599
in the Stream that kind of Yeah question yeah so there stream enter stream

399
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,880
enterers right is the first stage and uh the tradition holds um that

400
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,760
there's uh the ending of Doubt but what's uh most evident you can see is uh

401
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:12,920
people's their identity view has shifted so their sense about themselves is

402
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:18,599
really is different in some kind of way and that's noticeable and the Third Way

403
00:44:18,599 --> 00:44:24,240
is no longer believing that rights and rituals alone will be sufficient for uh

404
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:30,760
greater Freedom so that's the the three marked changes that happened with that

405
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:33,520
uh first

406
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:46,119
shift okay okay well thank you all for your kind attention and I wish you a

407
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:50,799
lovely rest of the evening thank you
