1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:07,740
okay welcome welcome folks uh appreciate seeing seeing your names

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:15,000
over there um yeah welcome to the uh the 8 A.M session

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,640
here and uh I thought

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,480
Gil and I made a mistake but actually eight o'clock is a more dignified time

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:35,280
for me to speak and so um yeah you all are benefiting from uh

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:43,140
the pharmacodynamics of caffeine better profile uh

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:50,360
and uh I am awake so uh let's uh let's sit together

8
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:36,560
stay tuning attuning to the present

9
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:54,438
tuning to the present in the way we might attune to another human being in front of us

10
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:22,040
to attend to another human being is to uh to cultivate

11
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,140
empathy

12
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,780
to clarify the the landscape the inner landscape of the other it's

13
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,780
Attunement

14
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:51,560
to be responsive to the inner landscape of the other

15
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:07,739
and of course meditation is a kind of self-directed

16
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:13,080
empathy Attunement

17
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:16,580
this pool of affect of feeling energies sloshing around

18
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:34,460
of emotion that calls out for its objects

19
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:50,240
and so a surge of of feeling in the body effect

20
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:00,479
and then a kind of interpretation of what it means for this moment what it means for my life

21
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:06,379
for what I must have what I must rid myself of

22
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:53,160
so much of our thinking proliferation

23
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:04,940
is like a smoke Rising off of the engine of affect

24
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:48,720
where always reading the the Tea Leaves of our

25
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:50,959
body

26
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,620
coming to conclusions about what we

27
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,820
want and don't want

28
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,320
so natural adaptive to be able to do this

29
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,640
some of the time

30
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:50,779
but fatiguing for our heart to do it all the time

31
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,300
and so here in our practice

32
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:14,820
as the energies of our body surge

33
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:21,720
and swell and Bloom and collapse

34
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:27,420
where

35
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:39,560
practicing not over interpreting any event not making it mean too much

36
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:52,019
treating all of the urgency that are feeling life creates

37
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:55,760
as a kind of false alarm

38
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:59,820
for so long we've made our our feelings affect me in so much so

39
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:07,260
many things so many objects

40
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:16,459
born of that feeling so many plans and strategies

41
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:26,120
of acquisition of removal

42
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:44,240
but now our our feeling or affect means one thing

43
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,160
so often

44
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:57,019
suffer

45
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,539
foreign

46
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:54,679
early Pleasant means good

47
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:58,399
unpleasant means bad

48
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:06,740
but uh

49
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,880
in our practice we

50
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:22,400
Revere all experience for its capacity

51
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,780
to soften our heart

52
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:20,539
in the pleasantness we we abide

53
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,820
rejuvenating our heart

54
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,860
truly resting

55
00:21:41,159 --> 00:21:48,720
letting the the Dharma saturate

56
00:21:57,059 --> 00:22:01,580
in our their unpleasantness

57
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:10,460
we let the imperfection

58
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:20,419
soften the somethingness of ego

59
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:38,100
we call it purification

60
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:12,299
staying empathically connected to yourself

61
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:19,860
to experience to the the richness of our

62
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,000
feeling life

63
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,080
foreign

64
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:38,720
foreign

65
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:48,720
okay

66
00:29:53,640 --> 00:30:01,740
um that's good to say with you so I I saw some some chats about the

67
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:08,279
cyclone and Gill and ajin sachito and I have not been in touch with Arjun sujito

68
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:14,159
Nancy's been in touch with with Gil and I reached out to uh the retreat center

69
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:23,179
and they're safe and sound they're still posting to uh to Dharma seed actually so

70
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,799
yeah so excuse me

71
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:49,020
so I I was um was talking talking with a uh a yogi

72
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:54,600
after a retreat and they said um said something like

73
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:01,080
uh you know I'm suspicious of spiritual teachers who who lack a sense of humor

74
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:06,179
the lack of a of a sense of humor usually means they haven't reached deep

75
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:14,039
into the mystery that's what they said and for a long time

76
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:20,039
I thought the Dharma with serious business

77
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:25,759
and Dharma teaching is even more serious

78
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:35,000
so I'll uh I'll tell you how I got my nickname Captain buzzkill

79
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:40,919
I I have a lot of joy in my life

80
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:47,100
but little excitement even things that I wind up enjoying a

81
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:52,140
lot I'm not I'm not excited about in advance and that's not because I'm like

82
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:57,960
trying to be all Buddhist present or whatever that's just probably more

83
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:03,000
temperamental or something and um

84
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,279
and my brother is kind of the reverse younger brother more on the excitement

85
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:14,100
side and uh he was this is years ago he's telling me

86
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:21,000
something that he was excited about and I kind of was like what on the first

87
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:26,279
Noble Truth is still true whatever and

88
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:33,000
he's just like you know who you are you're Captain buzz kill that nickname is kind of kind of stuck

89
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:38,940
with me um and so

90
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:45,419
um so today today uh theme of uh playfulness

91
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:53,700
and humor that's uh that's next on my fake list uh

92
00:32:53,700 --> 00:33:00,740
Monday surrender yesterday humor playfulness today

93
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:08,940
so there there is this sense that um that the intensity and the poignancy of

94
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,399
life is somehow In Contention with the humor of it

95
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:22,320
that it is incompatible in some way but one of the gifts of Buddhist practice is how

96
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,360
quickly even strong forces

97
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,640
can move through US leaving sort of no Trace

98
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,159
and opening us to a very different next moment

99
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:46,019
poignancy and then Delight grief and then

100
00:33:46,019 --> 00:33:52,620
humor and the seriousness the seriousness is

101
00:33:52,620 --> 00:34:00,059
is often driven by ego which is I think by Nature serious

102
00:34:00,059 --> 00:34:05,279
the the kind of Hallmark of ego is a subtle kind of defensiveness and

103
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:14,580
territoriality and the ego definitely doesn't think it's funny but but it is

104
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:22,020
it is it can get tight it can get tight in there and certainly in retreat

105
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:29,398
my meditation my Insight my samadhi my Enlightenment it

106
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:37,500
gets serious and yet this is a long path a deep path and

107
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:45,080
playfulness humor is needed at various points along the path

108
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:52,618
so what are the what are the characteristics of of playing

109
00:34:52,619 --> 00:35:01,099
what are the characteristics of playing to play in the way a child plays

110
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,040
there's non-vigilance we we cannot be playing when we're

111
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:14,640
patrolling everything there's uh

112
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,780
an absence of self-consciousness we play we play

113
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:27,240
in the absence of of that congealed sense of self

114
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:33,660
you kind of can't can't play you can't play If you're trying to look cool

115
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:41,760
right or smart or whatever you cannot play right it's a performance and play

116
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,900
is not a performance play is the kind of inclusion of our

117
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:55,880
of our whole being at ease with ourselves in a kind of flow

118
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,500
yeah it's a beautiful thing to see a child at play it's a beautiful thing for

119
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:06,660
us to play and we're not it's intrinsically

120
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:13,200
rewarding we're not we're not getting anywhere we're not we're not building towards something

121
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:20,119
we're playing uh

122
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:27,359
winnicott uh psycho psychoanalyst pediatrician said um psychotherapy

123
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:33,180
takes place at the overlap of two areas of playing

124
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:39,839
that of the patient and that of the therapist Psychotherapy has to do with two people

125
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:45,180
playing together where playing is not possible the work

126
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:53,339
done by the therapist is directed towards beginning the patient towards bringing the patient

127
00:36:53,339 --> 00:37:01,700
from a state of not being able to play into a state of being able to play

128
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:10,400
a state of not being able to play into a state of being able to play

129
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:18,079
and a lot of the that can be said for the Dharma too

130
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:24,000
where can you play where can we play

131
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,720
where can we not can we

132
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,180
play with our foibles

133
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:41,300
play in the zones of clinging

134
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:46,099
way even maybe with our shame

135
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:54,420
as um as the egoic framework becomes less and

136
00:37:54,420 --> 00:38:00,540
less of a kind of organizing factor in our lives we open

137
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:07,740
to to humor and play because a lot of what is painful in the presence of ego

138
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:13,760
is playful in its absence

139
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:23,820
as we we come to to take ourselves less seriously we can we can play with the

140
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:30,720
conventions of self with who we think we are we play with it

141
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,720
in other words we become the joke and it feels good

142
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,180
feels good I

143
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:47,700
I've always loved when people make fun of me somehow well I mean not when I was

144
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:54,839
like in middle school or something but if they're making fun of me with with

145
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:00,839
love it's a it's a delight and um

146
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:05,880
and just and making fun of myself there's Delight there too

147
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:13,260
actually and it's not like a casual making fun I'm

148
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:22,400
like really actually making fun of myself but from Love From Love

149
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:29,880
the Buddha says something like you know don't deprecate yourself when you're teaching and I I get that but I I am

150
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:34,160
making fun of myself from Love

151
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:41,900
and part of how we can relate to our

152
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:47,040
defilements is actually through some sense of humor

153
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:52,380
and there's a kind of in our playfulness there's a kind of

154
00:39:52,380 --> 00:40:00,599
relief we release some of that that affect you

155
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:08,280
know sometimes affect can re it can really I was pointing to it in the the set like it can go more than one way

156
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:14,700
it can become shame or pain or something or can become humor

157
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:17,700
viteness

158
00:40:23,099 --> 00:40:31,740
where can we play where can't we and where we can't it is a signal it is

159
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:37,980
a kind of signal a little warning light of egoic

160
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:47,240
seriousness but our path is both serious and playful

161
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,020
I went to this uh a kind of Workshop a

162
00:40:55,020 --> 00:41:00,420
sort of more breathing kind of more more kind of pranayama-ish sort of practice

163
00:41:00,420 --> 00:41:06,300
with a couple friends just years ago and uh a couple other Buddhist Buddhist

164
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:12,660
people and it was not a Buddhist practice but um

165
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:18,900
um I got into to a very kind of interesting mind state that I

166
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:26,760
had known I think it was a 90-minute session and we were made we're in the dark and we're breathing and maybe an

167
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:33,839
hour in I think we were lying down an hour and I start to hear

168
00:41:33,839 --> 00:41:43,760
um this woman next to me start crying and uh it's just the the kind of

169
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:51,240
um poignancy of it brought tears to me I didn't didn't you know we had met very

170
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:56,820
briefly I didn't know who she was but but okay I'm hearing crying oh yeah I'm

171
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:03,440
gonna be crying too and I start crying and uh

172
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:10,440
coexisting perfectly in perfect harmony with that with those tears

173
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:15,480
that kind of empathic connection of whatever she was feeling

174
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:21,060
was humor not laughing at her for sure not

175
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:29,059
laughing at myself but humor and laughing deeply deeply

176
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:35,280
and coexisting with the the tears and with the humor

177
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:40,320
was this abiding peace

178
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:46,940
as if I were miles beneath the surface of the sea

179
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:56,339
so still and yet convulsing with laughter with

180
00:42:56,339 --> 00:42:58,880
tears

181
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:07,460
and this is our life

182
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:25,160
so way may we um yeah maybe

183
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:33,060
find the coexistence of um of grief of seriousness

184
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:39,599
of earnestness of play of humor lightness

185
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,520
and keep going

186
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:51,839
okay it's good to be with you so uh

187
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:59,520
will gather back again tomorrow I wish you uh wish you all a good day

188
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,740
and uh appreciate being being with you in this

189
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:07,339
