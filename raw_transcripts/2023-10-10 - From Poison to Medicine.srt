1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:10,040
welcome welcome everyone can I have the volume just a little bit higher it sounds like a I

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:16,880
don't want to have to be yelling and then this is the awkward part where I have to talk nonstop while you sounds

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:24,400
like I can maybe that's okay how does that sound does that sound okay

4
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:31,960
okay so welcome welcome it's nice to see you all

5
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:42,160
yeah I'm sitting here with a little bit of a heavy heart about uh what's happening in the

6
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,120
world yeah just to acknowledge

7
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,480
that and the emotions right that emotions arise

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,800
it's part of being

9
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:12,040
human and this practice offers how can we find

10
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,799
Freedom in the midst of emotions with

11
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:25,920
emotions I know there was a time in my life when I thought oh Freedom meant I wouldn't have any emotions they were too

12
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,840
messy and just got in the way and

13
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:38,159
and that had no small part in my decided to become a research scientist early in

14
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:45,439
my life because I thought oh you know scientists that they clearly they don't have emotions

15
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,640
and turns out to be ridiculous but uh that's C you know kind what I figured or

16
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,360
what I thought but how can we find Freedom

17
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,880
with emotions right we don't get to choose when emotions arise we don't get to choose when they leave we don't get

18
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,560
to choose their intensity their duration which ones we don't get to choose any of

19
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,640
that as much as we would like to as much as we would like to

20
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,000
control and you know only have certain emotions and not other ones and only in

21
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:30,959
convenient settings not in other settings

22
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,360
but what does it mean to have like Freedom with emotions what whichever

23
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,840
emotions we're having there's a few things we can point

24
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:49,280
to about this like what would it mean I'm using this word Freedom as a way to point to what would it mean to not be

25
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:58,159
pushed around by our emotional life not being like compelled to run away cuz we don't

26
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:05,319
want to feel certain things or to avoid certain situations in order that we don't feel things or to always feel like

27
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:12,879
we're chasing after certain emotions what would it be like to have

28
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:20,280
freedom ease steadiness with the emotions that life

29
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,760
brings us so one

30
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,599
thing is to recognize that em ions are part of the richness the

31
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:41,799
depth the beauty of life and so part of freedom is to have a

32
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:47,280
whole range of emotions not just the ones that we like and that are maybe

33
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:55,079
socially sanctioned but to all of them because let's be honest we do have the capacity

34
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:00,400
for all of them and we don't want to disown parts of our

35
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:07,000
El or try to pretend it doesn't exist excise it get rid of it these types of

36
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:15,160
things but to have the whole range the whole range of emotions because what we can feel emotionally is

37
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:22,199
enormous if you Tak in all the different flavors and intensities and kind of the

38
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:29,680
different aspects of it from this mild irritation to murderous rage from this

39
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:35,160
mild fondness to deep unconditional

40
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:44,360
love maybe some even like you just some contentment to intense

41
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:55,000
Joy so part of Freedom with the emotions would to be able to have this whole range to whatever is arising and there's

42
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,199
this part of the variety of emotions that are available that humans have

43
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:07,000
does provide for a life that I use this word depth to it it feels like that so

44
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:13,720
rather than just being on the surface maybe it has some color or

45
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,639
Vitality or richness to life so that's one way we might think

46
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:28,319
about Freedom with emotions another way is to actually be able to be with our

47
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,919
emotions which whichever ones are arising and not feel overwhelmed by

48
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:40,319
them not feel out of control in this sense that uh we tip

49
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:46,360
over into where we kind of like lose sense of our faculties in some kind

50
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:53,639
of way or not feel like we have to get rid of them but allow them to be

51
00:05:53,639 --> 00:06:00,160
there and to be able to be present for them that we can learn the the lessons

52
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,720
that they have to teach us one way to consider emotions is as

53
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,960
Messengers like a way to communicate from ourself to

54
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,120
ourself there's something that's being communicated with emotions sometimes

55
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:25,080
it's clear sometimes it's not clear but one way to be consider about Freedom with emotions is to be able to

56
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,400
be with our emotions when they arise

57
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:38,800
and then also to be able to unot things when it when it gets Tangled and

58
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,840
messy and we feel tight and constricted either because we're trying to avoid

59
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:52,479
something or have more of something or maybe we just feel a wave of emotions and we don't even know what it

60
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,400
is but we want to be able to feel like we can unot things when that's

61
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:05,680
appropriate when things feel all jumbled up and confusing and we found ourselves

62
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:11,039
flashing out or closing down or something like

63
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:18,599
this so another part of having Freedom with emotions is also to learn to have have some of the skill the

64
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:25,360
capacity to unot them untangle

65
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:33,639
them another thing we might think about having Freedom with emotions is to have

66
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:39,319
confidence that whatever emotion arises that we can be with

67
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:48,800
it that we're not going to get so overwhelmed or that it's not going to send us into a spiral that we can't work

68
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:57,199
with or be with sometimes we have fear of emotions so maybe we're not consoling somebody

69
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,520
who for example terrible diagnosis or a

70
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:11,400
loved one has died maybe we're not offering support to them because we're afraid of our own sadness that might

71
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,478
arise or maybe we're not having some difficult

72
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:23,759
conversations because we're afraid of our our own anger or their anger or what

73
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:31,039
might happen so part of Freedom with emotions is to have confidence

74
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:38,800
that whatever emotion arises that we can be with it as best we

75
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:47,399
can we can stay in it not like detach in some kind of way in which we are a bit

76
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:53,560
cold and detached and a little bit removed but to be

77
00:08:53,560 --> 00:09:01,079
there with the experience and to have the confidence

78
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:09,959
that it's okay it's okay even though it might be exactly what we don't

79
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,600
want that it's

80
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:22,720
okay so H how do we have this Freedom with

81
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:31,839
emotions notice that what I've been talking about is like it's all about like our relationship to

82
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,440
emotions our way that we respond to them the way that we react to them the way

83
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:44,880
that we hold them pushing them away or trying to

84
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:51,959
shove them [Music] down or maybe just holding on or maybe

85
00:09:51,959 --> 00:10:01,120
even trying to like fabricate a little bit thinking that oh this is what I should feel

86
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,079
but so how can we have some Freedom with emotions how can we understand our

87
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:14,160
relationship to our emotional life because all of us have an emotional

88
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,720
life it's true for some people maybe they have this really rich

89
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,760
emotional life that they're in touch with that they can express and they have the vocabulary to even

90
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,000
describe and for some people maybe it's not so

91
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:38,040
clear our emotional life might be kind of like the

92
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:47,720
three main ones are mad sad glad that's okay we start where we

93
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:55,760
are part of being know relationship to emotions is maybe to like increase our

94
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,920
emotional vocabulary awareness

95
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:07,800
just not an easy process it's not something like you just decide okay I'm going to be more in touch with my

96
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,760
emotions it can start by just occasionally saying well how am I

97
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:23,760
feeling right now and I was touched that uh Jack

98
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,600
cornfield he writes in one of his books I don't remember which book I read this in that

99
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:38,240
he was a a monk in Thailand and then when he came back to

100
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,360
America he uh kind of back in the American culture and all the

101
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:51,680
expectations and things he realized that he really didn't have a rich emotional life and

102
00:11:51,680 --> 00:12:00,959
partly you know being a monastic he was very simp much simpler for him to kind of like be a steady and

103
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,320
quiet but he realized that he had just completely detached himself from his

104
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:14,519
emotional life and he had it to he found a list of emotions a long list and he

105
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:21,480
discovered that he had to familiarize himself what is this I don't even really know what awe feels

106
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:29,040
like I don't really know what disappointment feels like how is that different than just sadness or frust

107
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,399
ation or thrill you know these types of

108
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:40,880
things so I want to normalize that some people have a really rich vocabulary

109
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,120
experience and other people have uh maybe have

110
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:53,199
less but one thing that I think is important to also say that whatever idea

111
00:12:53,199 --> 00:12:58,839
whatever Notions we have about which emotions are appropriate which ones are

112
00:12:58,839 --> 00:13:07,160
are inappropriate how they should be expressed how they should not be expressed all these ideas

113
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:13,959
about one's relationship to emotions they are always historically and

114
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:19,720
culturally situated there is no one right way to be

115
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:25,320
with it even somebody who sits up here and talks about emotions right you know

116
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,760
I'm coming from my culture and my time

117
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:37,199
why we can understand that in the Buddhist time we we don't even really have a word that we translated his

118
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:44,160
emotion it's fascinating right they just had a different way that they kind of like sliced up the pie of emotion I'm

119
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,839
sorry of The Human Experience and they didn't label one just

120
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:56,120
emotions fascinating right that for us it seems like well that's so obvious why wouldn't

121
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:03,639
they as a little aside I'll say they more had like mental States and bodily

122
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:08,000
States and emotions are a

123
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:14,440
mixture and some for some of us that's was a little bit of a wakeup call what do you me what do you mean it's both the

124
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:20,959
body and the mind if we pay attention to our inner

125
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:28,160
Life we'll discover that every emotion has both a physical somatic bodily

126
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:33,800
aspect to as well as a mental aspect to it and part of the way that we can work

127
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,920
with emotions is to kind like tease apart those two

128
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:44,880
aspects and to be with the bodily one to be with the physical

129
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,639
one the tightness in the throat the fluttering in the belly

130
00:14:51,639 --> 00:14:56,920
the I'm like feeling into my heart because that my heart feels a little broken or I have a little bit of

131
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:02,000
heartbreak these days I don't know what is I use the word

132
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,199
heart

133
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:17,360
tobreak so often also just to recognize that you know all these cultures and

134
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,920
times in history and have uh relationships to emotions some cultures you know tend to

135
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:30,120
be a little more appear to be more stoic and some appear to be you know of like

136
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:38,040
exuberant just also to say including even like the Dharma subculture right of course there's something here we have a

137
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:42,040
something that we talk about emotions

138
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:49,560
too but one of our relationships to emotions might be that uh we have some

139
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:55,519
resistance to them and it turns out that often it's

140
00:15:55,519 --> 00:16:02,120
not the emotions themselves but our resistance to the

141
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:09,279
emotions that it turns out to be where the difficulty

142
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:19,399
lies I heard this in a Dharma talk years ago and I thought oh that's cute I wonder if it's true and uh I've since uh

143
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:26,880
heard a neuroscientist say this like okay so here's like independently validated this idea that uh emotions

144
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,880
only last for 90 seconds they arise we feel them and they pass

145
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,880
away and you may say but wait you know I've been angry

146
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,360
for hours days

147
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:52,839
years sad for decades like what do you mean 90

148
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:58,680
seconds yeah it's fascinating how there's often it's this

149
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:04,199
story it's the mental part it's the I shouldn't be having this or who do they

150
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:10,720
think they are or I can't believe this is happening again it's these type of uh

151
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:19,480
narrations these commentaries that are fueling the emotions and kind of like keeping them

152
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:27,959
there and I think if all of us if we look closely at all those emotions that tend to stick around we aren't having an

153
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:34,919
open is of like wow sadness feels like

154
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:42,840
this I have this pressure behind my eyes I have this heaviness in my

155
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:51,760
shoulders I feel like I kind of want to collapse wow this is what sadness feels

156
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,640
like and just to be with it and not to just keep on going with the

157
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:07,200
stories it's human nature of course we have a narrative and why we're sad and

158
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:13,600
what we're got to do to get to stop it and all these kinds of things of course we

159
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:21,280
do but it turns out that that's extra and there's a way that we can

160
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:27,320
maybe take away some of the authority and the power of this

161
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,759
narration and then it just starts to

162
00:18:34,159 --> 00:18:41,039
atrophy so one of our relationships to emotions is that we might have

163
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:47,720
resistance and we might know or might be indicate that we have some resistance if

164
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:53,440
we just in general feel uncomfortable talking about emotions or we notice

165
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:59,600
ourselves doing frequent things just to distract ourselves so that we don't feel emotions

166
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:05,240
right so many of us have these electronic devices that now are designed

167
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:11,360
to do precisely that want to distract yourself here pay attention to this

168
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:17,720
right they been capitalized on this kind of wish to distract ourselves or maybe

169
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:24,080
we do a lot of procrastination because we don't want to be with our emotional life in some

170
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:29,760
way so where that's kind of a way of avoiding or not quite being with uh

171
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,159
what's arising or maybe we have this idea that

172
00:19:35,159 --> 00:19:41,159
this spiritual practice means that we should become a little bit like a

173
00:19:41,159 --> 00:19:47,559
emotional somehow and may as well start now and I shouldn't have any emotions or

174
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:53,159
turns out not to be true spiritual people of course they have

175
00:19:53,159 --> 00:20:00,080
emotions what's different is maybe the duration and intensity I don't know

176
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:08,400
about the intensity when maybe the duration but they're not a problem they just arise like maybe anger

177
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:14,320
is there and then it's gone okay sadness is there and then it's

178
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:22,919
gone I'm not a completely awakened person so I can't tell you but it's not like we stop becoming

179
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:29,320
human stop caring about things with this spiritual practice

180
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:35,280
so we might have some resistance to emotions and there might be a way in which there's a part of us that kind of

181
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:43,600
likes these emotions that can get us into trouble the greed or the

182
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:50,080
hatred there's a part of us that kind of likes these ones that the anger we might

183
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,960
feel like this power and exhilaration and you know this real sense of self-righteousness this real strong

184
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:04,840
sense of self is that me against the world I'm right they're wrong don't they

185
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,880
know who I am how dare

186
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:17,080
they there's this way in we can feel like Justified to do whatever we want

187
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:24,640
when we're filled with hatred we feel like this that's part of this exhilaration this sense of Vitality

188
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,159
that can arise or maybe anger I'll put in there anger or hatred both of them kind of

189
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:36,520
have that or maybe there's a way in which we

190
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:42,880
like this kind of the greed because um this just the whole ideal idea of being

191
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:48,400
attracted so we're so attracted to the object but there's also a way in which

192
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:57,000
we're kind of like attracted of just being attracted it also can bring some juiciness to our lives and and then

193
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:04,480
we're always let Maybe be looking for the next thing to want we has also a huge industry that

194
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:11,200
supports this too Medicine Avenue write all these advertising wow we is that powerful

195
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,559
partly because you know we we like there's this way in which the the greed

196
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:24,520
I'm using greed right the strong words here anger hatred and greed but to make a point that this uh there's

197
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:31,279
this this I don't know this want I'm doing this with my body I'm leaning forward probably because for me it kind

198
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:38,640
of feels like that this yeah oh I want this thing over there and there's this way in which okay I don't have it but

199
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:45,240
the next moment you know I don't have to be with this moment the next moment is going to have it'll be

200
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:52,720
better or maybe we have this certain attraction in some way with anxiety

201
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:59,840
because maybe there's a way we have this belief if we worry enough about potential problems then

202
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:05,840
they won't happen or if we worry a lot that's how

203
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:12,720
we indicate that we care and so we're attracted to feeling

204
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:19,120
this worry or anxiety even though it might be draining

205
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:24,880
us or taking away some of our Vitality or

206
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:29,880
our ability to be with what's

207
00:23:30,039 --> 00:23:36,120
happening so of course the downside to the anger or the hatred or the greed or

208
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:43,080
the lust or the anxiety is it doesn't allow the best forms of ourselves the

209
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:49,720
best aspects of ourselves to come out our greatest

210
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:57,400
wisdom we all have wisdom of course we do but it takes a lot of energy too at

211
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:04,840
the time at might feel like oh it gets to bring a lot of energy but wow does it take a lot of energy we feel empty we

212
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:11,480
feel depleted and then we feel like we have to chase after the next thing maybe to

213
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:17,520
replenish the energy and maybe that chasing itself turns into an

214
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:29,840
issue yeah so our relationship to emotions is a place where we can practice where

215
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:37,480
we can notice our relationship and is is there a way in which we can have more

216
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:45,640
freedom have more ease have more stability not making things go away but

217
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:52,360
be able to stand on our own two feet in the midst of

218
00:24:53,799 --> 00:25:01,919
them so here's a story this also is from Jack corner field that I appreciate very much I like

219
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:08,799
this story it's about a poison tree so a tree

220
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:15,799
that has poisonous fruit and then we might say that uh in

221
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:23,760
our lives we might discover like oh there's a tree and it has this poisonous fruit and maybe it's this greed or this

222
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:30,279
hatred or this anger or whatever it might be whatever ever it might be this

223
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:36,720
poisonous fruit and we might say well let's cut this down let's cut down this tree before anyone is hurt because we

224
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,880
don't want anybody else to eat the fruit this poisonous fruit and we don't want to eat this poisonous fruit so we

225
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:51,720
clearly we just have to get rid of this tree then when we are faced with stress

226
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,840
or loss or conflict or depression or sorrow in ourselves we may think like

227
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:03,279
okay I just got to get rid of this you know where is the saw got to chop this down

228
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:10,399
and this poison afflicts us let's uproot it get rid of it got to chop it

229
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:16,440
down of course we do I've done my fair share of this of

230
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:22,520
course I have all of us have and then maybe with a little bit

231
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:29,600
more maturity more life experience

232
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:36,399
we discover that uh whe there's this poison tree that has this fruit it's uh

233
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:42,120
poisonous and maybe with our life we've realized that to open to life to open to

234
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:48,640
what life brings us requires a this deep heartfelt

235
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:54,120
compassion for everything that's around

236
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:59,600
us and so encountering the poison tree it's like let's let's not cut it

237
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,080
down let's not cut it down instead we can put a fence around

238
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:11,440
it and the fence will protect ourselves we won't go near the tree and it'll

239
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:16,640
protect others and let everybody know like okay here in lies a poison Don't Go

240
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:22,159
Near it and so out of kindness and care they

241
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:29,519
build a France around the tree and and the tree also gets to have its own life

242
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,039
so it's compassion for everybody everything is to build this fence but of

243
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:43,440
course takes energy and lot of effort to maintain

244
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:51,039
fences so maybe a third type of person or maybe in the same person in a different uh situation encounters a

245
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,519
poison tree and they see this tree and they see the

246
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:04,399
poison and they have a different response they say oh perfect just what I

247
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:11,480
was looking for and they examine the fruit they take it apart maybe learn

248
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:18,640
some of the ingredients maybe isolate a little bit of it combine it with some something else and make

249
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:24,640
medicine out of the poison they transform

250
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:30,559
it they transmute it into something that is

251
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:37,519
helpful that can be healing for themselves and for

252
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:43,919
others so they're not trying to get rid of it or make it go away but maybe they

253
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:50,600
you know have learned something about these poisons they're not afraid of

254
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:56,559
them and have the confidence and the wherewithal to not only to be with them

255
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:02,760
but to kind of feel into and discover what's helpful

256
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:09,000
here and to leave what's not helpful behind and combine it with you know a

257
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:16,960
dash of compassion and some loving kindness and wisdom all these other things to make some

258
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:25,440
medicine so what are some ways in which we can make medicine about out of some

259
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:29,320
of these emotions

260
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:37,679
one is if we have this idea that our emotions are messengers from ourselves

261
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:45,279
to ourselves so that there's something that's need to be learned or

262
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:51,200
communicated or something that maybe isn't

263
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:57,840
seen about the emotions then we can

264
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:05,640
briefly reflect on why is this emotion arising in terms of like what why is it

265
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:12,120
useful how can it be helpful as opposed to just automatically

266
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:18,440
thinking good or bad or something like this to ask another question like how can this be

267
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:27,399
helpful what can I glean from this or what uh where's the the the medicine

268
00:30:27,399 --> 00:30:33,320
maybe inside so what is skillful what is

269
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:39,399
valuable and here are some ideas Daniel

270
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:45,200
Ingram had this um has this list and this was helpful

271
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,960
for me quite a number of years ago when I was having a lot of emotions and I I

272
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:56,080
just I felt a little bit of wash and I found that this really helpful so I'll

273
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:04,720
share it with just in case it's helpful for you guys too so Daniel Ingram says well maybe in

274
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:10,120
this whatever emotion is having is there something in there is there a wish for

275
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:18,279
me or others to be happy and can we tune into that and be

276
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:25,600
sensitive to that this wish for others to be happy the wish for ourselves to be happy or maybe there's a wish for the

277
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,760
world to be a better place for

278
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:35,799
everybody it's part of this emotion has this this part of this wish as part of

279
00:31:35,799 --> 00:31:43,559
it or maybe there's a wish for someone to understand something that could help them make

280
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:50,519
their life easier part of this emotion is born in

281
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:56,679
this wish for someone to understand something or maybe there's just a wish

282
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:04,279
for things to be better so can we tune into that this

283
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:10,760
wish this idea this notion that things can be better this possibility this

284
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:17,399
aspiration for things to be better maybe part of the emotion is due to this wish

285
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:24,880
for things to be better or maybe there's a wish for

286
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,080
tranquility or the end of suffering

287
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:35,919
for ourselves for others and this wish for the end of suffering this is a

288
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:42,080
wholesome wish all of these are wholesome skillful wishes maybe that's what's kind of like

289
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,200
fueling these emotions or wrapped up in them disguised inside these emotions or

290
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,360
something like this and is there a way that we can have this gentle

291
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:59,039
inquiry is there something in this emotion

292
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:04,840
that has a aspect that's related to

293
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:11,360
compassion that's related for the wish for the world to be better ourselves to

294
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:18,679
feel better for others to feel better for the world to be better and compassion has this feeling

295
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:26,639
in the heart but it's a softness and this softness can undo some

296
00:33:26,639 --> 00:33:33,200
of the brittleness that we find in some of these other emotions the ones that have a strong

297
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,600
sense of me against you or us against

298
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:45,519
them which is exhausting and turns out not to be so

299
00:33:46,639 --> 00:33:52,240
helpful there's this uh verse in the dapada I don't have it

300
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:58,159
in front of me but it goes something like this

301
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:06,679
hatred never ends with hatred by non-h hatred alone does it

302
00:34:06,679 --> 00:34:15,960
end this is an ancient truth hatred never ends with hatred by

303
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:23,599
nonh hatred alone does it end this is an ancient

304
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:31,040
truth of course I like this translation nonh hatred

305
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,679
that's we could say is literally what the paully says some translators will

306
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:44,440
translate it as love but I think that's asking too much it's like nonh hatred makes the room for

307
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:50,599
all kinds of things doesn't have to be love maybe it

308
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:55,839
can be a sincere wish for the suffering to

309
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:03,960
end maybe it can just be some amount of respect for their

310
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:15,520
Humanity so when we find ourselves in some of these emotions that aren't so helpful or skillful for ourselves maybe

311
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:22,160
we can find the compassion in them or maybe we can also find some of

312
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:29,839
the skillful underpinnings some of the ways is that maybe it's uh not so

313
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:35,839
directly compassion but something else that's skillful for example

314
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:44,640
fear can have as part of it this wish to protect this wish to take care of

315
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:53,520
ourselves others so maybe to feel into

316
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:01,319
that or maybe anger just wants the word the world to work

317
00:36:01,319 --> 00:36:06,520
well wants there to be a way in which

318
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,838
there is not so much

319
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:17,040
misery so not so much

320
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:25,720
suffering or maybe frustration comes from this caring sensation of anger being

321
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:30,760
thwarted that frustration is I'm not expressing my

322
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:37,400
anger because I care but the frust there is some anger there a little bit of

323
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:44,000
anger and to tune into the care not expressing my anger I'm not expressing

324
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,440
it I'm not letting it get as big as it wants and feel into that care not a way

325
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,960
that we're repressing or trying to shove down things but like to recognize yeah it's not best for me it's not best for

326
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:04,599
others in this situation to just feel the frustration as a part of

327
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:10,440
care or maybe desire is rooted just in this wish to be

328
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,200
happy and certainly a part of Desire can help us be

329
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:21,839
happy not all of it some desires right they're skillful and unskillful helpful

330
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:28,920
and unhelpful but to tune into that helpful part of Desire this wish to be

331
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:35,359
happy of course we want to be happy everybody

332
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:40,520
does so maybe to tune into the that wish

333
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:45,440
and to recognize that that desire has maybe that is the

334
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:53,720
root or maybe if we find judgement we find ourselves judging that's not good

335
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:59,520
that's not good that's bad and you know all these types of things maybe we can

336
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,800
tune into this Wish for Things to have this uh have a certain maybe we can even

337
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:12,880
say high standards we don't want things to just atrophy and lots of entropy you know

338
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:20,040
just get worse and worse and worse and fall apart we want things to be as good as they can

339
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:25,800
be maybe there's something in this that recognizes the Beauty and the power and

340
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:31,800
strength and others and in ourselves and there's judgment maybe is a little bit

341
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:39,839
of we can as an expression of our wish for that to be expressed maybe we can

342
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,720
tune into

343
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:52,440
that so in this way we can do a little bit of this

344
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:59,640
transformation taking this poisoned fruit and turning it into

345
00:39:00,319 --> 00:39:06,520
medicine I'm not saying this is easy sometimes right we have patterns of

346
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:12,920
how we express emotions and what's appropriate what's not appropriate and how to express them and you know all

347
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:18,400
these kinds of ways and these patterns get reinforced by our communities our

348
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:24,319
families of course they do I keep on saying this word of course because it's so natural right that we have this I

349
00:39:24,319 --> 00:39:30,800
don't want to say any of this is wrong but also it's natural for us

350
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:39,319
to maybe wish to express the beautiful parts of

351
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:46,880
ourselves to express the strength that we have the wisdom that we

352
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,800
have and maybe to Aspire for that to be for the benefit of all

353
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:01,000
beings for ourselves for the people that we come into contact with but in a way

354
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:09,280
that we can be a support for whatever we

355
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,838
encounter whomever we

356
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:24,960
encounter so our relationship to

357
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:34,160
emotions might sometimes get in the way of our ability maybe to transmute them into

358
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:40,319
medicine there might be a way in which we bat a bat away certain emotions or

359
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:47,760
something that we really hold on to that's okay we start where we are we

360
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,838
start where we are and where we are might be just to examine some of our

361
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:00,760
beliefs right maybe we have some ideas I shouldn't feel this or maybe we have

362
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,880
some ideas right and often these ideas are not so clearly articulated they're

363
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,160
just a general sense but we also might have ideas that every emotion we

364
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:18,680
experience should be expressed freely and everyone should know about them and and whatever emotion I have it's the

365
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:24,920
right one to have and whatever intensity I have it is the right one to have and there's a way in which we might feel the

366
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:30,519
opposite of kind of repressing that we feel like we have to express it all the

367
00:41:32,599 --> 00:41:38,359
time so we could just have like what are my beliefs about maybe this emotion that

368
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:47,880
I'm feeling now or maybe we could ask ourselves what scares me about this

369
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:57,800
emotion which whichever emotion it happens to be or we could ask if I were to to fully

370
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:04,319
feel this emotion what would happen What would happen if I were to

371
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:10,119
fully feel it feel it in the

372
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:17,079
body not try to Temp it down

373
00:42:22,520 --> 00:42:29,800
or yeah our emotions are such a rich part of our human

374
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:35,920
experience and I don't think that humans maybe as as species or as

375
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,240
individuals we ever get to the end where we have them all figured out and

376
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:47,960
understand them all or like in some ways like we will never be

377
00:42:47,960 --> 00:42:55,160
robots there was always be a kaleidoscope a richness a depth a

378
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:02,640
beauty ugliness there will always

379
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,000
be for humans and so part of our relationship

380
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,880
to emotions and it's where we can find the freedom for this wide wide uh

381
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:22,440
Spectrum or this what's available in this our

382
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:28,079
inner life

383
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:39,359
and when way we might consider there's so many opportunities for us

384
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:42,799
to make

385
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,920
medicine I want to it reiterate it's not it's not easy it's not

386
00:43:53,160 --> 00:44:00,680
fast there was a time when I was a chap uh up in San Francisco General

387
00:44:00,680 --> 00:44:05,880
Hospital and um I felt like wow there's like there's

388
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,440
a lot of suffering that's you in all hospitals right by definition right

389
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:18,680
then and um I discovered this

390
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:24,520
book I the the author escapes my mind it's a well-known

391
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:32,839
book but I think the title was like the wounded healer and the notion was the idea that

392
00:44:32,839 --> 00:44:39,160
from our own wounds our own difficulties our own you know emotions our maybe

393
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:44,359
unfinished business in our hearts it was that that would allow us

394
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:50,200
to connect with others it was that our own difficulties what we've learned and

395
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:58,640
our own vulnerability our own emotional life that allowed us to to show up for

396
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:04,520
others and at the best chaplain were the ones that had a

397
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:11,760
history of you know being wounded in some kind of way they they knew what it was like

398
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,960
to be

399
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:23,119
wounded and that was quite helpful because otherwise we might feel like we

400
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:28,280
have to have all the answers or you might need

401
00:45:28,280 --> 00:45:35,640
to be appear to be invulnerable or something like that and

402
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:41,760
that just is a big way of denying

403
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,280
ourselves so turning Med poison into

404
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:57,880
medicine with our emotions finding Freedom with emotions

405
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:11,240
I wish for all of you is that you can find

406
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:17,160
Freedom with whatever emotions come your

407
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:24,800
way doesn't mean it's not messy doesn't mean it's pretty or easy

408
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:31,558
but can you find Freedom whatever life brings

409
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:35,400
you thank

410
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:46,559
you sometimes I open for questions but tonight I'm um I'd rather do this

411
00:46:46,559 --> 00:46:53,040
without a microphone so if people want to come up and talk to me you're welcome too but uh I I'll do it with the mic off

412
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:57,800
so thank you and I wish you a wonderful rest of the evening

413
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:09,400
for
