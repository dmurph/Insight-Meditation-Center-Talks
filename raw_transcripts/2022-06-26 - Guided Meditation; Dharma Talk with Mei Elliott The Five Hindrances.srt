1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:06,399
good morning everyone how's the sound

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:12,960
can you hear me okay great all right so we'll begin this morning with a 25

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:20,400
minute 35 minute meditation together we can start by finding a stable

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,720
comfortable relaxed yet energetic posture

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,840
so this can be a sitting posture a standing posture or a lying down

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,680
posture all of these are suitable for meditation

7
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:47,120
we might start by taking three deep breaths together inhaling

8
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:55,120
and exhaling inhaling again

9
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,399
exhaling and a last time

10
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:12,600
[Applause] and allowing the breath to resume a normal rhythm

11
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,960
as we begin our meditation we might consider setting an intention

12
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,118
for practice this morning

13
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,159
maybe to meet the moment with patience and kindness

14
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,960
maybe just to recognize what's happening at any given moment

15
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:01,960
and to feel it to feel it fully in the body

16
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,480
at this time you might connect with an anchor for your meditation

17
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:37,840
that might be the breath the soundscape

18
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,280
or the bodily posture

19
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:01,360
allowing the mind to rest and settle on the anchor

20
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,560
on our object of meditation

21
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,239
as we begin to settle together

22
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:59,480
it can be helpful to notice if there's any extra tension in the body

23
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:10,640
you can intentionally relax the body

24
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:19,040
softening the scalp releasing the temples

25
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,120
softening the jaw

26
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,479
perhaps allowing the mat the mouth to open for a moment and float clothes

27
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:39,240
closed so the jaw is relaxed

28
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:49,040
softening the shoulders

29
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:59,280
allowing the belly to drop down and forward

30
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:12,240
and releasing any extra tension in the legs

31
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,520
the ankles and the feet

32
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,680
and if there's any tension in the body that won't relax that's no problem at

33
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,600
all just relax around the tension

34
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,840
no need to ask this moment to be any different than it is

35
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:17,560
so

36
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:29,520
reconnecting with your anchor now

37
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,880
feeling a full breath cycle

38
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,400
inviting the mind to rest on the simplicity

39
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,840
of what's present

40
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:26,680
so

41
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,279
if you've noticed that the mind has wandered

42
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,959
can you gently and kindly return your attention to the present

43
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:32,399
moment bringing yourself back to the anchor

44
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:39,360
just sliding back to the anchor no need to contract

45
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,839
or judge yourself if the mind has gone missing

46
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:59,399
just sliding back to the present moment as many times as is needed

47
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,520
as we continue staying connected to our primary anchor

48
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:45,360
of attention the breath

49
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:48,640
the soundscape

50
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:58,480
if something else calls your attention maybe a strong sensation elsewhere in

51
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,640
the body

52
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:11,279
an emotion or mood

53
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:22,640
a sound allow the mind to recognize that

54
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:34,880
such that mindfulness knows what's happening

55
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,440
sensations in the knee

56
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,720
contraction in the shoulder blade

57
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,760
a sense of peacefulness

58
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,559
or dis-ease just allowing the mind to recognize

59
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:21,640
what's present if it draws your attention away from the anchor

60
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:52,880
and you can take a few moments to get to know that experience

61
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:59,679
that which is recognized which is identified

62
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,520
feeling the sensations in the knee getting to know them

63
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:16,320
getting to know whatever draws your attention for a few moments

64
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,559
before returning to your anchor

65
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:33,400
so

66
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,840
so

67
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,480
so

68
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,080
so

69
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,279
so

70
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:54,279
so

71
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:52,900
so [Music]

72
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:05,360
may the beneficial energy of our practice benefit all beings everywhere

73
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:09,879
so they may be free from suffering

74
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,690
[Applause]

75
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:27,440
[Applause] good morning everyone

76
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:33,440
welcome if you're just arriving my name is may elliott

77
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:40,320
i'm coming today from san francisco zen center where i live and work

78
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,158
and it's a delight to be with you today today is a special day for those that don't know

79
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,280
it is gay pride day with the pride parade in san francisco

80
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,878
an opportunity to celebrate all forms of lgbtiqa

81
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:02,800
diversity and identities um and something for me that feels so

82
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,320
special about pride is it really feels like an opportunity to

83
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:13,920
um celebrate and honor all parts of oneself

84
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:19,200
and so learning to love ourselves just as we

85
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:25,599
are is such an important thing so i hope that this talk today inspires some of that

86
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:31,760
same sentiment for you so that we can learn to be present with

87
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:37,359
ourselves present with whatever is arising for us without judgment

88
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:40,559
no part left out

89
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:48,720
i'd like to begin the talk this morning with a memory

90
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:54,960
i was just reflecting on how when i was a teenager one of my favorite things to

91
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:02,320
do was to go backpacking and we'd pack up our our backpacks with

92
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:08,960
everything we'd need and take off into the back country and go out to remote lakes and mountains

93
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,640
and one of the aspects of this is we needed to be self-sufficient and we

94
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,960
could only carry about two liters of water on us at any given time so we needed to hike from

95
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,359
water source to water source and so this might be finding

96
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:34,960
mountain streams or creeks or um finding lakes

97
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,200
and on occasion we would travel for miles and miles through the

98
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,839
heat and get to a water source and it would be murky or filled with silt or

99
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,520
overgrown with moss and that was not good news

100
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,359
we'd have these little plastic water filters with us that we'd pump the water with and though

101
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:06,839
they did a pretty good job they were no match for a really funky lake so

102
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:14,720
um what we needed was for our water to be somewhat clear in order to sustain us

103
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:20,560
and to continue surviving on these on our journey

104
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,800
and i remembered this experience when i was thinking about the mind

105
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:32,960
so our mind is a little like the water in these in these lakes and creeks

106
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,240
when the mind is clear it can be life-giving it can sustain and support

107
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,880
us and we can become more free of suffering we can become more loving and joyful in

108
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,000
our lives but if the mind is too agitated to murky

109
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,200
to overgrown we're not able to see clearly the qualities of love and wisdom

110
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:05,838
are obscured by the silt of the mind and we're not able to move forward towards greater freedom in our life

111
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:12,480
the buddha named five specific states of mind that create a lack of clarity

112
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,520
these are called the five hindrances i'm just curious who here has heard of the

113
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:22,800
five hindrances people familiar wonderful great so this will be a review

114
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,839
for some of you and for me what i find is uh the more i hear about the hindrances the

115
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:36,640
more i'm able to recognize them in myself and to not be fooled by them

116
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,000
so the hindrances are known for covering over and obscuring our wisdom

117
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,240
and typically if we're having a difficult time probably one of the hindrances is at work

118
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,760
so the five hindrances for those that could use a review are

119
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:59,440
sense desire the wanting mind ill will or aversion

120
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:06,720
the mind that doesn't want what it has so these first two are two sides of the same coin wanting and not wanting

121
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,800
the next is restlessness so this can be a higher energy state a

122
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:19,359
mental or physical agitation the next sloth intorper which is

123
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:24,400
sleepiness and those two are energetic states and

124
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,320
then the last is doubt so the buddha compared the mind to a

125
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,839
bowl of water in one of the early buddhist sutas he talks about the hindrances

126
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:40,240
as though they were a bowl of water

127
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:46,240
so the doubtful mind is like a bowl of water that's murky the

128
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:53,359
restless mind is stirred up or agitated water the sleepy mind is like a bowl of water

129
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,560
overgrown the aversive mind is boiling as though

130
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:06,560
hot with anger and the desirous mind is like water filled with colorful dyes

131
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:12,160
dyes that can entrance us and distract us in the way that sense desire is so

132
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,839
apt to do so in all cases the mind is not clear

133
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:24,160
so lucky for us the buddha offered some wonderful teachings on how to work with

134
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:29,920
these states and in this talk i'll share a singular practice that you can use to

135
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:37,599
apply to any of the hindrances so we could think of this as a one-size-fits-all teaching

136
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:43,680
and then i'll go through each hindrance individually and share some of the specific practices that you might apply

137
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:50,318
to each individual hindrance including the antidotes

138
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:58,960
and something i find quite helpful to remember is that almost anything i'm struggling with not everything but many

139
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,200
things can in large part be distilled down to simply being a manifestation of one of

140
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:12,079
the hindrances so simple just one of these five things pretty easy right so if i can learn to

141
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:18,160
meet these hindrances skillfully then there's gonna be a lot more freedom in my life so i find that pretty

142
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:25,839
incentivizing for learning how to work with these so to begin here is the one size fits

143
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:30,880
all practice and if this is the only thing that you remember from this talk

144
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:38,319
it will serve you well and it's really simple just two steps to this the first is recognize and the

145
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:43,599
second is feel so recognize that's just recognizing what's

146
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,880
present present identifying what is present in this moment

147
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:54,480
so that might be oh this is wanting this is wanting that's present or oh

148
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,960
this is sleepiness and it's really helpful to know a hindrance as a hindrance oh this is just

149
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:07,440
one of the hindrances we're so often transfixed by the storyline of what we want or what we

150
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:14,400
want to get rid of that we don't even really know that desire or aversion or are present for us

151
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,520
and that those are actually what's fueling the show

152
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:26,640
and sometimes just the act of naming something is enough to help it lose its power over us

153
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:33,680
sometimes there can be something in us that's asking for attention and piping up in our mind over and over

154
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,440
again and when we can turn towards it and identify it recognize it it's as though we're giving it the

155
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:44,800
attention that it's been seeking and that can sometimes be enough to help

156
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,440
it release

157
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,680
some time ago i decided to embark on trying a new

158
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:02,720
meditation technique and this was taught by a teacher that i really admired

159
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,760
so naturally i wanted to impress the teacher with my

160
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:14,560
meditative prowess and of course as one could suspect i

161
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:21,040
found myself sometime later worrying about well am i any good at this practice i really want

162
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:26,400
to be good at this am i doing it right and so it's no surprise that there was

163
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:31,519
some suffering there associated with that experience

164
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:40,720
so one day i was sitting kind of mulling over my sense of insufficiency

165
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:46,720
when the mind stopped and a phrase came into the mind

166
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:52,800
and it said this is doubt

167
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:59,839
this is doubt that's it this is just one of the hindrances and i know that i don't need to take the

168
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:05,040
hindrances personally and it was upon the arising

169
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:12,800
of seeing the recognition this is doubt that the whole package fell away

170
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:20,240
that whole narrative the whole storyline just evaporated and in its place

171
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:26,400
it was replaced by joy so

172
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:32,880
sometimes just the naming of something can be enough to have it release

173
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,280
and you'll notice when that happened i didn't make the doubt go away i didn't

174
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:46,079
get rid of the doubt i didn't even let go of the doubt inner wisdom released the doubt in that

175
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:53,599
moment and that's what can become possible as we we begin to practice with the hindrances more

176
00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:00,000
and often for us simple recognition does not cause the hindrance to evaporate

177
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:06,160
and so what what then so then we have our second step so we recognize and then we feel

178
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:12,240
we feel the hindrance in the body we get to know it we bring curiosity to it we

179
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:19,200
investigate it and this is an opportunity to

180
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:26,319
to shift our fixation so often when we're entranced by hindrance

181
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:33,440
there's typically an object that we're fixated on especially this happens with desire and ill will or aversion

182
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:38,800
we're fixated on wanting a new haircut or getting our roommate to take out the

183
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,920
trash and so we're so wrapped up in the object

184
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,319
the trash the roommate the haircut that we don't really know what's happening

185
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:55,839
so instead in this way of working with the hindrance we let go of obsessing with the object

186
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:02,079
and we turn 180 degrees and look inward and identify what's happening and this

187
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:08,560
begins to pull us out of our trance it pulls us out of our daydream so rather than trying to get rid of our

188
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:14,280
hindrance we turn and look at it we feel it

189
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:19,760
and just to say a little bit more about what i mean when i say feel um we can

190
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,079
when we feel it in the body and we get curious about it we're actually feeling into the sensations

191
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:32,319
we're not exploring it with a mental narrative we're feeling it in the present moment moment so that might be

192
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:38,400
experiencing tightness in the chest or a dull ache at the pit of the stomach

193
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:45,359
or heat in the forehead tingling pressure we're feeling it from that lens

194
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:52,079
and we might notice what um uh what the the hindrance feels like in the mind also how is it coloring the

195
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:57,920
mind maybe there's an emotional tone or a mood that goes with it

196
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,440
you might even notice what sorts of thoughts are occurring without getting caught up in the narrative

197
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:10,079
but just seeing like oh wow there's a lot of thought production around this or the thoughts are kind of yelling or

198
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:17,280
they're maybe really quiet just seeing what's happening from the present moment view

199
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:26,079
so that's it recognize and feel and it's through this experience of

200
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:32,880
recognizing and feeling what's happening in the present when we're not transfixed by the object

201
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:38,640
that the mind is obsessing over that the mind and heart can register

202
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:43,680
oh this is suffering it actually hurts when i'm caught up in

203
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:49,520
this pattern of these hindrances and in the same way that the mind knows

204
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:55,599
if the hand touches a hot stove ouch that burns and we don't have to convince ourselves

205
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:02,000
to not touch a hot stove we just know that hurts i'm not going to touch a hot stove

206
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:08,319
the mind heart begins to learn that with the hindrances because it really feels the hindrances

207
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:14,319
fully it begins to learn ouch this hurts i'm not going to do that anymore

208
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:20,720
and we can see this in the way that the mind let go of doubt right it's like oh yeah i remember that one that hurts i'm

209
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:26,480
not going to touch that stove anymore i'm not going to do this doubt thing anymore and the system can learn to

210
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,400
release it and that's a really powerful and inspiring thing when the mind begins to

211
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:39,760
do this when the mind begins to let go of these patterns these hindrance patterns

212
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:46,079
okay so now i'll go through the hindrances individually to say a little bit more about each

213
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:51,920
and provide the antidotes so traditionally an antidote is a

214
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:58,000
medicine to counteract a point a poison and in this case with the hindrances the

215
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,240
antidotes are no different they are designed to counteract the the hindrance

216
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:09,920
and to say something about when we would use an antidote i remember learning about

217
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:15,119
all the antidotes and kind of being confused about how to practice with these things and when do i do one and

218
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:20,480
when do i just feel it and too much stuff so uh

219
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:26,319
what i would suggest is start with recognizing and feeling antidotes

220
00:49:26,319 --> 00:49:34,319
are what can be applied when we're being overwhelmed by the hindrance and we can't just be mindful of it so we

221
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:40,800
start with being mindful of it and staying with it with feeling it getting to know it and it's only when we become

222
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:47,599
overwhelmed feels like too much that we can try something different that it's a good idea to change the channel and try

223
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,079
something new

224
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:04,480
so let's go into sense desire let's talk a little bit about that so other ways we might refer to this hindrance include

225
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:10,839
craving wanting the wish to acquire things longing

226
00:50:10,839 --> 00:50:17,040
grasping sense desire is at work when we are longing for a cup of coffee

227
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:23,599
or when we are trying to make ourselves more physical physically beautiful or seeking

228
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:29,920
to go to uh gallery to have some visual pleasure

229
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:36,880
it's at work when there's fantasy about sexual or romantic desire

230
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:43,839
all different areas that can come up it's even comes up when we are craving for uh trying to repeat a blissful

231
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:51,200
meditation experience so as you know we have the five senses

232
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:57,200
hearing seeing touching tasting smelling in buddhism we have a sixth the mind so

233
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:03,599
there's these six senses so with sense desire

234
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:08,640
it's just that we're craving for pleasant experience at one of the six

235
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:13,920
senses so that's what's happening and it can happen at any of those senses it's the craving

236
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:20,319
for what's pleasant and agreeable to take place at any one of the given sense stores

237
00:51:20,319 --> 00:51:25,359
if not all of them and often when we have free time in our life

238
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:30,400
say maybe a sunday afternoon we're often trying to fill that free

239
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:37,680
time with back-to-back pleasant sense experience there can be the illusion in our culture

240
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:44,720
that a happy life is one where we've been able to string and up string together back-to-back pleasant sense

241
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:50,520
experiences and avoid anything unpleasant

242
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:57,520
and generally what's at the heart of sense desire is a feeling that something could make

243
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:05,599
this moment better that this moment is insufficient and that happiness resides out at the next

244
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:11,839
pleasure the next pleasant experience and i i do want to note as i say this

245
00:52:11,839 --> 00:52:18,480
because desire can get a pretty bad rap in buddhist circles that not all desires are problems

246
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:24,160
so there's the desire to be free from suffering the desire to be compassionate or

247
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:30,000
patient these are all wholesome desires then we can also have

248
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:35,680
what i might call innocuous desires like the desire to go for a walk outside or

249
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:41,440
to put on a sweater um these typically don't manifest as

250
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:47,359
hindrances and what shifts an innocuous desire into being a hindrance

251
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:53,200
is when we're gripped by it when we're preoccupied by it when it runs the show

252
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,960
so often desire it's it's as though it gets in the driver's seat and we're

253
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:07,119
in the passenger seat and it's taking us for a ride so kind of we're subject to the wishes of desire

254
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:15,040
but it is possible to hold sense desire lightly the dalai lama was

255
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:23,119
uh in germany and getting a tour of an abbey there and this was an abbey that was known for

256
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:30,240
producing cheese and fruit cake so the dalai lama is getting toured around to the different sites and

257
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:35,680
seeing all of the things and that night the dalai lama got to sit

258
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:41,599
down with the monks that toured him around and he was recounting his experience of

259
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:49,599
the tour and he shared that you know it was great but you know i kept being offered cheese

260
00:53:49,599 --> 00:53:57,838
here's try this cheese try that cheese cheese cheese cheese but the whole time all i wanted was fruit cake

261
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:04,640
and of course upon saying that he threw his head back and laughed and laughed

262
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:10,720
and he held his his sense desire so lightly not owned by it in any way

263
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:16,319
really really at peace with it so how can we do that for ourselves how

264
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:21,570
can we meet our sense desire without distress or disappointment

265
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:26,640
[Applause] so we can do this practice of

266
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:32,480
recognizing that desire is present and feeling it in the body and when i

267
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:38,640
want to say something about feeling it in the body because something that's interesting about sense desire is it

268
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:45,839
often feels pleasant in the body when we think about it so for me if i think of something

269
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:51,599
enjoyable that i want often it has a sort of sparkle in the mind and that's a

270
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:57,839
indicator for me that sense desire is at work if i have that little sparkle of feeling enticed

271
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,640
by something

272
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:09,520
under the surface though what i've discovered as the mind has become more settled and

273
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:15,920
more peaceful is that the state of sense desire even though it's exciting there's an

274
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:22,119
excitement to it it's unsettled it's based in this feeling of lack or

275
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:29,520
insufficiency and that there's actually something much more peaceful the mind that is content

276
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,760
is much more peaceful and satisfying than the mind that is excited by sense

277
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:38,240
desire

278
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:46,640
so if you're having a hard time staying mindful of sense desire this is when you might consider an

279
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:52,240
antidote one of the antidotes for sense desire is

280
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:57,440
impermanence or in constancy so remembering that whatever it is that

281
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:03,760
we're reaching after will fade away in time and for me it can be helpful to remember

282
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:10,799
that even if i'm i get that object and i can keep it for a long time my enchantment with it will probably fade

283
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:16,640
away pretty quickly you may have had the experience of having something that you really want

284
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:23,040
and you finally get the new purchase and you're so excited and you have to have it and you it's finally here

285
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:31,119
and then a month later you hardly remember that you own it anymore the enchantment has disappeared

286
00:56:31,119 --> 00:56:36,559
so remembering impermanence can be useful and in states of meditation actually

287
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:42,480
observing in constancy observing impermanence the arising and passing of things

288
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:48,240
in the present moment helps train the mind in the truth of inconstancy

289
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:55,200
and when we understand at a deeper level how everything is falling away and changing it's hard to be fooled by sense

290
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:02,160
desire so both reflecting on and observing impermanence

291
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:08,720
in real time is an excellent antidote for sense desire

292
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:13,839
and lastly this applies with all the hindrances

293
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:20,799
don't miss recognizing when they're absent so really let the mind register when

294
00:57:20,799 --> 00:57:26,319
sense desire isn't present really enjoy the satisfaction there the

295
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:31,359
the lack of seeking so out on the backpacking trips

296
00:57:31,359 --> 00:57:36,559
we didn't just fixate on the pools of water that were cloudy and covered over

297
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:43,920
but we really enjoyed the pools that were clear so let yourself be nourished by those

298
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:50,640
the second of our hindrances is ill will or aversion

299
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:56,079
this can manifest as anger disliking grief fear

300
00:57:56,079 --> 00:58:03,440
resentment boredom etc the zen teacher leanne shut

301
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:10,640
talks about this hindrance as the terrible twos spelled t-o-o-s

302
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:18,000
so we can know aversion is happening when the mind is saying too messy too cold too many bugs too

303
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:25,920
itchy too ugly so if you if you notice that's happening a version might be happening inside

304
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:31,760
and then when we have the terrible twos that can turn into the terrible use

305
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:38,640
so uh you're too loud you're too distant you're too unprofessional so it can shift to

306
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:46,078
judging others right so these are all common ways that aversion can manifest

307
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:52,799
and just as with desire we can recognize oh this is a version

308
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:58,640
dropping the fixa and drop the fixation turning and looking inside and feeling

309
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:06,640
it and i think that a version holds a special place amongst the hindrances

310
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:12,799
so much so that i have a specific nickname for it i call it the tagalong

311
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:19,520
hindrance and that's because typically if any of the other hindrances are present

312
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:25,760
chances are aversion may be tagging along too and that's because the other the other

313
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:33,520
hindrances often not always but often manifest manifest as unpleasant in our system

314
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:39,599
and so naturally something unpleasant is there we want to get rid of it so there's the primary

315
00:59:39,599 --> 00:59:46,720
hindrance of say restlessness and then an add-on a tag-along of a version with

316
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:51,920
it so just watch for this in your hindrance practice often when we can

317
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:58,799
see the aversion we can begin to reorient and learn to relate to the initial hindrance with more patience and

318
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:04,960
kindness so if the mind can't be mindful with

319
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:10,720
aversion then we go to our our antidote the classic antidote for aversion

320
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:17,599
is meta or lovingkindness and for me

321
01:00:17,599 --> 01:00:24,079
if i'm feeling angry if i'm feeling aversion towards someone it's often not so accessible to send them loving

322
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:30,480
kindness so what i do is i send it to myself because if i'm angry chances are i'm

323
01:00:30,480 --> 01:00:35,680
suffering i'm the one that needs that loving kindness in that moment so that's one

324
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:42,480
way you can bring you can replace the mind of anger with

325
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,119
well wishing

326
01:00:54,640 --> 01:00:59,680
so the third hindrance is sloth and torpor and before going into this i want

327
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:07,280
to remind you that these next two are energetic states sloth interpret and restlessness one low energy one high

328
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:16,960
energy so sloth and torpor can manifest as fatigue drowsiness sleepiness dullness

329
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:25,040
and sloth typically refers to a mental sleepiness and torpor to a physical tiredness

330
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:30,960
i usually just think of them under the category of sleepiness

331
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:36,880
and that usually does the trick to be able to note sleepiness in one's practice

332
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:43,200
and this can come about for a variety of reasons sloth and torpor can come forth because we're genuinely tired we're

333
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:49,200
genuinely under stress or underslept stressed overworked and our body really

334
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:55,680
actually just needs to rest and there are other forms of sloth interpreter that can arise in meditation

335
01:01:55,680 --> 01:02:03,680
such as as the mind tries to focus on something simple like

336
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:08,880
the breath we're not used to being

337
01:02:09,119 --> 01:02:15,599
we're not used to having an experience where we're not entertained by our inner fantasies and aversions

338
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:20,799
by our exciting romance films or horror films

339
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:27,920
that play in the mind so as those start to dissipate sometimes the mind gets a little bored and falls asleep

340
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:33,119
there's yet a third type of sloth interpreter and it's defensive

341
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:40,160
sleepiness so this is when there's something difficult that's being experienced and the mind

342
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:46,960
does not want to feel it and so sometimes when that's in the system the mind puts

343
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:54,078
up this shroud so that we can dip out and not have to feel that difficult feeling

344
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:59,680
in my early retreats i had a lot of sleepiness i had a lot of the

345
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:05,440
the head jerking bucking bronco experience

346
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:11,119
and this was really unpleasant for me there was a lot of fighting and i remember this sort of kind of clenched

347
01:03:11,119 --> 01:03:16,480
the teeth sort of energy trying to fight against my sleepiness

348
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:22,079
and what i learned after suffering significantly over my sleepiness

349
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:28,079
was that the difficulty of it was my resistance to it it was the tagalong hindrance of

350
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:33,440
aversion that was making sleepiness difficult and that sleepiness itself is

351
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:39,039
actually karmically neutral there's nothing bad about sleepiness

352
01:03:39,039 --> 01:03:45,480
so the key with sleepiness is befriending it

353
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:55,280
and particularly if we can can continue to just be with the breath from a tired

354
01:03:55,280 --> 01:04:02,400
place there's no problem it might not be the sharpest mindfulness you've ever had but that's okay

355
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:08,240
if it's a sleepy period of meditation we can just be sleepy buddha

356
01:04:08,240 --> 01:04:16,400
no problem there and when we look at this basic instruction of recognizing and feeling

357
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:22,640
something i want to emphasize with the feeling part is that that aspect can have a little

358
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:28,559
curiosity or investigation in it and for sleepiness can be really helpful just to

359
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:36,160
turn up the volume a bit on the investigation turn up the volume a bit on the curiosity because those factors

360
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:42,799
of mind are energizing and that's actually the antidote to sleepiness is energy

361
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:48,799
so in this case when we're just feeling and kind of checking it out bringing this

362
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:55,440
this curiosity can be just enough energy to see what's happening and of course if

363
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,799
the mind is really really tired it's hard to investigate anything um

364
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:05,920
but if there can be just a bit of energy it can be really interesting and this

365
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:12,720
totally revolutionized my sleepiness practice so some of the things that i got curious

366
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:18,240
about which you might explore in your own sleepiness practice is

367
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:23,599
where is the epicenter of sleepiness in the body

368
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:30,480
and what i mean by that is where in the body is the most sleepy

369
01:05:30,480 --> 01:05:37,440
so what i would do is i'd go looking to find the sleepiest spot and for me it was often behind one of my eyes

370
01:05:37,440 --> 01:05:43,760
typically not both but behind one of my eyes would be the sleepiest spot and if i brought the attention there i'd fall

371
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:49,119
asleep but if i kind of hung out around it i could stay awake

372
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:55,520
or we might explore uh are we if we're falling asleep in meditation can we catch if we fall

373
01:05:55,520 --> 01:06:01,359
asleep on an in-breath or an out breath or if we are somebody who's counting

374
01:06:01,359 --> 01:06:07,599
breaths in our meditation one to ten what number are you falling asleep on

375
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:13,760
for me it was often like around somewhere in the six to eight range i'd go down

376
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,799
pretty repeatedly each time through so you can check these out in your own

377
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:25,520
practice and if there's enough brightness in the mind um you might be able to see some interesting things or see if you can

378
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:31,440
notice the moment the mind falls asleep this can all be really fun to explore

379
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:39,039
so as i mentioned the antidote to energy so perhaps a more

380
01:06:40,799 --> 01:06:47,200
direct intervention or a little more extreme intervention if the mind's too sleepy for all that

381
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:54,880
is open the eyes stand up go for a brisk walk splash water on the

382
01:06:54,880 --> 01:07:00,319
face the buddha all recommended these for people working with sloth and torpor

383
01:07:00,319 --> 01:07:05,760
for me cooling down my body temperature if i'm warm and cozy in the hall in the

384
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:13,280
meditation hall i'll probably fall asleep so even if i'm a little on the uncomfortable cool side if i'm wearing

385
01:07:13,280 --> 01:07:18,799
short sleeves in a cool haul i usually don't have sloth and torpor so

386
01:07:18,799 --> 01:07:23,839
these are things you can play with oh and lastly i had mentioned that

387
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:29,599
defensive sleep if you're sitting a lot and there's

388
01:07:29,599 --> 01:07:35,520
and you're falling asleep a lot and particularly on retreat if you're past the first several days of retreat and

389
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:41,680
you're still getting sleepy a lot and you're getting enough sleep you might just drop in the question

390
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:48,880
is there something underneath this is there something underneath this

391
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:54,000
and that has the potential to expose if there's something else going on

392
01:07:54,000 --> 01:08:00,400
that sleepiness is shrouding trying to protect you from

393
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:07,440
okay the next is restlessness fourth hindrance

394
01:08:07,839 --> 01:08:13,839
so with restlessness there can be an over abundance of energy

395
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:19,040
it's sometimes referred to as worry and flurry

396
01:08:19,040 --> 01:08:24,719
and can come forth in a mental or physical manifestation

397
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:31,758
so mental restlessness can manifest in an agitated mind racing thoughts anxious thoughts

398
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:37,838
worrying and in the body it can be that sort of

399
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:43,758
can't sit still fidgety itching moving adjusting that can be

400
01:08:43,759 --> 01:08:50,640
physical restlessness where i've experienced it getting home from a really busy day of work and the

401
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:56,080
momentum of the day makes it so i can i i can't stop almost like it's it's hard

402
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:02,480
to slow down because there's so much movement in the body

403
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:09,120
with restlessness it can be helpful to remember that this is a natural part of

404
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:16,560
being human the zen teacher and author mark lesser likes

405
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:23,600
to remind us that we are the descendants of the nervous apes

406
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:28,560
so all of the chilled out apes got eaten

407
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:34,880
and it was the nervous apes that made baby nervous apes

408
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:42,159
etc and here we are so don't be too hard on yourself

409
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:48,080
if uh if you have restlessness if you have anxiety in your life and practice

410
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:51,120
this is so normal

411
01:09:53,679 --> 01:10:02,320
so the antidote the antidote for restlessness is calm or tranquility

412
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:07,600
so if you feel restless you can return to your meditation anchor if you're

413
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:14,960
meditating can return to your anchor say the breath or the soundscape but do so in a gentle way

414
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:21,280
in a way that invites the mind to rest what we're doing here is allowing the

415
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:26,480
mind to gravitate around a simple object

416
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:33,760
and this can be a refuge for the mind that's tangled up in what can be a high-energy agitated storyline so we're

417
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:39,840
moving from a complex object to a simple object and sometimes that can be very relieving

418
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:45,840
for some people bringing the attention to an anchor

419
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:51,040
can increase the energy though and if that happens can try giving the

420
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:56,640
mind a really wide pasture so that might be rather than focusing on

421
01:10:56,640 --> 01:11:04,000
a small point in the body opening up to the soundscape so that there's a lot of room

422
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,440
for the energy in the body

423
01:11:09,679 --> 01:11:15,840
and then another way is to if if there's restlessness is to connect with any calm

424
01:11:15,840 --> 01:11:23,360
that may already be present so sometimes if i'm restlessness if the energy is really

425
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:29,679
wrapped up in the mind in a story line or maybe there's tightness in the chest

426
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:36,560
i might notice if there's calmness anywhere else in the body like maybe the feet feel pretty relaxed

427
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:41,679
or i might tune into any tranquility that's in the space around me

428
01:11:41,679 --> 01:11:47,760
if i'm in a natural setting or a quiet room or a peaceful meditation hall

429
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:55,840
i might allow the mind to be soothed by the tranquility that's already here

430
01:11:58,400 --> 01:12:04,480
and then as with all the hindrances when the mind is free of restlessness

431
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:11,600
when calm is present let yourself be nourished by that don't miss that

432
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:19,120
okay our last hindrance the fifth hindrance is doubt

433
01:12:19,120 --> 01:12:24,400
this can manifest as doubt in the buddhist teachings does this really work

434
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:30,560
maybe i should have tried hinduism doubt in your teachers

435
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:35,600
doubt in the teachings doubt in yourself

436
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:41,198
can i really do this practice i'm not really any good at this

437
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:48,880
when doubt arises for the inside teacher greg scharf he says he feels like he's in the i'm

438
01:12:48,880 --> 01:12:56,000
not very good at this club you may relate and as i shared in my story earlier of

439
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:03,679
self-doubt it can be a powerful visitor self-doubt can be a powerful visitor

440
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,880
something that can help with this is remembering that you don't need to

441
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:14,239
judge or assess your progress on the path

442
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:19,840
that's actually extra and not necessary

443
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:26,159
if we go to a guitar lesson for the first time

444
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:32,239
we don't expect to be a grammy-winning musician the next day

445
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:38,239
and yet somehow when we sit down in meditation we can have the feeling like oh

446
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:45,600
i'm supposed to be peaceful and calm and tranquil all the time so re readjusting our expectations can

447
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:53,840
be quite helpful the antidote to doubt is faith

448
01:13:53,840 --> 01:14:01,040
another other words for faith are trust or confidence so faith doesn't resonate

449
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:07,600
for you these other words also work so can we trust that whatever

450
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:13,679
is arising is arising right on time

451
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:19,600
we are right on track can we trust the dharma can we trust the practice can we

452
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:25,760
have confidence in it if you struggle with doubt

453
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:32,719
build a daily faith practice this might involve reflecting on times

454
01:14:32,719 --> 01:14:38,960
that the dharma has supported you remembering times that you've felt

455
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:44,320
that the dharma has benefited you in some way reflect on times that you've had

456
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:51,120
confidence in yourself and in these ways it can bolster the mind

457
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:57,920
for some it's taking refuge in buddha dharma and sangha and connecting with faith in the triple

458
01:14:57,920 --> 01:15:04,480
gem that can bring faith so there's a lot of ways to do this you can borrow the faith of your

459
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:10,719
teachers if there's a teacher that you particularly admire and trust and maybe

460
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:18,560
you don't have a lot of faith but you can see that the practice is working in them you can borrow their faith

461
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:25,000
so have confidence in the practice by seeing how it's working in others

462
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:32,640
i saw a sign a while ago that said proceed as though success were

463
01:15:32,640 --> 01:15:39,440
inevitable and i don't think people proceed in that way very often

464
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:44,960
so what would it be like in our practice to proceed as though success were

465
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:52,000
inevitable so those are the five hindrances

466
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:59,360
and i'll review the antidotes for you so of course we start with recognizing

467
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:06,320
what's happening and feeling it exploring it in the body and then if that is

468
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:12,560
isn't accessible then we turn to these these antidotes so for sense desire

469
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:18,480
it's reflecting on and observing impermanence it's one of the antidotes

470
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:24,320
aversion or ill will it's meta loving kindness practice

471
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:30,560
for sloth intorper it's energy for restlessness it's calm or

472
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:37,920
tranquility and for doubt it's faith so those are our antidotes

473
01:16:38,480 --> 01:16:43,840
and as i come to a close here i want to say

474
01:16:43,840 --> 01:16:51,120
how important it is that we have a friendly attitude to the hindrances

475
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:56,159
as we do this practice it's so easy to judge ourselves when hindrances are a

476
01:16:56,159 --> 01:17:01,440
present so remember that it doesn't say anything

477
01:17:01,440 --> 01:17:07,600
about you as a person or as a meditator if the hindrances come for a visit

478
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:12,960
it can help to remember that the buddha was visited with the hindrances

479
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:18,400
up through his night of awakening so these are going to be around for a

480
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:25,760
while so if they're going to be around for a while you know if we can think of these as roommates that we may be living with

481
01:17:25,760 --> 01:17:32,239
forever that come and go from our house it could help to make friends with them to learn how

482
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:36,719
to be with them in a skillful way

483
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:42,960
i like to think of the hindrances as a valuable messenger that's come to teach

484
01:17:42,960 --> 01:17:50,800
us can we respect our hindrances as teachers teaching us how to love our

485
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:56,960
life our role is just to meet them

486
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:03,040
not as a diversion from our path but as the next stepping stone on the path

487
01:18:03,040 --> 01:18:08,159
itself and when we meet a hindrance with

488
01:18:08,159 --> 01:18:15,120
recognition curiosity patience kindness we're simultaneously

489
01:18:15,120 --> 01:18:20,320
growing a wholesome state so it doesn't matter that a hindrance is present if

490
01:18:20,320 --> 01:18:27,360
we're bringing wholesome states to it that's what we're cultivating if we're bringing mindfulness to it then we're cultivating

491
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:32,880
mindfulness so we can simultaneously work with the hindrance

492
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:40,400
and cult cultivate these really beautiful qualities so they're really an opportunity to grow the heart

493
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:47,440
the hindrances are ultimately the medium by which we wake up

494
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:53,040
so in a way learning to be with the hindrances without rejection

495
01:18:53,040 --> 01:19:00,480
is a radical act of inclusion it's a way we can make ourselves whole

496
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:08,880
so there's no part excluded everything here is allowed and welcome

497
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:16,159
so i'd like to close with a poem by izumi shikibu a female japanese poet

498
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:22,719
from the 10th century it's a short poem it goes like this

499
01:19:22,719 --> 01:19:31,120
watching the moon at dawn solitary mid sky

500
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:39,599
i knew myself completely no part left out

501
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:46,198
so let's sit together for a moment

502
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:13,040
watching the moon at dawn solitary

503
01:20:13,040 --> 01:20:19,840
mid sky i knew myself completely

504
01:20:19,920 --> 01:20:24,520
no part left out

505
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:42,520
