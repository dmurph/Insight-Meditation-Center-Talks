1
00:00:01,979 --> 00:00:04,159
foreign

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:15,059
good morning everyone and have a good day good evening for some of you maybe

3
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:22,820
good afternoon so

4
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:34,260
lately I've been thinking about the Town Square of a small square the

5
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:41,280
the and I wonder sometimes if this you know

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:48,300
YouTube It's kind of open to the world to come by and a little bit of a Town Square that

7
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:55,038
people come and visit and come through and everyone's invited

8
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:01,860
and I'm thinking about this meditation session with the metaphor of town square

9
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:08,820
imagine you're a traveler and you come to a small town looks like

10
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:15,659
a welcoming Town looks like people are happy to have visitors come through and

11
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:23,520
and so you come and make your way to the town square and and there have very comfortable benches

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,560
on that town square and you're happy to sit on the edge of the square and

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,740
and watch the comings and goings the Town Square

14
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:40,320
and it Marvels you all the different people and maybe animals and

15
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:47,159
activities that somehow come through show up in the town square stay for a

16
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:53,100
while leave and it seems like every Everything everyone has ability to use the Town Square as a

17
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,340
public space and there's no sense that anyone shouldn't be there that everyone feels looks like

18
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:08,119
they feel like they're quite happy to be there and comfortable and they belong and they can be themselves and

19
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:14,760
and um and it's lovely to watch the young the old the children

20
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:21,599
the lovers the you know people argue and

21
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,319
even maybe the people on political soap stands soapboxes so all this comes through it's all of

22
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,140
life comes through and um

23
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:40,920
and then at some point it Dawns on you as you look at everyone something seems unusual

24
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:46,680
you can't quite put your finger on it Until you realize

25
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,160
that all the people who come into the square they're all visitors

26
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,459
like you some of them might stay for a few days some of them are for a few weeks maybe

27
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:05,819
some of them a little bit longer but in fact everyone in the town everyone coming through are just

28
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:13,200
visitors and you realize you're a visitor

29
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,920
everything here is a visitor so in the same way

30
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,079
it might be useful to think of your capacity to be aware your mindfulness

31
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:35,099
as the Town Square that you keep open 24 hours a day kind

32
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,620
of kind of to keep it open and everything is welcome in into the town square into the

33
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:48,360
mindfulness your job is to make sure that you are sitting on that bench that

34
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,720
comfortable bench that allows you to be present and gaze upon all that

35
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,200
comes and maybe if you have a responsibility in that town square

36
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,799
as all visitors do perhaps is to be accepting

37
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:14,120
kind to all the visitors that come

38
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,280
so to think of mindfulness as a Town Square in which everything everything is

39
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:27,600
allowed to be to come through everything that comes through is allowed to be there everything's just a visitor

40
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,520
something stays longer than others

41
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:40,740
and um and your job is to know it to see it to be present and to keep

42
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:48,419
the Town Square available to everyone to keep keep this

43
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:53,520
town square as a place where all things could be

44
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:00,419
without you being for or against without being involved or interfering

45
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:06,139
with anything just aware just present

46
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:15,500
and perhaps this will give you a profound sense

47
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,440
of being at ease and at peace

48
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:28,680
because you know you're in the Town Square and you can just allow things to come

49
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:35,060
and go yourself all things all the ways that you are

50
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:43,520
so to assume a meditation posture

51
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:46,819
that is upright

52
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:53,960
literally or metaphorically

53
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:01,940
and to gently close your eyes

54
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:15,900
and to settle into your bench in the Town Square so you can relax and be present

55
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:20,600
taking a few long slow deep breaths

56
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:28,219
as you exhale it's settling in

57
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,380
relaxing

58
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:57,780
and letting your breathing return to normal perhaps you've actually come to the Town

59
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:05,699
Square early early in the morning before anyone else and you they find a broom to sweep it

60
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:12,180
clean to make it nice for people who come in the same way

61
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,280
relaxing your body is to sweep

62
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:26,599
and make it nice for all that's going to be there for you on the exhale relaxing the face

63
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:40,699
on the exhale relaxing the shoulders

64
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:57,139
relaxing the chest

65
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,360
relaxing the belly

66
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:24,379
maybe relaxing the whole body

67
00:08:24,599 --> 00:08:29,940
releasing holding

68
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:32,940
tightening

69
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:52,380
and then the comings and goings in this town square

70
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:59,240
include to include the comings and going of each inhale in each exhale

71
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:26,640
maybe their breathing can be like the pigeons

72
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:34,580
lying around and as you stay here

73
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,860
sooner or later all kinds of things will come to your awareness

74
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:48,920
Let It Come Let It Go Let It Be

75
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,920
but don't leave your bench don't leave and get involved

76
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,019
with anything just watch it just see it

77
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:08,779
from the vantage point of your bench as if

78
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:19,399
your attitude of acceptance of all of it is the very recipe

79
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:25,320
of providing a sense of freedom and homecoming

80
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,920
to whatever arises

81
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:36,299
foreign

82
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,740
foreign

83
00:27:06,419 --> 00:27:11,539
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

84
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:19,860
maybe to take a few moments with the perspective

85
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:26,299
that you're a visitor here in this world

86
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:35,419
and everything else everyone else is a visitor everything is a visitor

87
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,860
we all have this in common in the comings and goings of all things

88
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:44,179
just visitors

89
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:51,960
and with that perspective perhaps sitting on your bench watching in the

90
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:58,500
Town Square it might be a little easier

91
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:04,760
to gaze upon all the visitors kindly

92
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,919
caringly respectfully

93
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:15,240
maybe even reverently

94
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:29,039
men may be wishing aspiring

95
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:33,200
that your heart and your eyes

96
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:40,679
can look upon all people and all beings

97
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:48,000
with kindness that you can look upon all beings

98
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,580
with eyes that convey safety

99
00:28:55,980 --> 00:29:04,520
that you can be with all beings with a heart that radiates peace

100
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:14,419
that you can be present for others in a way they feel free to be themselves

101
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:21,960
May It Be that your gift to the world that you

102
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,898
Aspire that you give to this world were all visitors

103
00:29:27,779 --> 00:29:33,320
that you contribute kindness good will

104
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,480
safety Peace and Freedom

105
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:49,500
and may this meditation practice we've done today may it be that one way or another

106
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:55,919
it supports this aspiration to be this kind of person

107
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:02,778
in this world of that we live in

108
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:21,199
[Music]

109
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:26,480
thank you

110
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:48,840
so hello everyone I'm starting a new week with a new theme

111
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:55,080
and um I think maybe the title of the theme

112
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:02,820
that one word for the theme this week perhaps it can be the word meaning

113
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,880
and now too we'll want to spend this this week exploring the topic of meaning

114
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,559
in relationship to meditation what's the meaning of meditation

115
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,500
and I think in years past I would have been very hesitant to take up a topic like this

116
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:28,080
partly because coming out of my zen training the idea of assigning meaning or finding meaning was often presented

117
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,539
as being besides the point there was something very significant just showing up and being present

118
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:39,240
without inserting or meaning on top of our

119
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:46,320
experience in our life and I love this idea it was a radical Simplicity of

120
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:53,039
so much Falls away but I think we cannot get away from human life

121
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:59,460
human Minds somehow one way or the other whether it's conscious or unconsciously

122
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:05,880
being involved in the questions of meaning of purpose why are we here what's the

123
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:13,440
most important thing for us to do and so religions provide often sense of

124
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:20,399
meaning and purpose and interpretation of what it what's important what priorities are

125
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,500
what we do with suffering what's up what's the meaning of suffering what's the purpose in our life in relationship

126
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,740
to suffering and so what I thought I would like to do this week is that with the hope that

127
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:39,299
this topic gives a kind of depth to uh your involvement with meditation that it

128
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:47,039
gives kind of um uh it lets your meditation be fueled or

129
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:52,140
or founded on based on supported by

130
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:59,159
some of the deeper values deeper understandings you have maybe that you're not even conscious of that gives

131
00:33:59,159 --> 00:34:05,039
me meditation more motivation more strength more value more like grubby

132
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:12,240
toss in a sense and um and so we'll do that by looking at the

133
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:17,339
connection of meditation Association meditation can have to a variety of

134
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:24,300
different things in our life today I want to talk about suffering and I don't quite remember the sequence that I have

135
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:31,320
but I think neck tomorrow was the important values we have and then the connection to values the connection to

136
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:36,720
ourself the connection to others and the connection to what is might consider to

137
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:42,179
be sacred um so what's the meaning of meditation in

138
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:50,599
relationship to these important areas of life there was a tendency when this

139
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:56,099
mindfulness meditation that I'm teaching when it was brought to the United States

140
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:02,700
there was a very strong Wish by the teachers to make it very available to as

141
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:08,580
many people as possible without the hindrance or the this that

142
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:13,800
it might be there if it was the whole Buddhist religious package was brought

143
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:20,119
with it there was a idea that this mindfulness practice is a simple raw basic practice

144
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:25,740
is doesn't have to belong to any particular religion doesn't have to

145
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,900
belong to any particular philosophy maybe and wanting to make it this

146
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:36,300
practice available broadly and widely so it could benefit so many people

147
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:43,680
and in fact they succeeded in many ways because they inspired those first Buddhist teachers inspired Generations

148
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:50,099
now of people who offer mindfulness completely separated from Buddhism you know sometimes call it secular

149
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:55,560
mindfulness in clinical settings and all kinds of places and it's I think it's

150
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:00,660
been overall a wonderful contribution to society

151
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:06,240
and um and uh and I think there's some real

152
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:13,440
value in offering kind of a Buddhist Buddhism light where we don't kind of Pile in a lot of the Buddhist meaning

153
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:18,960
the Buddhist sense of purpose Buddhist religiosity that surrounds it and just

154
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:25,260
make it accessible to people easily and that's still the case but uh I'm but

155
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:31,740
I'm hoping that this the discussion this week will prompt you to not feel like

156
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,839
you have to adopt or adapt uh you know some Buddhist idea that might come

157
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:41,940
through here but rather it becomes a mirror the teaching for you to reflect

158
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:51,480
and think more deeply about your life maybe more deeply than you ever ever have for some of you about uh maybe the place of meaning and

159
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:57,119
what what meanings do you bring what purposes do you bring what is your understanding what it means to be a

160
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,000
human being in this world so perhaps this can be an example for or

161
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:11,000
a kind of a for the value that can be found is that um

162
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:16,140
someone might go to the doctor and the doctor says you know you're about to

163
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:23,160
have a heart attack and you're living with so much stress that I think you need to go and learn

164
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,740
some meditation so mindfulness is very helpful and there's a mindfulness center

165
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:36,540
nearby why don't you go there and learn to meditate because you know you're without stressing I don't think I don't

166
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:42,780
see that you're going to live more than a couple of months so that motivates the person and the person shows up at a meditation center

167
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:49,440
and learns mindfulness and and maybe the teacher there asks why are you here what's the purpose what's the meaning of

168
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:56,339
you being here and so you or this person might say um well my doctor sent me

169
00:37:56,339 --> 00:38:02,280
and uh therefore if it says a prescription end of story

170
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:07,700
and uh and then um the

171
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:14,099
the um but then you press for further you ask

172
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:20,520
the person the person you could ask or something the question further what um

173
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:26,460
what um but you know is that why the doctor send

174
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:32,280
you and um and that the um

175
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:38,760
the doctors and so because uh you know the doctor said that if I don't do it I'll die and I want you know

176
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:45,000
you know I don't want to die and the meaning of the meditation is not dying but then you go person you start

177
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:52,619
thinking about more or you're asked more questions and and so the question becomes um oh why do you want to live

178
00:38:52,619 --> 00:39:02,880
oh because I want to be able to see my grandchildren I want to be able to finish the work that I do I I love life

179
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:09,740
and I just want to be able to live it fully I'm afraid of death and I'm trying to put it off as much as I can

180
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:16,920
I um I feel like I haven't really dealt with my big issues in my life and I

181
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:24,060
really before I die I want to finish and deal with those issues is um so there's all kinds of so this thing

182
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:29,400
I didn't have the doctor says you have to go and meditate because otherwise you'll die it begins being connected to

183
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:35,339
other values other important ideas about why you should stay alive

184
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:41,700
and um and those can are animating forces there's a reasons

185
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:48,240
some people don't know why they're alive or the people don't have a meaning or purpose that they have

186
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:54,540
um and some people might do it because they've discovered that they can live much more peacefully if they don't have

187
00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:00,780
live searching or questioning or or getting all

188
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:05,820
wrapped up around issues of meaning purpose and they just you're happy just

189
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:11,460
to kind of Roll Along with whatever's happening then that becomes the meaning that

190
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:17,339
becomes the purpose just Roll Along just be present and the meaning is that the

191
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:23,280
meaning is a is a hindrance and it's just nicer just to roll along with things

192
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:29,720
um so to there's many so what's the meaning

193
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:36,180
what's the purpose what's their interpretation we have and so it just might be interesting for

194
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:42,060
some of you to know that um uh in in kind of classic or

195
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:47,460
quite uh there's a kind of standard terravan Buddhism that this tradition

196
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:55,200
comes out of I consider myself a taroten Buddhist and this role as teaching but I don't really uh have much place in

197
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:00,839
my heart or my mind for some of the core teachings that give meaning give a

198
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:07,440
purpose to teravan Buddhism some people will say this is the foundation of it some people say that without believing

199
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:12,480
in this there's no Buddhism even but I take exception of that in my sense

200
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:19,560
of meaning is very buddhistic I have some kind of an ultimate sense of meaning and purpose that comes from this

201
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:25,160
practice but I don't share some of the core things that some of the tradition has

202
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:32,339
so the I'm not motivated so the example would be I'm not motivated with idea

203
00:41:32,339 --> 00:41:37,579
that the purpose of this practice is so that we can we will no longer get Reborn

204
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:44,640
that doesn't speak to me doesn't inspire me doesn't have a place for me it's completely appropriate and fine for

205
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:51,660
someone else to have that view I don't have a issue with that but it's just not what animates me

206
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:59,160
um and um and uh and the idea of you know that I would the purpose is to no longer be

207
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:05,760
reborn it doesn't really do much for me and so but but do I have something else

208
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:13,140
that's comparable um I um if anything I feel

209
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:20,760
uh that it's enough for me the idea that to have a radical freedom

210
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,599
from suffering they really let go of suffering in some deep way and then live this life free of

211
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,780
the attachments the clinging that's motivating for me it's almost fundamental

212
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:38,820
but in the background of that there is some kind of idea that I don't hold very

213
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:46,859
tightly but some sense that of trusting life a feeling at home in this universe

214
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:54,359
and so this letting go of suffering letting go of clinging is also a homecoming into this universe where I'm

215
00:42:54,359 --> 00:43:00,720
no longer standing in opposition to it or or or making some problem with it so

216
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:07,680
these are all ways of making meaning a purpose of uh contextualizing interpreting what we're doing

217
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,740
so I want to just end here now with one of the things to find that people find

218
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:21,000
meaning in or purpose is in relationship to suffering and some people will inherit some

219
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:27,660
meaning of what suffering means what the purpose of suffering is from the religions they grew up with and there

220
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:33,060
are some religions that have a very important idea that's suffering is Redemptive that you're supposed to

221
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:39,060
suffer it's good to experience suffering because It prepares you for the hereafter

222
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:44,880
some people say that suffering is testing our religious faith and so we

223
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,300
have to kind of you know somehow hold on to our faith when we suffer that's the key thing about what we have to do and

224
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:57,960
we'll get rewarded if we hold on to our faith um and um and you know there's all kinds

225
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,720
of ideas people have um and um and in Buddhism the kind of

226
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:09,720
the meaning of suffering is that it's unnecessary and that it's motivating

227
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:18,300
in order to come to the other side of suffering to be free of suffering to radical Liberation from suffering

228
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:27,079
uh if there's a famous quote from the Buddha where he says I teach suffering and the end of suffering

229
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:33,119
um and why and suffering you might say there's no need to ask why just like you

230
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:39,359
take your hand off a hot stove uh you don't have to ask why you do it it's your body will do it immediately

231
00:44:39,359 --> 00:44:44,520
so it could be that simple uh like it's almost like a biological imperative to

232
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:51,119
be free of suffering but there might be other things there might be the idea that yes I Want to Be

233
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:57,060
Free of suffering so I can be a better support for the world around me I wanted

234
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:03,599
I Want to Be Free of my clinging so that I can act with uh act from a place of

235
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:09,960
compassion and care for this world take care of my family I want to become free of the kind of

236
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:17,640
sources great hate and delusion that bring about the suffering so that I can live a certain way or be a

237
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:27,020
certain way or do this and that um the um so what is your meaning

238
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:34,500
in terms of your meditation practice what's the purpose what's the role what's the meaning of suffering

239
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:40,800
uh how does suffering fit into it and how does that fit into a wider uh

240
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:47,400
Circles of meaning or deeper Circles of meaning in your life is simply just to

241
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:55,020
be free of suffering and that's enough or is there some deeper purpose that that serves some deeper value is it just

242
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:00,900
to kind of be free of stress so you don't have a heart attack or you know

243
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:06,240
what do you if you're free of suffering what what do you hope that will do for you

244
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:11,819
what is your aspiration what is your sense of purpose if you can become radically free of

245
00:46:11,819 --> 00:46:17,339
suffering or is suffering just kind of a free freedom from suffering and coping with

246
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:23,579
suffering kind of a little bit of a sideshow that you do reluctantly so you can get

247
00:46:23,579 --> 00:46:31,339
on to what's most important what is most important what is the most important kind of uh

248
00:46:31,339 --> 00:46:37,740
way in which you understand your life what your life's about what it means to be a human being

249
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:45,119
what is and what is suffering and freeing suffering how does that fit into that in your life

250
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:53,300
so I hope that this makes some sense for you and I'm hoping this as a catalyst for you to do some reflection

251
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:58,880
and I would encourage you if you have anyone friends family total strangers

252
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:05,700
that maybe you engage in this topic of meaning and purpose and what is the most

253
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:11,579
fundamental meaning and purpose that you have that you associate that you live by

254
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:19,818
um and how does meditation connect to that once they can meditate connection meditation might have to support that

255
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:25,619
so thank you and um and um

256
00:47:25,619 --> 00:47:30,200
we'll continue these reflections over this week
