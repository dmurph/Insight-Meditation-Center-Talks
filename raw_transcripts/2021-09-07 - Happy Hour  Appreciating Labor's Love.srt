1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,640
so so formally hello and welcome

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,160
to happier dear sangha so

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,359
today in the united states

4
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:24,400
is um a holiday this is a holiday weekend and this monday is a holiday and it's

5
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,480
it's called labor day it's the day to celebrate labor the working

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:37,200
working force with working the labor of all all who labor who work so

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,559
so with that that's kind of a very uh general description of the holiday

8
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:51,360
and um so [Music] so

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:58,719
for the given that particular theme what i wanted to to use that theme

10
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:06,400
but but change it shift it um for us to um

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:15,439
to practice appreciation appreciation and gratitude for all labor for all work all

12
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,960
gifts um both all the

13
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,479
the labor all the the gifts that anyone has given us

14
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:33,360
both knowingly and unknowingly um as well as appreciating our own labor

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,000
and the word labor perhaps is kind of laborious it sounds a little heavy

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,119
but um but maybe we can think of it

17
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,920
as something light for example you know i'm wearing this this this shirt here

18
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,880
because of so many people's contribution so many people's contributions

19
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,758
around the world that this shirt has made its way

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,720
providing um support from the elements to this body there's

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,560
been the designer there's been the person who has produced it you know

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:24,080
if it's cotton you know the person who's who's the farmer who's

23
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,360
produced the cotton etc etc all these contributions all these human contributions

24
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,360
and also it closer to home all of us every single one of us are

25
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:45,599
us human beings whether we've had um parents who've been loving or not as

26
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:52,080
caring and yet for the first four years of our lives all of us human beings

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:58,480
are [Music] pretty dependent we're actually completely dependent on the care of

28
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:05,200
others so it has taken a lot of labor has taken a lot of labor

29
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,380
for us to even survive to make it to this point

30
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:17,200
[Music] so [Music] appreciating the labor the contributions

31
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:24,799
of of people who have supported us friends as well as maybe coaches etc etc and as

32
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,319
well as our own labor our own contributions our on our own work

33
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:34,560
our own practice our own

34
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,280
maybe studying or work or whatever we have done to make to bring us to this

35
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:48,720
point and for the practice today the invitation is to turn off our judgment this is not the time

36
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,840
to start judging of course the judgmental mind can be there but we can

37
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,720
choose we have a choice we have a choice which way to go and if we notice that

38
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,319
we've gone down the road of judging others well they didn't work so hard and

39
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:13,200
they should have done more like why would we come back we are intending we are inclining our mind

40
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,280
towards appreciation we're cultivating appreciation

41
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:27,280
this is the work we're doing right now there might be another time for discernment um etc etc but right right right now

42
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,199
given that our minds tend to be more judgmental than appreciative

43
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:40,240
normally we are going to choose to strengthen the muscle of appreciation

44
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,160
and again not to say there is not a time for discernment et cetera et cetera and that has a right

45
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:53,120
place and time but not judgment there is there is a um sharpness there is a

46
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:59,360
acerbicness in judgment that that is not helpful doesn't serve

47
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:05,759
similarly for ourselves when we turn today to appreciate ourselves

48
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,199
don't start unleashing all kinds of

49
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,479
judgments and self-recommendations onto yourself to evaluate everything you've done

50
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,199
as a shortcoming turn your mind towards appreciating appreciating what what has been done

51
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,199
what what you've been able to do so so that is the frame that is the frame

52
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,120
for today's practice and i've spoken enough so so let's turn

53
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,880
let's turn to [Music] practice appreciation for all our labors

54
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:53,000
and everyone else is together and i'll lead us as usual so let's let's begin

55
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,939
[Music]

56
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:07,840
let's begin by landing by landing in this body

57
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,280
landing in this breath

58
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:35,840
and letting go in this moment choosing to let go choosing to put down

59
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,440
what is not helpful what doesn't serve in this moment

60
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:46,520
and softening relaxing into the body

61
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,479
relaxing softening into the breath clear sit bones

62
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,680
allowing your spine to have a sense of integrity to be

63
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,120
upright rising up from your sit bones

64
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:33,599
from the stable base sitting with integrity

65
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:42,680
tall yet relaxed the muscles soft and relaxed

66
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,120
as always we start with settling arriving

67
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,760
just this

68
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:27,640
breath received in the abdomen in this moment in time

69
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,000
just taking cherishing this moment as a moment of

70
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,560
refuge

71
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,199
connecting with the breath in the body

72
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:31,399
in this moment

73
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:11,680
as we receive the breath each in breath each out breath

74
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:18,600
appreciating this body

75
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:31,240
and the way it works the way it functions all the internal functions

76
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:38,240
it's not just the breath

77
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:48,279
the autonomous nervous system functioning

78
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,880
all the chemical biological functions

79
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:15,480
systems actions

80
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:29,000
that support this being who is me who is us

81
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:37,720
functioning

82
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:51,680
without thinking about it too much just receiving the breath

83
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,360
and what is whatever sensations

84
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:06,680
reveal themselves present themselves to you

85
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:25,720
and as we connect with the breath with the body so connecting with appreciation

86
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:33,199
for this body functioning working

87
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:39,320
as well as it does which may not be perfect

88
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,360
breathing digestion hearing

89
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:18,080
seeing tasting smelling touching

90
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:23,600
healing etc

91
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,480
so many functions

92
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:35,000
to be grateful for

93
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:09,799
and now turning turning your awareness or attention

94
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:18,640
to someone someone who's easy in our life maybe a parent maybe a teacher a coach

95
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,519
a benefactor someone who's been there for us

96
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:38,200
we feel gratitude appreciation for their work for their labor

97
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:51,960
perhaps previously unappreciated or unseen unacknowledged

98
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,200
and letting a sense of appreciation for their work for their contributions

99
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,840
for their labor to be an open-hearted one

100
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,840
it's a gift that may be continuing or was

101
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:37,600
previously gifted and by receiving it graciously continuing to receive

102
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,600
openheartedly

103
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:49,158
we honor the gift honor the labor

104
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:56,240
honor the contribution receiving it wholeheartedly

105
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:59,480
with appreciation

106
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,000
and you're welcome to invite more benefactors if you wish

107
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:47,000
in this circle of appreciation

108
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,960
spending time with each person

109
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:10,799
not jumping quickly from one to the next which can get the mind a little

110
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:17,559
unsettled if we jump too quickly spending a little bit of time with each

111
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:46,159
i remember it's not the time to get judgmental and consider all the shortcomings but to be

112
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:54,600
generous cultivate generosity in seeing the good

113
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:59,480
cultivating generosity and the appreciation

114
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:57,360
and now if you wish expanding the circle of appreciation

115
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:09,600
to categories of beings maybe all farmers all farmers in the world

116
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:24,960
all fruit pickers vegetable pickers etc etc

117
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,960
all farm laborers all over the world who've had

118
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:38,720
any hand supported

119
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:48,120
the food you eat have eaten so many people so many beings

120
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:01,559
maybe bringing to mind just one or two

121
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:40,159
maybe appreciating the work of

122
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:46,080
all drivers in the world everyone working in transportation

123
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,320
supporting the movement of food of goods

124
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:12,440
feeling the interconnection with so much of humanity

125
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:53,960
maybe choosing another category it's meaningful to you maybe from your

126
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:59,760
profession all those who've laid the foundation

127
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:04,720
for what you do or maybe all writers

128
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:10,600
whose writing whose work you have appreciated

129
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,760

00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:36,640
um do i just speak yes please okay um

173
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,960
well where i went to in my mind was with my grandmother and my

174
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,720
sister who were um carers for me in the absence of my mother

175
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:55,280
and i got in touch with so much love that i uh experienced as a child

176
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,560
that i hadn't um really reflected on in that way

177
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,960
um and so then when i extended that to a group it was

178
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:13,200
uh women that have given birth because we all came and that's labor right because

179
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,640
we all came from from someone that gave birth to us so um

180
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:24,000
we had this all in common and then the next group were

181
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:29,599
teachers and because i saw their influence on me in my life

182
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:35,040
and i really did see because i'm a teacher now a high school teacher i really did see

183
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:42,000
the connection between the care i received from these women in my life then um all the

184
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:49,520
mothers and then the teachers and now what i do and oh it was beautiful big web of interconnectedness

yeah the labor labors of the buddha it wasn't easy for him

195
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,560
the story goes that after he was awakened he didn't want to teach it just it was too

196
00:42:56,560 --> 00:43:02,560
hard he thought nobody's going to get what i want to teach so

197
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,079
and it was hard and all the the lineage all the teachers and all the

198
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:14,240
practitioners and being practitioners yourself you know that yes sometimes practice is nourishing and rewarding

199
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:20,160
sometimes it's it's hard it's challenging it's difficult so

209
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,520
hand i usually don't hear there we go

210
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,440
i have difficulty uh and can you hear me yeah

211
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:36,720
okay i have difficulty with one thing which is that my contributions have been huge i know

212
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,240
them uh think about it in so many ways um

213
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:49,119
but it would be nice to have something recognized at some point you know yeah i

214
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:55,680
just uh it's just there's just i i'm not it's not about that it's just like

215
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:01,440
uh i'm a really good friend to someone or it's i go through life

216
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:08,800
and and not feeling um [Music] and just like being there

217
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:15,760
and i just heard this thought that that may be a healing thought for me the previous speaker talked about his own

218
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,960
expansiveness of heart maybe

219
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:27,680
it may be within me being closed off and [Music]

220
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:35,040
not seeing others appreciation of me or something like that i don't

221
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:41,280
diana i think you i i love how you circled around you know your insight

222
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:46,880
as you're speaking out loud into oh yeah maybe that maybe that's what

223
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:52,000
needs a little more leaning into and opening up to

224
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,640

229
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:28,720
pleaser and uh you know that was it was i was really looking for a lot of recognition and it wasn't until i

230
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:35,359
started a lot of self-compassion practice and started to really um appreciate myself for who i am and

231
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:40,880
appreciate kind of you know what i've accomplished that i stopped looking externally for that validation

to be a teacher either but when he was given the gift from his teacher

249
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:40,240
he taught us to honor his own teacher but a lot of times he didn't want to be

there but he did it in honor of his teacher and i have a lot of respect and love for him because of that
