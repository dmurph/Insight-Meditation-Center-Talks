1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:17,920
so good day to everyone and welcome to this meditation

2
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:31,840
there are times especially when i was a relatively new meditator that i had two different

3
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:39,040
things i would tell myself about meditation and different times different ones and

4
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,840
the kind of mindsets that i had for it and one of them was um

5
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,600
and that is in particular i use these when things were challenging if i had a lot of physical pain or something that

6
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,399
was difficult to be present for

7
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:06,000
and if the first one one i would say

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,720
to myself moment by moment that i would just be present for this

9
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,520
moment and then the next moment and i'd be try to be content with just

10
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:26,159
being here for this for this and that would be um and then i can

11
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:34,000
somehow if it was just this moment that's all there was then i could be with a difficulty

12
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:41,920
the other thing that i would do is say to myself what if this is forever

13
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:49,200
whatever was happening what was this this was it and i suppose it could be

14
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:56,159
the reason to despair or be depressed or something but for me when i'm when i said that

15
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:03,360
what if this is forever then there was no reason to fight it no

16
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,840
reason to try to change it or try to escape it which is okay this is what i have to

17
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:16,239
accept and that also would loosen up something in my mind that would also make it easier for me

18
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,480
okay this is this is what i'm going to stay stay here for so those two mindsets

19
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:30,720
are used sometimes and the consequence of both of them was a kind of uh

20
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:37,440
just okay this is it i'm just going to steadily do my practice show up be present

21
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,000
in an ongoing way and this ongoingness okay this is what i'm doing

22
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:51,040
this is where i am and uh so if there was real if sometimes that wasn't so difficult to do

23
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:56,720
if things were going well but you know there were all kinds of times when it wasn't going so easily and

24
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,519
but just okay this is what i'm doing and this kind of inspiration to the ongoing step by step

25
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:12,080
by step or breath by breath moment by moment just this just this and this taught me to set the

26
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,159
course it taught me not to be so caught up in goals and trying to achieve things and

27
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:25,280
trying to change my experience or get away from it and it taught me to really appreciate to

28
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,400
value to even enjoy the momentariness of each moment of

29
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:38,400
showing up being here being here being here and as i you know and then

30
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:45,360
sometimes as i got into that then there started to be kind of a flow in in the present moment this movement

31
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,799
with the present moment ongoing is that at some point felt like

32
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:57,439
more like i was carried by the present moment rather than having to show up for the present moment

33
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:05,200
but this you know this steady it's very simple calm

34
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:14,879
kind of a modest approach to meditation just the ordinary ongoingness of this

35
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:22,560
moment this moment not making it complicated not making it looking for something

36
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:30,000
grand and wonderful not belittling anything not

37
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:37,199
denying anything not criticizing anything not being in some ways for or against

38
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,720
anything just the ongoingness it's kind of like

39
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,400
going for a walk up the mountain where there's all kinds of things on the mountain

40
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:55,759
difficult things to see easy think wonderful things to see [Music] steep difficult places rocket territory

41
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,759
smooth easy places to walk but if it's a long long way up to the top of the mountain

42
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:08,639
it's just the ongoing step then step and step and step so

43
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:15,680
the ongoingness of practice the ongoingly ongoing the momentariness

44
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:19,120
of each moment of practice

45
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,080
so to prepare yourself for that journey

46
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:39,680
establish yourself in a posture that seems conducive to remembering

47
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:48,160
to be present a posture that supports you or

48
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:54,720
guides you into being present for your experience

49
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:03,840
and so perhaps a posture that is a little in a bit intentional

50
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:11,600
a little bit like you're really in the posture

51
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,960
a little bit more slightly more alert than usual

52
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:24,160
not over emphasizing being relaxed and comfortable

53
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,479
but not looking to be uncomfortable either

54
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,840
but so there's a little bit of intentionality

55
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:49,840
and gently close your eyes

56
00:06:50,960 --> 00:07:03,840
and then gentling yourself in your body a gentling of your inner life

57
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,520
maybe a few deeper breaths maybe today

58
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:20,240
deep enough to be half of how full you can breathe

59
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,720
a little bit more than you would without effort but little effort to fill your br

60
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:34,639
fill your lungs and then that gentle releasing of all

61
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:42,960
that on the exhale so here too there's an intentionality

62
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,758
in how you're breathing for a few breaths

63
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:59,840
and the intentionality of the practice is a way of gathering yourself in the present moment

64
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,599
and then letting your breathing return to normal

65
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:14,800
and part of this intentionality is the intentional activity of relaxing

66
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:27,840
to soften and relax the muscles of your face

67
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:41,839
to soften and relax

68
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:55,600
your shoulders

69
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:09,839
to soften and relax your belly

70
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:23,839
and then becoming aware of your body breathing

71
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,640
and here with each breath each inhale in each exhale

72
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,560
settling in for the ongoingness

73
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:48,880
of one moment at a time of attention one moment after another

74
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:55,120
one step in a sense in the ongoing journey

75
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:05,839
of being present here and here and now

76
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:12,320
and to bring a little bit of relaxed intentionality

77
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:19,680
a sense of purpose or dedication maybe even devotion

78
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,560
to calmly steadily

79
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:36,240
going on with being here now with this with this

80
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,320
perhaps being supported by the ongoingness of breathing

81
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:52,639
breathing keeps breathing over and over again

82
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:02,720
there to remind you to be present moment by moment

83
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,839
ongoingly

84
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:47,840
being mindful of the ongoingness of mindfulness

85
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:59,039
this simple calm ongoingness of

86
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,120
now and now

87
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:15,840
and now

88
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,840
so

89
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:53,919
as we come to the end of this sitting i'd like to apply

90
00:24:53,919 --> 00:25:05,200
the idea of ongoingness of practice to kindness to ongoing kindness

91
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,159
and one orientation that has supported me in

92
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:20,559
this regard is to imagine that

93
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,840
kindnesses can be very simple and modest

94
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:40,400
that it can be a simple interior attitude that i carry with me ongoingly

95
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:46,720
without needing to express it externally

96
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:53,200
in words or in deeds and just giving myself that permission

97
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,480
not to need to express it externally

98
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:08,840
it makes it easier to be devoted to it

99
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:15,840
internally not to give it up not to allow it to be

100
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:22,840
an ongoingness an ongoing friendliness

101
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,880
or ongoing warm-hearted caringness

102
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:39,840
that's not dramatic maybe unnoticed by others

103
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:49,840
and the ongoingness is to be very careful not to sacrifice it or give it up

104
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:56,559
easily but to stay

105
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,039
in the simplicity of private feeling of kindness

106
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,480
as you go through with the day

107
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:17,360
an interior feeling of good will or caringness

108
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:24,799
and so in this way knowing that it doesn't have to be

109
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:33,200
expressed externally maybe it's easier to end the sitting

110
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,679
with a wish for the welfare and happiness for others

111
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:49,279
may whatever benefit that has come from this meditation today

112
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:56,879
may it keep each of us close to an interior kindness

113
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,360
of wishing all beings to be happy

114
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,480
wishing all beings to be safe

115
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:17,840
wishing all beings to be peaceful

116
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,720
in wishing all beings to be free

117
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:33,278
and that we in simple appropriate ways

118
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:43,279
stay close to this wish open to the possibility of contributing

119
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:59,840
to the welfare of others may all beings be happy

120
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,000
so

121
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:31,200
this morning there'll be another day of uh storytelling from the discourses

122
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:38,720
of the buddha and this time some of the story will be constructed out of the

123
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:44,720
evidence the pieces that are there it seems that for the most part

124
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:50,960
the people who composed these earliest discourses of the called earliest discourses of the buddha

125
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,279
weren't particularly interested in history or even biography weren't really doing

126
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:04,000
much of a biography of the buddha but there are all these little snippets of stories that exist

127
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:09,279
and some of them we can then connect the dots and understand a little

128
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:15,039
bigger piece of the history of the times the life of the buddha

129
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:21,440
and so i'm going to tell some of this what comes from the early discourses some of its piecing pieces together and

130
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:26,480
some of it comes from a little bit later the commentaries

131
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,000
that also tried to piece some provide the bigger context for some of these stories

132
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,919
and um and a piece of what um inspires this uh this little discussion today

133
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:47,600
is uh some of the work of steven batchelor who's done some of this work of also piecing together some of the evidence

134
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:54,880
so it has to do with the end of the buddha's uh life the context that his times that

135
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:02,559
he was uh coming that were that he was you know in his last year of his life

136
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:09,120
and what we begin seeing if we start looking at the pieces is that the society around him much of what the

137
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:14,240
society he knew and his people he was close to were dying

138
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,760
or were the societies were beginning to fall apart and

139
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:28,159
war was it was happening and kings were being usurped um from power and uh the buddha's own

140
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:34,000
disciples the senior closest disciples that were dying this last year of his life

141
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:40,799
and um and so and the buddha seemingly through it all was calm was peaceful died very

142
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:46,159
peacefully under some trees and this contrast between the

143
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:54,320
kind of i call it the society falling apart around him and his peacefulness is quite a contrast

144
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:00,960
and and maybe it's something that's also relevant for all human times and

145
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:08,398
it seems like maybe almost every generation thinks that the world is falling apart around them

146
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:15,039
so this piecing things together begins with

147
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:20,159
um um maybe

148
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:26,080
uh in the last year of the buddha's life maybe when he was about 80 and i think

149
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:32,399
it says that in this in the text that the king come the king comes to talk to the buddha and the king says you know both of us

150
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:38,080
are 80 years old so buddha is up in his home country sakya

151
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:44,720
up in the foothills of the himalayas in parts of nepal

152
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:50,320
and he was magnus on retreat or just living quietly there in his old age

153
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:58,880
and uh nearby was another kingdom of um where there was a king pasanidi

154
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:05,039
who uh they had been friends for 40 years early in the buddha's teaching career they were at the same

155
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:10,880
age they were same age and they had struck up a friendship and for 40 years they had her

156
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:19,200
they had 46 years or something they had seen each other periodically and and were considered friends and

157
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:24,960
the senate personality was also a student very devoted to the buddha

158
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:30,559
and um this king uh in his uh was out and about and

159
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:37,120
wanted to visit the buddha maybe one last time in their old age and uh so he went with

160
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:44,399
his um minister who he apparently trusted and um and they rode into close to where

161
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,360
the buddha was in the forest and

162
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:56,000
the king got off his horse or his elephant whatever he was riding and then he had said he said to his

163
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:01,519
minister i'm going to go in there and see the buddha alone and here

164
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,919
hold these things and he handed over to the minister all the insignia all the paraphernalia

165
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,520
that represented the power of the king of the king his sword his

166
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:21,358
maybe his crown or his turban and different things that he had that were represented his authority and the minister was a

167
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,040
little bit perturbed like what's going on here some secret plan uh uh that he doesn't

168
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:34,560
want me to be there and hear what's going to be talking about and and so he was a little bit suspicious about what's up what was happening

169
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:39,599
and then um the buddha the king goes into the forest and sees the buddha and

170
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:44,878
and um the king gives almost like a eulogy for the buddha it's almost like he

171
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:52,000
is going to see it maybe one last time and he's he speaks so in a high praise of the buddha

172
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,280
and um and that's the end of the story oh that's the suit that just ends right there

173
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:03,680
um but so the buddha is you know 80 years old old man

174
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:09,920
and then we have another discourse that has to do with the last it's called usually called the

175
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:16,000
english the last days of the buddhist life it's the story of his passing away and

176
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:22,000
that's a little bit more of a chronology over many months actually but it begins with the buddha being

177
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:27,280
almost about as far away from his home country as he could be in the in the world that

178
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:32,480
he lived in it in northern india and maybe some 300 miles i'm not sure

179
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,240
exactly how many but quite far so here was a man who was 80 years old

180
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,640
who had been in his home country and then some time later and then

181
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:49,839
over the next year we don't know exactly when he was 300 miles away

182
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:56,240
in uh and far to the south and i think the bay of near the bay of bengal something like that

183
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:04,560
and um near what's now called patali putra i think and and so how did he get there and why

184
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,200
did he go there but this one the story begins almost begins with the story of the buddha now

185
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:18,480
walking back home so he came all the way down this 300 miles

186
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,520
only to kind of more seemingly turn around and go back up back home to his home country

187
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:33,200
and and what was you know what why why such a quick trip so the piecing it together

188
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:39,119
one idea is that the the minister of the king who took all

189
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:44,160
the king's paraphernalia what the commentaries say

190
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:51,280
is that the king this minister had a little bit resentment for the king and so he what left and abandoned the

191
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:57,119
king there in the forest and left him with a horse and one attendant

192
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:03,760
and went back to the capitol and handed the the symbols of of power to the king's

193
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,760
son who thereby usurped the throne and the king came out of the forest

194
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,440
without anything really except a horse and so he went down to visit the other

195
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:21,440
king at this place where the buddha was ended up going

196
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:27,680
and the other king was his relative i think it was a son-in-law or his cousin or something

197
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:34,400
and they had been at war with each other over those 40 years time but they also had made

198
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,920
some enough peace and there were relatives and and the king pessaneti had nowhere else to go

199
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:47,280
supposedly so he went down to see his relative the other king and so he made this long trip himself as

200
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,880
an old man and he apparently was not in very good shape they some of the texts say that he was kind

201
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,599
of fat and and a little bit lazy and so he made this long trip and he came to the capitol where this other

202
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:06,400
king ajata satu the one who'd killed his father the story i told earlier

203
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,920
was raining and he came at night and so the city gates were closed and so he stayed

204
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,920
into some place slept in some home or hall or something outside and then he died

205
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,440
that night the piecing this together it seems that

206
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,800
the buddha knew about this that his friend the king had been usurped and

207
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:37,520
headed south so the buddha followed maybe to offer support for the king or

208
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:42,640
to intervene or some something but when he arrived at the

209
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,119
capitol his friend had died so there was not much reason to head

210
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:57,520
back home to stay there so the buddha then started marching home but before he did ajata satu

211
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:03,359
sent a minister his minister to talk to the buddha and said i'm thinking about attacking

212
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:08,800
the neighboring country the country that's between ajato sato's country

213
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,839
and the buddha's home country the place that buddha had often

214
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:20,720
and it was kind of a republic it wasn't really run by a king it was um and um

215
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:26,000
and that and the buddhists and he asked them yeah the minister said uh do you have any advice for us about

216
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,640
what do you think of this us attacking and conquering this neighboring country and the buddha gives some advice and i

217
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,920
won't tell you what he said because of the time and

218
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:45,680
and so he prevented he prevented the war then and there but in fact he gave in

219
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:51,040
giving his advice about how why he shouldn't attack the buddha

220
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:56,800
unintentionally gave the clue for what it what what the king had to do in order to

221
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:05,040
attack the neighboring country which he did then three years later successfully as the buddha then

222
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,560
got up to leave and start heading north to his home country he passed he was going to cross a river

223
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:16,480
and there he saw another minister of the king ajata satu who was beginning to lay down

224
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:23,359
the the ramparts or the walls for a great new fort in preparation

225
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:29,119
for war so here war is at war is at hand war preparations are

226
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:34,640
going on the buddha begins walking north and he describes himself

227
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:42,560
as an old man and i wanted to read you this um description the buddha gives of himself

228
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:53,839
and um

229
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:59,680
buddha says himself that

230
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:09,280
i am now old worn out venerable one who has traversed life's

231
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:15,280
path i've reached the term of life which is 80.

232
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,720
just as an old cart is made to go by being held together by straps

233
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:28,880
so that the tagata's body is kept going by being strapped up it is only when

234
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,520
i meditate deeply that this body my body knows

235
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:41,040
comfort is at ease so here's a person who's 80 in the

236
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:46,319
ancient world who's being held together by straps and bodies

237
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:51,680
falling apart in other words and he's in pain and uh only in

238
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:57,119
meditation is he free of his pain back then they had no pain medication

239
00:41:57,359 --> 00:42:03,839
and he's walking this old man is walking he's in pain

240
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:09,359
his minister his close friend his king had just been usurped and had died

241
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:15,920
the other king is about to conquer a country that had embraced the buddha and had been a kind of a place that

242
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:22,720
would have lived a lot and it was and that was being attacked they were getting ready to attack it

243
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:29,040
and in this long walk across back north to his home country he learns that his two closest disciples

244
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:35,680
had died one had been killed by bandits and the other had just died and buddha keeps walking

245
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,680
and at some point he gets diarrhea or dysentery he's quite sick with lots of pain

246
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:48,560
and he gets revived enough and he's heading home but at some point he realizes he's going

247
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:57,119
to die he doesn't reach home and he finds two magnificent trees to lay down underneath and he lays

248
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:03,359
there and that never to get up again and there he lays and

249
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:09,599
spends his last time teaching his disciples and then he carefully asks them do you

250
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:16,720
have any other questions for me before i die no one asks anything and so the buddha

251
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,880
finally says his last words

252
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:30,800
be all things are impermanent

253
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:37,520
everything is impermanent practice diligently

254
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:45,520
carry on diligently ongoingly carry on

255
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:52,079
and then he dies and he dies by going into deep meditation states

256
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:58,240
and goes as deep as uh possible in in the what's possible through meditation and

257
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:04,560
then he begins coming out and then in the fourth jhana which is one of the most sublime places

258
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:12,480
to be maybe the ideal place in which to die his life passed away and this image of

259
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,720
this man peacefully dying at peace with himself surrounded by his disciples giving his

260
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:24,160
last teachings and then peacefully going into the one last journey

261
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:31,280
in his deep meditation states and in those states his life goes and passes away and all

262
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:36,880
around him so he's spiritually easy in his inner life is deeply at peace and

263
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:43,440
peaceful setting in the woods under trees but all around him

264
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:50,079
kings are being usurped war is about to happen people are dying the

265
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:55,280
buddha's he's an old man sick in pain

266
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,800
walking up you know through india and he doesn't reach home he's trying to get back to his home

267
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,400
country so the juxtaposition

268
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:13,359
of a world out of kilter and the buddha

269
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:18,800
at peace this is the end of the buddha's time his

270
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:24,079
life so what we think about that and how we

271
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:32,000
live with that and understand that in relationship to our own life perhaps the the

272
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:40,079
the buddha said as his last words can apply to our us as well all things are impermanent

273
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:47,839
practice diligently so thank you
