1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:08,599
so so hello and welcome to this uh fourth guided meditation on

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:14,040
mindfulness of emotions and what I'd like to uh start with

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,320
today is uh using a kind of a

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:27,199
analogy we can say uh in English uh uh we use the distinction between the

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,920
words listening and hearing someone might direct you to listen to something

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:40,680
and and then intentionally you turn your attention to listening to and um or you can you can hear

7
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:48,199
something without the intention to to hear and uh these two words overlap but

8
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:54,559
hearing is more likely used for something which is more receptive and maybe

9
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:01,960
unintentional we hear a sound and then we're interested what is going on and so we listen carefully and the listening is

10
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:08,479
the more the effort to be engaged the same thing with um seeing

11
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:16,320
and looking uh someone doesn't say uh someone might say see here but um if

12
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:23,560
you're more the usual instructions is to look um and so in the way I'm talking

13
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:28,880
about today trying to highlight the difference between two different ways of

14
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:35,479
uh using our eyes is to see one there's more a natural receptivity where we see

15
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:41,560
what's happening without um trying to see and the other

16
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:48,759
is seeing by trying to see intentionally to look and so when we practice

17
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:55,880
meditation uh both are activated and both are fine but there is a kind of a

18
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:04,520
orientation or a leaning towards the part that is more receptive more um not trying to make

19
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:12,000
something happen so if we're sensing the body breathing if we're

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:21,000
sensing The Body Sensations the idea is to not be so much in the control tower trying to sense or

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,840
making making kind of a kind of extra mental effort to really feel well what's

22
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:33,080
going on but rather to put ourselves in a situation where we can really sense

23
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,640
receive uh in an open way the sensations and

24
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,519
um so um on this topic this week of

25
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:51,280
emotions uh in that in this way we want to uh receive the

26
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:58,560
sensations and and and nice mode for being with our emotions is to listen to

27
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:06,720
them the the way we would listen not the way we would um the way we would uh um

28
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,159
no we would hear we would uh hear them we allow they

29
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:18,120
come we wouldn't direct ourselves to kind of strain there's no strain

30
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:27,280
involved uh it's just kind of allowing ourselves the this the emotions to be heard to hear deeply what's there so I

31
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:34,760
don't know if this distinction makes so much sense to all of you but um the idea of

32
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:41,239
receptively uh being open and to hear to listen to the emotions as if there's

33
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:47,959
something profound to hear there for some people that gets their their um

34
00:03:47,959 --> 00:03:54,720
self-consciousness out of the way their efforts to try to fix or make something happen out of the way it's a way of

35
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:00,640
allowing the emotion to be there uh giving a permission to be there

36
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,840
uh while also being available to hear to

37
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:13,840
feel to find out what's going on here and more deeply so it'd be akin to sitting on a

38
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,639
sitting with a friend and who just wants to be heard and you just are an active

39
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,040
listener you're present hearing allowing it to come but you're not involved in

40
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:33,720
trying to fix or or um question question or interfere with your friend you might

41
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:39,759
indicate that you're listening well and Nod and say yes or I hear you or maybe

42
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:45,400
sometimes repeat back what you hear but you're just a a really good listener and that's all they

43
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,639
need and so with emotions mindfulness of emotions we're trying to shift the

44
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:58,320
orientation from any tendency we might have to be judging them to be preferring

45
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:04,960
one over the other to be uh resistant to them to kind of approach them as if

46
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:12,560
they're a problem and I have to fix them and if I just bring mindfulness to it this difficult emotion will go away the

47
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:21,199
idea is to approach it more um with the capacity to allow it to be there and I

48
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,600
use that word capacity very carefully we're trying to increase our

49
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,960
capacity to sense feel hear

50
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:39,639
see uh whatever is happening in uh um without interfering with it and and by

51
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:45,840
doing so to be able to see it deeply to hear it deeply to feel it deeply to see

52
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:52,000
you know so that it reveals something deeper about itself and one of the simplest things it

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,160
reveals is that it's some way or other is always changing and to see a

54
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:05,400
change uh makes it easier not to be kind of stuck around it and and a fixed view

55
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,400
or reaction to it it's easier than maybe to allow it just to change to unfold

56
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:17,400
give it room to do what it wants so to increase

57
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:24,240
capacity so we'll begin this uh this uh meditation with a small Act of

58
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:32,840
imagination and then uh we'll go into this a little bit more deeply so assume a meditation

59
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:42,680
posture and gently close your

60
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:54,039
eyes and before doing anything else before taking some deep breaths and

61
00:06:54,919 --> 00:07:00,039
relaxing spend a few moments feeling or

62
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:07,639
listening deeply what is here for you how are

63
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,599
you and one way to increase the capacity to hold and be with whatever is here for

64
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:28,400
you is to imagine that you're in a very very large

65
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:36,039
space big Cathedral like room or a vast

66
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:45,680
landscape and whatever way you're feeling is clearly a one part of a

67
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,879
vastness all

68
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:57,039
around maybe looking into the night sky and you still feel just the way

69
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,720
you're feeling but the vastness of the night

70
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:13,520
sky it both highlights how you're feeling and it's it's like there's a vast room for it to be just the way you

71
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:24,479
are do you be quiet and still spacious with how you

72
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,839
are as if a awareness is the vast

73
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:37,880
Sky within which how you are is

74
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,320
known in the vast Sky nothing is a

75
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,720
problem it's just a piece of the

76
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,680
whole and then in the middle of it all breathing

77
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,880
in and breathing

78
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:18,959
out and as you exhale to relax soften the

79
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
body

80
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,519
and then centering yourself on your

81
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:02,240
breathing the center of all things is breathing in and out within a vast

82
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:08,600
landscape of a spacious awareness of

83
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:17,600
space maybe almost as if there's vast space in your own

84
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,920
body and the movements and sensations of

85
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:35,120
breathing maybe are like a g Al wind coming and

86
00:10:46,519 --> 00:10:52,399
going as you exhale to relax relax the thinking

87
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:58,040
muscle relax around thinking calming the thinking

88
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
mind

89
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:13,040
more often than not there's a thinking mind which contracts

90
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:20,320
us Narrows our identity who we are what's

91
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:27,079
important the more we're preoccupied and caught in our

92
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:34,839
thoughts the the smaller the capacity

93
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:43,199
is to be open and aware non

94
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
reactively

95
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
for

96
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
for

97
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:13,920
and as we continue meditating for a little while longer

98
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:20,360
Center yourself on the breathing but with your peripheral

99
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:29,160
awareness with a very light touch not trying too hard peripheral awareness around Beyond

100
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,639
the focus on breathing be aware

101
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:41,000
of your body maybe the weight of your

102
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:47,600
body the substantiality of your

103
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:56,399
body without focusing on the body or thinking about it much let it be a

104
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:01,079
companion on the edges of Bri full

105
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:05,279
awareness the edges of

106
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:20,320
breathing where peripheral

107
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:29,639
awareness provides more room for breathing to come and go

108
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:32,480
inhales and

109
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
exhales

110
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

111
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:58,639
and now take a few moments to recognize how

112
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:06,079
how you're feeling what's your emotional state

113
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:12,800
mood the state of your inner

114
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:18,240
being how more globally do you

115
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,079
feel and let there be lots of

116
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:40,040
space for how you're feeling or maybe

117
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,800
your central attention is being with your emotions your mood your

118
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:54,519
state maybe breathing with it but the peripheral

119
00:16:55,279 --> 00:17:00,319
awareness creates a

120
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:07,400
vastness a spaciousness where it's easier just to

121
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:15,438
allow the emotions to be there without reacting or doing anything

122
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,480
about them judging them or making

123
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
commentary

124
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,840
we're like a good friend you're just listening or feeling or

125
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:49,400
seeing the emotion for what it is giving it permission to be

126
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
there

127
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:14,240
finding an ability to give lots of space and

128
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:20,600
room to how you feel without thinking about it or

129
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:27,320
analyzing it or reacting to it the task is to increase your

130
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:34,279
capacity to Simply allow how you are to be

131
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:40,600
there and you listening or sensing

132
00:18:41,799 --> 00:18:46,919
feeling how it is how the emotion

133
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:51,360
is as if you're a friend for

134
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
it

135
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:12,000
where you're present for the sensations of breathing of of the

136
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:21,080
emotion how the emotion is expressed in the

137
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:26,559
body and and for that you make lots of

138
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
room

139
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

140
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:13,640
if it's helpful for staying present with the emotion breathe with the emotion breathe

141
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:20,679
through it let breathing be in the middle of the

142
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:30,158
emotion and on the edges vast space

143
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:43,919
openness that allows your emotion to be there as it

144
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
is

145
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

146
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

147
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

148
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

149
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

150
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:16,000
checking in how are

151
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:29,799
you checking in without trying to disturb anything

152
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,240
just to see and feel as if everything is allowed to be

153
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:45,919
just the way it is undisturbed but you seeing it knowing

154
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:53,720
it as gently as the breathing might be a Brea as as gentle as a gentle

155
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,760
breeze of breathing

156
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:08,679
making room for how you feel and feeling it in the body the

157
00:25:08,679 --> 00:25:15,559
sensations of your emotions it's okay let it be for these

158
00:25:15,559 --> 00:25:21,000
few moments

159
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
breathing

160
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:59,480
there is freedom to be found not by changing what's happening

161
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,000
but by changing a relationship to what's

162
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:14,840
happening and one of the ways that change can take is to know and be aware of what's

163
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,960
happening in a spacious Way open

164
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:26,600
way listening deeply listening with respect to all

165
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
things

166
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:35,039
while not disturbing

167
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
anything

168
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,000
and then as we come to the end of this

169
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:24,279
meditation without disturbing anything or thinking we have to do anything

170
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:33,720
directly to anything open your awareness wide

171
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,120
broad vast like the

172
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:44,960
sky and become aware of the people of your

173
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:56,519
life those you know the neighbors you don't know people on the streets and places

174
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:01,720
of Commerce

175
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:10,799
work and for a few moments to hold it

176
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:16,480
spaciously allowing without a mind that disturbs

177
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:24,120
anyone with our judgments or commentary our

178
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:29,559
preferences just a A

179
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:40,399
Ware an awareness within which people are safe from us safe from our judgments

180
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:46,080
safe from our fixing and condemning and pushing

181
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:55,600
away or holding on an awareness that helps people feel

182
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:04,960
safe and in that safety in that capacity to hold people in our hearts in our

183
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:14,159
awareness to wish them well may you be

184

together so in such a way that we all can be

188
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,200

189
00:29:51,840 --> 00:30:00,799
safe we all can be peaceful we all can be

[Music]

192
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:29,240
free thank you

193
00:31:17,880 --> 00:31:23,639
so good morning good day everyone and welcome to this fourth talk

194
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:30,679
on mindfulness of emotions and um one of the great skills

195
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:39,840
to develop in relationship to our emotions and how we're feeling is to expand our capacity to

196
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,480
feel and partly that means uh in a very powerful thing that can mean is expand

197
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:51,760
our capacity to be

198
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:57,840
uncomfortable many of much of our reactivity in life challenges we have is

199
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,880
because something or other is making us feel uncomfortable and and so then we don't

200
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,960
like it we want to fix it we want to blame someone we get caught up in the trying to do something about being

201
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:18,919
uncomfortable and that discomfort might be physical it might also be emotional and there's a lot of things

202
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:24,960
which are emotionally uncomfortable and to be be to become

203
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:30,000
wise and skillful with situations that where we feel

204
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:40,240
emotionally uncomfortable one of the ways to find our way with that is to be able to allow

205
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,639
ourselves to feel what we're feeling without reacting to it without being

206
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:50,799
pushed around by it or feel trapped by it or feel somehow like we have to do

207
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:56,360
something because of it and all of which uh is subsumed under

208
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:02,480
the idea of of uh increasing our capacity to feel how our emotional

209
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:09,720
life and without reactivity this allows us then to be

210
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:18,399
more reflective of what we do to consider what's the wise thing to do in this situation if we feel that uh we want to

211
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:25,399
um swear at someone because we feel bent up anger or frustration um if we increase our

212
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:30,720
capacity to feel frustration then it doesn't have to be an automatic

213
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:36,159
trigger to swear at someone we just kind of oh we rest we open to what's

214
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:42,840
happening for us and then we can reflect what would be the skillful thing to do what would be the wise thing or the

215
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:47,919
compassionate thing to do uh with this phenomena with this P

216
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,000
what's happening here and um and there might be chances are there are better

217
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:58,080
things to do than to swear at someone or we might might shut down we

218
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:04,960
might collapse or pull in and or or or kind of shrink away if something is

219
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,200
uncomfortable and it's certainly understandable we can feel threatened and challenged and want to do that but

220
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,638
there are also uh capacities to the ability to kind of stay open and feel

221
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:24,000
afraid but without being influenced by it just it's there and we kind of are bigger than the fear we have more space

222
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,720
for it and again we can then be wiser about how we respond to the fear rather

223
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:36,320
than shrinking maybe we take three 10 steps back and and um without having to

224
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,480
diminish ourselves or Shrink or collapse in some way or perhaps uh we can assess

225
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:47,560
the danger more carefully and and uh have a wise response while standing our

226
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:52,800
ground with it um so these are all just kind

227
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:59,240
of examples that maybe you can fill in but the idea is whatever is happening it

228
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:05,040
doesn't have to just be discomfort some things feel really good and uh and

229
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:11,680
sometimes uh it can be quite stressful to be overjoyed or feel delighted and

230
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,480
and uh feel happy and or it's easy to kind of get swept away in it and we lose

231
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,560
ourselves in it uh and lose our mindfulness lose our

232
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:29,920
presence because we're so kind of Swept Away in the in the excitement of the moment and there's it might be nothing

233
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:36,119
wrong with that but uh it's easy T to make mistakes to say the wrong things to

234
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:43,960
uh do some things which later we regret we did in the excitement of the moment and um and it's a wonderful thing

235
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:50,079
to open up to a capacity to feel our joy not to diminish it but to allow it to

236
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,920
kind of live in us in a very different way than if we allow it to uh um take

237
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:02,079
over and and uh get us act activated around

238
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,599
it and there are times when it's the best thing we can do is to just hold the

239
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:12,760
good feelings in this broad open way because there might be a deeper

240
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:19,119
Wellspring of responsivity that has a chance to surface if we don't act from the surface

241
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:25,440
joy and the excitement of it all but we open and relax and feel oh maybe there's

242
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:32,040
love here maybe there's generosity maybe there's um you know um being more

243
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:38,880
inclusive of the other people involved rather than caught up in our own excitement and joy and somehow lose

244
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,359
track of the people around us so the principle of increasing our

245
00:36:44,359 --> 00:36:49,880
capacity to feel our emotions without being reactive that's kind of like one

246
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:54,920
of the North Stars that we're working with when we're practicing with mindfulness of

247
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:01,800
emotions so one way to do that is to uh find

248
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,640
something a different way to be with emotions than the way we are when we get

249
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:14,760
activated or reactivated by it very often what uh what activates us

250
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:22,720
around it is the story or the way we relate to it the attitude we have

251
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:28,240
towards it and so to increase the capacity to hold an emotion it helps to

252
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,839
kind of sit quietly like in meditation breathe gently be present uh feel the

253
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:41,760
emotions in the body and then take a look and see what is your relationship to the emotion

254
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,119
being there is there is your relationship the way you're relating to it the way you're

255
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:54,680
reacting to it is it making the space smaller you're getting narrower contracted or you're getting kind of

256
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:01,560
caught up in it or are you able to relate to it more spaciously and openly

257
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:07,240
and for these few moments at least allow it to be there so there's an expansive

258
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:13,760
quality of the heart of the body of the mind of awareness so that oh it's like

259
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,960
this and so to part of the task of mindfulness of

260
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:27,119
emotions is to notice what is our relationship to the emotion and this is not meant to be

261
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:34,119
analysis it's not meant to be spend a lot of time thinking about it it's just kind of asking yourself the question and

262
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:40,640
if nothing jumps out as being obvious uh don't go looking for it just but

263
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:48,920
sometimes you say oh of course I don't like it I'm trying to push it away or I'm trying to fix it or I'm um you know

264
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:58,000
I'm trying to justify why I feel this way with the story so so if it's obvious is then see

265
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:04,920
if you can expand and say oh it's just a story it's just a way of relating to it there's the

266
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:10,960
emotion and the relationship to it and then maybe it's easier to kind of

267
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:18,319
drop in and feel the emotion by itself and you can just make room for the emotion and feel it and allow it to be

268
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:26,680
there another way of talking about expanding our capacity to feel emotions is expanding our developing

269
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:35,319
ability to stay uh quiet and still with the emotion to cap develop a

270
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:41,000
capacity not to automatically act or automatically think to what's happening

271
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,079
but find a place of stability and quiet and Stillness inside in meditation in

272
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:53,400
that Stillness or that stability recognizes the

273
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:58,839
emotion some people find that there's a kind of stab ility or a kind of U

274
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:04,160
Stillness in the peripheral awareness that uh so it's kind of like

275
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:11,720
the this is an analogy is that of a site we have central vision and we have peripheral vision and when we look at

276
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:18,960
something we're engaging central vision and um but uh when we're um but

277
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,640
peripheral vision is kind of always there and we can kind of tune into

278
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:30,319
peripheral vision almost by not trying um we can't kind of turn our

279
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:38,359
central vision to look at peripheral vision we have to kind of relax and open and and kind of just sense and feel

280
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:44,760
without a central Focus being predominant same way when we sit in

281
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:51,319
mindfulness and just with our eyes closed and we're aware there is a kind of peripheral

282
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:57,880
awareness that is more kind of like peripheral vision where when we're not

283
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:04,400
caught in it we're not fixating on something we're kind of have spacious around it we kind of allow it to be

284
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:10,440
there and um and in a kind of Stillness of peripheral vision or non-reactivity

285
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:19,160
of peripheral awareness and so it's another way of then developing this capacity to be

286
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:24,280
with emotions in some emotions it turns out

287
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:30,800
that some of the wonderful emotions can become more wonderful when there's that space for it and we don't get

288
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:37,200
involved tinkering with it and some of the difficult emotions when there's space and this kind of awareness tend to

289
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,560
get be to be deflated tend to relax because they tend to be there because of

290
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:47,800
tension and the very thing of not being involved takes away the in the tension

291
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:55,720
that comes from involvement so to increase the capacity to feel and be is one of the great uh

292
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:04,200
skills we're trying to develop here in mindfulness and it doesn't require getting rid of anything it just requires

293
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:11,880
a quiet way peaceful way of staying present with this it's a skill that we develop over

294
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:17,240
time so don't be in a hurry but uh I hope that this teaching

295
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:23,280
today about increasing your capacity uh is something now that is of

296
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:30,920
interest for you and you have a sense oh yeah maybe I could do it a little bit at a time and let me experiment with

297
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,400
this and so for example as you go through your day there might be times

298
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:41,839
through the day that you're emotionally uncomfortable or maybe emotionally

299
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:48,680
excited in some good way and you might uh spend maybe three breaths maybe a

300
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:54,319
minute see what would it mean now to expand my capacity just allow this to be

301
00:42:54,319 --> 00:42:59,480
here with a spacious peripheral awareness as if there's lots of room for

302
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:05,920
me to be this way if there's if I have the ability to stay still and

303
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,079
non-reactive kind of inner Stillness or stability just to be with it and to feel

304
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,720
it and what happens if you do that for a minute um and maybe you want to start

305
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:24,520
with emotions that are not um really strong maybe there's medium emotions

306
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:30,480
that you can experiment with this capacity to expand this ability to expand your

307
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,720
capacity and in the end maybe what you learn is how to be comfortable with

308
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:44,040
being uncomfortable and that is a superpower uh all kinds of things are

309
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:49,720
available if you can do that that are not available if you're reactive to be

310
00:43:49,720 --> 00:43:54,760
being uncomfortable so

311
00:43:54,760 --> 00:44:02,119
um I hope hope that you have plenty of opportunities today

312
