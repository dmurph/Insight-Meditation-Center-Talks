1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:08,879
good morning everyone and good day

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:15,600
welcome and this morning as a way of beginning I would like

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,359
to evoke the the

4
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:30,679
image of a standing on a wonderful high mountain peak

5
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:38,360
and on a very clear day and this mountain peak is on the edge of

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,719
a vast land that's below nothing is higher

7
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:51,800
and you can see a far distance the Great Plains below the mountain ranges to the

8
00:00:51,800 --> 00:01:00,039
north the ocean to the West Great Rivers

9
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:05,080
to the East and uh in standing

10
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:11,640
there on this day you look around and what stands out is all the different

11
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:19,240
weathers that you can see in some areas you see that it's raining clouds maybe

12
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,759
rainbows in other direction maybe higher up you can see in the distance far from

13
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:30,119
you where it's sunny you can see that's even snowing

14
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,799
down below you see across where the ocean is you see

15
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:42,560
fog Banks coming in and it's clear that down in The Valleys that somehow the

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:49,000
wind is turning and maybe the soil is being kicked up so that you see little

17
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:56,119
tornadoes or wind storms and uh other places further down

18
00:01:56,119 --> 00:02:03,399
you see that there blue skies far to the South and and uh places where looks like it's

19
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:11,400
maybe almost desert-like and clear warm it looks down there and

20
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:18,599
so and so you see that there so many different kinds of weather and as you watch it you see it shifting and

21
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:25,040
changing clouds move rain comes and goes and

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:30,599
um and but what stands out is that even though you can differenti iate these

23
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,800
different parts of the weather uh it's just all part of the

24
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:42,400
same weather system they're all interrelated you could in some sense say

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,560
that um that uh there's no there's a

26
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,920
continuity between all the different weather that you see that uh they're all

27
00:02:52,920 --> 00:03:00,040
there's no line and barrier between one and the other and uh it's they're all so some

28
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,560
ways in relationship to each other the weather is a

29
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:12,640
whole and in a sense we can know that the weather of the whole planet uh is this global weather

30
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,360
patterns that influence each other and work together and and now we think uh

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:27,720
sometimes we think scientists now think of the global weather is a single ho that is uh

32
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:35,640
interacting with itself and and so the same way as we

33
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:43,799
sit on our mountain peak of meditation on our cushion our chair where we're

34
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:50,560
sitting all that we experience in ourselves can be like the weather we can

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,959
certainly see that there are different emotions and feelings and Sensations

36
00:03:55,959 --> 00:04:02,079
happening but there's some way of seeing it all part of a larger

37
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:09,640
hole to not create strong lines be uh boundaries

38
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:16,280
between one thing and the other the boundary between your hand and your arm

39
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,120
is an arbitrary line your fingers and your

40
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,280
palm you know we usually don't separate that we think of the hand we can of

41
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,560
course think about finger we can of of course think of the hand separate from the rest of the

42
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:39,880
arm but there's also a continuity and they all work together as a

43
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:47,440
whole our heart is part of the whole our whole body the heart

44
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,000
nourishing the body the heart nourishing

45
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:59,840
Itself by how it works but the heart exists

46
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:05,280
completely interdependent on everything else in our

47
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:13,600
body and so in meditation the idea one one way to approach it is not to get too

48
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,520
focused on one particular thing as if that's the most important

49
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:26,680
thing but rather to see that all that happens to us is

50
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:32,199
part of one larger hole and often the part of our life that

51
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:39,600
we're preoccupied with is only a very small percentage of what keeps us alive

52
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:46,120
and going in any given moment 99.999% of

53
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,560
what keeps us alive and living when activated

54
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,520
and conscious are processes within us that we don't control that we can

55
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:05,759
support but that operate without our conscious effort

56
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:14,680
and and we and so the 99.999% of who we are is the larger part

57
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:23,840
of the whole than the particular part that we're preoccupied with that we Define ourselves

58
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:30,120
by and so to behold very lightly any way we Define ourselves any that we're

59
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:37,199
preoccupied with and instead of getting absorbed in

60
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,080
preoccupation stand on the mountain peak of mindfulness and see it all as part of

61
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:49,560
the weather the larger weather system without being

62
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:57,960
caught in the divisions that the Mind makes so to take the whole of your body

63
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,520
and assume a meditation POS

64
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:15,879
and to lower your gaze perhaps gently close your

65
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:25,759
eyes and as you are what's the broadest way at this

66
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:30,639
moment that you can feel your body

67
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:43,879
what are the sensations in your body that appear

68
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:51,680
flow Express themselves as you're sitting here

69
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:06,800
and to see it as part of a larger hole

70
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:38,640
and then within this body maybe as part of

71
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:47,920
the part of the [Music] whole experiencing how the body breathes

72
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:55,560
the movements of breathing sensations of body as you breathe

73
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:13,440
and as a way of entering into your body more

74
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,880
fully take a few Fuller breaths relaxing

75
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,240
as you exhale

76
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:49,839
letting your breathing return to normal on the

77
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:56,959
inhale see if you can experience recognize notice what the

78
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,360
thinking mind is like how it feels feels how activated it

79
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:07,720
is but to feel it as part of the wider

80
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:14,519
hole it's just a piece of the weather of Who You Are

81
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,079
relaxing the thinking mind

82
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:06,200
and then feeling as part of the

83
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:12,560
whole how things are for you in your heart

84
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,760
center almost as if whatever is in your heart center whatever your emotion

85
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:31,800
is is nested in a wider hole of your

86
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,519
body mind

87
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:45,760
awareness no need to be focused or fixated on how you

88
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:55,399
feel there's something better than that and that is to allow it to be

89
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:01,240
nestled in The Wider hole of your body

90
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,480
and then finally to Center yourself on your breathing

91
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:36,519
in some ways

92
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,160
breathing the process of Brea processes of the body connected to

93
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:48,120
breathing touch every cell in your

94
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:03,399
body as you breathe in let your awareness grow and spread

95
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:08,040
throughout your body with the

96
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:18,120
inhale and as you exhale relax back into some

97
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:25,800
Center the some root stability Within

98
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:43,399
being with a whole of your

99
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:50,720
body maybe a whole that includes all things about

100
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,639
yourself thoughts feelings

101
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Sensations

102
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

103
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

104
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

105
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

106
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

107
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

108
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

109
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
for e

110
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:41,760
when there is tension in the body and mind we are compromising the

111
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:45,360
whole of who we

112
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,640
are for the body and mind to soften and

113
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,720
relax helps us move back into the hole

114
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
oh e

115
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,600
for e

116
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

117
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

118
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

119
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

120
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
e for

121
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:15,360
and as we come to the end of this sitting might it be possible for

122
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:21,600
you to relax more fully into your

123
00:25:22,039 --> 00:25:29,640
body or to allow yourself to sense

124
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:36,080
your as wide as broad as a field of your body as

125
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:41,240
possible maybe the humming

126
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:48,120
vibrating flowing sensations of your

127
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:00,240
body whatever broad sense of the whole body

128
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:04,080
that you can rest in

129
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:19,559
and and relaxing softening any activation of your

130
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:26,120
thinking mind and in that

131
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:32,919
relaxation allow there be a broad broading a further broadening of

132
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:39,600
awareness to take in the whole without centering yourself on

133
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:43,398
anything in particular

134
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:11,360
and then to expand relax

135
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:19,039
outward with a relaxed gaze or a relaxed

136
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:29,799
sense of all the beings human and others

137
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,398
that are found in your

138
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:51,679
neighborhood that are found in your city or county province

139
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:06,200
as if all of them are part of a whole working

140
00:28:07,399 --> 00:28:15,080
together part of the wider biological social

141
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:27,080
systems that can live that can live harmoniously together as a whole

142
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:38,880
and maybe feeling a sense of

143
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,639
kinship with all living things all living

144
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:56,360
things all living things of a common source

145
00:28:56,360 --> 00:29:04,679
origin all living things exist together in the whole of the

146
00:29:08,919 --> 00:29:15,720
biosphere and may we care for the whole and for the

147
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:21,799
individuals may all beings be

148
00:29:21,799 --> 00:29:31,320
happy may all beings be safe may all all beings be

149
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:39,120
peaceful may all beings be free and may

150
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:47,510
we extend our care to contribute to that possibility

151
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,730
[Music]

152
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,960
thank you

153
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:49,919
so welcome to this fourth talk on the road L

154
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,440
taken and

155
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,799
um and The Road Less taken the RO the road that's commonly taken for many

156
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:08,279
people is one that somehow is related to attachments to

157
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:14,279
clinging and one of the primary attachments that we have is clinging to

158
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:20,519
self and clinging to being alive clinging to our

159
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:28,760
identity one of the ways that we do that is to select something out of out of our

160
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:34,760
environment to be us something out of our whole Constitution as a human being

161
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:40,440
to be what's important and what's valued what's valued for us what's

162
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,360
valued for others and in doing so divide up the

163
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:56,120
whole when that division when that sense of identity is created formed made up based on

164
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:01,240
attachment that identity will bring

165
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:09,080
suffering it'll also bring a division of the whole we no longer live in the whole of

166
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:16,919
our experience but we're prioritizing a small subsection of it and one of the ways that that is

167
00:32:16,919 --> 00:32:23,440
physically experienced is through tension through uh tightness in the body

168
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:30,559
and the muscles and it's very interesting to see how when there's a pre occupation in the mind around

169
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:36,440
anxiety for example or fear or anger or desire the impact it has on the tension

170
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:44,039
in the muscles in the body it can be sometimes quite large the shoulders are held tight the chest is kind of

171
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:49,200
contracted it can be in the hands sometimes the hands are fidgeting a lot

172
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:56,159
and moving and sometimes the the um it's in the jaw tight sometimes it's in the

173
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:03,120
eyes the eyes are not floating and relaxed in their sockets but are held and fixated at

174
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,080
something there's a myriad ways in which we hold tension in our body that has its

175
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:16,480
source in the tensions in our mind so if we're caught in thoughts that are

176
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,919
anxiety thoughts worry thoughts if we're kind of caught in thoughts of ill will

177
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:30,399
or aversion or desire if we're caught in thoughts about me myself in mind and my identity and

178
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:35,919
myself as um as the you know as the

179
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:43,320
responsible one as the victim of it all as the consumer of

180
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:51,000
experience all kinds of ways in which we create something if it comes with tension um even if it seems reasonable

181
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:57,799
to have tension as a survival mechanism sometimes what it does is it starts uh

182
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:03,679
creating divisions in the whole of who we are tends to prioritize and restrict

183
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,919
and limit the experience of who we are and sometimes people are quite

184
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:16,919
restricted from being eily in touch with themselves some people live from the neck up some people from the waist up uh

185
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:21,960
some people um are not really in touch with their body at

186
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:28,919
all and so what in various ways we begin dividing up the whole We Begin centering

187
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:36,638
ourselves on something that we've kind of taken as being the thing and that can be done

188
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:44,040
conceptually uh with what our understanding and the focus of things and it can be physically because of the

189
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,200
impact of tension and holding and and where our attention goes and where it

190
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:58,119
doesn't go and um and so the Buddha emphasized this uh quite a bit and he said that um

191
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:07,359
greed hatred and delusion kind of the root cause for all forms of attachment is um creates limitations

192
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:12,680
creates boundaries create creates edges that we then live in between what's

193
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:20,640
included and what's not and we can feel that physically the way we contract and hold ourselves we can feel how the the

194
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:28,880
the doors of the heart sometimes close and um or go numb or uh not available

195
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:36,119
and uh all kinds of ways in which we then live live under limitation and so uh GRE haen delusion

196
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:42,560
is what limits us and um and what arises out of greed ha and delusion then is a

197
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,920
further limitation so if there's preoccupations and thoughts that come from that it limits us it makes us

198
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:58,119
smaller in a sense or or a range of who we are less and less and um and a lot of the this

199
00:35:58,119 --> 00:36:03,640
operating system that comes out of greed hate and delusion when it P when it flows

200
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:10,800
into um uh the thoughts that are kindr trying to get what we want it often

201
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:17,640
comes along with creating ideas attitudes of who we are and many times

202
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:24,240
the identities that we have that we form um have the role not of kind of

203
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,440
opening us up to the whole of who we are which certainly identity can at times

204
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:35,440
but actually limits us and uh and makes us much smaller than who we are and this

205
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,839
idea that the madeup world of identity limits us so if we our

206
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:49,720
identity is mostly having to do with our physical body that's a limitation we're much more than the physical body if our

207
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:54,760
identity is around certain ideas and Concepts and we rotating around those

208
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:01,040
Concepts and those roles that have been we've entered into that limits the whole

209
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,160
if our if our identity and who we think we are is

210
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:13,599
shaped predominantly by the stories of our life the stories we make up the fantasies we have that limits

211
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:20,359
us and uh if we uh Focus too much on the nature of awareness itself being aware

212
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:26,160
or cognition of things that that itself is a limitation on the

213
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:33,680
whole so the the Buddha call these limitations the five uh bundles of

214
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:40,760
clinging uh I didn't talk about all five but but those five are are physical

215
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:47,480
appearance uh appearances um whether things are Pleasant or unpleasant that's what some

216
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:52,800
people really focus on and they're limited by that always trying to adjust and make themselves comfortable and

217
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,040
avoid discomfort um the things that our ideas of how we recognize the world and

218
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,920
ourselves the stories we have and the and the act the wonderful marvelous Act

219
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:10,200
of cognition or Moments Of Consciousness which we understand ourselves in the

220
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:16,400
world the Buddha called those is Center on any one of those is a

221
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,960
limitation and what we're looking for in in Dharma is to bring is to let the

222
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:30,040
whole this deeper operating system operate an operating system that operates with in the whole so something

223
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:38,920
like for example the heart our heart generally when it's everything's going well um is completely the operating with

224
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:45,440
with a interconnectedness with the whole of who we are the the heart doesn't care

225
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,640
that uh our role our career who we're related to all kinds of things the heart

226
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:56,760
doesn't care it just does its work and supplies the whole of who we are a child

227
00:38:56,760 --> 00:39:02,560
that's growing up up uh the the the the growth of that child comes from the

228
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:11,359
inside out as it as it um as it eats food and nourished and the whole biological system with which it grows is

229
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:17,240
is belongs to the whole of the of the child it's not a limited part of you

230
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:25,359
know the body the feelings the stories the identities that child has so that uh there's so much of who we

231
00:39:25,359 --> 00:39:31,520
are that uh Wells up from deep inside and for the Buddha the deepest spiritual

232
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,560
way of being in the world the deepest emotional way of being in the world is not in the world of attachments and

233
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:44,240
stories and ideas within the field of those limitations we create but comes

234
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:51,440
when we settle and relax and allow an upwelling allow the growth allow a flow

235
00:39:51,440 --> 00:40:00,720
allow a a um uh uh our inner development to come

236
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,560
out of and be part of the whole of who we are and part of the role of

237
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:14,240
meditation is not so much to just get calm or not just to have Insight but

238
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:20,880
because all the both of those come back into this world of a limited World thinking that calm or pleasure and

239
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:28,400
meditation is the point to be peaceful is the point I'd like to suggest that one of the real values of buddh practice

240
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:35,000
and meditation practice is to get out of the way uh or to relax all the

241
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:40,160
limitations all the edges we've created for ourselves all the tensions by which

242
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:45,480
we live by that limit who we are so we can sense and

243
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:51,760
feel something that is not part of our constructed world not part of the world

244
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:59,040
which we think about or uh judging about or having commentary

245
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,720
about but something that's organic something that is deep

246
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:11,359
inside that can flow or grow or or feel like it has no edges to

247
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:17,599
it and so things like um the seven factors of Awakening things like the

248
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:24,720
Brahma vas love kindness compassion appreciative

249
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:31,880
Joy um loving Quin imity equanimous love all these things

250
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,400
uh they don't have boundaries they are kind of just something we radiate or or

251
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:42,960
flows throughout our whole being ideally and um and that's possible it's

252
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,760
possible to have a sense that it's all part of a organic ho um not part of some

253
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:57,319
particular thing that we're holding on to and fixated on we might have ideas about love but the sense the feeling the

254
00:41:57,319 --> 00:42:04,800
warmth the tenderness the the glow of warmth and love within us um that's part

255
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:13,359
of that organic ho that we can relax into so to uh to relax the tensions of

256
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:20,760
the mind to relax the tensions of the body so that we live without edges

257
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:27,680
without boundaries without divisions inside of ourselves an undivided hole

258
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:33,680
of our being that um is makes us so much more

259
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:40,960
than anything that any way that we can think about ourselves and thinking is certainly part

260
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:47,720
of that whole which makes it kind of fun at times so

261
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:54,960
um uh the second operating system is one that belongs to more of an

262
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:03,359
undivided World undivided self then it does a divided self a fragmented self um

263
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:10,720
that most people live in so um The Road Less travel there's a

264
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:17,040
fork always and to choose the wholesome rather than UNH wholesome is to choose

265
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,800
that which belongs to the whole and um that which comes out of the

266
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,800
whole to choose the UNH wholesome is choose that which is is only that is a

267
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:35,079
that is uh restricting the whole or in a in a more limited world that's not whole

268
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:42,240
it's fragmented it's divided so um May you experiment today

269
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:47,540
may you sense and feel the ways that you live that

270
00:43:47,540 --> 00:43:56,240
[Music] are closer to taking the wholesome step step rather than the UNH wholesome step

271
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:02,640
that the way you live that sense to open to a wider sense of how things are than

272
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:10,119
to a restricted narrower sense to how things are and may that bring you much joy and

273
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:18,160
Delight May that bring you a sense of being cozy in yourself a cozy nested in

274
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,280
a wider world that than therefore is

275
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,040
softer and uh maybe more receptive to you

276
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:37,599
so thank you very much and um and we'll conclude this uh talk

277
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:45,440
tomorrow and then talk a little bit tomorrow I'll talk a little bit about um uh what's planned for the new year and

278
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:51,200
for this YouTube themes thank you
