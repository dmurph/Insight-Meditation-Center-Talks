1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:00,530
here

2
00:00:00,530 --> 00:00:04,060
[Music]

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:10,880
so

4
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,160
so today we're going to touch into that

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,640
tenth step of anapanasati breathing in

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,960
one

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,240
delights the mind breathing out one

8
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,199
delights the mind

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,800
and and this word mind cheetah

10
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,280
appears in step 8 9 and 10.

11
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,399
in 8 it's

12
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,520
calming the

13
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,200
activities of the mind

14
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,199
then step nine it's uh

15
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,559
experiencing the mind and then

16
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,719
in step now ten it's

17
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:01,920
delighting the mind

18
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,360
and and so there's the light

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,960
the word that's translated i'm

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,040
translating now is the light

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,560
sometimes can be translated as pleasing

22
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,799
the mind or satisfying the mind

23
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:18,799
and it rather than it being an active

24
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,080
verb that what we're doing

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,159
we might understand it as being

26
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:24,720
recognizing or allowing for

27
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,439
a certain sense of deep satisfaction

28
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:28,320
deep

29
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,520
being pleased a deep kind of very glad

30
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,680
gladness in the mind

31
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,759
and that comes from meditation practice

32
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,119
and there's a number of ways to

33
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,880
understand this and there are different

34
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:45,040
ways to experience this

35
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,640
one of the classic ones that the

36
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,560
tradition talks about

37
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,960
is um finally

38
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,640
the mind is no longer out of control

39
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,680
or say differently finally the mind

40
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,840
doesn't have a mind of its own

41
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,040
and and where the mind were led around

42
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,840
jumping around agitated trashing about

43
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,959
in the mind with our thoughts but we

44
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,720
feel like now we've really come home or

45
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,319
we're settled we're back to in ourselves

46
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,400
the mind is under control or the mind is

47
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,640
not

48
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:26,480
just doing whatever it wants wandering

49
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,080
around and picking up thoughts and

50
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,319
chasing thoughts and

51
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:32,800
but we're really settled here and we've

52
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,640
come home to ourselves the mind is

53
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,400
settled and present

54
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,800
it's a word and the word that's often

55
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,560
used in the ancient tradition is mind is

56
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:40,879
now

57
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,000
tamed i suspect a lot of us

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,760
in the modern west don't really like the

59
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,360
idea of taming ourselves

60
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,280
so if a tame mind doesn't really inspire

61
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,400
but but the opposite of that

62
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,959
you know having a mind which is no

63
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,440
longer

64
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:00,800
untamed or out of control maybe

65
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:03,360
just feels better to appreciate that or

66
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,120
value that

67
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,720
and one of the metaphors for an

68
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,280
out of control mind in the ancient world

69
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:12,319
is

70
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,280
like a fish trashing about in a very

71
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,840
shallow puddle of water

72
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,400
you know just flap flapping around and

73
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,080
so sometimes the mind just flaps and

74
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,599
does its things and

75
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:25,760
jumps around and chases one thought

76
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,640
after the other and

77
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,000
and and we have no control or no

78
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,440
say over the mind and but to get

79
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,400
the mental activities to quiet down to

80
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,599
settle

81
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,440
and a feeling that we're not really

82
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,959
going to wander off into the past in the

83
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,560
future anymore we're not really going to

84
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,040
get lost in thought anymore we are now

85
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,799
really here

86
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,920
and and feel that sense of it's deeply

87
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,120
satisfying

88
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,840
to start feeling really connected here

89
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,560
and

90
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,599
and at peace here or settled here

91
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,360
and there's a kind of a satisfaction of

92
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,200
not having the agitation or the

93
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
energetics of the mind jumping around

94
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:07,840
moving out

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,480
going here and there and it allows the

96
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,360
mind to be

97
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,519
start becoming peaceful or being a deep

98
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:14,400
rest they're just

99
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,440
here and it can feel like very

100
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,959
solid or very centered i can

101
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,840
hear and the mind is in the present

102
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,800
moment

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,040
and any tendency to leave that present

104
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,000
moment by going off

105
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,960
into thought it just it just doesn't go

106
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,800
very far it hardly goes anywhere at all

107
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,520
it's like

108
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:35,440
a rubber band attached to their thoughts

109
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,880
and they just get pulled right back to

110
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,080
the present

111
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,360
or we just like no you know why bother

112
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,560
it's really good to be here and

113
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,639
this movement of the experiencing the

114
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,759
mind

115
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,880
this way is a movement towards wholeness

116
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,320
to becoming more whole that's only

117
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,199
possible

118
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,240
if we're in the present moment

119
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,400
by almost by i don't know if definition

120
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,680
is the right word but

121
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,840
by definition if we're lost in the

122
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,960
future

123
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,960
caught up in future concerns or past

124
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,240
concerns

125
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,120
we are partial we're involved and

126
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,560
focused on the future and we're not

127
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,800
really connected to what's here

128
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,080
or if we're involved in fantasy it's no

129
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,800
matter how

130
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,440
wonderful and nice the fantasy might

131
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:22,320
feel

132
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,479
a fantasy is only a small part of who we

133
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,479
are and there's a disconnect even in

134
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:27,440
dissociation

135
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,479
in extreme forms with our body our mind

136
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,240
states and it's really what's happening

137
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,840
right here

138
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,000
and so as we start settling and able to

139
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,560
be here in the present moment in a

140
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:41,840
rooted way grounded way

141
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,960
it allows begins allowing for this

142
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,000
of a process of feeling whole

143
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,000
becoming um and a whole

144
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,039
is is a process also

145
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:58,960
of a lot of the sharp boundaries we have

146
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,000
time and space begins to fall away

147
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,360
or sharp boundaries between

148
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,360
the body and the mind or sharp

149
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,960
boundaries between

150
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,880
the edges of our body and the space

151
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,160
around us

152
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,680
a lot of the

153
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,639
sense of wholeness starts moving into

154
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:22,639
what some people would call

155
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,479
altered states of consciousness altered

156
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,000
states of mind

157
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,720
but that suggests that somehow it's

158
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:29,520
non-nor

159
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,880
like not normal or and well maybe it's

160
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,240
not so normal because

161
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,639
we don't go into those states very much

162
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,919
but um

163
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,600
uh to in in meditation we start feeling

164
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,280
this settled in the present moment and

165
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,120
start opening up to a whole

166
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,319
feeling of wholeness of being here

167
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:51,840
it starts feeling like this is natural

168
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,560
this is a homecoming this is what should

169
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,240
be ordinary

170
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,840
ordinary states of consciousness

171
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,440
ordinary states of mind

172
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,880
are fragmented narrow limited

173
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,880
bounded and

174
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,960
frazzled and even though they might be

175
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,919
familiar with us

176
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,720
and that sense comfortable for us to

177
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,240
really experience starts feeling a

178
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,639
settled wholeness it starts feeling oh

179
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,840
this is health this is healthy

180
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,280
healthy mind this is um

181
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,720
you know it's the altered states of mind

182
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,280
are daily mind states those are the ones

183
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,039
are altered and

184
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,160
and strange and preoccupied and things

185
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,039
like that

186
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,800
but you know a subtle feeling of

187
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,080
wholeness

188
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,000
that feels good some people

189
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,039
when they meditate are struggling with

190
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:47,520
a distractible mind you know being

191
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,560
caught by the hindrances

192
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,039
and uh caught the desires and aversions

193
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,560
of all kinds

194
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,319
and they're coming back and coming back

195
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,000
and working with that

196
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,440
to finally have those quiet down

197
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,440
and the mind is able to finally be

198
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,639
present

199
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,160
it's like the mind has found itself

200
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:11,120
it provides a deep satisfaction a

201
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,080
delight a joy a pleasure

202
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,919
and this is what we're talking about in

203
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:18,000
this tenth step

204
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,520
of delighting the mind or pleasing the

205
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:22,560
mind or

206
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,080
gladdening the mind allowing the mind to

207
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,080
feel a deep satisfaction

208
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,240
and i offer all these different words

209
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,919
because different people will

210
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:33,839
find different words speak to what their

211
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:35,279
own flavor of

212
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,159
all this might be in their meditation

213
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,279
and

214
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,839
and uh but the important thing here is

215
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:42,959
that we're allowed to

216
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,320
feel the goodness of that we're allowed

217
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,399
to feel the delight and the joy and the

218
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,240
satisfaction

219
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,560
certainly not to cling to and hold on to

220
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,720
and congratulate ourselves for in some

221
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,399
egotistical way

222
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:59,440
but we're not supposed to ignore the joy

223
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,200
the happiness the well-being

224
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,959
the pleasure the satisfaction of

225
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,320
meditation

226
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,279
in fact feeling that is there's a way of

227
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,600
feeling a way of experiencing it

228
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,760
that allows us to continue this process

229
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,959
of settling in

230
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:15,839
quieting the mind expanding the sense of

231
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:17,120
wholeness

232
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,880
that we're moving into and in doing so

233
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,600
we open up to states of mind qualities

234
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,800
of mind

235
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:30,800
that are coterminous that are

236
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,000
intimately part of

237
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,440
this feeling of a wholeness or a broad

238
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,320
awareness or

239
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,040
centeredness clear knowing clarity of

240
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,399
mind

241
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,040
that are uh that are considered a form

242
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:46,480
of wealth

243
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,040
in fact for the buddha the greatest

244
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,080
wealth a person

245
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,440
can have and acquire is the

246
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,560
wealth that comes from a settled

247
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,440
clear and open mind the sense of

248
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,399
wholeness so

249
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,079
the seven factors of awakening that i

250
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:05,200
mentioned yesterday

251
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:09,040
mindfulness investigation effort

252
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:12,320
joy tranquility samadhi

253
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,600
and equanimity these all kind of belong

254
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,279
to the realm of this

255
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:20,240
settled wholeness that comes with it as

256
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,079
the awareness the attention gets full

257
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,680
and complete

258
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,040
and and and so it isn't just like we're

259
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,720
losing something

260
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,720
by settling down and really letting go

261
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,560
of the distracted mind and really being

262
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,600
present

263
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,920
we gain so much and and it's called

264
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,680
an inner wealth if you want to be

265
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,160
wealthy develop your inner life

266
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,320
and it's uh and it's a wealth that i

267
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,680
mean it qualifies as a wealth because

268
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,279
it provides some of the greatest

269
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,800
pleasure and

270
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:54,079
safety and happiness and

271
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,200
that that's available to us and

272
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,120
certainly greater happiness than any

273
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,720
material wealth can ever produce

274
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,079
so so

275
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,040
breathing in delighting the mind

276
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,519
breathing out delighting the mind

277
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,600
you can't do that too early you can't

278
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,240
just sit down decide to do that

279
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,800
it comes when when meditation is really

280
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,360
settle down and settle down settle down

281
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,200
so remember it's now we're talking about

282
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,320
the 10th stage of the 16 stages

283
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,279
but when it happens to you that you get

284
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,200
that you start feeling inklings of

285
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,560
kind of this kind of delight

286
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,720
satisfaction pleasure

287
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,839
being pleased by what's happening deep

288
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:42,800
satisfaction

289
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,680
open to it allow for it let it spread

290
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,200
wide and broad

291
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,680
throughout your being be nourished by it

292
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,680
and and let it be something you

293
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,160
appreciate and enjoy

294
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,360
and that sets a stage for the next step

295
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,360
amanapanasati which we really won't do

296
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,880
for a couple of weeks

297
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,440
which is samadhi which is the

298
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,120
unification of the mind the

299
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:10,560
concentration of the mind and until then

300
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
we're going to spend next week with the

301
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,079
seven factors of awakening

302
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:19,680
and maybe this will support experiencing

303
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,639
the mind and

304
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:23,040
experiencing the delight in the mind to

305
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,639
really kind of spend some time with

306
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:25,279
these

307
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,519
seven factors of awakening and they'll

308
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,040
also serve

309
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,639
for the 11th step the samadhi
