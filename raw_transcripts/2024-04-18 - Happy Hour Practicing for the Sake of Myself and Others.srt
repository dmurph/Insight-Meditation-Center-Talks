1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,240
so hello and welcome everyone to this edition of happy hour um lovely to be

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:14,000
with you [Music] so so for today's practice um I wanted

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,640
to bring in this idea that we always bring in

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:27,480
actually in at the end especially when we do medic dedication of Merit that we

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,320
do this practice not just for our own sake but do we do this practice um practice

6
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:40,360
of cultivating our hearts our minds towards kindness uh mindfulness awareness

7
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:47,680
equinity all these beautiful qualities of the heart that we do it not just for ourselves but we do it for others for

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:54,879
those we are entangled those we are those we love those we care

9
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:02,960
about um our friends our family those we are in Tangled with and and all beings

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,200
everywhere we do this practice not just for ourselves but for others and there's a beautiful

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:15,200
aspiration in in both doing it for ourselves and for others there's so so

12
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:24,000
much goodness in that so I uh recently heard some um research

13
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:29,880
actually uh and let's see if I can quickly uh find the name of the re

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:36,840
researcher I wasn't necessarily going to talk about it but now I feel inspired yes David joer Dr David joer who's done

15
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:45,560
a lot of research on this and the the um one of the uh uh aspects of the research

16
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:53,600
it it shows that um not no not just for meditation but for worldly actions um

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,920
one way to to help motivate ourselves and especially motivate young people

18
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,320
people in the world it's not just the benefit that they get out of it not um

19
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:10,399
only that for example they'll graduate and they'll have high paying jobs or whatever it might be but that that their

20
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:17,920
work their their study their U cultivation of skills is of benefit to

21
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:23,319
others is is benefit to greater good and as I was listening to this research I

22
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:29,480
thought yes of course yes and especially his research shows that when things are

23
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:35,640
tough if if we're just doing it for our own sake and and there challenges or

24
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:42,519
maybe there is a lack of success and and and um there's a different mind mind

25
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:50,120
makes a different kind of meaning out of it that oh you know I failed and and when it's personal when it's feels more

26
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:55,360
perhaps personal and just for myself or maybe selfish has a different

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,640
orientation challenges feel more difficult whereas has if we do something

28
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:08,840
that seems challenging or difficult but it's for the sake of not just our ourselves but everyone else there's a a

29
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:15,440
uh a uh uh what I like to call a wholesomeness an uprightness there is a

30
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,360
dedication there is a and and the way his research I forget the words he was using but there's a sense of people

31
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:27,200
arise to the challenge because it's not just for themselves they arise to the challenge I was thinking about that in

32
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,640
our meditation practice um also that this these are skills the that that

33
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:39,599
we're developing not just for our own sake especially if things are challenging or become challenging at any

34
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:45,040
point in the meditation practice we're doing this for the sake of all beings

35
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,360
and perhaps if we bring up the the um thought of people we care about and and

36
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:58,560
the sense of dedicating dedicating this practice to others um it's it supports

37
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,680
us so couple of things I wanted to bring in and David dieger has a new book out

38
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:12,280
about all these research and and uh so you can learn more anyway so with that

39
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:19,120
as Preamble let's practice not just for our own sake for but for the sake of all

40
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:26,478
whose lives ours touches directly or indirectly so let's

41
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:32,600
begin let's begin by arriving AR diving in our

42
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,840
seat let's arrive together and

43
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,080
settle allowing your body to settle allowing our mind to

44
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:01,638
settle this invitation to settle

45
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:27,960
and what if we thought about this moment of settling our minds relaxing the body

46
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:35,160
and connecting with the breath with the in breath and with the out breath bringing awareness

47
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:41,600
attention ever so gently kindly

48
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,120
receptively to the sensations of INB breath out

49
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,639
breath and what if we considered that this moment right here not hypothetically but this moment moment

50
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,280
of receptive

51
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,280
attention with the in breath and out

52
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,080
breath is both for the sake of an

53
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,599
offering a gift to ourselves in this moment and feel

54
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:35,720

55
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:42,280

know having evoked sense of our inter connection our vast

111
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:29,240

and as we bring this period of sitting too close

127
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:32,120
together appreciating our practice for the sake of ourselves is

128
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:41,320
being who me was vastly interconnected whose life whose life is

129
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:49,399
so miraculously amazingly [Music] interconnected in speechless

130
00:25:49,399 --> 00:25:55,600
ways with all beings in ways we can't quite

131
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:01,520
understand May our practice be support or The

132
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:09,240
Awakening of all beings everywhere may all beings be happy may

133

all beings be free including myself

134
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:35,039
you so much for your practice

135
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:44,440
everyone nice it it is it does make a difference

136
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:51,640
when we expand our perspective and really see the truth

137
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:56,919
of of how interconnected we are and we're not doing this practice just for

138
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:02,000
our own sake it really gives it so much beautiful dimensionality which I hope

139
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:08,240
came in for you in whatever ways it did so um and now with this dimensionality

140
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:14,720
of interconnection that we don't do this practice just for ourselves as we're sitting with our eyes

141
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:21,320
closed but also in in engaging with others um I also learned from the

142
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:28,840
research of David the acre that one of the best ways to really um own

143
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:34,000
um a a something that you learn is to share it with others explain it to

144
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,960
others so in that that way of sharing it with others really making it our own uh

145
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:47,000
you know that's that's a big bonus of teaching being in the Dara seat um that

146
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:56,279
I need to walk my talk really own it all these practices so so so um you get to to

147
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:01,840
engage and and share explain the the benefits the inner

148
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:09,279
process the challenges whatever it is uh with one another what a privilege to be able to do that have this space that

149
00:28:09,279 --> 00:28:15,559
other people are interested in this too fellow practitioners so we'll be in small

150
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:21,679
groups of size three mostly other there would be some smaller or bigger groups

151
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:28,519
and the invitation is to um share a bit about how this practice was for you how

152
00:28:28,519 --> 00:28:35,679
it shifted moved um or perhaps challenged you and again you're really

153
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,440
speaking for your own benefit for your own sake to to internalize this practice

154
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:47,279
and and explore your relationship to it not to educate or edify others it's

155
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:52,399
really for your own sake so let's Go reverse alphabetical

156
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:59,480
order uh according to first name each person will offer one short nugget the next person the next person will come

157
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:06,519
back to you and you'll go around and round a few times and again please be kind be sensitive to yourself to others

158
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:12,720
this is really how we practice kindness as it meets as the rubber meets the

171
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:33,760
practice for

172
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:50,159
you what did you discover during the practice what did you discover S I see

173
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:59,480
your hand we haven't heard from you for a while hi Nikki hi thank you I have a

174
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:05,679
question um you mentioned the future self and the past

175
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:12,679
self and when I think about the future self I think about what you sometimes mentioned which I really love the

176
00:31:12,679 --> 00:31:20,519
planting the seed it gives me a sense of hope uh but I'm not sure what you

177
00:31:20,519 --> 00:31:26,639
exactly meant but that future self is related to that and also the past self I

178
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:32,559
I think as still my mind goes to the past and like kind of

179
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:39,240
navigating what has happened not always in a positive way also dealing with like

180
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:44,320
the traumas of the past and the challenges of the past and and like this

181
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:50,480
planting of the seed is very hopeful but I still struggle with like the past and I wonder

182
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:57,200
what you you what was the intention here right instead of going down the rabbit

183
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:02,840
hole of of yeah exactly um that's a very good

184
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:08,278
question and I appreciate that you're bringing this up

185
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:16,480
so so the idea here is first of all the big picture idea to bring a lot more

186
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,240
dimensionality instead of the small self of me in this moment but really bring

187
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,399
dimensionality in in lots of different perspectives not just other human beings other beings

188
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:35,360
that we know we don't know expanding the circle that way but also expanding the this circle of concern through time

189
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:41,600
through this other dimension of time and and the way um the

190
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,919
idea of our future self is you know

191
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:54,080
um it's the teaching of Karma and the appropriate correct teaching of karma is

192
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:01,000
This Moment's actions precondition the next moment and the next moment so

193
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:06,840
it's an actually a very empowering teaching so in that way oh yeah this

194
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:13,799
moment of being empow being Mindful and kind oh it's planting the seeds for my

195
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:19,120
future self I'm S as if my future self is my child you know someone

196
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:27,000
I'm bearing um giving them the best opportunity for kindness for for uh

197
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,200
equinity by how I am in this moment so just invoking that and then coming back

198
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:39,279
to this moment inhabiting this moment more fully it's not just for it's it's like oh there other dimensions here you

199
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:46,440
kind of keep that and then instead of analyzing and and hope is a nice way to to think about that too this

200
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:51,919
um and then with respect to the past I appreciate that it can become a thinking

201
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:57,320
and and you know what did I do all of that getting entangled in that and and it's helpful to notice if that's

202
00:33:57,320 --> 00:34:05,200
happening and come out of it and and yet again the idea there is oh it's you know as if

203
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,638
you're the child this moment you're the child of this being from the past you're

204
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,200
their child they you know they had hopes and dreams and challenges and you're their child you're like thank you Mom

205
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:21,320
thank you Dad you know thank you it's like oh there's this there's like oh

206
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:27,280
this is the gift this is the gift of this is this moment it's um there's a

207
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:34,440
whole some this in this moment that they can they can benefit from retroact you know in in time I I hope that makes

208
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:42,480
sense in a in a um um in a time in you know in a

209
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:50,919
holographic way it's an H you know this moment being a hologram of many moments so that's the idea of oh yeah inhabiting

210
00:34:50,919 --> 00:34:59,440
the dimensionality uh and just again evoking the idea of a past self as as as you

211
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,440
would evoke the idea of a parent whom you're oh yeah you're dedicating this moment of kindness and and wholesomeness

212
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:12,119
to the to a parent instead of thinking about your relationship with your parent and it's just evoking them it's the same

213
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:19,920
same idea with your past self oh dedicating oh this is not just for this moment but for for me but also all the

214
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:28,480
versions I have been uh it's that that kind of a dedication does that make sense yeah it's uh youing

215
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:34,079
yes very much the last piece just brought everything together for together

you're un yes thank you thank you sure thank you uh yes I want to share something

244
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:43,200
that I've become aware of today and that is that um you know how we say that we do

245
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,800
the practice for old beings not just for ourselves and

246
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,839
um it occurred to me today you and you know and we also have this idea that we

247
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:01,280
we reap the fruits of our past actions the good and the bad and what occurred

248
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:09,800
to me today is that when one being you know uh comes from a place of

249
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:17,480
Enlightenment and uh has reach a certain state of being

250
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:24,160
that the karma The Good Karma of that being actually affect changes the karma

251
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,920
of a whole bunch of other beings and I never thought of that before but but it

252
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:36,400
occurred to me today that actually the um the fruits The Good the good fruits

253
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,200
of our Karma my karma your karma other people's Karma actually

254
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:49,280
affect uh for other will will impact other people's karma in a good way you

255
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,520
know it automatically does just but us being present and it's never occurred to

256
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:01,079
me before uh so this this was an awareness that I I gain today thank you

257
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:07,079
great thank you so much for sharing this Serena indeed yes we we affect one

258
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:15,160
another and as we um shift and change so that our actions are internal actions

259
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:22,400
actions of the Mind actions of speech actions of body are more wholesome it

260
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,560
impacts it invites others it impa it encourages others it impacts others

261
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:32,839
wholesomely positively for them to be the better angels of themselves of

262
00:40:32,839 --> 00:40:39,760
course it does of course and of and ditto negatively if our actions of the

263
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,599
Mind our thoughts are UNH wholesome and our words are UNH wholesome and and our

264
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:53,480
physical actions in the world are un wholesome it in it unfortunately it inspires perhaps others to to it it

265
00:40:53,480 --> 00:41:01,760
brings the worst out of people so yeah thank you Serena thanks for sharing this Insight you had today beautiful

266
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:06,520
important and

267
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:13,000
clear I just thought I'd give you a little laugh I was not watching my timer

268
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:19,119
at all on my computer and uh was very happy doing what I was doing and it was

269
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:24,599
finished too fast all of a sudden it was over I couldn't believe it I went looked

270
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:30,839
at the clock it's so thank you very much it was a

271
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:37,200
total Joy thanks Claire yeah time flies when you're having fun it it yeah it

272
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:44,040
fell Too Short too but and yeah yeah thank you glad it felt that way sweet me

273
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:50,200
too thank you thank you and I see Jerry's question who is

274
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:55,680
asking what is the proper definition of karma

275
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:02,680
so the um so cause and effect is the

276
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:07,720
translation and um cause and effect and

277
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:13,680
effect the um kind of the effect is the

278
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:21,160
karma vipaka in poly so karma is short for karma vipaka which is the the cause

279
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:27,880
and effect the effect of an action in the world so uh that's the proper

280
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:35,200
definition but really as a as a teaching very briefly is best to think of karma

281
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:42,720
as an onward leading as a forward movement as a as an

282
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:50,040
empowering teaching that what I do in this moment it preconditions the next

283
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:57,720
moment and the next moment and the next moment it's really best to to practice it that way not backwards looking which

284
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:03,920
can be actually very detrimental what did I what did I do in my past life that

285
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:09,960
I'm suffering this like oh ouch that's just or other people you know they must deserve what they're getting because

286
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,160
they did something awful like those are those are unhelpful please don't go down

287
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:20,720
that rabbit hole with yourselves with others with societies cultures people

288
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:25,760
it's just like that's the whole other talk but very helpful to think to

289
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:32,119
practice this is is as a forward um onward leading practice of how can I and

290
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:37,640
and actually also ties with it ties in with the Neuroscience research of what

291
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:44,520
what and also what the Buddha has taught whatever uh you frequently reflect and

292
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:50,680
Ponder upon becomes the inclination of your mind so whatever you're thinking whatever you're doing if you're thinking

293
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:55,880
Goodwill thoughts wholesome actions calm kindness that's how you're going to

294
00:43:55,880 --> 00:44:01,680
precondition yourself if you're angry in this more feeding the fire of anger and hatred well guess what that's just going

295
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:09,480
to become the Habit pattern of you become kind of an angry person we know this anyway so that's I hope I that

296
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:16,200
answers your question Jerry so thank you all thank you for practicing for the

297
