Enough compassion and as the Dalai Lama said compassion is not a luxury it's a

it can you relax your body especially if there is pain physical pain

34
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:03,159

35
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:09,079
tighten up can you invite your body your dear

36

relax relax just be

38
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:33,960
breathed nothing

39
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,720
needed nothing extra

40
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:47,120
relax and let the body be breathed because it knows how to do this

41
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,880
knows how to

42
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:01,560
breathe and awareness simply receiving the breath

43
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,600
the sensations of the breath in the belly are being received on their own

44
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,039
you don't have to add much effort on top of what's already

45
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,479
happening

46
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:34,599
Let each breath especially each out breath be more and more relaxing letting

47
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:43,080
go of expectations of thoughts and just be present thinkinking

48
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:50,400
more deeply allowing

49
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:56,440
preoccupations to be put down to be released for just this moment this

50
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,400
moment of respit deeply needed

51
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,599
and we put it all down in this moment just for a moment we can pick it up

52
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:14,000
later but first we need to establish the ground the ground the

53
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,000
stability of the

54
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:23,879
heart intimacy with this

55
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
breath

56
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:52,880
and can we imagine that each out breath is releasing calming

57
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,800
soothing bringing comfort and sucker to this body to this heart and

58
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,120
mind

59
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,519
every out

60
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:17,880
breath as if the out breath is soothing calming

61
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:22,680
massaging wrapping a blanket of

62
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,480
care around

63
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
yourself

64
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:51,480
and the in breath is gathering any acknowledgment of discomfort

65
00:10:51,839 --> 00:11:00,639
pain not so much thinking about it but it's automatically happening

66
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:08,360
as if the pain and the heart and the body is being collected and transformed in the heart the heart

67
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:13,720
center and breathed out as comfort and

68
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,279
sucker nourishing yourself with each

69
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
breath

70
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,800
and if it feels like too much Mo think about the INB

71
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:37,720
breath electing the challenges and being transformed in the out

72
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:43,519
breath breathing out sucker Comfort compassion and let go of the in breath

73
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:51,680
part and just consider the out breath is soothing

74
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:57,839
comforting bringing calm care to pain and

75
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
sorrow

76
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:49,920
and now if you like you can expand ex extend and

77
00:14:53,519 --> 00:15:00,680
expand the circle of [Music] compassion

78
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:10,759
to include a few people in areas of the world that are

79
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:19,240
suffering right now include them in your mind in your

80
00:15:19,959 --> 00:15:27,600
heart as if your out breath is bringing them care sucker while they're

81
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,950
afraid [Music]

82
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,199
grieving

83
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:48,040
suffering there are human beings just like me just as I wish to be happy I

84
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:53,480
wish you happiness and freedom from sorrow and

85
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:59,600
suffering just as I wish it for myself

86
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,959
and include all of

87
00:16:04,959 --> 00:16:09,959
you in your practice include

88
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:17,720
yourself and others in a

89
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,639
challenged area in our world right

90
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
now

91
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:30,240
just as I wish to [Music] be free from sorrow free from pain

92
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:38,799
I wish you fellow human beings I wish you freedom from sorrow and pain may you

93
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:44,240
have ease as much as possible in the midst

94
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,840
of this

95
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,720
difficulty as if with with each out breath you were putting your blanket of

96
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:02,960
care around people you don't

97
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:08,600
know but it doesn't matter we're all

98
00:20:08,919 --> 00:20:13,440
related we're all part of the human

99
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:25,280
family you could have been born as them they could have been born as

100
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
you

101
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,600
and now for the last few minutes of this

102
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,840
practice let your heart be drawn to

103
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:29,960
wherever it's drawn to the most for the compassion practice

104
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:42,120
maybe someone you know who's grieving someone you don't know yourself your body your heart

105
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:48,720
wherever you're drawn breathing out compassion and

106
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:51,720
sucker

107
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
care

108
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:28,960
offering your wishes for well-being without attachment but as a

109
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:34,440
gift to the world to yourself to [Music]

110
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:43,720
nonviolence to more love and compassion in the world training our hearts and

111
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:48,200
Minds to

112
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
care

113
00:24:55,399 --> 00:24:59,760
and in the last minute of this practice

114
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,279
period offering compassion to yourself or however this practice period

115
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:13,559
was whether it was sleepy or distracted doesn't matter offer care and

116
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:21,279
compassion that you showed up you've done your best and letting go of the

117
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:26,679
rest May our practice be a cause and [Music]

118
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:32,919
condition for wisdom for compassion in our world may all beings

119
00:25:32,919 --> 00:25:37,559
be free including

120
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:47,120
[Music]

121
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:52,559
ourselves thanks everyone thanks for your

122
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:04,399
practice so the practice of compassion meeting sorrow and suffering

123
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:12,200
with with care with kindness and tonight the way I let it is we started

124
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:20,840
with ourselves and then we rod in others and also another thing to note is

125
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:27,799
um for those of you who know what tonglin practice is breathing in um

126
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:33,120
suffering breathing out care I offered that as one

127
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,760
variation um early on but if it became too overwhelming

128
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:44,919
invited you to just lean into the out breath of bringing comfort and peace

129
00:26:44,919 --> 00:26:50,760
meeting suffering so so just some nuances of tonight

130
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:57,080
so so as be back everyone and uh we have some time for

131
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:04,399
any Reflections if you want to share them in chat chat is open or um also you

132
00:27:04,399 --> 00:27:12,760
can raise your hand hi Amy I see your hand please thank you so much um I've had a

133
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:19,240
lot of aha moments when it comes to um finding PL ways to elicit

134
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:25,159
compassion for others deeply in hard moments moments of conflict and one is

135
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:31,640
like somatically like you guys see me rocking here a lot the rocking chair reminds me of holding a young child and

136
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:36,760
rocking them and meeting them in their emotions and the hand on the heart or or

137
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:42,360
a hug um and other pieces and then another piece I've been doing is

138
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:48,480
um putting aside their story and trying to see the emotion under the emotion

139
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,519
that's under that I can relate to and the the part of them that probably started having that emotion when they

140
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:58,640
were young so defensiveness or that comes out of fear or sadness I can

141
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,679
relate to that and and stopping my own need to be seen or validated in that

142
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:09,320
moment but instead seeing seeing them and then once I can deeply like see them

143
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:14,880
for like ouch like they are in pain right now and they're relating it to me or they're relating it to something and

144
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,159
we don't necessarily agree in that aspect but that doesn't matter about that what matters is is that like

145
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:25,200
they're this human experiencing a pain and if I can see them then usually their

146
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,440
defenses can come down and sometimes there's discernment for me to then share

147
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:36,080
mine and if there isn't then I can go here or to another friend or someone who

148
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:42,960
can um I can feel a congruence or an Attunement or a validation or love Feel

149
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:49,120
Love from um but I I feel like that's been a very big aha moment for me in how

150
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,320
I try to meet conflicts profound thank you Amy thanks

151
00:28:55,320 --> 00:29:02,360
so much for sharing you're a and see so much you shared here beautiful both the

152
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:08,480
sematic aspect of relating as well as because we have all we all have bodies

153
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,799
so that's doorway of of somatic experiencing

154
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:20,720
or through the rocking or or hand on the heart you mentioned and also as you you

155
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:28,880
said so beautifully I was touched when you mentioned um seeing not the P you know what what's

156
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:37,679
happening on top but but you know what what emotion is underneath and H how that perhaps came to be when they were

157
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:42,760
younger um the causes the conditions I think that's my words to to bring the

158
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,919
the Buddhist terminology to that but but really getting in touch with that and it

159
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:53,080
um and not overlaying your own perspective on

160
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:59,720
it and how I can kind of relate to that pain for them so that I can like that can be the true compassion there like if

161
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:08,159
it's it's oh I could see how that would hurt then that can elicit that true compassion and yes I see how that would

162
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,240
hurt exactly if I were in their shoes this would hurt of course yeah yeah

163
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:21,320
thanks Amy thanks so [Music] much

164
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:28,440
Ron yeah someone in our group mentioned something that really reson ated which

165
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:36,440
was when we become so aware of of so much

166
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:43,919
suffering and in so many areas at times it it can almost feel

167
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,279
like it's exponentially growing and can

168
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:55,399
start to feel almost hopeless in some way

169
00:30:55,399 --> 00:31:02,679
um but when when we sort of turn turn

170
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:11,000
inside to focus The Compassion on our own

171
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:20,919
suffering it has a quality to it of you know a it's it's something that's

172
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:28,240
doable and we have some control over and B it's also a

173
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:34,440
we're we're better at being compassionate and helpful to

174
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:41,200
others when we've also turned that compassion onto

175
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:49,000
ourselves and and done that work indeed well well said I'm so

176
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,679
appreciating you um sharing what came both for your practice and also in the

177
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:03,399
small group it sounds like yeah had a very very um juicy wonderful conversation about

178
00:32:03,399 --> 00:32:08,840
the benefits of compassion both turned inwards how that can actually support it

179
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:15,360
turning outwards and and not veering into overwhelm because the mind can get

180
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:25,159
overwhelmed but the heart when it stays in the present moment can always have hope can always have hope yeah thanks

181
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:29,080
Ron thank you

182
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:43,080
CLK um so I was starting out trying to Envision like a family who maybe on side

183
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:49,919
being persecuted and I was like struggling to connect and trying to anyway and kind of to my surprise a

184
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,840
little ways into it I have this very clear image of somebody on the other side who is

185
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:03,840
doing doing persecuting and kind of like Amy said seeing the pain of hurting another

186
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:11,120
person and the Bad Karma of that and then also all the causes and conditions and pain that would have led them up to

187
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,919
that and then I thought about that scene I don't know who seen um everything

188
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:22,639
everywhere all at once but there's a climactic scene where she puts a googly

189
00:33:22,639 --> 00:33:28,159
eye on her third eye and instead of fighting all the other people she uses

190
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:34,039
this new power to see what needs they didn't get filled in their past life that are making them act the way they

191
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:39,399
are now and she creatively starts helping them fulfill these needs that

192
00:33:39,399 --> 00:33:46,480
they don't want to be violent anymore and it just made me think about the courageousness that you need to respond

193
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:53,720
and and creativity and um yeah to respond in the face of of

194
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,519
really intense suffering like that and I just love that image of her putting the googly eye and this wind blows behind

195
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:06,559
her and she stands there really strong and then instead of fighting she just Embraces them all with compassion

196
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:13,040
yeah beautiful thanks for bringing this in claric I've seen the movie and and um

197
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,760
I'm getting chills as you bring that in to this moment because yes in in in the

198
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:24,960
movie she becomes the expression of of the Buddha of compassion in that moment

199
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,358
and and really seeing the cause and condition and what does this person need they didn't get and gives it to them

200
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:37,079
it's so sweet actually it's so sweet and and I'm so touched that that you bring

201
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:43,358
this in from your own practice of oh yeah this is what came up for you this is what came up for you instead of

202
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:48,679
seeing um someone who's being prosecut prosecuted and and seeing their pain oh

203
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:54,280
it just flipped naturally which is beautiful what an expansion of our heart

204
00:34:54,280 --> 00:35:01,160
to be able to to go there on its own that yes this person who's causing pain

205
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:09,520
is really really hurt in I'm I'm deeply Touched By by your practice report as

206
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:16,119
well as everyone who's shared tonight Ron and Amy too thank you thank you all

207
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:24,200
beautiful deep practices thank you and one question is coming Nikki how

208
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:29,480
to overcome Bel that that blocks compassion this happened to me today my

209
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:35,280
belief about someone events blocked compassion for me towards myself or others

210
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,920
um so I would say that it um in order

211
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:47,480
for me to answer that I need more details like what because there are different things that block compassion

212
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:52,960
so so actually this is what I'll say okay this is what I can say I think what

213
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:59,800
what needs to happen is that when compassion gets blocked you need to see

214
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,240
with awareness what is the belief that has blocked it is it that I don't

215
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:12,240
deserve it is it that they don't deserve it is it that it's going to make them soft me soft like what is that belief

216
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:18,160
that's blocking compassion that compassion is too soft I don't know there are just so many beliefs I can't

217
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:24,880
go through all of but but please Free Yourself see what is the belief that is

218
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:31,160
causing that block and then put a question mark next to it is that so is

219
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:36,880
that so is that really so challenging instead of just believing it um because

220
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,880
there there are so many um unhelpful beliefs that we can

221
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:51,280
carry around unexamined beliefs we can carry around that block compassion so examine them

222
00:36:51,280 --> 00:37:00,359
that's what I'm trying to tell the person who wrote me the private question in chat that you're

223
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:10,359
welcome so thank you dear ones thank you so much for your practice

for cultivating your hearts I'm deeply deeply touched with the reports tonight and

225
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,839
just holding so many sides of of this aching

226
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:33,079
Human family where we are in pain and we cause pain and may

227
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:38,680
we may we grow in love and compassion may all beings

228
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:48,560
everywhere be free from sorrow may all beings everywhere be free including

229
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:58,079
