00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,759
Hello and welcome to this meditation to this to red to insight meditation center

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:16,800
in Redwood City, California. And welcome to um to this uh uh YouTube community of

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,640
people coming together to meditate and to hear the dharma. I appreciate this

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:29,679
opportunity. And the topic for this week has been uh

5
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:36,399
something that maybe is not automatically welcome to to address, but

6
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:43,120
this is suffering in all the different forms that it takes. and um from the

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,960
mildest stress to the greatest catastrophes of life.

8
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,719
And Buddhism, Buddhist practice, the meditation practice we're doing was

9
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:02,079
designed to address some of the deepest uh existential issues of our life and

10
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,360
and um to address them directly uh and

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:15,119
um unflinchingly. So um

12
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:22,880
uh there's many different perspectives, many different uh ways of understanding,

13
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:29,920
seeing, experiencing what we might call suffering. And as we do this uh practice of

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:39,920
mindfulness, of samadei, of insight, a time comes when uh uh the challenges of

15
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:47,280
our life, the challenges of our direct experience, challenges of our emotions, emotional life,

16
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,640
uh our physical life uh is experienced,

17
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:01,360
is seen, is known from from a place of great stillness.

18
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,960
There's a place within. We find a place in awareness

19
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:15,160
in the heart, in the mind, deep inside, in the belly

20
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,920
or some place that has no location at all.

21
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,440
that there is profound sense of stillness,

22
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:37,920
something unmoving, something imperturbable.

23
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,760
It might be being inside in a very quiet,

24
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,120
still room,

25
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,519
looking out the window. And sometimes we have the sun and

26
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,159
springtime it's nice to see. And sometimes there's the winter storms with

27
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:08,120
lots of snow and

28
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,879
um snowstorms and wind and lightning.

29
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:23,200
And um the um

30
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,440
but we're inside and we're still the movement is outside

31
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,080
and it's cozy, it's nice, it's safe, it's it's uh it's comfortable to watch

32
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,959
the snowstorm. So rather than identifying with

33
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:49,680
suffering, rather than becoming it, rather than being the the victim of it

34
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:58,000
or the re receiver of it, the bearer of our challenges, there comes a time with

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:07,040
the deepening of samadei, the deepening of insight that we can gaze upon our challenges

36
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,319
from a place of profound stillness. stillness.

37
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:20,199
A stillness that's a little bit like the stillness of a vast open space.

38
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,720
Maybe a vast place, open spacious place in nature.

39
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:31,800
Maybe the vastness of a

40
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,960
large temple or cathedral where everything has certain kind of

41
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:46,000
stillness to it that holds it all.

42
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,040
So as we sit today, maybe with your imagination, maybe with

43
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:56,080
your all your senses or particular senses,

44
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,120
maybe you can find some way

45
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:06,960
of experiencing the present moment as it unfolds

46
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:14,400
from a place of stillness. Some place inside that doesn't move.

47
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:21,680
It's not doesn't go towards, doesn't go away. Some place that's so still inside that

48
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,840
is almost like there's nothing there to resist the experiences of life like empty

49
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,520
space. It just goes right through it.

50
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,880
So assuming a meditation posture

51
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:45,199
and adjusting little bit your positionality, positions

52
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,479
of your body to bring your body into some degree of

53
00:05:52,479 --> 00:06:01,840
stillness. the body. So to to some degree

54
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,360
it moves less than usual.

55
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:19,800
And maybe it's the larger movements of the body that become still.

56
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:33,280
And within the wider stillness of the body,

57
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:39,160
become aware of the movement of the body breathing

58
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,039
and how That

59
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,639
movement of breathing

60
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,759
occurs together with the wider stillness

61
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:11,240
of the body.

62
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,080
And as you exhale

63
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:43,160
to relax into whatever stillness

64
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,960
you also feel Here.

65
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,080
There might be stillness of the body

66
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:19,800
that highlights the movements of the thinking mind,

67
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,919
the energy activation.

68
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,199
As you exhale,

69
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,039
let the activation of a thinking mind,

70
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:49,560
the edges of it dissolve into the stillness.

71
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,600
And if how you're mindful, how you're aware

72
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:32,399
also moves from one thing to another. If the mind wander wanders off in

73
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:39,880
thought and you bring it back, see if instead

74
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:47,560
you can recognize a way of being aware, being mindful

75
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,480
that doesn't move.

76
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,760
A still quiet knowing

77
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:07,519
like sitting quietly and very still

78
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,160
on a chair while you look out a window.

79
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:20,399
And the awareness doesn't move.

80
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:27,560
You don't move. Even though out the window

81
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:33,720
there's rain and wind and snow.

82
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:46,920
Know your direct experience without chasing it,

83
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,040
without going after anything.

84
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:03,079
without avoiding anything or trying to change anything.

85
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:24,640
from whatever is the stilllest nonmoving place that you find.

86
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:31,279
know the movements, the activities,

87
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:35,560
the experience you're having

88
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:45,800
where first and foremost you know the movement of breathing,

89
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:59,959
but you know it with an unme unmoving knowing

90
00:12:53,440 --> 00:13:00,680
Whenever you have a chance, settle back

91
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:06,279
to the stillness that's here.

92
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:15,160
Settle back to maybe some core center.

93
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,600
that is unmoving

94
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:31,480
that maybe has no solidity.

95
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:36,200
It's more like the unmoving

96
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:43,720
space in the middle.

97
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:49,639
of a large peaceful space.

98
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:12,320
with whatever degree of calm or subtleness you have.

99
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:18,320
Feel your way. Imagine your way

100
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:24,520
to the place within that has the most stillness.

101
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:33,960
a place of unmoving awareness,

102
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,120
attention,

103
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:49,280
and from that unmoving place,

104
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:58,400
be aware of anything that fits the word dooka.

105
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:03,400
suffering stress,

106
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:10,919
discomfort, unpleasantness

107
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:21,559
and and gaze upon it from the stillness.

108
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:29,799
Know it with the unmoving mind

109
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:44,400
that is not touched, not affected

110
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:47,960
by the duka.

111
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,080
Gaze upon

112
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,440
What is unpleasant

113
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:07,520
from the simplicity, the home,

114
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:14,600
the sacredness of a deep,

115
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:23,960
imperturbable refuge. image

116
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:31,158
of unmoving awareness.

117
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:56,400
Maybe Stillness is like the still air when

118
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,039
there's no wind.

119
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:06,840
The still air that permeates

120
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:12,519
every area of space around you.

121
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:23,039
It's always there in the stillness

122
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:27,240
of a windless day.

123
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,360
Being aware from that still place

124
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,440
imperturbable.

125
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:38,679
And as we come to the end of this sitting

126
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:47,159
with the next few exhales,

127
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:57,760
relax. Settle back into whatever place of calm,

128
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,760
stillness,

129
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,120
sense of ease that might be here.

130
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:27,440
And then with your imagination gaze upon the world

131
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,440
kindly.

132
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:40,840
Be still and gaze upon the world kindly.

133
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:57,799
Be still and gaze upon the world kindly

134
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,440
with a heart that has the well-wishing of others. close at

135
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,919
close by.

136
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:24,440
May all beings be happy.

137
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:34,279
May all beings, be safe.

138
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:42,760
May all beings be peaceful.

139
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,039
May all beings be free.

140
00:27:55,840 --> 00:28:04,760
And may it be that each of us with our inner stillness

141
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:14,039
can gaze upon others nonreactively.

142
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:29,080
And in that non-reactivity, there's a room for people to feel safe,

143
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:34,759
peaceful, and free

144
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,398
in how we relate to them.

145
00:28:48,750 --> 00:29:00,699
[Music]

146
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:09,039
Hello and welcome to this continuing series on insight, the insight of

147
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:15,120
insight meditation. And currently we're looking at the topic

148
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:23,480
of duka, the poly word for suffering or stress, d-stress.

149
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:29,760
And uh one of the learnings to be had through meditation, through mindfulness

150
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:37,039
practice, through samadei practice is that um our experience of ourselves,

151
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:46,399
our experience of the world, our experience of others is very much contingent upon the state

152
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:53,760
of mind we have. And uh and if we don't know that then we

153
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:01,840
assume that whatever way we're experiencing the world ourselves um is how how things are.

154
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:07,520
But if we begin appreciating the state of our mind, how stable the mind heart

155
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:15,120
is, how concentrated it is, how calm it is, how open it is, how receptive it is.

156
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:21,200
Um there's a whole slew of ways how how clear the mindfulness is. The state of

157
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,799
the mind has a big influ im influence in how we know ourselves, how we know

158
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:32,880
others, how we know the world and how uh and because the state of the mind can

159
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:39,039
vary quite a bit, the uh how we understand see the world and ourselves

160
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:44,799
can vary quite a bit too. And this is a radical thing to understand and very

161
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,840
different than how most people I believe go about their day. Uh most people don't

162
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:56,240
know that there's a huge range of states of minds in which we can live in

163
00:31:56,240 --> 00:32:03,039
and uh and uh and so to not

164
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:09,279
uh take as authoritative whatever way whatever state whatever view that we

165
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:16,640
have at any given time. And so the state of mind is fluid and changeable. And it

166
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:23,840
becomes more so when we uh are a meditator. When we learn how to let go,

167
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,880
we learn to get focused. We learn to get become calm. We're moving through in

168
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:34,960
between different states of mind. And uh we begin appreciating that whatever

169
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:40,480
state of mind we in is just the state of mind for now.

170
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:49,039
And the way in which we see the world becomes a little bit more like a question mark like oh or more like

171
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:54,880
appreciation. This also is uh not necessarily the absolute truth. This

172
00:32:54,880 --> 00:33:01,760
also is just a byproduct of the state of the mind that we have. And uh I think

173
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:07,519
the more people meditate the more they come to a profound appreciation that uh

174
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:12,640
of the role the state of mind has in how we know the world, how we experience the

175
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:20,960
world. Uh it's a particular state of mind where we see the world as a dangerous place.

176
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:26,159
Of course, the world is dangerous to some degree, but uh but to constantly

177
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:31,279
see it through that lens is a is a product of a particular state of mind or

178
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:38,000
art. to see the world as um as um

179
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:45,200
a difficult place, to see the world as a beautiful place, to see the world as a

180
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,919
um as a place of belonging. To see the world as a place where we don't belong.

181
00:33:51,919 --> 00:34:00,640
To see the world as as a um ours, see the world as not ours.

182
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:09,200
to see the world as um uh or to see ourselves as a as a wonderful person,

183
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:16,320
see ourselves as a difficult person, see ourselves as an inadequate person, uh all those conclusions, all those

184
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:22,480
things are in part the product of a certain state of mind. And if we're

185
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,520
navigating these views, these ideas about the world and only trying to

186
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:34,320
readjust, fix, solve the the world, solve ourselves without appreciating the

187
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:41,040
very way in which we're looking is part of the part of the solution, part of the

188
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:46,240
what's what's going on. And um and so rather than changing the world,

189
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:51,520
sometimes we learn to change our mind. And as we learn to change our mind and

190
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,920
go through all kinds of different states of mind, we're all kinds of different ways of seeing and experiencing

191
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:03,200
ourselves in the world. Then any particular state that we have in any

192
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,400
given moment, we start seeing well that's just how it is now. This is

193
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:15,520
impermanent. It's changing. It's not fixed. This is not necessarily the absolute eternal truth. This is just

194
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,440
what's real and happening at this moment. And we learn to hold it lightly.

195
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,760
We learn to not make grand conclusions. We learn how not to uh fall into the

196
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,960
delusion of permanence. It's always going to be this way.

197
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:38,000
And even to this day, I fall into little states of permanence like thinking kind

198
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,400
of almost subconsciously thinking sometimes, oh, this is how it is and I just have to kind of figure out or cope

199
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,839
with it. And um and the particularly way is sometimes when I have a lot of things

200
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:57,920
I have to do, I feel a little bit maybe harried or a little bit the pressure of my to-do list. And um and at some point

201
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:05,920
when I feel it's strong enough, I've learned to just stop and sit and meditate for a few minutes. and uh and

202
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,680
my state of mind quiets and I realized that I was the state of mind was one

203
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,079
that was had pressure in it, anxiety in it or or responsibility that was in the

204
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:24,079
forefront and it had a certain authority and I thought this is how it is. But when I

205
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:30,400
set meditate, the tension of responsibility, the tension of

206
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:37,200
the to-do list or wanting or to finish or anxiety dissipates and now I see

207
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:43,680
things in a very different way. And so this means that when I uh the more I am

208
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:50,000
aware of this, the freer I can be and the easier it is to move between states.

209
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:56,400
So it's a long introduction to point out that uh how we see suffering, how we

210
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,440
experience it, how we interpret it, our relationship to it has a lot to do with

211
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,720
the state of mind that we have. And if we're only have one state of mind that

212
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,960
we know that we're trying to address suffering, um it might be,

213
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:20,000
you know, like the bird that's pecking on the window. it's never going to get into the window. But um but it doesn't

214
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,760
know any better. And so uh the um

215
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:32,480
so sometimes what we're we want to do is not try to solve the problem in the state of mind in which the problem has

216
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,640
appeared. Sometimes when we want to uh change our state of mind, our ch our our state of

217
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,960
heart by becoming calmer, more centered and more settled to develop a clear

218
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:50,000
sense of present moment awareness where the present moment awareness is not

219
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,720
caught in the grip of our preoccupations and concerns. And um so as we begin to have this

220
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:04,320
fluidity, as we meditate, there comes a time when we become uh aware or we the

221
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:13,200
state of mind is characterized by being um very still, imperturbable,

222
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,960
nonreactive. The state of mind is spacious,

223
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,880
open, receptive. The state of mind is aquatous,

224
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:32,560
steady, and sometimes feels very broad. It feels

225
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,839
like the state of mind, the awareness maybe feels like it's expands way beyond

226
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:43,760
the boundaries of the body. Or maybe it feels like there's a quiet still place

227
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:49,440
deep, deep inside where that's the refuge, that's the home. And we're not

228
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,040
turning away from anything. We're not avoiding anything. We're quite available

229
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,760
for whatever shows up. But uh but we're available from this quiet, peaceful

230
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:09,040
place. like when I would went I lived for a while with my greatg grandmother

231
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,160
and she lived in a small little apartment in a three-story apartment

232
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:21,839
building and and I had a little room on the side and um and she doesn't seem

233
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:27,280
like she's so old now that I'm so old but back then she was in her 80s and and

234
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:34,000
she would sit in her chair kind of very soft maybe like a rocking chair or something with a blanket over her knees

235
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,880
and and I would go visit her in her small little room, a living room where she was in and

236
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:47,280
filled with little white lace that she had uh crocheted, I guess, on the table

237
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,440
and different places and um and we wouldn't talk very much and we would

238
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,119
just sit in silence together. She'd be very still and quiet, but it was so

239
00:39:59,119 --> 00:40:04,960
comforting to be with her. I felt like this was peace, this was love, this was

240
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:10,640
um a wonderful wonderful just to be with her and accompany her and her to

241
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,280
accompany me and um and so this this you know and I'm she went through a lot of

242
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:23,839
challenges in her life and um and so to her to come to this place of peace and

243
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:30,320
quiet I think was a refuge for her too and it was certainly a refuge for me. So

244
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:36,160
to find that come to that place deep inside ourselves to be able to let go of

245
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,839
the ordinary states of mind that sometimes we're attached to in a ways we don't even realize how attached we are

246
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:48,240
to being in this kind of way in the mind and to let all the tension in the mind

247
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:55,760
dissipate and quiet and come to a place where we can gaze upon our suffering

248
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:03,119
quietly. Gaze upon suffering peacefully. Gaze upon suffering without being for

249
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:08,400
and against it, without trying to fix it, without defining ourselves by it,

250
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,760
without being the victim of suffering. But we gaze upon it with a this

251
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:19,119
stillness as a a imperturbable

252
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:26,400
unmoving kind of awareness that maybe is everywhere at the same time or maybe is

253
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,240
at the center of all things or something. But there's a the shifting

254
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,400
states of mind to come to a place where we know that we can be aware of anything

255
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,599
at all and not be affected by it not be

256
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:50,640
troubled by it. So in relationship to suffering to suffer but not be troubled

257
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:58,319
by it to feel stress feel discomfort and not be preoccupied be it caught in it

258
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:04,480
but to kind of be our own great grandmother just peacefully quiet

259
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:13,440
um present available seeing knowing not shutting anything out

260
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:19,359
but knowing from an imperturbable able place knowing from a non-reactive place

261
00:42:19,359 --> 00:42:26,960
knowing from a profound stillness within. This isn't easy to do.

262
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,480
But as we go through some the the practice of samadei, the practices of

263
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:40,560
insight, uh we're going through different states of mind. And at some point we start feeling, sensing,

264
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,960
intuiting um this place of profound stillness

265
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,800
that has space to let everything be just as it is.

266
00:42:52,800 --> 00:43:00,160
Nothing has to change, but we're aware of it in a still way.

267
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,520
And in relationship to suffering, we know suffering, but we're not

268
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:12,160
troubled by suffering. We know suffering, but we don't suffer

269
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:19,599
because we're suffering. We just know the discomfort as discomfort. We just know the stress as

270
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:25,280
the stress, the tension as the tension. And it's not anything that needs to be

271
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:30,560
fixed or solved because

272
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:37,760
in that place of stillness in a certain kind of way there are no

273
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:44,720
problems. It's just what is here. And this is not the absolute state. This

274
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:50,160
is not the final conclusion. This is not how it's supposed to be what I'm talking about today.

275
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:56,480
But it's one particular state of mind that we can tap into. And as a dharma

276
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:02,160
teacher uh when I'm supporting other people in practice, I'm less interested

277
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,359
in the state of mind that people attain or have than I'm interested in the

278
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:13,200
fluidity, the ease by which people can move between different states of mind.

279
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:21,119
That's where the freedom is. And as we become more free and relaxed and can move freely between states of mind, then

280
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:28,720
at some point this idea of the unmoving, imperturbable, still aquamous mind

281
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:36,240
becomes highlighted and it becomes a gamecher to be able to

282
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:44,880
understand suffering in this kind of very free way where we're not defined by it or troubled by it. And then we might

283
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:55,119
that might carry over into our ordinary states of mind where we begin now see how contingent and uh and our reactivity

284
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:00,319
is and how unnecessary our reactivity is and we can learn to

285
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:05,359
leave suffering alone and be free.

286
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:12,560
So I hope this makes sense and um and uh I hope it doesn't trouble you. The idea

287
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:18,720
is to support you to be untroubled through all this and we'll continue this

288
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:24,680
uh adventure uh tomorrow. Thank you.
