1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:06,439
good morning and good morning to all of you

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:13,040
uh it's it's really lovely to be here and I have a few friends that are here

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:18,480
and it lifts my heart but it doesn't diminish the affection I

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:25,119
feel for all of you that I don't know who are here spending

5
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:32,398
this time meditating together and practicing the dharma it is a delight so

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,520
I want to be sure to mention that because perhaps the lifting that I feel

7
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,840
from my friends makes it more likely that I see that I share an affection for

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,440
all of you and it is that that I want to talk about today

9
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,520
how how do our views the views that we have

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,840
influence our experience and what does that mean how does that affect who we

11
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,439
are how we are how we practice whether we suffer

12
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,880
so in uh in wise view one of the first

13
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,880
factors of the eight-fold path one of the one of the goals is to be

14
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:26,680
able to see clearly that's the only part of that biography I really like

15
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:35,520
um that that that that is my goal in life is to be able to see really clearly

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:41,520
and if we're going to see clearly it's crucial that we see the color of

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,560
the lens that we're looking through it's crucial that we know what our

18
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,600
prejudices and biases are how how we are viewing the world

19
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,320
why we have views is influenced by how we're seeing how we're looking where

20
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:08,720
we're looking otherwise we are subject to delusion so one one

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,080
piece that uh got me started on this idea was a a briefing that I got an

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:20,560
email i get a lot of really horrible emails but one of them every day uh

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,680
during the week I get a briefing from Nature magazine and it has a list of you

24
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,800
know the latest things that people have found in all realms of science it kind of keeps me from forgetting entirely

25
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,280
that there's something else going on in the world besides news and so in this scientific news today there was an

26
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,319
article or this week there was an article about the coffer illusion some of you may know what this is but

27
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:53,120
basically it's an optical illusion and it it was done by a man in uh San Francisco actually created by a man in

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,200
San Francisco uh that is made up of a whole series of

29
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:05,360
well most people see squares

30
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:10,640
the estimate is 97% of people see squares when they look at this i saw

31
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,720
squares when I looked at this but some people see circles

32
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,400
some people see circles now the article was about there are lots of theories about why people see squares or circles

33
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,319
the article was about some psychologists who have been linking this to

34
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:36,799
conditioning visual conditioning of how how we raised so so if you see squares

35
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:42,000
their theory is that you see that because you're used to assembling your

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,080
life your your buildings your streets everything's kind of on a grid we like

37
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:54,480
we like we see preferentially squares structures that are at right

38
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:59,920
angles to one another but they tested some people in a village

39
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,239
in Africa who who live in huts round huts and they

40
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,400
have round corral that they keep their animals in and they see circles

41
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,519
now after staring at the illusion for a while I was able to see the circles and

42
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,160
now I can rapidly go back and forth between them but I always see the squares first

43
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:29,919
you put it up in front of me I see the squares and I look and I can find the circles i know exactly how to do it now

44
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:35,040
my mind knows how to make that shift and I can go back and forth at will

45
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,960
now what's interesting is that one of the things I noticed when I was

46
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,840
first reading about this was that I wanted to be able to see those circles that I wanted to be somebody who saw the

47
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:55,479
circles i wanted to be in that 3% i noticed that trend toward exceptionalism

48
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:01,880
i want to be exceptional i want to see the circles

49
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:08,000
interesting to see that this is what our practice is

50
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:13,520
in order to see what is guiding what we're doing we na need to be able to

51
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,680
understand what are our mind habits what are the things that we typically default

52
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,039
to where do we go when we look at somebody when we see something now I'm

53
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:31,120
speaking mostly of optical illusions but it can apply to anything it can apply to

54
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:39,160
I feel unsettled right away i need to know why I'm feeling unsettled excuse me

55
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,240
i want to know why I'm feeling unsettled what I can do about it how can I fix it

56
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,600
it takes a lot of practice to just stay with unsettled

57
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:57,600
because it's uncomfortable and we we don't like that we want to be comfortable

58
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,160
now what I want to emphasize is there's nothing good or bad no judgment applied

59
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,199
to any of this the fact that I see squares doesn't mean

60
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:15,280
anything about me except I see squares in fact

61
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,160
there are no actual squares or circles in the illusion they're just sticks of different lengths

62
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:29,199
arranged on a page and it's called coffer because the squares appear to be

63
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:36,600
indented like you could put something in them in into the little recesses of the squares

64
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,120
but they're just sticks or light or shades whatever you call it the reality

65
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,800
of it there are neither squares nor circles but the perception is that there are

66
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:56,759
squares or circles and and the predominant perception is that there are squares

67
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:04,560
it's really crucial to understand how that affects our experience

68
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,000
not just because of that page but because everything that we experience has that feature

69
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,400
of being influenced by where you're coming from and what you're looking for

70
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:26,080
and what you're familiar with we are conditioned by the familiar

71
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,199
that's a large part of seeing actually we can't typically see things that we're not used to seeing

72
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:39,440
it's quite difficult we miss stuff we just miss it

73
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:47,120
so I'm going to read you a quote by uh Andrew Alenski who wrote a book called Untangling Self that's where this is

74
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,960
from the truth is we like our preferences and prejudices

75
00:07:52,960 --> 00:08:00,039
we like defining ourselves in terms of what we like and don't like

76
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:09,919
it's precisely desire's entanglement with the sense of self that makes this all so difficult to unravel

77
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,240
fortunately there's a relatively easy and accessible way to counter the powerful forces of desire the

78
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,800
cultivation of equinimity every moment of mindfulness is also a

79
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:30,400
moment of equinimity it is not a disengagement from the object of awareness but rather the full

80
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,680
and complete engagement with it it is engaging with the breath or with

81
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,959
the feeling tone or with a thought without also either wanting it to stay as it is or wanting it to be different

82
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,320
than it is end of quote so the truth is we like our

83
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,040
preferences and prejudices

84
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:01,120
we define ourselves in terms of what we like or don't like you know we're

85
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,320
constantly saying "Well I'm somebody who does this i'm somebody who believes this

86
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:14,480
and you're somebody who believes that." Because we have ideas and prejudices and

87
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:20,240
beliefs about other people based on totally arbitrary things they could just

88
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:26,120
be sticks and we're seeing squares

89
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:34,320
or you could be frowning and I could decide oh you don't like what I'm saying

90
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,519
and you're really frowning because your knee hurts

91
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:46,880
but I don't know that and I interpret what's happening to you or with me

92
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:54,720
andrew Olinsk's quote emphasizes the importance of willing direct experience

93
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,640
with this is what's happening really this is what's happening when I

94
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:09,760
feel myself when I feel the energy of forming an opinion about something can I stop very key pause and say is that

95
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:16,399
what's happening or how I'm interpreting it then what can I look what can't I really see

96
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:22,160
in this moment as opposed to what do I believe about

97
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:25,399
this moment

98
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,240
so it often involves this bias we have of

99
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:42,160
how we see involves judgment judgment of me judgment of you you know so so I

100
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:48,240
mentioned the thing of exceptionalism seeing that

101
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,519
I had this urge toward wanting to be different wanting to be separate I could

102
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:58,560
decide oh there's something wrong with you you have to be important i can form

103
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,519
all sorts of opinions about that unless I'm also able to see that I really like

104
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:13,200
being here in this group with this group i happen to be sitting up here but

105
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,120
really it's with you that that lifts my soul lifts my heart

106
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,040
but if I'm focused on oh I got to worry about whether I'm conceited or whatever

107
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:35,440
the judgment is you have about one yourself or about others you can become derailed from what's actually happening

108
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:41,440
you get kind of stuck in a rut and find yourself going down a tunnel this is my

109
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,279
conventional way of thinking this is how it is

110
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:53,560
and what we're really doing is seeing what is familiar

111
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,720
seeing what is familiar

112
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:08,480
so I recently spent some time with my sister who uh is closest in age to me i

113
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:15,600
come from a large family and I really love my sister and uh

114
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,760
maybe three days into her visit I found myself wanting to tear her apart

115
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:29,360
i could feel the anger and I I turned around and I walked away and I realized

116
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:37,279
and I walked away because I didn't want to say something hurtful so I wasn't totally out of control i could I could

117
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:45,040
see anger is here and consequences are always bad so I'm I turned away and as I

118
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:50,959
walked away I thought about how this was actually an automatic response based on

119
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:59,120
a long history of life with my sister and thinking oh she's always that way as soon as I heard she is always or I am

120
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:04,560
always as soon as I hear that message in my head I immediately know that I'm lost

121
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:12,320
in some delusion i immediately know I'm not seeing things as they are

122
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,160
because the truth is I turned away because I loved my sister not because I

123
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,319
was angry

124
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:33,279
seeing clearly requires you to really notice what's going on and be brutally

125
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:40,000
honest about it it is neither good nor bad the fact that anger arises

126
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:47,920
is not bad it just is what we do next determines whether it's

127
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,560
skillful or unskillful

128
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:00,800
one of the places this shows up most clearly is in the realm of righteousness

129
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:06,320
this is how it should be it really should be this way and it's

130
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:13,440
not this way and the dissatisfaction comes from the sense that there's one

131
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,639
right way that this can be

132
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,480
and one has to ask oneself if they're just not seeing the circles

133
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:33,000
am I just not seeing the circles

134
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,880
one of the the difficulties of unraveling the case of

135
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:49,199
of reacting from a sense of familiar seeing what's familiar noticing what's familiar

136
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:55,480
is that we ignore that the conditions are always changing

137
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:01,959
so conditions are such that today this is happening

138
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,720
so maybe at noon I don't want to be down at Market Street in San Francisco because

139
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:16,560
it's going to be really really busy there and there going to be a million people there and I might not be able to

140
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:24,839
find my way on another day that is totally untrue

141
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:33,040
the conditions are always changing in every moment for everything that is occurring any experience you have you do

142
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:40,000
not repeat that experience there are some conditions that are different and so being able to recognize I'm acting

143
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:47,199
from a conditioned response or I I can see the tendency toward a conditioned

144
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:54,160
response gives us the freedom to stop and say "Oh

145
00:15:54,160 --> 00:16:00,079
am I seeing clearly am I really seeing what's happening or am I just seeing

146
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:06,880
what you know is easy to see it's easy to see

147
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:12,320
one place this plays out very strongly is in the case of expectations

148
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,399
we may we plan something and in fact this is what the anger with

149
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,639
my sister was about i had a plan for how how the visit was going to go we were

150
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:32,839
going to do X Y and Z and we were going to do it in this order and it was going to make everything perfect

151
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,079
except you know her grandson didn't want to do that

152
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:43,839
and he was there too and I found myself just being irritated

153
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,759
by that but but I'm trying to make this perfect for you

154
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:57,600
can't you see this act of generosity it took me a while to see that it was my

155
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,720
selfish grasping on my expectation of how

156
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:09,360
delighted they were going to be by this thing I planned that I failed to see that they were actually delighted by

157
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:12,678
something else

158
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,839
and the suffering was being caused by my expectations

159
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:28,000
not by anything they were doing or even anything I was doing it was all based on

160
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:34,640
I have a plan this is how I think it should go this is what this is how I'm this is what I'm

161
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,760
offering it comes from a very generous place and turns into something not quite so generous

162
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:48,720
not quite so generous when we are disappointed over the

163
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:57,520
outcome of something the first thing we want to do is establish blame it's your fault it's my fault

164
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,080
no you just see it and when I saw that my expectations were getting in the way

165
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,200
of everybody being at ease I thought "Oh well it's just

166
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,320
expectations i can let go of expectations

167
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:20,080
the mind locks back on the expectation no it's just an expectation step away

168
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:26,120
from it again step away step away

169
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:34,400
we can't really recondition the mind willfully overnight

170
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:40,480
we can only increase our ability to see when the mind habit is occurring when

171
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:47,400
it's showing up when it's arising we condition ourselves to watch

172
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:54,679
and then we say "Oh that's what's happening oh I see that."

173
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:06,000
The other thing to keep in mind is the tendency of us to see things from

174
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,200
our point of view all the time because you know that's where we're looking from right

175
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:17,399
but can I see you if I'm only worried about me

176
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:26,000
so there's need for balance in our view as well when I feel jittery when I feel

177
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:32,160
irritated when I feel delighted I too have a tendency to say "Ah it

178
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,320
means this it's about that." And then I look at who else is in the

179
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:45,360
room and see what does their experience look like what does it feel like for them it

180
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,360
helps me get more in touch with what's really happening

181
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,480
but if I'm only focused on me

182
00:19:56,559 --> 00:20:01,080
I can't see what's actually happening

183
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,039
because I'm leaving out a large part of the experience

184
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:15,280
seeing clearly requires us to be open to all the aspects of experience

185
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:21,039
to be open which can be you know scary

186
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:28,280
it leaves you a little vulnerable guess what that's a good thing

187
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:36,760
because it means you're taking it in you're actually taking in what's what the experience truly is

188
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:43,039
so many of our assumptions are

189
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:47,720
biologically socially conditioned

190
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:54,080
we're conditioned beings but we're not determined by those

191
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,840
conditions we can see oh this is happening

192
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,880
we don't decide to have that conditioning it's just there

193
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:15,200
we don't decide well what we do

194
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:22,559
is we reinforce what we believe we re reinforce ideas that we have about

195
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:31,879
ourselves how we are how we should be instead of what's happening now

196
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:39,720
what's going on in this space in this time with these conditions what's happening now

197
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:49,039
we've all had the experience where uh everything is going beautifully

198
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:54,559
and we say "Ah now I've got it i know just how this works

199
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,240
this feels so good and we feel locked into the experience

200
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:06,880
because it's a pleasurable experience when we feel like we're in the flow you know we're in the flow we're just moving

201
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,919
with things it's really easy and

202
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:17,840
we ascribe meaning to that oh this means that now I've got the answer i know how

203
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:25,360
to do this cool i'm never going to be angry with my sister again right

204
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:38,159
being affected is not the issue noticing something is not the end point

205
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:43,200
the next thing we do is say "Okay I notice that I'm affected how am I being

206
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,960
affected what do I notice what's going on in me how do I use this information

207
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,559
that I've just received that things are not the way I thought or they

208
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:59,600
are the way I thought how is this affecting me what what do I feel about

209
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:06,000
that so rather than getting caught up in the

210
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:13,840
story about it so let's let's take the case of being angry with my sister

211
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:18,880
instead of worrying about why I'm angry or what I'm angry about or what all the

212
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:24,000
details of the story I can notice that it makes me uncomfortable that I'm

213
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,840
irritated that I'm hot i can change the focus based on what I see that

214
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:38,480
disentangles me from the story so that I'm not reinforcing the view

215
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,679
not reinforcing the need for blame i'm over i'm in a different realm now

216
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:50,880
still with this what's happening but now I can feel what does this anger feel

217
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:56,640
like what and the in in turning it around so that I'm not reinforcing why

218
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:02,480
the anger is there explaining the anger whatever the feeling is just being

219
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:10,320
present for that allows me to say "Oh that feels not good i don't want that to

220
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:18,080
continue." It increases the possibility I can step away from that anger i'm not fighting

221
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:23,840
the anger i can see it and say "Okay

222
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:29,919
anger is here but it's not me i don't want to cultivate it here's how I'm

223
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:36,159
feeling i'm my stomach is upset i'm looking at the actual things that are

224
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:43,279
happening and not trying to interpret them i'm also not denying that it's there

225
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:50,480
that's delusion but it's not the only thing there

226
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:55,520
and I can look up and I can see in the the particular case of where this

227
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:01,679
argument occurred i looked out at the at the waves and the

228
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:10,279
beach we're on Santa Cruz Beach and said "Isn't it a beautiful day

229
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:16,039
it's still a beautiful day

230
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:24,720
you don't we don't have to take some emotional content piece of experience

231
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,640
and make it the entire experience

232
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:36,559
we get washed away in waves by an emotional experience

233
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:45,880
but we don't have to be and we and like waves we can see them come crashing in and they go out again

234
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,200
they're not who we are

235
00:25:54,799 --> 00:26:00,240
so while the programmed mind establishes what it is that's going on

236
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,840
we can say is that true and what else is happening is that true and what else is

237
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:11,440
happening and what is actually happening that's led me to this conclusion

238
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,320
what's actually happening

239
00:26:16,559 --> 00:26:24,159
how is this affecting me and now what am I going to do the skillful thing is not to have these

240
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:29,840
biases never show up the skillful thing is what do I do when they show up

241
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,840
what do they do what what do I do with this whatever the bias is

242
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,039
maybe it's a bias toward optimism

243
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:47,039
my husband really likes to see the good in everything

244
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:53,360
so when he's frowning and he's trying desperately to find the good

245
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,080
you know he's suffering

246
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,400
because he doesn't want to see the stuff that he doesn't like to see none of us

247
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:09,760
do we don't like pain we don't like discomfort

248
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:17,120
and we tend to think it means something so Sylvia Bourstein tells this wonderful story she um I don't know if she still

249
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:23,120
tells it i heard it 20 years ago or something but she uh was trying to get a

250
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:31,200
hold of somebody at Zen Center and they exchanged emails this was before the world of texting and telephone calls and

251
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:38,159
they just didn't seem to connect so one morning she was calling Zen Center and she she asked for the person and whoever

252
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:43,679
answered the phone said "Well he's not here." And she said "You know it just must be that we're not meant to

253
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:50,039
connect." and he said 'N no it just means that he's not here

254
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:58,320
now I particularly like this story a because it's humorous but really because

255
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,399
it it makes it really clear what it is we're talking about here it's not life or death it's that we tend to form

256
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:10,320
opinions and implications when actually this is the only thing

257
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,640
that's happening just this just this thing is happening

258
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:24,080
we have to take out the have to take into account the nature of our attitudes

259
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:30,480
you know what's my mood today uh how how am I feeling physically did I

260
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:36,240
have a night where I couldn't sleep and so I'm really kind of short

261
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:41,279
i have attention deficit i'm not actually listening to you i

262
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,799
heard the first two words but after that

263
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:56,520
we can develop a sense of the energy of how we are in the world

264
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,320
in order to to make these quick determinations of what's actually going on

265
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,760
we have to pause we have to have some something that we look at look at the

266
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:14,000
energy am I leaning toward this am I leaning away from this am I

267
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:21,120
lifted by this am I depressed by this learn to follow the energy of what's

268
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,600
happening it keeps you from getting lost in the story for one thing there's a tendency then to convert that into this

269
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:33,440
is what this means like you know we're not expect we're not meant to meet

270
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:39,840
but if we develop a feel for what our preferences and expectations are like

271
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,880
what does it feel like to to find myself leaning toward an expectation i've got a

272
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,320
plan and to feel yourself moving ahead to the next item on your plan you can

273
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:59,320
kind of feel that leaning into part and say "Maybe I'll just stay here

274
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:04,120
maybe I'll just stay now

275
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:12,000
become sensitive to the the energy flow of your attitudes your your

276
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,440
uh responses your experience

277
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,559
become familiar with it that's part of what we do in meditation

278
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:29,279
when we're sitting in meditation and watching what arises I can't seem to sit here today i feel

279
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,399
like I'm going to jump out of my skin feel what that feels like know what that

280
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,919
feels like there are many times where we're standing in the kitchen and we feel like

281
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:46,720
we're going to jump out of our skin or or we're driving down the freeway to know that and say "Oh that's what's

282
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:54,640
happening." If this is the jumping out of my skin feeling and not everybody on the road is driving

283
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,640
crazy

284
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:06,399
find yourself free of blame don't let the view of this has to be

285
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:12,480
someone's fault or someone's doing or someone's responsibility

286
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:19,440
mine or yours and just be with the experience of this is what's happening

287
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:27,279
know that the views of mind habits are very strong learn yours

288
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:36,240
learn the ones that come up most often they're tendencies they're not you

289
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:41,760
just as sometimes I really really really want to be alone just as strongly

290
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:50,760
sometimes I really really really want to be in a crowd not as often crowds

291
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:57,919
but get a feeling for what what pressures you

292
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:03,360
get a feel for it notice oh there's pressure here i'm feeling pressure

293
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:09,760
there's stress there's stress here i'm feeling this not I am stressed but I'm

294
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:15,360
feeling stress i'm feeling some pressure i'm feeling anxiety

295
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,519
anxiety is here instead of saying "Oh well of course I'm

296
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:28,480
anxious i'm always anxious under these conditions." No no no these conditions didn't happen before

297
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,600
oh what's happening that anxiety is here what am I actually feeling what am I

298
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:42,399
uncomfortable with what am I delighted with

299
00:32:42,399 --> 00:32:48,880
how can I have more of this in my life what did I just notice that lifted my

300
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,320
heart ah because every time you notice something that lifts your heart it makes

301
00:32:54,320 --> 00:33:00,200
it more likely that you'll notice something again later

302
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:08,320
feel the energy note this is how it's affecting me this

303
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,000
is affecting me this energy is affecting me this experience is affecting me but

304
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,640
it is not me

305
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:27,039
this is the wisdom of wise view i see it but it is not me it just is

306
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,240
what's happening it's just this it doesn't have any untrust truthful any

307
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,760
unconventional meaning

308
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:44,960
what we're in search of here is truth truth what's true

309
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:52,080
if we know the patterns and behaviors that we are prone to we can learn to see

310
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:58,399
them and say "Is is that coloring what my experience is now

311
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:06,278
or is I is it something that I need to pay attention to?"

312
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:17,158
And remember that what we think we are is just a point of view

313
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:22,398
what we think we are is just a point of view and then any given day we might

314
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:27,000
think we are something entirely different

315
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,040
there's a role of the people that we interact with

316
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:46,000
in seeing ourselves clearly when we notice how people react to us

317
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:53,280
we can form assumptions about them or we can say "What are they reacting to

318
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,720
what are they seeing what's going on with them

319
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:08,920
what's going on with them just as much as I'm interested in what's going on with me what's going on with them

320
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,079
because our practice is really relative to other people you know it feels like

321
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:24,760
it's all about us but it is really about all of us as opposed to me

322
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:30,480
suffering in the world arises because I want to be liked because I want this

323
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:36,320
because I want that i have all kinds of desires things I want to have happen things I don't want

324
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,920
to have happen how attached to those things am I

325
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:49,359
earlier in the week I had I ran across something that I I wanted I wanted and

326
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:56,400
it was too expensive i've been following it for a year waiting for it to go on sale it finally went on sale and I

327
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:01,520
wanted that i wanted that and I said

328
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:08,920
"And it's on sale this is great just what I was waiting for

329
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:14,280
but you know I really don't need it."

330
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,079
And when I heard my say self say "I don't need it," I thought "Well you're just arguing with yourself now you're

331
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:27,200
trying to be as you know trying to be a good person yes and

332
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:34,000
I don't need it i really don't need it

333
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,359
i took it out of the cart it's been there for a year

334
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:48,960
waiting to go on sale it was interesting for three days it's

335
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,800
been on sale and I kept watching what does it feel like to want

336
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:59,839
pretty soon the want was much bigger the understanding the want was much bigger

337
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:04,960
than the item I mean the item just kind of disappeared but what was interesting

338
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:13,200
was how strong that wanting was for something I didn't even need

339
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,520
would have very little impact on my

340
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,400
almost none and how strong that wanting was

341
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:33,359
not because I'm a bad person or because I am I don't know any number

342
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,119
of things that you could say about it but because I'm human I'm also subject

343
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:46,240
to wanting and not wanting and to be able to watch that feel that

344
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:52,079
understand what that feels like to see when you're in the grips of that is a

345
00:37:52,079 --> 00:38:00,119
very important part of practice how we cling to something

346
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:06,880
to be with that in a nonjudgmental way

347
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,640
so all of that wanting the thought would arise oh you're a bad

348
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,320
person for wanting ah that's I don't need to go there what I need to

349
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:27,119
do is understand what the wanting is to to really feel the wanting doesn't have anything to do about who I am it only

350
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:33,078
exists under these conditions

351
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:41,440
the way that we are with these uncomfortable things that we see is by

352
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:49,079
not assuming that they're us they just are they're just there

353
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:02,599
so I have lots of other things in here I could have said however

354
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:10,800
what I want to leave you with is that awareness of what's happening

355
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,560
is impacted both by the views that we bring into the moment and the

356
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,240
mindfulness with which we see them

357
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:30,400
wise view comes out of seeing things as they are recognizing the tendencies of

358
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:37,960
our mind habits seeing them nonjudgmentally

359
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:47,440
the space we want to occupy is the space of neither wanting nor pushing away the

360
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,560
experience just see the experience

361
00:39:52,560 --> 00:40:00,240
don't label it as good or bad that just gets in the way

362
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:06,640
so I'm going to read you a uh a pros poem by Steve Cohit

363
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:14,640
uh and it's co called Mount Baldi this is a spirit up before dawn to

364
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:20,960
meditate all day with a saffronroed Thai terraada Buddhist monk who explains the

365
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,119
incomprehensible dharma in all but incomprehensible English then jabs a

366
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:32,240
finger in the air and nods triumphantly and at the bell propped upon my purple

367
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:39,040
zafu in half lotus I set grimly to the task of reigning in the hyperactive and

368
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:44,560
incourageable mind that screaming brat who's flying up and down the supermarket

369
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:51,920
aisles flinging from the shelves everything in sight i liked Malt Mount Baldi in the Zeno

370
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:59,680
there and Terraata mindfulness practice and that grinning sensei with his fractured English and I liked as well

371
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:06,319
that shapely dark lubricious fellow meditator three zafuss down her lovely

372
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:13,280
face and arched cross-legged body lust longing random fragmentaryary thoughts

373
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,319
and drowsy bits of memories and momentary bouts of wakeful consciousness

374
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:23,839
and sudden bursts of joy one moment quiet ecstasy and utter peace the next

375
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:30,000
the wish this week weekendl long retreat were long since over with my back felt

376
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,760
stiff my knees achd then Sunday after lunch with an hour's freedom for myself

377
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:40,880
I wandered off alone and scrabbled up a nearby hill and found a perfect rock to

378
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:48,160
sit upon and looked around unbburdened and relaxed amazed by everything those

379
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:55,440
few spare pines the skies soul-wrenching blue and at my feet a tribe of ants

380
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:02,800
systematically upending grains of sand and far away that winding strip of highway with its antlike string of

381
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:09,200
trucks and cars and then I saw her in a clearing some 50 odd feet below where I

382
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,960
was perched that gorgeous raven-haired young meditator that seductive bodhicattva wielding a long crescent

383
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:23,920
sword and practicing her katas cutting through desire the hundred,000 permutations of the

384
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:30,560
wobbling mind wonder pleasure dreams desires and memories

385
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:38,960
i simply watch and let them be they too luminous transparent perfectly apparent

386
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:44,960
perfectly themselves that all things rise abide are changed

387
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:52,960
and pass away mindfulness practice at the Zeno at Mount Baldi 6,000 ft above the sea

388
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,520
exquisite world of craving and delusion

389
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,720
there he was on a perfect rock unbburdened and

390
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:17,440
relaxed amazed by everything those few spare pines the sky soul-wrenching blue

391
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:23,760
and at my feet a tribe of ants systematically upending grains of sand and far away that winding strip of

392
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,520
highway with its ant-like strength of trucks and cars and then I saw her in a

393
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:36,319
clearing some 50 odd feet below where I was perched that gorgeous raven-haired young meditator that seductive

394
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:42,720
bodhicattva wielding a long crescent sword and practicing her katas cutting through

395
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:50,440

396
00:43:50,960 --> 00:44:00,480
wonder pleasure dreams desires and memories i simply watch and let them be

397
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:07,839
they too luminous transparent perfectly apparent perfectly themselves

398
00:44:07,839 --> 00:44:15,839

399
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:23,119
the Zeno Mount Baldi 6,000 feet above the sea or here at IMC

400
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:32,520
exquisite world of craving and delusion may you all see clearly thank you
