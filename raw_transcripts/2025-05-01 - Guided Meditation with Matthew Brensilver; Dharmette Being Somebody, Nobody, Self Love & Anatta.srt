1
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:15,440
okay folks So uh so welcome It's um I always happy happy to see um your

2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,840
names and be practicing uh

3
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:27,400
together So um finding uh yeah finding a posture

4
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:11,960
Just landing in your body as a bird lands on the earth

5
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:19,400
Just breathing into your body as if to uh deepen the sense of gravity

6
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,800
And just as we we begin scanning through

7
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,599
uh the the hindrances just to see what's here

8
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:37,920
So the two poles of energy of agitation restlessness on the one

9
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:46,040
hand kind of dullness sloth the other

10
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,079
And the two poles of of desire of wanting not

11
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:07,040
wanting seeking sense pleasure experiencing aversion ill

12
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,599
will and doubt

13
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:28,880
kind of lack of confidence in our contact with

14
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,520
sensory

15
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,840
experience The dharma

16
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:55,360
Feeling buried behind layers of

17
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:07,520
fog And so each of these five we just uh get a kind of pulse

18
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:16,080
check It's okay Whatever you find just bring that into awareness in your

19
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,080
finding

20
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:43,080
Just appreciating how profoundly intolerant we are of unpleasantness

21
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,800
But to be judgmental is just kind of uh the architecture of our nervous

22
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:09,198
system is unpleasantness even quite

23
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:21,160
modest signals to us that um something about the universe is off its rails

24
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:38,000
And sloth is unpleasant Restlessness is unpleasant Sense longing is unpleasant

25
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,800
Illw will is unpleasant Delusion unpleasant Doubt unpleasant

26
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,560
We bear with

27
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:04,520
it and blessing it with our awareness

28
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,279
and pay attention to whatever you feel drawn to pay attention

29
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:51,040
to Maybe the cycles of your breathing maybe your body more

30
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:58,240
broadly maybe uh your body experience from the

31
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:06,279
perspective of emotionality and affect urgency and motivation

32
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,680
Maybe you're anchoring to sound Maybe the anchor is

33
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:27,040
everywhere nowhere Just wide open to all sensory

34
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,040
experience

35
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:49,600
But every so often may be fruitful

36
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:59,399
to check the ways in which our attention can become a kind of

37
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:03,959
appendage of our wanting

38
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:18,399
And so [Music] we do a kind of pulse check the ways in

39
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:26,880
which greed or aversion creeps

40
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:32,519
into the meditating mind

41
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:10,160
How much can we

42
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,720
relax and offer a kind of unmixed attention

43
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:40,439
an attention that bows rather than grasps

44
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:59,559
We're practicing surrendering control

45
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,440
And we think wait a second no I have to pay attention I have to let go I have

46
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,240
to do all these

47
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:41,880
things Surrender and control does all of them

48
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:15,000
You really don't have

49
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,640
to create goodness

50
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,679
Just let it find you

51
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:45,720
Greed hidden delusion is a making of measurement

52
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:08,919
Just put down all all

53
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:13,320
the yard sticks

54
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:45,278
[Music]

55
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:21,159
Okay it's nice to uh nice to practice with you Um I know that

56
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:27,799
sit was better for me having been with you all than it would have

57
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:32,679
been left to my own devices

58
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:42,360
SA So for whatever

59
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:47,559
reason this morning I went back to um

60
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:54,640
my notes that I had saved from the kind of very first Dharma talks I'd given Um

61
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,799
these are about 17 years ago

62
00:30:59,799 --> 00:31:07,600
and it's kind of a fossil record of my wisdom and

63
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:14,720
delusion you know and that's kind of interesting to look

64
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:20,080
back and hindsight of course 2020 as they say

65
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:28,000
but um we know with certainty that um

66
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:37,399
uh the present will become the past And so until

67
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:44,080
time stops some humility is uh is

68
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:51,360
necessary And um it was curious to see some you know kind of detect some

69
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:57,799
measure of uh confusion in those notes A kind of

70
00:31:57,799 --> 00:32:04,320
angular rigidity but also uh some continuities

71
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:09,600
themes that preoccupied me then remain with me

72
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:18,159
now And I had looked uh uh back at a talk I'd given on a classic line from from uh

73
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:24,399
Jack Angler who's a I think transpersonal psychologist and Buddhist

74
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:31,200
uh writer teacher and he he as I as I recall it he

75
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:38,120
got this question about somebody with psychosis highly unstable sense of

76
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:46,480
self and uh so the questioner are asked like okay are they given this this very kind of

77
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:54,559
amorphous sense of self are is that person close to um understanding a nota understanding

78
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:03,159
not self and uh angller's reply was you have to be somebody before being

79
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:08,320
nobody and the implication is you have to have a solid sense of self before you

80
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,039
can shed that self and many years later

81
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:21,440
um um he uh Engler was interviewed and was asked where he stood on that quote

82
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:28,919
you know and he said yes um well I don't see it as quite that linear exclusive

83
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:35,039
anymore in a general way I would still stand by it that you have to be somebody

84
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,320
before you can be nobody although it's a provocative way of putting Yet what I

85
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:46,519
had in mind when making that statement was that if you're going to go to the depths of the Buddhist mindfulness

86
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:52,120
practice which is what I was talking about it requires certain psychological

87
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:57,440
capacities what in the psychoanalytic tradition would be called a certain

88
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:04,240
basic ego strengths And those ego strengths form around some stable sense

89
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:11,760
of sense of who we are some stable sense of identity I still believe that's

90
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:18,040
true So I get that the the

91
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:24,118
deconstruction needs to occur from a place of

92
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:29,599
strength And I I've recently suggested that there

93
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,760
are kind of two dimensions Insight into not self gives us power insight

94
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,919
into self makes us safe And I think all that's fair enough

95
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:48,398
but it strikes me that there's some confusion

96
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:54,599
um involving our language about you know quote

97
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:01,240
self and uh the philosopher Vickenstein famously says phil philosophy is a

98
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:09,599
battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language

99
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:18,839
And the word self self in the in the phrase self-love it's not exactly the same as

100
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:24,839
self in the phrase no self not self

101
00:35:24,839 --> 00:35:32,320
anata and selflove is is not the celebration of a permanent selfexisting

102
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:37,920
entity that is me That's not what self- loveve is Self-

103
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:44,720
loveve is not a kind of deeply emotionally charged story about the

104
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:49,960
essence of my being

105
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:55,280
And self-love is um maybe better thought

106
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,520
of as a kind of forgiveness Self- loveve is forgiveness It's understanding and

107
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:06,880
honoring one's very peculiar conditioning and

108
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:13,359
sensing our innocence And so to love oneself is not

109
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:18,680
to cher cherish or elevate a self or

110
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:23,760
claim ownership over something

111
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:31,760
In other words self love is an expression of of

112
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:39,960
non-clinging Maybe we even say um selflove is the

113
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:45,560
first mini taste of the emptiness of

114
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:51,400
self Self- loveve is the first taste

115
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,400
Self-hatred is clinging Self- agrandisement is

116
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:05,240
clinging Self-love is the beginning of unclenching the

117
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:11,560
fist the beginning of insight into not self

118
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:22,440
The kindness we can show to ourself um the love we can show is a function of

119
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:29,320
metaccognitive clarity Metaccognitive clarity In other

120
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:34,359
words we're we're not fused We're not

121
00:37:34,359 --> 00:37:44,240
wedded We're not reifying um some some story some self story

122
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:50,800
In a person with um psychosis that that Angler was asked about there may be a

123
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:56,119
kind of diffusion in their sense of identity but

124
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:02,040
often very intense emotions bound up with the self story If you ask

125
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:09,119
somebody schizophrenia about their self view uh they're you're likely to get some

126
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:16,480
very charged material and a not uh not self is not

127
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:25,599
about diffusion It's not about being um confused or oblivious to one's traits

128
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:33,560
to one the continuities in one's personality It's about um

129
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:40,359
flexibility and as we drain

130
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:45,440
the self story of attachment and

131
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:54,160
aversion we begin to get freer We begin to get freer

132
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,920
And that doesn't mean we can't aspire towards

133
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:07,240
excellence It doesn't mean that we're confused about our

134
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:13,960
traits Uh but we know that it doesn't attach to

135
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:21,400
me Life is um is happening Life is

136
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:27,880
happening and gains and loss All of it is

137
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:33,560
happening It's just not happening to

138
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:36,560
you

139
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:47,200
Exactly Self-love is the beginning of metacognitive clarity with respect to

140
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:54,359
traits and characteristics Anata is a dramatic deepening of that

141
00:39:54,359 --> 00:39:59,480
metacognitive awareness It's the

142
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:05,599
unbinding of his that had previously been grafted

143
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,880
into the model of

144
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:20,240
self That which um felt like the origin of our

145
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:25,720
light becomes illuminated

146
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:34,720
What um we sensed before was something like

147
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:40,000
I'm the spotlight and now but the spotlight

148
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:46,280
itself was in the dark and now the spotlight

149
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,800
is a wash in luminosity

150
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,079
The philosopher Letha be in ordinary waking consciousness

151
00:41:01,079 --> 00:41:07,040
representations that are bound to the self-model including our deeply held

152
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:13,200
often unconscious beliefs about ourselves and our lives typically do not attract explicit

153
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:18,440
critical attention or reflection They are experiences reality

154
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:24,079
itself or as that with which we see the world rather than part of the world that

155
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,200
we see When the binding of these stimuli

156
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:36,079
into the self model is disrupted we disidentify with them a

157
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,280
very straightforward sense rendering them opaque

158
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:46,800
They're no longer experienced as part of me but as something separate an object

159
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:53,560
or an appearance in consciousness to which I can attend with some sense critical distance and

160
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:57,880
suspension of judgment

161
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:07,200
You get the sense of uh yeah what had been grafted into to me

162
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:12,920
the place from which I see becomes something else that is

163
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:20,599
seen There's a kind of unbinding process It's it's along the same continuum of

164
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:26,319
metaccognitive awareness that begins with selflove

165
