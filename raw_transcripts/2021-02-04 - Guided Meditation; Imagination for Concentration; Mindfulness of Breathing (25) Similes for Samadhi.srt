1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:11,519
so good day and good evening

2
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:16,960
good morning to everyone and it's a

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,840
it's a funny thing to be sharing here and now with

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:32,320
different time zones and different places it's a wonderful way that here can be

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:37,440
at different time zones or now can be at different time zones at the

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,920
same time something like that so um

7
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,559
i think it's uh maybe useful to i think that

8
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,600
human beings are using their imagination all the time

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,119
and imagination is more subtle than

10
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:16,000
flights of fantasy and this but rather it's the little uh images

11
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,600
that we have of what's going to happen what did happen imaginings when we

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,680
we imagine people when we meet them we imagine things about them we imagine what's going to happen

13
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:34,400
tomorrow and and sometimes these imaginings are detrimental they undermine us

14
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:41,520
especially if they're they are kind of frightening or disturbing

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:49,520
imaginations that we do over and over and over again they kind of slowly kind of begin to

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,000
create a mood a disposition and almost maybe sometimes

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,000
even a personality by this the constancy of what we imagine

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,399
and so meditation practice is certainly a wonderful time to learn how to put

19
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:16,080
down some of the imaginings that we do so when we let go of thoughts we are also letting go of imaginations

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,800
when we come back into the present moment we're letting go of or what we imagine or assume will be

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,400
tomorrow or other times other places but we can also use imagination to give us a

22
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:38,000
kind of a little edge a little clear clarity about uh um stay here be present

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,599
write this out and uh you know so i've used the lots of

24
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,800
analogies over time and these analogies are all acts of imagination it gives us a sense a feeling for

25
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:56,800
kinesthetic and association that can we give a better sense of what it means like to stay with something

26
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,959
continuously than if the instructions are okay sit down and stay with your breath and don't leave it

27
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,879
but this idea of riding a scooter and and every time that your mind

28
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,200
wanders off we come we push back into the present moment and then we coast along on the present

29
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,239
moment until we need to kind of come back again and push again

30
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:27,440
or if we're staying with the breathing the imagination that we are it's like waves

31
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,640
and as i've done frequently and or like we're surfing on the waves the in-breath

32
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,640
is the lifting of the lifting us up and on the wave and then the out breath we're surfing the front of it

33
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,560
going down or maybe not surfing just simply kind of gently being lifted

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:50,560
and falling when my son was quite small had trouble sleeping i

35
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,000
sometimes had him imagine that he was an author floating on its back to sleep at

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,720
night and top of a wonderful peaceful sea and the kelp forest all

37
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:10,000
around underneath and that the and the gentle kind of swells would come up and down and that with his

38
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,920
breathing he was the otter that was being lifted and settled lifted and settled with

39
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,000
each wave and generally then after a while he'd fall asleep

40
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,800
and so all these little acts of imagination that not to put us asleep here but to

41
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,160
encourage us to stay here this is what it's like so as i said yesterday the buddha gave

42
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:40,240
one for uh for breath meditation

43
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:47,840
which is that of a lathe worker holding the lathe knife i guess or the

44
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:54,240
chisel so that against the wood that's going around in the lathe

45
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,600
and in order to cut the wood properly the chisel has to be in continuous contact with the wood

46
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,800
that's how it it chisels away and so i guess this idea of a lathe

47
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:15,039
turning around and around was the buddha's analogy for the cycles of in-breath and out-breath

48
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:22,080
and the awareness somehow is like the chisel where the kind of the point of awareness

49
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,960
is really centered someplace with the breathing and then it doesn't leave it just stays

50
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,400
there stays there and stays connected so this goes around and around

51
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:42,800
and um and if that kind of image doesn't mean much for you an image that

52
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:49,039
when i was when i was in college i took a massage course and the instruction was that if we had

53
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,400
to get more oil to put on more you know for the massage to continue with the massage

54
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,880
to never lose physical contact with the person getting the massage so you have to always keep one hand on

55
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,440
this you know touching the person's arm or something as you reach for the oil and put it on your hand and so this idea of

56
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:15,280
always staying in touch and contact and contact and touch i interpret to be

57
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,280
the physicality of breathing the physical experience just stay there with

58
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:27,680
your chisel or stay there with your hand stay there on the waves riding up and down

59
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,120
so don't be busy with all those images but these are images that can be used

60
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,600
one of them maybe speaks to you and uh if using the image is better than the

61
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,360
alternative meaning that you it's you're less likely to wander off into thoughts and

62
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,960
imaginations which are not supportive for you then stay with the image until the image

63
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,960
no longer is needed and you're able to stay there with the with the breathing

64
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:07,759
so taking a meditation posture and gently closing your eyes

65
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:15,120
and even saying the word gently closing your eyes and hadn't thought about it but also

66
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,520
evokes the imagination the idea of gentle gentling

67
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,199
and maybe has value that travels beyond just the eyes

68
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:33,120
and then sitting quietly and gently the body

69
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:59,840
shifting gears so that you are settling down into your body your embodied experience

70
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:15,680
and taking a few long slow deep breaths big swells big waves that lift you up

71
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,919
expand you and then down the other side of the wave

72
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:27,840
as you exhale relaxing your body

73
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,839
and letting your breathing return to normal

74
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:59,839
and then softening relaxing parts of your body and as each parts of your body relax

75
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:04,959
imagine it's becoming soft like a cotton ball

76
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:10,320
relaxing the muscles of the face

77
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:23,839
softening the shoulders

78
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:37,839
and softening the belly

79
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,640
and also as you exhale softening the mind

80
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:51,839
quieting the mind

81
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,480
distilling the mind into a soft

82
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:07,920
place and if any part of your body mind feels

83
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,160
hard brittle maybe it's your awareness which is like

84
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,720
a soft cotton ball it gently supports or holds

85
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:33,839
whatever is hard challenging

86
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:56,720
and then to settle into the body's experience of

87
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
breathing

88
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:15,839
and feeling the sensations physical sensations that come into play as you breathe

89
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:29,839
the sensations of inhale are different than the sensations of exhaling

90
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:58,959
and then settling in to stay with the sensations of breathing

91
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:10,959
and so some continuity like you would a chisel against the bowl being lathed

92
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:18,000
or like the continuous contact of the waves is once flowed someone's

93
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:26,160
back on the gentle swells of the ocean lifting up and lifting down

94
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,800
or the continuous stroke of a masseuse yes as we receive a massage from the

95
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:44,240
inside as the lungs expand and contract as a

96
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:53,839
diaphragm pushes and releases

97
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,560
and settling in gently steadily

98
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,360
see if you can have continuity

99
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:14,480
with the breathing letting the thinking mind become quieter

100
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:21,839
softer stiller

101
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:29,279
so the center of gravity of attention shifts from thinking

102
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:35,839
to breathing

103
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:46,000
as if breathing is the center of the

104
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:51,120
universe if breathing is

105
00:13:52,800 --> 00:14:03,839
home for these minutes that we're meditating

106
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,799
riding the waves of breathing

107
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:54,559
letting go of imaginary futures imaginary

108
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:02,080
other places the imagination

109
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:12,240
of things which are not here and now and to use the imagination instead

110
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:23,840
to be intimate with our lived experience of here

111
00:23:53,120 --> 00:24:00,720
allowing yourself to feel whatever satisfaction or gladness

112
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:09,120
that comes from not being lost in thought so much

113
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:14,720
not perpetuating thoughts which are undermine you

114
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:22,480
trouble you glad to be intimate here now

115
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:31,278
perhaps even allowing yourself to feel the joy

116
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:41,200
of just being alive breathing just content sitting here breathing

117
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:47,840
feeling embodying yourself

118
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:54,960
the more that we are preoccupied in thought distracted by thinking

119
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:02,480
the more that we're lost in imagination

120
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:08,480
the less in touch we are with others

121
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:14,960
the less we are distracted the less we're preoccupied

122
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:25,840
the better what's best in us can come forth to meet other people

123
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,799
love gratitude

124
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:40,880
compassion friendliness all shine all flow most easily

125
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:49,039
most manifest when we are not distracted

126
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:57,120
not preoccupied when we are present for others

127
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:05,840
that's the vehicle that's the channels by which our positive attitudes

128
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:16,080
manifest and may it be that to whatever degree

129
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:22,880
that you're more settled more intimate with yourself

130
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:30,880
calmer clear from this meditation

131
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:38,080
may that register for you may you take that in feel that

132
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,240
and imagine how you can stay this way

133
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:51,760
or stay close to it so that your warmth for others

134
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:59,840
can be palpable expressed your love your compassion

135
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:12,080
your kindness can better flow

136
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:19,120
may it be that what you learn about being non-distracted

137
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:26,399
supports you

138
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:31,520
in greater goodwill for the people around you

139
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,880
known and unknown strangers and intimates

140
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:43,600
may it be that what you learn through this

141
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:50,960
practice is a means by which you live a life that

142
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,559
betters the life of others in small ways in big ways

143
00:29:56,559 --> 00:30:01,360
in intentional ways and unintentional ways

144
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:11,278
may the benefit of the merit of our practice together be for the welfare and

145
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:19,120
and support of all beings everywhere may all beings

146
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:26,720
be happy may all beings be safe

147
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:33,679
may all beings be peaceful

148
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:51,840
may all beings be free

149
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:11,519
so we've taken a little bit of a pause of moving through the next steps

150
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:16,559
of the 16 steps of mindfulness or breathing to

151
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:22,320
really look a little bit more deeply at this particular way in which the mind works

152
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:29,120
the use of imagination in the mind and i'll talk a little bit more about

153
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:35,840
specifically the buddha's use of this word imagination and i've read sometimes people say that

154
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:41,919
there's no poly word for imagination but there actually is it's a little bit

155
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:47,519
of translator's choice but i think there's a good argument i'll talk about it tomorrow

156
00:31:47,519 --> 00:31:55,200
the words that have to do with it and they have a lot to do with um they also relate to this idea of

157
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,480
self and not self which is so important in buddhism but for

158
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:08,000
today i want to uh so this is kind of pausing to look imagination is a is a preparation for next week when we

159
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:14,399
start looking at um the mind more carefully and what goes on in the mind the mental

160
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:19,519
activity but to create the right conditions for supporting

161
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:24,880
investigation and a deeper letting go in the mind is part of the function of this earlier

162
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:32,000
parts of anapanasati mindfulness of breathing and to to the more sense of well-being

163
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:39,279
that can come in meditation the easier it's going to be to really work with the mind

164
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,559
there's a i've told the story many times but i love the story

165
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,320
of when my son was in kindergarten

166
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:59,679
once a week they would play with beeswax with a little wax and um

167
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:07,200
and uh when it was time for them to play they would actually been sitting up on the shelf and it would be um usually when

168
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:13,039
the form or whatever animal they made the week before and they would it would be hard and

169
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:19,840
being hard it would be brittle and the only thing you can do with any of it would be to break it and a little animal legs can be broken

170
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:25,440
off easy enough for something but what they would be instructed to do every week would be

171
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:33,519
to put the little the piece of wax they had in the palm between the palms of their two hands and just hold it there

172
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:38,559
while the teacher told the story and by the time the story was over

173
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:44,799
the warmth of their hands had softened the beeswax so that the or whatever kind of wax it

174
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:51,039
was and so that they um then they would then they could make these beautiful little figures animal figures or

175
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:57,440
whatever it was they made but you had to have the warmth to soften it so the same thing with the mind and

176
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:03,519
the heart in order to make it into something beautiful to move it towards freedom

177
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:10,158
it helps to soften it and warm it up and the the the the good feelings the

178
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:16,878
calmness the joy the happiness the well-being the contentment the calmness that we sit

179
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:21,919
in um are all the kind of creating the right conditions

180
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:28,158
to begin softening the mind so the mind can be more pliable more

181
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:34,158
flexible more malleable in the best possible way so that the healthy mind the healthy

182
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:39,520
functioning of the mind can operate smoothly and easily

183
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,599
so on the way to do that the cultivation of these deeper states of well-being that

184
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:51,118
come in meditation the the mind is actually used to do that

185
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:58,640
the mind is always being used the mind is being used to apply the attention uh to sustain the attention

186
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,960
but it's also used to it can be used supported by the imagination and the

187
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,960
buddha uses a lot of similes and and rather than thinking about them as being

188
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:19,040
active and intentional uses of imagination when we sit down to meditate it's more like we learn those similes

189
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:26,240
internalize them well enough so that they're kind of in the background of the mind so the mind associates meditation with

190
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,320
those similes in a kind of a natural way the similes create kind of a positive kind of view

191
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:39,440
orientation that supports us to be present now it's very easy

192
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:47,520
to have lots of uh imagination which is

193
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:55,200
not so helpful we can carry a lot of unconscious and conscious associations

194
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:02,400
bias fears projections onto our experience so that

195
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:08,400
it's we kind of are creating kind of an unhealthy or unsupportive environment

196
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,000
for our practice the simple imagination that i'm a lousy meditator

197
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,119
i can never do this that's also kind of an imagination it's kind of an

198
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,720
idea a thought that creates a certain atmosphere which is a little bit something in

199
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,160
extreme forms is a self-fulfilling prophet prophecy if we're completely preoccupied by the

200
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:37,520
idea that i cannot meditate then you probably can't because of because of that preoccupation

201
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:43,200
and and so there's you know there's also fear like there's people who uh there's fear

202
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:49,760
what's gonna happen if i open my heart in meditation if i relax and really feel what's here and there might be some good reasons to

203
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:57,359
have some caution but um to have chronic anxiety and then kind of vague imaginary ideas of

204
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:05,040
why or what's going to happen um it doesn't it's not really supportive for the process of deepening and meditation

205
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:13,119
we have to be wise about that anxiety and caution not not feel not not feel bad about having it it's

206
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:18,320
there for reasons but we want to try to work with it and find another way of being

207
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:24,720
so when the buddha offers all these similes he's uh providing he's kind of seeding

208
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:31,040
in the mind associations and imaginary associations which then begin

209
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,800
to create a different atmosphere for what we're doing and what meditation is about

210
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,240
so whether we bring up these these imaginations actively or we just let them sit there

211
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,760
in the background both of those are supported by really knowing these similes knowing these

212
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,280
imaginary kind of scenarios

213
00:37:53,280 --> 00:38:00,000
so this comes into particular play with the deepening of concentration what's called genres

214
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:06,320
deepening states of absorption that really kind of really kind of settling in and really being present

215
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:13,359
in a clear continuous way almost like there's a state shift so that oh now i'm here i'm present it's

216
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:18,960
clear i'm here and the buddha doesn't give a lot of in descriptions

217
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:26,400
kind of prose descriptions of these states he describes a little bit but

218
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,040
but to really get a feel for what the buddha is talking about he provides similes almost ever many

219
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:40,079
times he talks about describes what they are he then follows up with a simile for each of the four of these absorptions

220
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:47,119
and these similes if you kind of feel your way into it and and kind of um let it kind of live

221
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,440
in the feeling of it or the sense of it or almost imagine that you are the simile in some way

222
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,000
then something begins to be kind of an atmosphere and a context is being formed

223
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,440
an association that awakens something inside of us that's not the imagination but rather

224
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:13,040
the felt sense of what the buddha is pointing to so the imaginations for

225
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:18,640
uh these similes for deep states of concentration where there's a lot of well-being

226
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,560
um use three of them use water as part of the

227
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:29,839
simile and often in the kind of symbolism of the buddha

228
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,040
water represents the mind and and perhaps the clarity of the mind or

229
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,240
the awareness itself of the mind i think maybe awareness maybe more than the mind

230
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,280
and um and so we're getting a sense of how to work with awareness or how to

231
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:52,160
relate to the awareness or how to notice uh qualities or aspects of awareness as we settle in into the

232
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:59,359
practice and um so um so there are four of these and i want to

233
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,000
read the the similes for you and maybe you could kind of let it sink in

234
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:12,480
for you and kind of imagine that you're somehow this you can feel this with your body or

235
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:18,400
feel it with inside the first one begins with an assembly

236
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:24,560
that's very much with in modern world maybe we would associate it with making dough with flour where you

237
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,240
sprinkle water onto the dough until and and and knead the the water in

238
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:36,079
until it's the all the whole all the flour is moist and in the ancient world it has to do

239
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:42,400
with making a certain kind of powder soap powder that they had and making that into a kind of a bald

240
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,800
so just as a skilled bath person or a bath person's

241
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,079
apprentice heaps bath powder in a metal basin

242
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:00,720
and sprinkling it sprinkling it gradually with water kneads it until the moisture wets one's

243
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:08,880
ball of bath powder soaks its and pervades it inside and out yet the ball itself does

244
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:16,800
not ooze so too a practitioner makes the joy and happiness born of seclusion

245
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,640
drench steep fill and pervade this very body so there's no part of one's whole body

246
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:29,760
unpervaded with a joy and happiness born of seclusion so here there's awareness in kind of my

247
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:37,839
kind of description that's that's that comes along with joy and happiness

248
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:44,160
so with sitting in meditation there's feelings of well-being and then one big gently kind of needs it

249
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,440
massages it or or spreads it or expands it through the whole body so no part of the

250
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,640
body is not moist with this goodness of joy and

251
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,400
happiness so so it implies that there's a kind of

252
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:09,040
engagement with the process so not just opening and allowing well-being there but in a certain kind of way gently

253
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:16,319
lovingly kind of maybe each time we breathe kind of opening and filling opening stretching letting it

254
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:23,359
kind of ooze or letting it like spread through the body so there's a little more active involvement and

255
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:30,640
and and this is where the mind is a little bit more involved in staying there stay present be with it work on work on

256
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:36,319
the breath the in-breaths and the out-breaths as the mind gets stiller and quieter

257
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:42,480
there's no more needing no more work is needed to stay present no more work to spread anything or

258
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,960
cultivating it and so the next uh uh level of

259
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:55,599
absorption so just as though there were a lake

260
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:02,880
whose waters welled up from below and it has no inflow from east west

261
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:09,200
north or south and would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rain

262
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:14,720
so there's no streams flowing in from any direction into the lake from the top it's only an

263
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:21,680
upwelling of a spring from below then that cool fount of underwater water

264
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:29,839
flowing up in the lake would make the cool water suffuse fill completely fill and pervade the

265
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:36,160
lake so there's no part of the whole lake unpervaded

266
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,760
by the cool water um in this way

267
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:48,960
one suffuses and fills and completely fills and pervades this very body with the joy and

268
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,680
happiness born of samadhi no part of the body is unpervaded with joy and happiness born

269
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:01,440
of samadhi the third absorption just

270
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,480
as in a pond of blue or red or white lotuses some lotuses

271
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:15,839
that are born and grow in the water thrive immersed in the water without rising

272
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:24,000
out of it and cool water suffuses feels completely fills and pervades

273
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,839
these lotuses to their tips and their roots so that there is no part of all these

274
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:37,839
lotuses unpervaded by cold water

275
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:45,040
so one experiences happiness in same way one experiences happiness with the body

276
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:53,200
that the noble ones describe when abides abides with happiness of one who is equanimous and mindful

277
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:01,119
one suffuses feels completely fills and pervades this very body with happiness no part of the body is

278
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:07,359
unpervaded with happiness so the joy has stopped which is more active and energetic and now it's just

279
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:12,400
happiness and then the final one

280
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,160
is um

281
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:25,200
just as though a person were sitting covered from the head down with white

282
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,839
cloth so that there's no part of one's whole body enclosed

283
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:37,200
um not enclosed by the white cloth

284
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,960
so once it fuses and fills it completely fills and

285
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:49,359
pervades this very body with mental purity mental clarity

286
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:57,200
no part of the body is unpervaded with mental clarity just as a so

287
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:02,640
um the the idea of surrounded by a white cloth and no part

288
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:08,720
of the body is not touched by this white cloth is the idea that

289
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:15,280
there's no outside stimulus anymore and there's no clear defined body anymore it's kind of

290
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:22,000
you can't quite see it but it's there it's it's covered and and it's a softness to

291
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:29,280
it the soft clean cloth that touches it everywhere so we go from working the working the

292
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:35,440
joy through the body to feeling the joy uh so being a very peaceful quiet lake with

293
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:43,359
whatever we've experienced kind of floating in this stillness of awareness happy awareness to um

294
00:46:43,359 --> 00:46:49,200
to becoming so quiet and still that the body begins to recede and very

295
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:56,000
peaceful safe quiet equanimous and characterized by a kind of mental purity mental

296
00:46:56,000 --> 00:47:02,560
clarity or cleanliness that's there so this is the closest we get to the

297
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:07,760
buddha really describing or these met these states of

298
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:15,599
concentration and i don't know if they mean something for you or whether you kind of evoke some imagination for you but if

299
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:21,520
they evoke your imagination then these are things to kind of take in and and

300
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:28,240
internalize a certain way some people memorize these descriptions and and then they're there

301
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,720
in the background for the mind to kind of

302
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,920
perfume itself or perfume meditation with dissociation and associations which

303
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:45,040
might be a lot better than some of the other ways in which your imagination is
