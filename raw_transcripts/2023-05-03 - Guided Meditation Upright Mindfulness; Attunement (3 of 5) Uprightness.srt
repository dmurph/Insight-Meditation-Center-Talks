00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:07,700
hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,500
and as we begin get ready for meditation I would like to

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,980
um mention yesterday we I talked about openness being open

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:30,260
to whatever is happening in such a way that there's like lots of room for experience you can just

5
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:35,880
experiences thoughts feelings sounds occurrences around us when we meditate

6
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:43,260
don't have to stick anywhere we don't have to pick them up we don't start thinking about them we don't have to react there can be kind

7
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,660
of an openness like an open window just allow things to pass through

8
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:55,500
and um and this related to other kinds of teachings from meditation of meditation

9
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:02,100
being a radical acceptance of the present moment being kind of Thoroughly receptive to

10
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:08,400
experience and in that class that category or kind

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,979
of side of meditation as important as it is um it's good to have it balanced with

12
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,140
another side and that is um then the two can go together they

13
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:24,540
don't have to be separate but as a way of talking and that is

14
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,460
um the side of being upright the side of not collapsing

15
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:38,520
we don't uh metaphorically we're sitting upright and

16
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:45,900
we're sitting uncollapsed on we're not finding difficult things

17
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:51,540
that we're experiencing thinking about remembering feeling and just kind of

18
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:58,920
kind of bending over and putting our hand on her forehead and feeling sorry for ourselves or

19
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:06,360
we're not giving up on ourselves or giving up our ability to you know be be

20
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:12,900
grounded firm stable by the moment

21
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,120
so on one hand we're quite open to our experience

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,540
which might seem a little bit like we're just available to be victims of challenges

23
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,940
but the other side of it is we are not we're being undefeated

24
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:35,280
we are not cowering we're not giving up we're not collapsing

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,400
we're not um giving up giving in to the inner forces

26
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:50,040
that might be pushing us driving us to run away or give up or collapse or feel

27
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,620
sorry for ourselves or get involved in angry thoughts of

28
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,379
Revenge or um no we're not giving up our our

29
00:03:01,379 --> 00:03:06,900
presence and stability here because of some fantastically wonderful pleasurable

30
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,780
fantasy that we get pulled into so this ability to be grounded and

31
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,720
upright grounded and just hear in a strong way goes together with this

32
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:27,000
openness and the uprightness gives a kind of strength and grounding and

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:34,019
and um kind of a freedom that adds to the freedom of just being

34
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:40,140
open and unaffected by what happens everything just passes right through in a certain way

35
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:46,200
and that combination then is certainly a preparation

36
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:52,379
for what might come the healthy things that might come and one of those healthy things is our

37
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:59,400
capacity for compassion and for love so this is not an aloofness or pulling

38
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,340
away the uprightness means we're right here for it for experience

39
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:12,319
there's no question that we're no we we're really here we're not avoiding anything

40
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:18,799
so to assume a meditation posture

41
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,560
and

42
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:34,740
closing the eyes and if you were going to call

43
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:42,800
on your inner strength to assume a posture that's upright

44
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:51,199
literally or metaphorically that feels like a strong

45
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:58,979
stance of being really here a strength that gives

46
00:04:58,979 --> 00:05:06,620
emphasis on yes here I am

47
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:15,979
so it might be some way that the chest is not collapsed pulled in

48
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,660
might be some way that the head the position of the head and the neck where the

49
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,780
the back of the top back of the head gets pulled up towards the ceiling

50
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:38,759
or there's a little bit space form between the last vertebrae of the spine and the and the

51
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,539
skull

52
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:51,960
and then you might sway back and forth a bit partly to feel

53
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:59,759
the shifting pressure or weight of your legs your feet your bottom

54
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,000
and whatever is holding you up and then

55
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:13,560
bring that sway to Stillness and feel definitively

56
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,160
the way that the weight of your body is supported received

57
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:25,340
by the chair your cushion the floor the bed

58
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:41,220
in finding Within some place where personal strength

59
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:48,300
resides maybe it's a small little marble-sized place

60
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:53,960
somewhere in the Torso or in the hands or the feet

61
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,580
anywhere where some and with reference

62
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,740
to that strength the place of strength

63
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,780
taking some gently deeper breaths

64
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,319
almost as an expression of Your Inner Strength

65
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:31,560
exhaling relaxing as a definitive way of settling into

66
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:39,918
here taking your place this is your place to be

67
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:48,919
letting your breathing return to normal

68
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:56,639
and scanning through your body both to relax where there might be

69
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,180
tension

70
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,539
and release any place where we're contracted

71
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:33,800
breathing in and breathing out as you breathe in

72
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:42,380
as your lungs fill and your diaphragms pushes down

73
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:50,339
let that be a clear establishment

74
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:55,800
of stability uprightness strength

75
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:10,620
each inhale as a expression of

76
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:14,480
taking your place here

77
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:23,300
each exhale it's a relaxing and softening opening

78
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:29,899
non-resistance in the exhale

79
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,959
and gently as you breathe

80
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,839
without resisting anything and without collapsing or giving up or

81
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:04,440
giving in really here now in the present

82
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:07,160
breathing

83
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:15,560
finding in the breath in each breath

84
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:21,779
strength definitive Clarity of being here

85
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,860
just now

86
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:38,159
staying open to your present moment experience

87
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:43,500
with the support of inner steadiness

88
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:49,940
stability a strength

89
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:54,360
of upright

90
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:02,899
embodiment of attention

91
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:35,658
foreign

92
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:07,700
so then as we come to the end of this sitting

93
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,919
to gently maybe even lovingly

94
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:18,960
feel yourself rooted Here and Now

95
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:25,580
in your body in your body

96
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:34,340
rising out of whatever supports the weight of your body

97
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:45,140
feeling some inner stabilities

98
00:25:45,140 --> 00:25:51,380
Inner Strength and maybe for a couple of minutes here

99
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:58,639
embodying that by sitting a little bit straighter

100
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:07,279
a little bit more a posture of definitively being here

101
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:21,840
and when you are here in a strong full way

102
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:29,340
upright imagine that your love your kindness

103
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:37,260
your compassion is supported by that strength supported

104
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:42,900
by that uprightness maybe like an antenna which is well

105
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:51,799
positioned to send out a signal far and wide

106
00:26:55,020 --> 00:27:01,260
where you send out your care for the world your care of others

107
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:06,659
whatever a good will wishing

108
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:10,700
love that you have

109
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:19,799
for the circles of people around you those who are close in that you know the

110
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:26,399
best friends Neighbors

111
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:33,980
outward encircles into your community and communities out into the world

112
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:42,360
May are Inner Strength May our ability to be

113
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:51,059
upright and not collapse not give up not give in

114
00:27:51,059 --> 00:27:58,320
but to really be here fully present May It Be

115
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,440
a means through which our care and love for the

116
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,460
world can flow

117
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:20,360
may we be a antenna that broadcasts well and far

118
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:25,158
kindness and friendliness

119
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:34,820
respect for others care for others appreciation of others

120
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:41,240
may all beings be happy

121
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:49,100
may all beings be safe

122
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:54,080
may all beings be peaceful

123
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:59,778
and may all beings be free of suffering

124
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:07,760
and may we with our inner strength and stability

125
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:14,659
be a caring companion for others

126
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:21,500
moving through this life may all beings be happy

127

[Music]

128
00:29:39,779 --> 00:29:42,559
thank you

129
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:07,080
hello and welcome to our third talk on Attunement

130
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:14,340
and the topic of Attunement is the practice of Attunement

131
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:20,700
is considered here one of the building blocks for compassion

132
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:26,220
to have a rush to be compassionate before we've put in place the building blocks for it

133
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:32,460
can easily lead to compassion being misguided and compassionate to be even detrimental

134
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:38,220
for those who are being compassionate in these days has been for a while now

135
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:44,940
to talk about um compassion fatigue compassion overwhelm

136
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:51,440
and it seems strange that anyone would ever be exhausted or overwhelmed by compassion

137
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:57,179
compassion is to be overwhelmed or fatigued by compassion would be like

138
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:02,600
saying that um that uh

139
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,340
I don't know the ocean is tired of being wet

140
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:13,919
they um the

141
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,919
you know the warm day is exhausted from being warm

142
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:26,159
that compassion by itself is not tiring

143
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:32,640
is not exhausting it's not it does compassion by itself does not make us

144
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,000
victims does not hurt us even what what's difficult is when compassion

145
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,940
is mixed in with all kinds of other attitudes and tensions and attachments

146
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:51,840
and things and but it's often it's considered to be part of compassion so people don't see

147
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:58,100
the difference but if we have these building blocks in place to be compassionate then

148
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:05,279
compassion can flow through us in a way that's even nourishing for us much more beneficial for others without

149
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:11,039
the exhaustion so one of these qualities is Attunement

150
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:16,320
which this week I'm offering five different aspects of Attunement

151
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,380
and today with the letter U in this in the acronym touch

152
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:28,919
is upright that when we encounter suffering

153
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:34,440
it's an occasion to make sure that we establish an uprightness

154
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:40,320
and what that means is we find our place of strength

155
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:47,880
and maybe it's an unfortunate term in the United States these days for how it's been used but um but if we can kind

156
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:53,840
of do away with some of the most recent kind of ways discussed in the news

157
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:02,039
kind of like stand our ground stand in our place not to attack anyone not to run away

158
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:08,280
from anyone but just really you know own our place where we are stands upright

159
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,700
firm strong not to be domineering not to be aloof or

160
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:22,138
distant but in order to so the openness we have can be supported by strength

161
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:29,638
and um into this uprightness for me implies a non-collapse not giving up not

162
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:35,820
giving in sometimes when they're suffering people want us to kind of participate in

163
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:42,540
their suffering on their terms and do the things that they want or they think is important to do

164
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:48,419
and it's not really clear that that's always the case should be necessary and the best thing to do

165
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:54,898
and so to um to it's kind of like taking a sacred pause

166
00:34:54,899 --> 00:35:02,280
to take time to be open present see the situation more fully and establish

167
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:07,400
ourselves in in the presence of this in a stable

168
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:14,040
relaxed open way and it's a way that our strength Inner

169
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:22,560
Strength can kind of we can be embodied with our strength and the proposal I like to make uh is

170
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:30,540
the that when we are strong our love is is more valuable

171
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:36,619
when we are really standing upright metaphorically you know

172
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:41,760
you know really kind of embodied and present in a clear way

173
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,800
that when we love someone when we care for them when we're kind when we're

174
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:53,640
friendly it has more resonance it has more it's more is communicated through

175
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:59,280
it when we're open and uh you know I have the kind of

176
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:06,240
openness with that stand our ground we're not asserting ourselves uh we're not dominating over people

177
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:11,579
we're not rushing to kind of take care of them but we are

178
00:36:11,579 --> 00:36:17,460
expressing care ing for and caring can be two different

179
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:23,579
things caring for is what we do caring is a attitude

180
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:29,280
and that attitude has more space it can be bigger when when we're really open

181
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:35,099
and there's a kind of inner largeness in space and awareness and when there's a

182
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:41,760
stability and uprightness of strength they a uh a

183
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,060
a embodiment that's really here for the situation

184
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:53,099
then it people notice more feel it more there more

185
00:36:53,099 --> 00:37:00,180
if we are kind of uh you know sitting quietly to not disturb anyone in

186
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:05,460
the corner of the room kind of making ourselves a little bit small and we're sitting there kind of saying may you be

187
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:11,160
happy may you be peaceful that might be nice to do that but it

188
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,859
doesn't have the same level of of of impact I think that sitting up in the

189
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:23,640
same chair or pulling the chair out away from the corner so we're there clearly in the room together with people and

190
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:31,560
then we have an attitude of kindness then it's noticed that it's felt that has more it has more texture it has more

191
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:40,560
aliveness it has more there and um so uprightness

192
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,980
so the first of these five qualities with the acronym touch is to talk with

193
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:52,520
people find out what's going on no no think about it that's tomorrow

194
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:58,200
think about it have some thinking have some reflection what's going on here how

195
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,260
am I and what how am I receiving this how am I present for this what's the

196
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:09,300
circumference of what the context for the suffering that I'm in touch with or that I have myself

197
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:16,680
what's a useful way to be with it what does it mean to be attuned how do I come into harmony with it or balance with it

198
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:22,320
so asking questions is a big part of thinking about it having a you know

199
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:30,480
um and it's not necessarily asking why something's happening but thinking about how is it I can be present and attuned

200
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,720
to be open to experience is to increase our capacity to hold it

201
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,839
and rather than fixing things a lot of Dharma practices about expanding our

202
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:49,579
capacity to be present for our discomfort for things that are difficult for challenging things

203
00:38:49,579 --> 00:38:58,079
without resisting without collapsing and when we don't collapse then we can

204
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:04,800
be upright and so uh to to think

205
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:13,500
to be open to be upright and and then tomorrow you'll see that

206
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:18,660
that's when we're there's the C is to communicate to actually talk to people

207
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:26,579
talk talk about what's going on it's before acting before acting out of the

208
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:33,660
compassion and so this uprightness where

209
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:39,839
there's non-collapse a powerful concept that comes from the Buddha in the kind

210
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:47,820
of CIS kinds of situations is to be undefeated do not be defeated by circumstance

211
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:56,520
do not sink down into being a victim but rather a rise to the occasion to be

212
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:03,180
strong a rise to the occasion to be free arise to the occasion to be someone who

213
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:10,200
takes a stance in mindfulness who's the way mindfulness is the home

214
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:18,240
from which we live in this world attentive strong presence

215
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,119
and um so to

216
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:32,040
practice now uprightness not giving in and not giving up

217
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:39,180
not belittling ourselves diminishing ourselves but also not aggrandizing

218
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:45,240
ourselves as simple relaxed really here I am definitively

219
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:52,440
not needing anything from other people not uh asserting myself to other people not

220
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:59,180
giving in to what other people want automatically but here I am be present

221
00:40:59,180 --> 00:41:07,680
so as you practice these things uh thinking being open being stable and

222
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,920
strong it's often useful to start in areas where it's relatively easy

223
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:20,160
because it's like building a muscle if we just go immediately into some of the biggest sufferings that humans can

224
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,760
experience we might not be ready for it it's kind of like you have to work out a little bit and become familiar with the

225
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:32,700
territory and how to be and build a strength and build confidence in these different steps

226
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:40,079
so I'd encourage you to see if there's ways peaceful ways non-assertive ways

227
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:46,980
that you can be upright today just to so you really can be present and

228
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:53,880
take in the experience see yourself see the situation more fully without giving in to anything

229
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,380
giving up on anything without feeling guilt or feeling

230
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:06,839
unimportant and there's a wonderful place in uprightness

231
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:13,619
of neither feeling the conceit of being important nor feeling the conceit of being

232
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:20,780
unimportant and if you are upright and present

233
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,359
being neither important nor unimportant

234
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:36,780
what are you what is that like so thank you and um

235
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:40,280
then we'll continue tomorrow
