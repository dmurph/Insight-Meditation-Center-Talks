hello again and welcome a warm welcome wherever you are in the world whatever time zone

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,880
so for today's practice um we are going to turn our hearts turn our

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:21,920
attention to the practice of equanimity for all beings

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,599
we've been working our way just to give a little bit of context and again if you're new it's all good

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,520
you can jump in wherever you arrive everything you need to know will be shared with you

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,920
during this guided meditation and also just to share the context both

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:46,800
for those who are new and also have been coming we've been going through the brahmaviharas one by one

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:53,680
meta loving-kindness compassion karuna mudita vicarious joy and

9
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:01,440
upeka which is equanimity crown jewel of buddhist practice to have a sense of

10
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,119
equipoise equanimity peace ease with whatever arises and passes

11
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,240
and those cultivation practices are done in concentric circles as we go through them

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,880
where it's easiest we extend our heart extend extent so we have made our way to the fourth

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,000
realm of ihara which is equanimity and the category of all beings

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,720
all beings and this is actually a very i mean all of

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:36,880
them are rich i don't think a single one is not rich in exploration and in ways that we can

16
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,240
cultivate our heart so here in this practice today

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,079
again whether this is your first session or your practice really the

18
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,119
invitation is we'll start as always we start with the breath and the

19
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,880
body to just settle for the first 10 minutes of our time together to arrive

20
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:05,680
breath body settling arriving calming the mind

21
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:13,280
inviting the mind to settle and then the idea of all beings

22
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,560
all beings everywhere they have ups and downs in their life just as we do so well by

23
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,640
the way we are included in the all beings practice let's remember that as we practice together

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,920
all of us every single one of us has ups and downs we may not know

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,080
sometimes we have the sense of oh everybody has it easy everybody has an easy life it's just me

26
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:45,360
who has challenges guess what

27
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:53,120
challenges stress suffering dukkha whatever name you give it um

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:03:00,959
are part of our mark of existence our part of being alive part of being human part of

29
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:11,040
being animal just part of being alive on this on this realm so we bring to our hearts a sense of oh

30
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,519
all beings have challenges including me and can there be a sense of equipoise

31
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:24,400
developing tapping the sense of peace and ease to be with whatever arises and passes

32
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:33,200
just as it is without falling into it without grieving attaching wanting

33
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,920
things to be different which which is also turning away pushing it away resisting but just being

34
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:46,000
withholding caring presence it's like this right now it's like this right now may i be

35
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,239
present with what what it is like right now and with all beings too may

36
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:58,400
all beings have spaciousness of equipoise so it says this can be a

37
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,560
very expansive practice actually equanimity for all beings can be very spacious

38
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:13,680
so that's what we try to to kind of tap into and whatever arises in this practice as long as you turn

39
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:20,320
into it with care and hold it with care you're doing it right so whatever arises

40
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:25,520
for you allow yourself a sense of safety for

41
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:31,360
whatever comes up to be held the sense of care and ease it's okay

42
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,720
if resistance comes up it's okay whatever comes up so it's that's

43
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,160
a sense of cultivation the practice of cultivation of art so enough words

allow yourself to feel allow there to be a sense that

89
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:45,040
the edge of the body is just a little beyond

90
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:50,399
the conventional edge of the body so the breath

91
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,399
is more expensive filling

92
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,399
this expands a little beyond your body

93
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,560
not effortfully breathing to do that but just noticing oh

94
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:19,199

95
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,839
awareness can expand with the breath

96
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:41,839
just beyond the edge of the body

97
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:54,639
just as naturally you're being breathed again not making it effortful just noticing that

98
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,639
there's there can be a sense of more spaciousness even wider

99
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:09,839
as if as if your breath was feeling

100
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:17,240

again don't need to breathe any harder or more energetically it's worth

102
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,000
noticing their sense of spaciousness

103
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,880
that can be there

104
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:51,839
as much as it's available

105
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,839
sense that your awareness

106
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,839
can be expansive can be relaxed and expansive

107
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,840
unbounded space

108
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:47,840
all around you

109
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:56,520
as if you were sitting on top of a mountain [Music]

110
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:01,840
360 degrees all around

111
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,880
a sense of expansiveness you can land and to relax

112
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,840
into

113
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:43,840
just relaxing into spaciousness

114
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:25,840
your body relaxing into spaces

115
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:39,840
with each breath

116
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:47,280
now this sense of relaxing into spaciousness with each

117
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,840
breath

118
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,840
a sense of being open

119
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
receptive

120
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:14,480
uh unmoved not toppled over but there's so much space so

121
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:17,840
much space

122
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:25,840
for birds to fly come and go in the space

123
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:34,640
clouds clouds of the mind to come and go weather patterns

124
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:42,240
to come and go so much space

125
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:46,400
for the comings and goings

126
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:59,840
and just as the buddha says

127
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,569
[Music]

128
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:18,640
the same way that if you took paint you couldn't paint space

129
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:27,760
air you couldn't paint it just wouldn't work it wouldn't stick colors

130
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:34,159
colors are presenting attitudes want not want good

131
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:41,840
bad push away grab grasp space

132
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,360
cannot be painted on a sense of spaciousness

133
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,840
it can hold everything it can hold everything

134
00:22:57,520 --> 00:23:03,200
it can make space for everything in a caring way can all be held

135
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:11,360
it doesn't turn its attention away its care away can all be held

136
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:23,840
without sticking

137
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:39,840
so just as space can have presence available

138
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:42,880
holding it all

139
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:51,760
without falling into turning away so can be this

140
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:57,200
space of equanimity equipoise

141
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,000
upeka

142
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:09,039
the space of our hearts our minds spacious

143
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:13,600
all things being just as they are

144
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,840
just as they are held with care

145
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:33,840
present to them just as they are

146
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:41,039
spaciously this top of the mountain as you're

147
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:46,559
sitting perhaps with a sense of all beings

148
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:51,520
all around 360 degrees

149
00:24:52,159 --> 00:25:01,840
birds that fly human beings other animals beings

150
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:07,919
all with the conditions of their lives including yourself

151

all the comings and goings of circumstances the ups and downs of life

152
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,200
as if those were color all the comings and goings all the

153
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:30,880
sadnesses and challenges all the happiness and joys all of them held

154
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:43,760
in the space but the same way that you can't color space

155
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:48,799
same way all the comings and goings

156
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:57,840
held in equanimity

157
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:04,720
may i be at peace

158
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:17,360
with all the comings and goings all the unfoldings of events for myself

159
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:25,840
and all beings everywhere

160
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:40,480
whether i understand it or not

161
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:53,840
all events for all beings

162
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:59,440
are unfolding according to the lawful

163
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
nature

164
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:58,320
or the traditional metaphase

165
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:08,720
all beings traditional equanimity phrase all beings are owners

166
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:17,840
of their actions heirs to their actions

167
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:29,039
their actions are the womb out of which they take birth

168
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:33,520
and they give birth to their actions

169
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:43,679
their happiness and unhappiness depends on their actions

170
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:59,840
not my wishes for them

171
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:16,320
all beings are owners of their actions actions of

172
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:24,799
thought speech and body

173
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:34,159
heirs to their actions their actions are the womb from which

174
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:50,480
they are born and they give birth to their actions

175
00:30:50,480 --> 00:31:05,840
their happiness and unhappiness depend on their actions not my wishes for them

176
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,360
or simply may i may we

177
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:28,559
have peace with things as they are

178
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:39,200
our things are the way they are right now or simply it is what it is

179
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:47,840
it is what it is

180
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:11,679
see what version of a phrase works better for you or maybe without phrases just tapping in

181
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,840
the sense of spaciousness

182
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,158
caringly holding risings and passings

183
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:29,840
beyond foldings

184
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:39,840
all beings have their own journey whether i understand it or not

185
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:28,240
and for the last minute of this practice period allowing there to be

186
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,119
this spaciousness expansiveness

187
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:40,560
caring expansiveness with which this practice period was held

188
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,640
whatever rose or did not arise

189
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,760
can just be as it is

190
00:36:52,240 --> 00:37:00,800
no judging no fixing no regret no pushing away

191
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:08,320
no attaching and grabbing could just be as it was as it is

192
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:13,359
ah sense of ease and freedom in the heart

193
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:17,039
can be just as it is

194
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,440
so much space so much freedom

195
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,720
may all beings everywhere including ourselves

196
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,680
be at peace

197
00:37:47,680 --> 00:38:05,839
and their hearts and minds be free [Music] spaciously free

198
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:09,299
[Music]

199
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:23,760
so thanks everyone for your practice

200
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,520
equanimity practice

201
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:40,720
can feel very spacious calming soothing um balancing

202
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:48,560
the sense of freedom in the heart sense of equanimity actually the sense of peace can arise

203
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:56,800
in the heart and the mind through this practice so much more i can say but oh one other

204
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:02,559
thing i want to say before i invite reflections and comments

205
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,079
is that the phrases i was offering many um i

206
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:17,520
sent through nils and longer lists of various phrases to uh

207
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:26,400
the google groups so if you aren't already part of google groups you can get on the google groups and see

208
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,720
the brown these uh equanimity phrases and play around with them and see what works better for you

209
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:43,520
and if you're already on then you probably have already received and seen these phrases so so

210
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:51,200
we have some time for reflections for comments for questions

211
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,740
for complaints what did you notice what came up for you

212
00:39:56,740 --> 00:40:04,000
[Music] okay susan

213
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:13,760
thanks i mean i'm over here i swear thank you everybody it's

214
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:22,319
um it's really great practicing with you all and um i what's been on my mind lately

215
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:28,800
and i was thinking about this i have to admit well i was supposed to be meditating

216
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:36,160
um is how important equanimity is to be a good listener

217
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:45,440
to develop equanimity is so important if one wants to be a good listener and um

218
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:52,079
i think did i mention to you guys that there was this andre no no in there's you know unrenewing

219
00:40:52,079 --> 00:41:00,000
this author i have this quote by him i want to read it

220
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,560
can i real quick okay here i go okay when we honestly

221
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,800
ask ourselves which person in our lives means the most to us we often find that

222
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:19,040
find that is that it is those who instead of giving advice solutions or

223
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,440
cures have chosen rather to share our pain and touch our wounds with a warm and

224
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,680
tender hand the friend who can be silent with us in a moment of despair

225
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:38,160
or confusion who can stay with us in a hour of grief and bereavement who can

226
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,720
tolerate not knowing not curing not healing and face with us the reality of our

227
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:49,838
powerlessness that is a friend who cares

228
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:58,160
beautiful that's the spirit of equanimity in listening beautiful yeah thanks susan

229
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:04,319
and i appreciate this this quote really eloquently brings up what

230
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:12,000
we were discussing i think was it yesterday already seems like so long ago or thursday wednesday in this sense of

231
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:19,280
um you know if you're sitting at the deathbed of someone who's dying that's where equanimity sense of

232
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,200
care you care so you hold presence you're holding care you're present

233
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:31,520
and really that is the spirit of equanimity and if you wanted to share that quote

234
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:37,040
actually in the google groups with folks i trust they would appreciate it because

235
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:45,280
that really epitomizes the difference between being you know aloof which is the near

236
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:51,920
enemy like uh things are as they are things are as they are whereas that's that's not equanimity

237
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:59,839
that's aloofness uh whereas equanimity cares it's present stays and yet doesn't

238
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:07,280
meddle it just holds space so beautiful thank you so

239
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:15,440
neil you have your hand up yeah so there was one of the quotes was

240
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:20,720
something about people being responsible for their own happiness right based on their actions

241
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:28,400
so how does that work i mean there are external factors that impact people fairly dramatically

242
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,920
yeah so how do you like you know rectify that

243
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:41,839
yeah yeah that's a that's a really good question um

244
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:47,760
yeah it's i think there are um because absolutely i mean they're

245
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:53,760
external circumstances and that that effect

246
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,880
that affect people in um and defect different people differently

247
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:04,720
et cetera so yeah so it's not to condone external circumstances at all i think what

248
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,079
what this phrase with this equanimity phrase is trying to get to is not

249
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:16,800
to to close that off and say that is not the case um but of course acknowledging that and

250
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,079
yet there's a sense of um and and you know there are some cases that that

251
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:27,520
maybe that traditional phrase doesn't work and actually there's some people who don't use the traditional phrase at all

252
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:35,440
so don't use it if it brings up a lot of um uh mental like wait this doesn't make

253
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,680
sense maybe the sentence that actually works a little better in is that that people have their own journey people

254
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:48,079
have their own journey so yes of course they're impacted but it really taps into the sense of

255
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:55,040
your care it becomes more relational instead of um positing about the world

256
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:02,640
so you see the difference when this cultivation or what i'm trying to point out here i

257
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:08,240
understand all the other phrases but the one i asked about but that's okay i could just dump it yeah yeah that's that's what i'm

258
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:13,359
suggesting i'm suggesting that it's okay to to not use that and if you

259
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:20,000
insisted to really really explore that then um maybe

260
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,920
relate to it not as positive this is how it is in the world positing

261
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:32,520
uh you know as if you're accounting for all circumstances in the world but in a way of your understanding of

262
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:38,400
relational but i can also see that as i'm saying that i can see that that can also fall

263
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,000
fat so you know if it doesn't work just drop it there are many people who don't like that phrase and it's perfectly fine if

264
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:51,920
it gets in the way of cultivating equanimity then just yeah just drop it yeah thank you

265
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:57,599
a couple of reflections uh far says when you invited us to imagine

266
00:45:57,599 --> 00:46:03,839
filling the whole room i realized that my breath is literally creating little air currents that circulate around the whole

267
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:10,880
room which was a delightful image oh i love that forest thanks for sharing that i'm going to have that delightful image too

268
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:18,160
it's true a little currents everywhere throughout the whole room i love it yeah

269
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:23,680
bill asks when you say spaciousness does this mean not having reactivity

270
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,839
it can mean a lot of different things bill so you can explore so there can there can

271
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:37,119
be not having reactivity that can be one meaning one way to relate to it but sense of spaciousness it can also be

272
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:44,640
the sense of feeling into the space element the spaciousness around like landing into ah

273
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,960
it's there are various studies you know when when you're um when you go

274
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:56,720
into a space a place that's really spacious your mindset changes from one that's

275
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:02,000
limited to one that is open to a lot of possibilities so there's so many different ways

276
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:08,800
to relate to spaciousness either literally as spaciousness or or non-reactively so i invite you to not

277
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:13,839
limit yourself to one sense and be open to so many different ways and the ones that

278
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:20,000
you haven't even explored yet so you are welcome bill

279
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:27,200
so um so dear ones so as we turn our practice now

280
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:33,280
in this brief short time into practicing in small groups we'll

281
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:41,520
start with 30 seconds of meta for each other kindness and then holding

282
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:48,319
this space of equanimity for ourselves and others with care just listening with care just

283
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:53,870
listening not trying to fix it change it just with care listening um

284
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:58,960
[Music] so that would that's the invitation and this is such

285
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:05,440
precious and important practice that you can take to your loved ones in your families and friends and

286
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,880
colleagues to to be to to listen with equanimity

287
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:18,880
so after 30 seconds of uh silent meta so i'm going to create the

288
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:24,400
rooms they're created and they are now open

289
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:31,839
take care of your hearts and each other okay welcome back everyone

290
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:38,160
so we have a couple of minutes for reflections for any reflections that might have come

291
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:44,000
up from your practice from your conversations and groups so especially if you're new or

292
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:51,839
usually don't share this is an invitation we'd love to hear from you what did you notice

293
00:48:51,839 --> 00:49:03,839
for yourself

294
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:17,838
you can either raise your hand or you can type in chat

295
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:31,920
what was it like to listen with equanimity to yourself and others with care and equanimity with that in

296
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:38,000
the space but anybody would like to comment on that

297
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:45,839
or anything else

298
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:01,359
yes please so we we had a conversation about picking

299
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:06,720
up on the last question we um somebody asked about the last uh one of the last phrases

300
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:14,319
and how we recognized how overwhelming it can be when you're not in a spot of your

301
00:50:14,319 --> 00:50:20,480
meditation journey perhaps where you can hold these things or even let go i remember personally

302
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:25,839
being quite angry when somebody told me oh you know just you're responsible for

303
00:50:25,839 --> 00:50:32,800
your own happiness because just biologically you can be so overwhelmed by external external circumstances but it's a huge

304
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:37,680
challenge so then to switch into

305
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:46,400
loving kindness perhaps and uh and even just physical basic grounding techniques or

306
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:54,000
frankly walking away from people who are telling you this even if it's you yourself telling it to you and um and so i could

307
00:50:54,000 --> 00:51:00,800
totally relate and we could both totally relate to to to that comment and uh i wanted to just acknowledge that

308
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:07,839
uh but this can't be because often this is what brings people to the practice to be in that spot where you're not able

309
00:51:07,839 --> 00:51:14,079
to be kind to yourself and you're not able you intellectually know that you could be responsible for

310
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:22,000
this but just don't know how to do it that can be a huge challenge yeah yeah yeah i really appreciate you

311
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:27,920
bringing that up and verbalizing that guitar um

312
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:33,520
it's yeah it i think the more we're having this

313
00:51:33,520 --> 00:51:40,160
conversation i think i'm realizing that there's something that's not quite captured in a way

314
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:46,880
in this translation of this traditional phrase it's it's not so much about

315
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:53,640
that we're all fully responsible for everything that happens to us because that is that is kind of um

316
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:59,920
[Music] um that's kind of mad in in some ways

317
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:07,599
right it's so i think that translation isn't quite appropriate it's especially you know

318
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:13,280
when it comes to it's like oh it's all my responsibility like really whereas it's more i think what

319
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:19,760
it's trying opportunity possibility no not exactly i think what it's trying to get to

320
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,040
so this is the intention so so that's the intention that i was trying to communicate in the guided meditation and

321
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:31,200
then i offered you know this traditional translation but the intention is to acknowledge the causes

322
00:52:31,200 --> 00:52:36,640
and conditions and there's so many causes and conditions that are beyond your control

323
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:43,119
part of them are within your control but so much of it is beyond your control and this translation i realized

324
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:48,559
even though it's traditional it doesn't quite capture that so i'm not going to use it from now on i need to come up

325
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:55,760
with my own translation that really captures that so i really appreciate you and others

326
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,800
and and neil for bringing that up because yeah i think it's kind of it's falling

327
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:06,559
short to the meaning to the spirit of this practice which is acknowledging wow there's so many causes and

328
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:14,079
conditions it's not just me what i do but my genetics my upbringing but but like historically what has happened

329
00:53:14,079 --> 00:53:19,280
and this it's just there's so many causes and conditions that are causing this and for me to take responsibility that

330
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:27,280
it's mine to fix it's like wow there's so inviting ourselves to have peace with that

331
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:32,880
if possible to have peace of life this is this is such this is so complicated this mess of

332
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:38,000
being human and being on this planet like wow may i just hold

333
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:44,720
the enormity of the the mystery of all that's going on it's not awful

334
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,760
it's not great and it's it's it's just it is what it is

335
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:57,280
this so that's where that's why the phrase of well it is what it is this is what this has all come to can i be

336
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:03,440
can i be with a sense of care with with what this has come to so that's the

337
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,960
spirit of equanimity practice and this phrase let's ditch it until i come up with a better

338
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:14,079
translation now but just because it's a traditional translation it doesn't mean that it's a good one

339
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:20,319
there's so many awkward translations of so many things that i don't like so thank you all this has been a

340
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:26,880
very very interesting and helpful fruitful discussion and i hope it helps oh yes

341
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:33,200
and a couple of things i want to say one is maybe i'll say this from now on that um

342
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:38,480
when we go into groups i think it is it's uh everyone is asked please turn on your

343
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:44,799
video and your audio because it's part of being a share sharing is the spirit of

344
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:51,599
of being in the group the etiquette of really showing up um so so let's

345
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:57,119
let's offer ourselves up as people other people are offering to support us in this way

346
00:54:57,119 --> 00:55:04,839
another quick thing i wanted to say is as you've noticed um for the first uh well

347
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:13,680
um as uh has been announced i should say um that uh diana is off for the whole

348
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:19,040
month of march on retreat so i i taught the first two weeks of march every night

349
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:26,319
as you've noticed maybe and for the next week i'm teaching a retreat for the entire next week seven days so

350
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:32,079
i'm not teaching and neither is diana so we have wonderful substitute teachers

351
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:37,359

352
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:43,839

353
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:50,720
your practice for showing up for your fullness for supporting yourself and each other

354
00:55:50,720 --> 00:56:02,400
may all beings everywhere be free happy peaceful

355
