1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,120
they're recording on for audio dharma's sake there

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,639
so hello hello warm hello and welcome everyone

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:20,560
it's good to be with you in this moment in time whatever the time zone might be for you

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,760
so i'd like to i'd like to invite us to explore

5
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,360
um the theme which is actually the title of a book

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,960
and it's a theme that we have explored in different ways and yet

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,360
it's so rich so let me share the title and the title of this book is happiness

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,399
is a choice you make and i might have mentioned it before uh

9
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,280
happy hour some time ago happiness is a choice you make and the sub title of the book i think is

10
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:03,440
lessons from the oldest old the title of the book is quite

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,640
provocative happiness is a choice it's a choice you make it's not something that

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,759
happens to you when when circumstances are perfect when you have perfect health when you have

13
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:22,640
just the right amount of money or the right job or the right relationship or the

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:30,400
right house um all of these come and go and yet

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:37,600
happiness can be can be a fountain within a choice that we make

16
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:43,600
that is not dependent on the conditions you can be sick you can have limited

17
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:52,159
mobility and still have a sense of well-being contentment happiness

18
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,960
and these are lessons that we explore in our spiritual practice of course we do and

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:07,200
and this book which i do highly recommend is is quite remarkable so this um journalist i think new york

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,120
times uh journalist i believe um and

21
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,400
john leland i think his name maybe i should quickly find just so that i'm i'm

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:24,319
referring to him correctly so he um spent a year

23
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,360
with the oldest old with with seven um uh

24
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,200
people who were over 85 and they became his teachers basically in that year yes

25
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,599
john leland l-e-l-a-n-d is his name and it was a time when his life had

26
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:48,640
fallen apart after a long marriage and and um and he learned so much and he shares

27
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,280
that with humility in the book about how the people who became

28
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,239
his teachers had lost so much had lost so much mobility and and you know with old age

29
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:08,000
what happens and friends relatives with some of them not being able to live

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,599
where they wanted to live being transferred losing their friends etc and and actually there is research

31
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:22,319
that suggests that um when we get older even though we lose

32
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:28,640
so much we lose so much but the level of happiness actually increases

33
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,760
which is quite surprising but it's because of how

34
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:41,360
how people become wiser in learning in learning to to be with to appreciate

35
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:47,760
what there is instead of pining after the past or or thinking about a future that's actually quite limited at that

36
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:54,959
point you know because lifespan we know it's short so so this art this this this both

37
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,840
science this art of turning inward and there are beautiful examples in the book how

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:09,360
how john neeland's teachers these people over 80 85

39
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,480
for example when one person is not able to go out to you know

40
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,759
uh to have an outing and then he decides he's actually happy in his apartment

41
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,840
turning on the tv and having ice cream which is not he's not supposed to have but there's a sense of contentment

42
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,400
instead of thinking oh they didn't pick me up they fell through like there was a sense of happiness there was a sense of

43
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,759
peace their sense of peace with with the simple pleasures with the

44
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:45,840
simple joys with the simple actually miracles of life so so hence the title happiness is a

45
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:52,320
choice you make happiness is a choice we make um [Music]

46
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,080
and it's a training we train ourselves with us as the buddha invites us we

47
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,199
train ourselves we train our attention we train our attention here right now

48
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:09,759
right here the mystery the miracle of this moment instead of the past the future we have

49
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,039
choice yes of course we can decide oh this is a terrible moment i wish i was in

50
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:21,680
somewhere else i had a different body different relationship different whatever but and yet the wisdom is and

51
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,039
recognizing the beauty the miracle the grace

52
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,240

ah the contact points releasing release i guess if you're letting a

76
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,240
ball internally drop drop internally

77
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:12,800
ah released unto the earth

78
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:20,640
in lieu of the chair the cushion dropped dropped internally unto the

79
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,640
earth

80
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,560
allowing awareness awareness to to receive the breath in the lower

81
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:15,760
abdomen the in-breath and the out-breath soothing comforting slow slow it down it

82
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,760
helps to slow down the mind to arrive more fully

83
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:30,959
slowly and slowly out for a few breaths not for the entire practice but just to

84
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:35,000
encourage us to settle

85
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:09,600
slowly in the in-breath

86
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,959
the abdomen slowly and more slowly out

87
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:21,000

like a snowflake

94
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:56,000

here's an experiment to try on for size

98
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,360
after this period you can go back to

99
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:52,000
choosing to be any way you want but for now what if what if

100
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:59,759

00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,600
we practice we practice

102
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:12,320
releasing letting go of the thoughts of the past what has come into now until now

103
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,880

let them float

108
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:55,839
and what if in this moment just for trying it on as an experiment see what

109
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,759
happens again we can bring back all the thoughts later

110
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:10,720
and right now experiment with a radical radical perception perspective

111
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:16,839
which all of us can the

112
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,079

00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:03,440
let your body relax and soften as much contentment as there is in this

118
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:09,679
moment just with a simple breath moving in and out

119
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:13,559
to lullaby

120
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:24,840
the privilege of just sitting and being briefed how awesome is that

121
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:15,200
the mind may want to turn to what's not right what's unpleasant what's hot what's cold

122
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,799
can you tune into as if you're tuning a radio and there are lots of channels so

123
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:28,320
much here so much information it's a deluge really every moment so

124
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:35,280
much stimuli the body outside inside

125
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,840
tune the radio of your mind

126
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:52,519
to what's wholesome what's nourishing what's good

127
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:03,039
the body and the mind and just to give it some support

128
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:07,840
let's bring in some meta

129
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:18,520
some kindness some loving kindness so care some warmth

130
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:28,720
for this being who is you struggles who tries their best

131
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:36,320

132
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:44,000
it's okay no need to struggle

133
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:52,720
as if you're an old person practice as if you're a very old person

134
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:59,039
ah let it go

135
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,960
not so much to do to accomplish but just to be here

136
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,360
is enough

137
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:31,760
and if judgments are arising you're not doing this right this is not enough let it go

138
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:37,520
this is enough whatever is happening whatever is here

139
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,799
whatever is here

140
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:53,760
tuning the radio of the mind to the goodness perhaps of some actions in the past

141
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:59,520
maybe kindness or acts of generosity ah

142
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:06,880
let yourself sit in the ripples nothing else to be done right now this

143
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:12,400
is enough to sitting in ripples of goodness

144

trusting tuning the radio of the mind to goodness

145
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,200
you can do this

146
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:29,158
train yourself less

147
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:52,799
knowing that you are doing your best this is enough whatever is arising is enough

148
00:25:52,799 --> 00:26:00,159
don't struggle don't try so hard releasing letting go is a part of this

149
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,159

00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:25,640
the highest flavor of happiness

160
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,519

this is enough let it go

162
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,880
notice if there is desire to continue with this state

163
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,880
with this enoughness whatever it is for it not to end for me not to ring the

164
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:23,520
bell notice acknowledge if it's present

165
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,160
honor it

166
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,359
this here is enough when we let go [Music]

167
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:42,960
pining after one thing and thinking

168
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:51,640
of what is not going well etc etc

169
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:58,720
may all beings everywhere including us

170
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:06,400
find the freedom no peace

171
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,799
deep peace of contentment

172
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,319
what is here what is enough

173
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:39,839
thank you all thank you for your practice

174
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:47,838
i wanted to share a couple of reflections before i invite you to share yours

175
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,520
and that and one is that the the sense of

176
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:00,880
contentment the sense of um [Music] oh enoughness this is enough this

177
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,320
contentment sense of peace that can arise which might never risen

178
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:12,960
for you even just a little bit to taste it this meditation i was tasting it i don't want to bring the bells like oh

179
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,960
this is enough this is yes the body's in pain but this is great this is this is

180
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:24,960
plenty so and and that is not so much

181
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,480
you know when i was inviting you to tune into the radio of your mind to what is

182
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,599
enough it also means really it's more about i think it's more about letting go

183
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:41,599
letting go of what is not helpless just letting go is releasing this releasing

184
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:48,640
again coming back to this book happiness is the choice you make is the releasing of the pining after the

185
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,560
wanting the this to that so that it's oh this right here and again

186
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,599
not to say that this is the state that you may want to have every moment of

187
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:04,640
your life i'm not suggesting that you give ever give up every intention or

188
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,400
desire that's not the idea here but it's a training it's a training that we take

189
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,359
on on the question and it comes to us in daily life when there is a sense of our mind is turning

190
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:23,680
to this that finding fault with everything it's like oh wait i know a different way to be so yes we can

191
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,760
continue to plan to be in the world to serve to to make plans all of that it's

192
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:38,160
nothing wrong with thinking and planning in the world but it can show us a different way of being

193
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,000
so i've said enough and i would love to hear your reflections what came up for

194
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,040
you what did you notice what worked what didn't again

195
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:53,838
sharing for the benefit of the sangha

196
00:40:54,079 --> 00:41:00,560
your insights your aha moments and also for the benefit of yourself to be held witness

197
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,800

198
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:13,760

199
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:18,880
your reflection not your name so take it away what happened

200
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,280
what did you notice was there any peace

201
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,720
was this moment enough for anyone did you notice the bliss of

202
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,720
peace

203
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,960
or not

204
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:55,040

205
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:02,400
is giving the thumbs up would you like to raise your hand and and say something oh it went away the thumbs up so that's

206
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,599
great that's alright here we go aurora please

207
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:13,599
there hi hi

208
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:18,640
i i really appreciated um the opening frame

209
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:23,680
and i felt like there was this like

210
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,839
my my meditation was like releasing grasping releasing

211
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:35,200
grasping um and then when you said the bit about

212
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:40,400
you said something like imagine that you're very very old

213
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:46,240
i got like a long moment of like oh right like

214
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:53,920
i don't have any other time but this time and it just like it like washed over me in this really helpful way

215
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,880
and so i then i kept coming back to that like remember you're you're you you could die tomorrow

216
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,839
and and it was really helpful

217
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:13,200
beautiful thank you so much er for for saying for sharing your insight and

218
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,480
the practice yes this this this reflection of

219
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:25,440
i could die tomorrow i could die tomorrow practicing as if you're really really old what a great

220
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:31,200
way to practice in the past i've given the instruction to people to practice as if you're sick as if you're ill because

221
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,319
when you're sick you don't try so hard it's more easeful and now i think i'm going to give the new instruction to

222
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:42,319
people practice as if you're you're 90 years old like yeah oh wow

223
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:48,880
something happens in our bodies right this in our minds beautiful thank you so much for sharing that

224
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:56,640
a couple of reflections in chat bill says pleased to see that slowing the breath did slow my mind yay

225
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,319
bill wonderful at the same time there was a slight physical strain in the breathing and

226
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:08,960
breathing so slowly yeah yeah so so it's there's lots of research about breathing

227
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:16,720
and the effect of slow breath especially slow out breath how it calms the mind and the physiology

228
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,960
there's plenty of physiological research and actually the book breath it's a lovely book i'm giving you lots

229
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:29,680
of book recommendations tonight it's a great book so and and it's good to do that for a while but then if

230
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:36,480
it becomes strange then let it go and my recommendation was just to bring that in at the beginning to kind of slow down

231
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:43,040
and then to let it go let it be normal and then deborah says i'm still

232
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:48,400
in the gooey peaceful state and didn't want to use words now to shift out of it

233
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,560
yes yes thanks for sharing that debra i appreciate it that's how i felt myself

234
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:03,119
after the meditations like i don't really want to talk i don't want to ring the bell but it times up

235
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:09,359
yeah yeah and one more reflections when private my

236
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,560
practice is not regular yet and when i allow myself to relax to the deepest

237
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:19,920
i still feel this background rumbling of jangling nerves

238
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:26,720
like a quarter rattling on top of a washing machine on the spin style yeah

239
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:33,359
yeah thank you for sharing that and it's okay it's been cycle right spin cycle right

240
00:45:33,359 --> 00:45:40,480
oh came the correction um that is okay it's it's it's often like

241
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,520
you know we're like running you know we're like a car that's driving at 100

242
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,880
miles per hour through our lives again going to get this done and that done and this side is like and then we sit to

243
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:58,640
meditate and the car is still like kind of moving shifting and and and i love your description of

244
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:04,160
yeah jangling nerds the quarter rattling on top of washing machine it's okay it's

245
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:09,760
really okay make space for that that's what needs to happen that's what needs to be

246
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:17,839
present given everything that has come before and if you hate it if you say okay i've sat

247
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:22,960
down i want everything to be quiet stop you quarters but by pushing it away and

248
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:28,240
hating it actually you give it more energy so my recommendation is make space for

249
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:33,520
the jangling nerves for the rattling quarters like oh yeah it's like this

250
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:40,319
and notice that how actually there could be peace there could be contentment

251
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:48,079
even if there's rattling and jingling the same way that there could be contentment peace and ease with physical

252
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:53,680
pain with things not being right the two can coexist and the moment you

253
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:00,560
see that there's a person who wrote whose practice is not regular yet the moment you see that yeah jingling and jangling

254
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:07,359
can be together coexistent with ah peace and contentment

255
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:15,440
the peace can be spacious enough to hold it then wow then your practice would open to the next level so

256
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:21,920
so dear ones with that i would like to invite us to to

257
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:29,440
share to engage to reflect uh whoever shows up in the room tonight is

258
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:34,960
the right person is this person that you're supposed to be talking listening

259
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:40,720
to to these special individuals they're supposed to teach you something

260
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:48,079
tonight and you're supposed to teach them something again not fatigued like preach but but you're it's you're meant

261
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:54,480
to leave each other with a gift let yourself be surprised and the gift may not reveal itself so don't start

262
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:00,559
like stressing out like okay i gotta say something smart no no no just just be yourself and your gift might just be

263
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:06,800
silently holding present just silently holding presents maybe

264
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,559
that's the gift that you give to the other person tonight the gift of compassion the gift of care

265
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:18,960
so so see what happens see what happens i am
