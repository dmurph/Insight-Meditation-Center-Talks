1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,680
so hello and welcome and here we are in our

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,400
meditation

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:24,480
session and one of the Arts of samadi is the

4
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,960
careful orientation towards pleasure

5
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:38,399
and underneath this or more fundamental is the way that mindfulness

6
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,719
practice Buddhist practice is meant to be a very

7
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:51,680
realistic understanding seeing acknowledgment of suffering of our

8
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:59,719
difficulties and to see them clearly one of the ways to care for it

9
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:05,239
is is not to do so directly but to do it indirectly through

10
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:15,119
the path of samadi and that should be done carefully and wisely not as a ver aversion to our

11
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:23,920
difficulties but rather with a a care for them a love for them a love for

12
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:32,640
ourselves and so the orientation towards pleasure is uh in a way it's done with a

13
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,880
with a gentle message that that you care for yourself you care for the suffering

14
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,200
and this is a way of doing it and then to be modest in the

15
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:54,200
orientation towards pleasure and when we first sit down it might be to notice just this the relief

16
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:00,119
of sitting down after maybe a busy day or a lot of activity and just the

17
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,560
Simplicity of just breathing and being and like you have permission to not

18
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,360
accomplish anything not to go through Tod doist but just to be be breathing

19
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:17,439
and to feel the relief the pleasure the goodness of

20
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:26,959
that and uh and so then to uh

21
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:35,400
feel uh is there any sense of pleasure or enjoyment or goodness or rightness in

22
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:40,680
the body in the mind and

23
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,800
to gently allow it to be there to appreciate it to let it be part of the

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,080
meditation sometimes the priorities or the biases towards the difficulties and

25
00:02:53,080 --> 00:03:01,200
the pain and the suffering sometimes the priorities is overdone towards

26
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,519
um uh towards

27
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:17,599
um towards uh the pleasure and the joy so before we continue I wouldn't be

28
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:23,879
reassured that uh you are seeing the screen because I had trouble of making

29
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:33,080
the the the YouTube screen um so it looks like we are seeing

30
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,080
it

31
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:48,599
um so I wonder if someone could point out

32
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:55,920
that they are seeing they're that we're connected video is fine great thank

33
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,560
you uh yes to the screen the good okay

34
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,760
good I believe that maybe the wires here at IMC had gotten loose since yesterday

35
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:14,519
and so when I first logged on I couldn't make it work so

36
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:22,800
pleasure the pleasure of things working well enough so to begin the

37
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:30,720
meditation to uh assume a meditation a meditation posture

38
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:38,720
that gives you the pleasure of being alert the pleasure of being

39
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:48,120
present through your embodied body so that means not the pleasure of

40
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,199
relaxing in a couch or something but the pleasure of being

41
00:04:54,199 --> 00:05:01,639
somehow with the body in the appropriate way whether it's laying down or sitting or standing

42
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:08,039
standing some appropriate way where there's an intention expressed through

43
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:13,960
the body to be

44
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:21,919
here in a way that has some pleasure to it some it's feels like it's inspiring

45
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,440
or good to be

46
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,160
alert and to gently close close the

47
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:43,600
eyes and then take time to scan through the

48
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,520
body to recognize where it's Pleasant and comfortable in your body and where

49
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,880
it isn't and a kind of matter of fact simple acknowledgment of how it is in

50
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:02,840
different parts of the body so that parts that are uncomfortable are at least acknowledged

51
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,080
and

52
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:25,080
known and maybe continuing this way but taking a few long slow deep

53
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:36,120
breaths so as you breathe in you're connecting to some part of your body body and as you exhale you're softening

54
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,599
relaxing opening that part of the body

55
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,720
and to let your breathing return to

56
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:21,120
normal and there's a pleasure or Pleasant feeling that can come with

57
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,680
relaxing so as you breathe in feel the muscles of your

58
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:34,199
face and as you exhale soften relax the the

59
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,759
face around the eyes the

60
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:49,319
Jaws feeling this subtle pleasure or goodness that comes with

61
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:04,879
relaxing on the inhale to feel the shoulder shoulders and the exhale to

62
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:21,919
relax on the inhale to feel the

63
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:28,520
belly on the exhale to soften the belly

64
00:08:53,480 --> 00:09:03,279
on the inhale to feel the thinking mind and on the exhale exhale to soften

65
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:12,920
open expand the thinking mind into the quiet around you

66
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:37,880
and then on the inhale feeling the body's experience of

67
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:45,839
breathing in wherever that is Pleasant or connecting

68
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,959
or

69
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:57,040
appreciated and on the exhale

70
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,759
relaxing the body

71
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,640
breathing breathing in a normal

72
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,920
way feel if there's any pleasure or

73
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,079
pleasantness or sweetness or or

74
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:38,920
rightness in the direct experience of the body

75
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,639
breathing and to feel

76
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,600
that it can be quite subtle the pleasure

77
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:19,600
and if you feel some of the pleasure or pleasantness of

78
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:27,279
breathing can you slightly adjust your

79
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,480
breathing to let there be more

80
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:39,120
pleasure maybe extending the

81
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:52,519
exhale extending the inhale Maybe by Maybe by relaxing

82
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:57,040
something in your torso

83
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:26,079
maybe the pleasure is not connected directly with breathing but rather the gentle

84
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:33,800
influence that the movements of breathing have beond the edges of the

85
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:04,120
movement connecting to the inhale at the beginning of the

86
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,880
inhale connecting to the exhale the beginning of the

87
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,839
exhale and then in a way that feels

88
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:32,839
Pleasant easeful sustain the attention through the whole

89
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:39,120
length of the inhale the whole length of the

90
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,079
exhale staying close to the feelings of

91
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,839
pleasure so that it's easier to stay with the

92
00:13:56,279 --> 00:14:01,279
breathing because the mind enjoys a

93
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
pleasure

94
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040

free and may we contribute to that possibility

137
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:09,329
[Music]

138
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,519
thank

139
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
you e

140
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:14,320
so to continue this series on samadi that uh as at certain point as

141
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:20,799
the mind and body get settled collected

142
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:27,200
unified as it gets stabilized

143
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:36,919
um the means for the support for entering into the Temple of deep

144
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:45,720
Samar is to uh is through the doorway of

145
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:54,000
pleasure not necessarily sensual pleasure but certainly an embodied

146
00:30:54,000 --> 00:31:01,000
pleasure that begins to feel like a sense of well-being joy and

147
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:10,639
happiness and so you're allowed to take in feel be nourished by

148
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:16,000
saturated by well-being when you're doing Samari

149
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:22,000
practice and so to be oriented towards it in just the right way to not be

150
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:28,600
attached to it expecting it pushing for it um but rather

151
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:38,559
to be open to it to allow it to acknowledge it when it's there to appreciate it and as it's there to

152
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:46,519
gently allow it to there be a kind of a feedback loop between the joy the

153
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:52,080
pleasure to and the meditation and the and the focus on breathing focus on your

154
00:31:52,080 --> 00:32:00,200
primary object and so that uh the joy the pleasure um keeps you

155
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:07,639
connected and it's a feedback loop where that as you get more St stable more

156
00:32:07,639 --> 00:32:14,080
engaged more fully in the experience of of the breathing of the meditation you

157
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:20,519
can feel that the well-being shifts and changes gets richer gets

158
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,919
stronger and um so this is not uh it can seem like

159
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:32,200
you're you know one in or you know clinging or trying to make something

160
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:38,480
happen it can some people get tense but the IDE is to stay relaxed almost as if

161
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:45,519
you're not expecting anything to happen but you're allowing it samadi willing so

162
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:53,480
willing let the let the The Joy the well-being spread and one of the little tools for

163
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:00,320
this is to uh have a little half smile smile turn up the corners of your mouth

164
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:09,200
just a little bit until you feel a sense of pleasure there and uh and let that pleasure uh uh

165
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:17,360
be the support to keep you connected keep you here in the present moment and um some people will shift

166
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:25,519
then from from the breathing to the pleasure the the physical pleasure of the smile and get absorbed in that but I

167
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:34,240
recommend that you just use it as a background support as a that as a as a pointer as a

168
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:40,559
encouragement stay stay with a breath continue stabilizing continue entering

169
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:47,440
into the world of breathing and as we do this massage of connecting and

170
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:52,600
sustaining uh it almost it can be in harmony with breathing in and breathing

171
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:59,200
out where we gently lovingly connect to the beginning of the inhale and that

172
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:07,080
massage of sustaining is there as the the chest the Torso fills with air we

173
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:14,960
feel the expansion the movement and the becoming larger and then we connect to the exhale

174
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:20,440
and and uh and um sustain the attention

175
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:26,040
feeling the the pleasure of the smoothness the smoothness the release

176
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:33,878
the softening the settling that can be there in the exhale and sometimes it's nice to feel

177
00:34:33,879 --> 00:34:39,358
the slight pause at the end of the exhale if that's really easy to do uh

178
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:45,800
and feeling The Emptiness of it the the lack of anything um the relief in a

179
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:54,440
sense of just being for a moment or two in that pause and because of the pause the call

180
00:34:54,440 --> 00:35:00,920
to breathe in is maybe a little bit stronger so it's a little bit more pleasant to breathe in because the body

181
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:07,839
somehow wants it we're not holding the breath for a long time there's no holding really just a pause to

182
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:14,960
accentuate being there with the breath and enjoying it and

183
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:23,000
um and uh and then part of this then is to that uh this focus on somebody on

184
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:28,800
breathing and the pleasure of it is meant to be a way to help the thinking

185
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:33,880
mind become quieter and now the thinking mind is

186
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:41,200
fueled by focusing on thinking itself the food for discursive thinking

187
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,599
distracted thinking is we lose our attention in the thinking but if the

188
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:54,640
attention goes somewhere else then the thinking is not being fed so much it might be there in the background but

189
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:59,720
it's the the preoccupation that being caught in it is not being fed and often

190
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:05,400
the thinking becomes quieter but it's also possible to participate in quieting

191
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:12,319
the Mind by relaxing the the thinking muscle to relax the tension uh the

192
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:17,880
pressure the contraction or round thinking and maybe softening the mind

193
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,520
opening the mind making this feeling the sense of the Mind become expansive and

194
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:31,040
open um and so sometimes that can happen on the exhale as you exhale let the thoughts

195
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,040
evaporate float away so that there's more space in the

196
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:43,560
mind the the absence of thoughts is not just a pure absence it's an absence

197
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:48,599
that'll kind of make room to feel the joy the pleasure it's an absence that

198
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:54,720
makes makes it you feel it almost with the experience of samadi with the

199
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:01,280
goodness of it with the breathing with the Sensations with the

200
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:08,280
pleasure and so there is a kind of Art in in the samade of knowing how to give

201
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:14,319
yourself fully to the experience without straining of giving yourself fully to it

202
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:20,800
while we relax and while you uh um you know let

203
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,400
go the first time I ever got instructions in samade specifically for

204
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:33,520
purpose of samade I was told it was all about letting go and I thought that was a useful

205
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,119
instruction to get because then um I kind of understood not to cling not to

206
00:37:40,119 --> 00:37:46,280
Crave not to be pushing not to be trying to make something happen um but just

207
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:51,920
keep letting go it's almost letting go into breathing letting go into samade

208
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:59,079
letting go into uh this uh this uh Nur in

209
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:06,839
settled enjoyable place within and um and what's uh really

210
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:12,319
special that can happen is that the pleasure The Joy the well-being of

211
00:38:12,319 --> 00:38:20,040
somebody belongs to a different operating system within us than the operating system of difficult

212
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:25,960
emotions sadness grief depression distress it's a different operating

213
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:31,880
system than a physical aching and pains in our body and so because it's a whole

214
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:37,480
different operating system it can operate beautifully wonderfully

215
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:44,599
without um um feeling that we're being

216
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:50,319
somehow disloyal or somehow bypassing or

217
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:58,079
somehow um that we have to kind of fix the emotional difficulties we have

218
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:05,480
first so we can get concentrated uh it's more the opposite

219
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:12,800
that as we can into somebody it puts us in a much better place to meet and

220
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:18,079
understand and address our suffering and this is one of the great possibilities

221
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:23,480
from samade enter into samade get really Ed meditation to get really stable and

222
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:30,640
settled and calm and then when you come out of meditation glance and look at your challenges you

223
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:35,839
have and see if you can see see it now in different eyes see it from a

224
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:42,119
different context a different frame of reference and um and uh you might find

225
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:48,599
yourself living in a kind of different world with a stable quiet settled body

226
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:55,200
and mind then the world you see when you're spinning in your thoughts and preoccupations spinning in your

227
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:00,800
suffering so that it's almost like the glasses by which you see are the glasses

228
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:08,400
of suffering if the glasses you're seeing is the glasses of calm well-being peace

229
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:16,040
then you can address and understand and have room and capacity to be with your difficulties in a much better

230
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:23,640
way so the art of samadi includes the art of how of being

231
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:30,079
attuned to our body heart and Minds capacity City for pleasure for

232
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:36,200

233
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:41,800
forms of Happiness can come as we dip into into deeper and deeper

234
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:48,000
samade and um and as uh and if sometimes the Joy or the happiness gets quite

235
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,200
strong be rest assured that there's better things than joy and there's

236
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:01,839
