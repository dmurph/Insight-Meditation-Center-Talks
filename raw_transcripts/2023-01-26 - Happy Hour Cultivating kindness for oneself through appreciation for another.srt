so invite you to settle to arrive in your body

7
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,920
and if you're sitting let yourself feel a set of a sense of

8
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:54,378
Integrity in your posture if you're sitting in a chair

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,660
feel the bottom of your feet both feet planted

10
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,720
on the Earth the softening

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,140
into your feet the softening into your sit bones

12
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,560

15
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:41,040
your jaw let it be loosened

16
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,340
let your breath be free

17
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,200

18
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,660
however it wants to be long or short

19
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:24,319
Let each out of breath settle you

20
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:33,680
releasing tightness holding

21
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,300
settling letting go more deeply with each out breath

22
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:35,659
nothing needs to happen

23
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:45,560
just here simply here

24
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:54,860

29
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:27,960
not thinking not analyzing what is here but just being with it breathing with

47

00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:17,360
thanks everyone thanks for your practice

137
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:23,640
so what we did this evening just a few words

138
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:29,340
um I'll review what we did was we uh

139
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:35,299
began with settling in the body with the breath

140
00:31:35,299 --> 00:31:41,240
relaxing softening in the areas that were tight

141
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:47,840
need to be released and then

142
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:54,600
invited the breath to be releasing with every out breath to

143
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:59,880
settle us more deeply into our heart into our posture into the present

144
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:07,140
moment and then we invited someone we cared about we did

145
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:12,899
meta for them any way that it was easy then brought to our minds and aspect of

146
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:20,340
them that we really appreciate we really love so that we really our hearts gather around that

147
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:26,940
around the goodness the brightness and then we invited ourselves as a beloved other in

148
00:32:26,940 --> 00:32:33,779
interaction interacting with our dear being something we haven't explored here in

149
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:41,159
happy hour so many ways and then wishing well for both of these beings or doing their best interacting

150
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:47,700
which is just a different way to get to mitta for ourselves because sometimes

151
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:54,000
meta for ourselves can be so challenging so these are so many different ways we we uh

152
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:00,659
try to get to it so and um

153
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:05,760
yeah metaphor dear being meta for ourselves through

154
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,799
that seeing ourselves as a as a beloved other and also this way of stepping out

155
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:18,000
of ourselves and seeing us ourselves in interaction with someone we care about is is also ties into as I was mentioning

156
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:26,360
there's a sense of universality that impersonality not self like oh yes just good will Goodwill it is us here that's

157
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:34,320
considering all of this and yet there is something tapping into the universality of Goodwill that's just available

158
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:39,659
so so I'd like to invite us

159
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:44,700
to um do not transition doing things a little differently just trying things

160
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:49,860
out for science I'm going to invite us to transition now to small groups and

161
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,960
then we'll have time for Reflections after that when we come out and

162
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,960
um with the recap uh groups of size roughly three

163
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:07,440
hopefully um the invitation always is as we

164
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,740
connect with other people in the Dharma with other practitioners and this contemplation the invitation tonight

165
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:21,179
with this question with this practice we did is um for each person to perhaps if you if you

166
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:28,080
would like to share a little bit of what was it like for you there's no right or wrong and say I fell asleep my mind was

167
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:33,720
distracted it's okay it's fine um or maybe something new came up when

168
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:41,760
you saw yourself in interaction with someone else just offering that again as as a gift as a gift to the Sangha then

169
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,820
notice also your intention why are you speaking is it to to be of service of to

170
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:54,599
to also to of service to yourself and others but not in a way of self-aggrandizing but just humbly with

171
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:00,660
humility sharing um your your insights with others and

172
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:07,740
you can also say pass or when you return comes and say thank you pass and then maybe later when it comes your way you

173
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:13,740
can say something or not it's all good um and

174
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:19,859
and each person maybe will just say something for a minute or two and then make sure you leave space for the next

175
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:26,700
person and then the next person and then it'll come back to you so you can go around a couple times

176
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:31,800
um and not no asking questions no directing other people's experience just

177
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,260
sharing from your own experience very simple and then ask and then letting

178
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:42,780
others share from theirs be kind this is really breakout groups

179
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:47,820
are perfect place to stay embodied and speak from your body to practice

180
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:52,859
mindfulness of speaking mindfulness of listening it's such such a beautiful

181
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:59,220
practice instead of like okay it's recess blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah please don't do that

182
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:06,660

199
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:05,520

people to drag my tattoo so if you've got family usually there's a lot of love

201
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:17,460
but really uncomplicated is that I was as easy and and I was just lucky that for me it

202
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:22,980
happened that talked about neutral person today did something really nice to me so I was able to bring that person

203

204
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:35,940
it was so easy to open the heart there was nothing between us really a negative so it was

205
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:41,940

217
00:39:57,540 --> 00:40:02,820
um I'm going to ask a question about um

218
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:07,880
how to skillfully deal with um

219
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:17,060
oh God I can't even think of the word right now um

220
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,819
okay maybe Pedro can help me what was the word I used in our group

221
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:33,800
you can type it in chat Pietra if you you can

222
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,539
are sending to Serena also

223
00:40:44,359 --> 00:40:51,660
well it's a type of ill will you know it's like not not really

224
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:57,900
um resentment no no resentment is no it's

225
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:03,859
it's a lot less it's it's less savvier than resentment oil will irritation

226
00:41:03,859 --> 00:41:10,079
irritation irritation that's it that's what it was thanks Peter so I felt a lot

227
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,900
of irritation during the meditation and I really did not

228
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:23,300
I didn't feel like I had the um the capacity at that point in time to

229
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:30,060
[Music] um to handle the irritation so I basically decided to do something else so let me

230
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:35,880
ask you so what um so I have an idea what the irritation uh I already have

231
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:42,180
some thoughts but I wanted to ask you so if you can go back in time and get a sense of what was the irritation what

232
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:50,700
was the source of it that as you as well as you can tell maybe it's hard to tell it was just a feeling of irritation that

233
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:56,220
you came in with and an irritable mind

234
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:03,599
yeah well I I wasn't aware that I was I'm I'm um actually quarantined from code phone

235
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:08,700
covered right now and I it's the first time that I'm aware that

236
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:16,680
I've had covered in the past three years and actually I wound up at the hospital for it so I was back since yesterday but

237
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:23,760
what I have noticed is even at the hospital I was irritated with this lady

238
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:29,780
who could not get it right something right so um

239
00:42:29,780 --> 00:42:34,859
so I guess the for me it's really important

240
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:42,480
it feels so strong when their rotation comes on yeah that I feel like I I'm not able to

241
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:48,000
really um get a handle it on the top of the

242
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,220
time that it it's on so unless I could just totally turn it off to something

243
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:58,560
totally different it doesn't feel like I can handle just

244
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:03,780
being with the irritation so for the benefit of time I'm going to I got it

245
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:09,960
just what's happening and thank you for sharing and I'm so sorry to hear that you've been so sick with coffee Serena

246
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:17,339
and had to go to the hospital glad you're back at home feeling better hopefully you're recovering so so

247
00:43:17,339 --> 00:43:22,980
regarding your question about irritation in the limited time left

248
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:30,240
um a couple of things one is you know if if the body is feeling ill

249
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:36,720
or or out of balance if you're sick with a virus fighting then there's less

250
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:42,300
there's less um uh room really so it's like a tire you

251
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:51,000
know there's less air in the tire so it's easier for that for for one to get irritated so so turn turn towards the

252
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,660
irritation turns because when you're irritated you're the person who was like you're the you know you're both hurting

253
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:03,180
yourself and you're harming others so so bring compassion especially when you're sick

254
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:11,880
especially when you're sick bring compassion which is like a soothing sound like it's okay as well as patience

255
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:17,760
patience and compassion those are the two antidotes for irritation especially

256
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:24,780
patients it's not going to get any better or easier if you're irritated and you're it it just you know that that

257
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:31,619
that's a wisdom practice bringing the patience in so bring patience in as well as compassion for yourself was really

258
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:38,220
hurting right now with the irritation um and distraction is not this is not a

259
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:45,780
very good strategy because uh I mean sometimes it can feel skillful but overall it's better to actually work

260
00:44:45,780 --> 00:44:51,300
with it head on with with wisdom bringing in

261
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:57,060
a dose of patience and compassion for yourself who's

262
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:03,440
suffering at that moment so thank you for bringing that in Serena thank you

263
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:08,460
