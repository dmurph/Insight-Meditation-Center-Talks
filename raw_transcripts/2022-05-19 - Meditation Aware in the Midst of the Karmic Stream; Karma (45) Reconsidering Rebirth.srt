17
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:10,479
and is arriving in this moment and all that is being passed on

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:22,080
this moment right here just on the edge of receiving and passing on

19
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,959
and yet with its own intentionality its own

20
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,480
creation forming formations

21
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,440
so let us form wholesome formations

22
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,239
of awareness appreciation

23
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,319
wakefulness alertness

24
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,280
ease peace arriving arriving

25
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:05,840
arriving spaciously

26
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,040
in this moment in this body

27
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:37,120
letting the breath be received

28
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:48,000
each breath each inbra the entirety of the in-breath

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:56,120
the entirety of the out-breath the pauses in between

30
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,519
soothing calming the mind

31
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,958
calming a restless mind an agitated heart

32
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,638
soothing calming the body

33
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,400
all formations

34
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,080
awareness of this breath in the body

35
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:47,520
let the breath be natural let awareness be natural

36
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,960
not forced it's already here

37
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,960
let the body be natural

38
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:22,560
nature we are nature

39
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,319
receiving from nature giving to nature

40
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:37,240
our breath our being intertwined with nature

41
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,720
and if thoughts arise as they will

42
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:15,160
not a problem

43
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,319
that's what the natural inclination of this mind is in this moment

44
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:39,599
so not to see it as a problem having a spacious heart with a spacious

45
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,840
awareness spacious

46
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,319
easeful breath

47
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,039
letting it arise and pass without getting entangled

48
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,479
staying aware staying in your station of awareness

49
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:18,639
as to what's arising what's being handed down coming downstream

50
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,720
coming downstream from earlier actions thoughts

51
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,000
forming formations

52
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:43,800
nowhere spacious knowing

53
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,959
and as awareness knows

54
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,240
sensations in the body the breath thoughts

55
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:40,240
emotions sounds whatever is arising

56
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:48,480
see does what is passed down through causes and conditions

57
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:54,560
through past actions formations

58
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:02,480
doings makings especially thoughts patterns that are us

59
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:11,279
as the stream passes through observe no

60
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,480
be aware

61
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,920
no need for judgment for the person you were

62
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,560
previously are you even the same person you were a year ago

63
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,320
this self letting go of that concept for a moment

64
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:52,199
and just seeing these streams that are arise arrive in this moment

65
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,560
and deciding intending [Music] for the stream of kindness

66
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:20,320
awareness wisdom to be passed down from this moment

67
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,240
so not judging not hating not being

68
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:29,240
greedy

69
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:43,680
about what arises meeting with kindness with spaciousness

70
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:49,760
as much as possible and if that's not possible can there be

71
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:56,399
acceptance and ease equanimity that it's not possible in this moment

72
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:05,600
that too is planting the seeds of ease and

73
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:13,240
equanimity and wisdom instead of being reactive entangled

74
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,839
watching the stream being passed down and adding

75
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:38,880
drops as if taking a dropper

76
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:47,759
that has color in it and dropping a drop or two

77
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:55,120
of kindness acceptance ease wisdom patience

78
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:02,639
spaciousness into the stream into the stream in this present moment

79
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:20,680
as the stream is passed down one breath at a time

80
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:14,039
present here here

81
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,200
can we appreciate this moment a liveness

82
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,320
of awareness even if we were lost in thought a moment

83
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:58,240
ago it's okay in this moment a new arrival

84
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:04,120
fresh with possibilities like the spring

85
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:36,480
and as we bring the sitting to a close

86
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:44,440
appreciating appreciating what was

87
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:49,278
without judgment

88
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:58,799
through appreciation and kindness towards ourselves through the stream that was passed down

89
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:02,720
you can plant wholesome seeds

90
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:12,080
more kindness in the stream in the river as we pass it down

91
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,399
into the future so appreciating appreciating our good

92
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:25,520
fortune for being able to sit together

93
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:32,559
practice and community listen to the dharma

94
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,960
such good fortune

95
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,440
appreciating that we have showed up that we have done what we could

96
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:55,640
today in this moment as best as we could

97
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,840
with appreciation gratitude kindness this person who is me

98
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:08,840
and our sangha our community our beloved community

99

100
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:24,559
generosity we receive generously we offer our goodness

101
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:30,960
the best of ourselves generously to others it's not for us to keep

102
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:35,158
it's not for us to keep

103
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:42,720
to share to offer the merit the goodness of our practice

104
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:46,080
to all beings everywhere

105
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:52,240
past present future

106
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:59,519

107
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:03,880
inextricably intertwined

108
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:09,519
may they all be happy well

109
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:18,120
free including ourselves

110
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:45,880
thank you for your practice

111
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,960
hello [Music] hello friends hello sangha

112
00:31:52,960 --> 00:32:01,679
so today we continue our exploration with uh with karma with this important

113
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:06,930
profound teaching of karma so

114
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:13,440
[Music] the past few days

115
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,120
today being thursday the fourth day we are going to turn our attention

116
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:26,000
to this teaching and how it impacts our life

117
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:32,480
in the past few days we've discussed the three different aspects of karma as

118
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,440
action with intention the action of the mind the body

119
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,240
and speech all actions from different sense doors and the lead and the trailing edge what

120
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:51,600
is left from the action from the intention which is the leading edge

121
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,399
the action itself as well as the the trailing edge what is left what is

122
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,200
created what formations are created

123
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:12,080
so [Music] it's impossible perhaps i mean it is possible

124
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:19,360
but but um it's important to talk also to pay attention to talk a

125
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,840
little bit about rebirth as we talk about karma

126
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:35,170
so [Music] so in the west as as buddhism has come to the west

127
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:40,480
[Music] most or almost all of western buddhists

128
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,960
they don't hold they don't really subscribe to the idea of rebirth this

129
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:54,000
concept of rebirth so because in the west there is this concept of the self there is me there

130
00:33:54,000 --> 00:34:01,679
i'm i'm here i'm um um [Music]

131
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,840
a fixed i have a fixed identity and thoughts and emotions etc this is the

132
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:14,878
fixed me whereas the idea of rebirth can actually loosen that it's it's concordant it goes

133
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:21,079
along with um with the idea of impersonality

134
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:27,599
ungovernability and control of uncontrollability so let me speak about that for a moment and just to say you

135
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:34,720
don't have to believe in anything you don't have to believe these are just invitations to consider a

136
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:43,200
different way of seeing so so for the next 10 minutes 9 10 minutes let us enter

137
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:50,240
into this world you know we're in this universe or in this world where perhaps we you know you don't believe that

138
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,839
there there is no rebirth for a moment for 10 minutes let's just enter

139
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:04,160
an alternate world um that we're um

140
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:11,040
the concept the idea that there was the reality of rebirth let's enter into that

141
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,680
together so

142
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,000
if if you were reborn if there was someone if there was

143
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,200
uh if you if you were reborn if you were a rebirth if there was rebirth and there was

144
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,480
someone else who was your say your previous self

145
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,760
you know they would probably they would have a different body different gender

146
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:49,200
different upbringing different language different memories different dreams different attitudes

147
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:56,160
all of that being different so would that still make you make them

148
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,160
the same person and if there was a being that

149
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,839
say was you were reborn as someone else in a future life assuming that is true

150
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:13,839
we've entered this universe together this thought experiment together where that is true

151
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:18,880
that person would still have a different gender upbringing and and language

152
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:24,240
learning memories dreams attitudes so they would be a different person could you still

153
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:29,280
consider them to be yourself right

154
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:34,560
so so there is no continuity of the self

155
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,680
in rebirth anyway because in buddhism in the buddhist doctrine it doesn't even

156
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:45,280
make sense to call yourself itself let another rebirth for it to be a

157
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:52,400
continuity continuation of yourself so the idea is that

158
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:57,760
even here in this one lifetime um

159
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,119
we are not this coherent independent

160
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:10,079
uh controlled being because we are made of causes and conditions

161
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:17,760
and interdependence strong interdependence with others with causes and conditions

162
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,560
so the idea of rebirth

163
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:30,560
is uh the idea of rebirth is that

164
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:36,040
as it is mentioned in the buddha in the suttas

165
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:44,240
the same way that milk changes into curds and then changes to butter

166
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:52,079
and then changes to ghee similarly and in the same way that

167
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,880
milk and milk curds and butter and ghee they all have the same they're all

168
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:06,800
connected they're all connected however they manifest very very differently

169
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:12,720
uh in the same way if there is if there is rebirth you know

170
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,359
you are manifesting very differently so there is not a sense of i'm still not the same person if they have this

171
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:26,640
different dreams and memories and parents and dispositions and everything so it's

172
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:32,880
uh there is not a self in the idea of rebirth that is kept

173
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,920
so if there is rebirth and the idea is that yes

174
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:48,960
i am heir to the actions of someone who is long dead

175
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,240
supposedly and and there

176
00:38:54,240 --> 00:39:01,520
even though you know again my body nationality language all of that is different i have i have this composition

177
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:07,760
here in this life and yet that gives rise at least for me

178
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:14,640
being in this universe assuming that there is rebirth for me gives rise to a sense of gratitude that there was this

179
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:22,000
person who passed down it's like they were my ancestor there was some kind of ancestor

180
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:27,440
that were different beings the same way that my grandmother great great great

181
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:35,440
grandmother or grandfather they were different beings but they passed something down to me in terms of genes

182
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:42,240
in the same way the they were this this ancestor they passed

183
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:48,480
down this this you know previous rebir reborn itself

184
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,400
passed down these karmic formations that now i'm grateful for

185
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:59,760
and i'm the beneficiary of and in the same way

186
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,760
i pass down i pass down these karmic formations for the benefit

187
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:12,079
of someone else who in some ways is related to me the same way my children are related to

188
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:18,079
me or my my great great great grandchildren if i had any they would be related to me and

189
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:25,839
i want the best for them so basically the teaching of rebirth and

190
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:32,640
karma brings up the sense of it's really it pivots it it's based on a

191
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:39,280
um based on generosity and gratitude a sense of generosity that we have

192
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,960
received something we have received life first of all and

193
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:50,720
we have received these karmic formations and

194
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:55,839
we are going to make the best possible and pass it down

195
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:01,280
so it's like i don't know if you have the same feeling but when you

196
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,680
say stay at if a friend's place i like to leave it better than i found

197
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:14,319
it cleaner than i found it it's the same idea this this karma that

198
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:20,400
you have been passed down thank you can we make it better can we improve it

199
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:27,200
can we make it kinder can we make it more patient can we make it more

200
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:33,119
loving less reactive and pass it down to others

201
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:38,560
is that possible is that possible so

202
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:45,280
again all we really have is this moment's

203
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,839
knowledge is this moment's [Music] awareness

204
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:57,680
and our actions our intention our actions in this moment we don't really

205
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,680
know i mean that again now we can perhaps exit this universe or

206
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,960
rebirth is definitely true exit this thought experiment together but even if

207
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,040
it were true it wouldn't make much of a difference right in terms of oh i'm going to live forever and i'll come back

208
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:21,440
and i'm not gonna die no of course you're going to die it doesn't make any difference it just brings a sense of

209
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:28,160
perhaps interconnection that we already feel with

210
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:33,440
all the living beings in this moment in time who are living with us on this

211
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:38,720
planet because our life is strongly intertwined with theirs the

212
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:45,359
air we breathe our actions etc and

213
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:52,480
the same way we are intertwined we are in inextricably intertwined

214
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,599
with beings from the past and into the future

215
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:07,520
not just genetically but in some ways that um in some ways that maybe

216
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:14,640
actually from some of us give us inspiration aspiration to be kinder to

217
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,920
feel that the whatever remarks we make whatever we do

218
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:28,000
is is not without reverberations in the world not just in this moment but but wider

219
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:34,000
so so basically the teaching of karma and with respect

220
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:41,040
to rebirth makes us even realize even more that we're not living for ourselves for our

221
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:48,800
own benefit it's such a small minded thing that to think that i'm just living for myself me me me me

222
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,839
but we're living for the benefit of all beings whether or not we like it

223
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:02,319
and so with what quality do we live in this moment with what quality do we live

224
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:10,480
in this moment for the benefit of all beings it's not about me how do my actions how do my

225
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:18,480
intentions affect everyone so i thank you all i thank you for your

226
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,560
practice today thank you for your dedication

227
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:30,640
planting seeds wholesome seeds of kindness take good care of yourselves

228
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:36,760
and hope to see you tomorrow take care
