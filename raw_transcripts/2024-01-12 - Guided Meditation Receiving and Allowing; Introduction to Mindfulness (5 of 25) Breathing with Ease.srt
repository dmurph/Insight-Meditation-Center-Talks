1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,160
hello and welcome

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,480
and for this uh meditation session continuing

3
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:21,880
to practice with mindfulness of breathing and one of the important

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:32,719
uh elements of mindfulness practice is not doing the mindfulness

5
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,640
exactly what we're mindful of but rather how we're

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:47,600
Mindful and that uh the attitude with which we are bringing attention to our lives is

7
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:54,480
very important and that attitude can be can come along with all kinds of uh

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:59,680
mindfulness can come along with all kinds of attitudes there can be fear as

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:06,960
part of of it they were worried about how we're doing or what's happening or what's going to happen and so there's a

10
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,040
heightened kind of alertness um that uh is fear-based there

11
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,080
could be desire and we want something to happen we're looking for something to happen

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:24,320
we're trying to make something happen there can be aversion that we're want to

13
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,960
avoid something we don't want to feel discomfort we don't want to be in the present moment because it's boring so

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,439
there's an inversion or pushing or resistance there can

15
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:41,799
be straining there can be um

16
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:49,799
complacency there's all kinds of things that come along with mindfulness and over time these

17
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:57,479
attitudes that are extra and not needed Begin to Fall Away we start seeing them at first we might not notice them but

18
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:04,840
the regularity of practicing begins to slowly reveal and relax and to settle

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:10,679
all the extra attitudes that uh make mindfulness more complicated than needs

20
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:16,239
to be and so um and it takes a while to

21
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:24,080
learn it and so today I'd like to offer two attitudes that are

22
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:31,200
often um seen as very nice alternatives to many of the ways that

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:38,200
the extra attitudes people bring uh they are attitudes which are on

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,959
the way to having mindfulness be very clear and simple almost as if it's

25
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:51,640
attitude free they just kind of a Clarity and open it's like a a window that's been so thoroughly cleaned that

26
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:57,920
you don't even know there's a w window there you can almost feel like you can put your hand through

27
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:05,159
it and um so uh so around mindfulness or

28
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,480
breathing and these attitudes for today are

29
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,280
um uh allowing and

30
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:22,120
receiving and it works fairly well for some people to do that uh with the

31
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,159
allowing with the exhale allowing the exhale to go allowing the

32
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:34,560
release and for the inhale receiving um the

33
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,480
um the um inhale you're receiving

34
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,799
oxygen on the exhale you're exhaling releasing

35
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:54,120
C2 and uh on the inhale uh we're the diaphragm is moving

36
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,599
down to mix space and we're receiving and filling and opening and on the

37
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,239
exhale there's a release a letting go that we allow for as a diaphragm comes

38
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:12,000
up again and by diaphragm is released and it pushes the air

39
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,199
out and um and so this gentle these gentle attitudes as we move

40
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:27,199
along and um and I'll offer one more uh little technique maybe halfway through a

41
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:34,680
very gently uh using thinking to keep you present rather than

42
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:43,199
have your thinking Wonder take you wondering off and that is to use a mental notes to very simple note and to

43
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,880
the note that notation that i' like to recommend today is on the in breath just

44
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:54,560
say in and the out breath out or the classic way of saying it is that the

45
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,680
belly Rises on the inhale the the word rise

46
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:07,160
Rising the the exhale falling and these don't have to be words

47
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:14,039
uh they could be kind of subvocal recognitions or subvocal kind of

48
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:20,080
thinking the idea is very light touch very relaxed and for some people having

49
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:26,759
that very simple thought is uh keeps the thinking mind occupied just enough with

50
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:33,319
the breathing to stay there rather than all too easily wandering

51
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:39,680
off so assuming a meditation

52
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,560
posture lowering the

53
00:05:54,680 --> 00:06:01,479
Gaze and gently closing the eyes

54
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,479
and gently taking some deeper breaths as a

55
00:06:11,479 --> 00:06:17,759
way of feeling more of your body feeling connected to your

56
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,919
torso your shoulders maybe your back rib

57
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,000
cage and as you

58
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:38,720
exhale to relax let

59
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,440
go letting your breathing return to

60
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:06,599
normal and on the inhale receive in

61
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:14,479
Awareness the different tensions and holding in your body as if it's okay to have

62
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:22,479
them let them be known or received during the inhale and then on the

63
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,520
exhale allow them to

64
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:34,919
relax allow them to

65
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
soften

66
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,440
and the same thing with a thinking mind on the

67
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,639
inhale receive the sensations the tensions the

68
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:32,000
agitation the energy that might be there the thinking

69
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:37,518
mind allow it to be there in a receptive way on the

70
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,159
inhale and on the exhale soften the thinking

71
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,519
mind relax the

72
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
mind

73
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,000
and then

74
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:30,000
calmly find how your body experiences breathing

75
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,200
and where in your body is it most comfortable most

76
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:43,800
inviting to experience the body's

77
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:51,800
breathing the movements of the body the sensations connected to

78
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
breathing

79
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
for

80
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:46,320
and as you inhale relax and

81
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:54,760
receive the inhale maybe letting go of straining

82
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:04,600
and but a sense of wide open space or window that receives the

83
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:10,399
gentle breeze receive the

84
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:32,360
inhale maybe as if the body is receptive awareness is

85
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:49,399
receptive and at the top of the inhale a moment or an instant of

86
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:57,600
pausing before you exhale and then allow the

87
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,000
exhale as if you're giving the exhale its

88
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,800
freedom allowing the release the Letting

89
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:17,720
Go allowing it freely let go freely

90
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:27,079
release and if it's not so free that's okay allow that

91
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
too

92
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:49,079
at the end of the exhale a moment or an instant of

93
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:55,199
pausing so that you can be ready and switch

94
00:12:55,199 --> 00:13:00,839
to receiving the inhale

95
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
for

96
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
for

97
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

98
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:55,519
if there's a lot of thinking the thinking fills the space of

99
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:05,759
the mind so there's less room for receiving experiencing

100
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:13,800
breathing see if you can quiet the thinking mind or let it recede in the

101
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,959
background don't give it much attention so there's more room in the

102
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:27,399
mind space to receive the

103
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,440
inhale space into which to allow the

104
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
exhale

105
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
for

106
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

107
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
for

108
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
for

109
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:19,919
and then ever so lightly the

110
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:24,960
quietest maybe even subvocal ways of

111
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,320
thinking gently have a single

112
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:38,440
word recognizing the inhale maybe it's

113
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:44,039
in or maybe it's using the word

114
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:53,600
receive and for the exhale

115
00:18:53,600 --> 00:19:00,320
out or allow

116
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:12,120
least amount of effort just enough to help you stay on

117
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:19,960
track breathing in and breathing out

118
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:23,840
all receiving and

119
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
allowing

120
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
e

121
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

122
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
e

123
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

124
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

125
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

126
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

127
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
e

128
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,200
e and if the practice of receiving the

129
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:09,360
inhale and allowing the exhale is nice for

130
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:19,679
you the next step almost like an extension of

131
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,080
each is to no longer

132
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,799
receive and allow

133
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,279
but let

134
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:45,360
awareness be there be intimate with each inhale and

135
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,679
exhale with no extra attitude just

136
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:02,640
breathing in

137
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
awareness

138
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

139
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
for

140
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
for

141
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:23,158
and then coming to the end of this

142
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:33,480
sitting to gently take some deeper

143
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:40,679
inhales as if you're opening yourself expanding yourself to now receive the

144
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:48,360
world around you the room you're in the building

145
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:53,320
you're in the

146
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,240
neighborhood the extended communities the

147
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,720
world and on the exhale to send out

148
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:16,399
your respect your good will love

149
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:25,240
compassion some form of positive regard out into the

150
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:32,919
world receiving the world on the

151
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:45,000
inhale sending positive regard on the

152
00:28:50,919 --> 00:28:56,080
exhale may all beings be

153
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,519
happy may all beings be

154

safe may all beings be

155
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:17,639
peaceful and may all beings everywhere be

156
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:32,250
liberated [Music]

157
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,799
thank

158
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
you

159
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:50,000
so good morning or good day for this fifth talk on mindfulness

160
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,720
of breathing and

161
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:03,919
um I've spent pretty much my whole adult

162
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:11,760
life some 50 years now um practicing mindfulness of

163
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:19,200
breathing and it's been a wonderful Journey it's been uh not something I've

164
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:24,799
really gotten bored with ever seems like it's always being renewed always

165
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:31,840
something new and um and I think the part of the reason for this is breathing is so

166
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:39,320
intimately connected to so many different parts of our lives and how we breathe

167
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:46,880
um what we breathe with as we breathe with our body and our emotions and thoughts it's always changing it's

168
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:53,519
always a process of deeper deepening understanding or deep greater Freedom

169
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:58,639
greater finding ease and the uh the word that I like a

170
00:31:58,639 --> 00:32:06,240
lot to associate with Brea breathing is breathing easily having an easy

171
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,519
breath being at ease in breathing and it's not always that way

172
00:32:12,519 --> 00:32:19,320
for me but when that's there uh it just seems so wonderful it's like a

173
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:24,440
homecoming it's a settling and part of the reason for that

174
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:29,760
is that when for me when the breathing just easy and relaxed and just doing

175
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:37,240
itself breathing itself uh the breathing has become freed of all these attitudes or all these

176
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:44,880
other uh psychological and physical activities that will often influence the

177
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,440
breathing change the breathing and uh emotions will change

178
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,080
how we breathe uh attitudes and desires and motivations will change how we

179
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:01,600
breathe um what's happening around us will change how we breathe the temperature

180
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,679
will change how we breathe there's so many things that come into play that influence

181
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:13,080
breathing and uh and some of those have to do with

182
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:18,200
uh being the agent being the doer being the one who wants something or trying to

183
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:25,960
avoid something or has to succeed or has expectations and uh the one that I can

184
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:33,320
measure with ideas of success and failure and to learn to put those aside

185
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,639
and not to live in those um maybe they still operate in the background but to

186
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:47,519
live with the breathing to live in the present moment here with this this kind of proof that we're alive and present

187
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:54,480
and and um at times I feel so grateful to be breathing it's uh you know it's

188
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:02,720
why not see it as a gift that we're offered all this oxygen from the trees and the plants that produce it and uh

189
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:07,799
isn't it a gift that when we no longer need it there's this kind of the carbon

190
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:16,079
dioxide we have a system a way of shedding it so it doesn't build up and poison us and um and so to sit here with

191
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:22,599
appreciation and gratitude and to sit with appreciation for being able to do

192
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:29,158
this practice uh even when uh it's Challen alling even when I'm challenging

193
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:35,760
uh in doing the practice where my my I'm caught up in trying to do something or measuring myself or such

194
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:43,480
things I feel so fortunate to have the practice of mindfulness which I'm confident is a path to Freedom a path to

195
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:48,638
this ease of breathing as um so the way that I've

196
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:55,560
introduced it this week is to not emphasize staying so much you know one

197
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:00,760
pointedly on the breath just not just stay on the breath without wandering off

198
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:06,720
but rather to offer you a kind of wider context of being mindful of the ecology

199
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,040
around thinking the the forces of distraction and learning how to fold

200
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:17,640
them in in a way that maybe brings us into the breathing in a simpler way

201
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:25,440
rather than uh kind of tightening up to over override the distracted mind um learning

202
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:32,280
to relax the body in the mind that uh the more distracted we are uh probably

203
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,720
it represents more some kind of tension in the mind in the body maybe in the

204
00:35:37,720 --> 00:35:43,680
heart uh something that's holding on some tightness or some contraction or

205
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:49,839
some zeroing in on something and so this uh learning how

206
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,359
these pieces work and learning to relax and and um and not override how we are

207
00:35:55,359 --> 00:36:03,079
but learning to appreciate that mindfulness just recognizing how we are in any given moment and and to know that

208
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:11,240
in a very simple way without uh judging without criticizing without being for or

209
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:17,760
against and then to um as we as we go um

210
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:25,240
but further at some point there is a kind of centering ourselves on breathing and being able to stay with uh breathing

211
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:31,119
over time and and over time might mean three breaths and just that might be

212
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:37,280
enough because it's enough for interrupting what is often non-stop

213
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,720
which is this the mental stream of thinking the rumination that the the

214
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,680
preoccupations of the mind which when they run wild more often than not are

215
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:56,440
not so healthy for us and so to have something that interrupts it that uh

216
00:36:56,440 --> 00:37:02,280
that doesn't allow it to just kind of build its build up and do more and more and that's one of the functions of

217
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:07,319
breathing even coming coming back and just feeling one breath fully is an

218
00:37:07,319 --> 00:37:13,359
interruption in the freedom in which the distractability can operate in

219
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:19,160
us and um and then be content with that one breath be content with three breaths

220
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:26,319
the three breath Journey that I said yesterday it's so useful and um I will often have a kind

221
00:37:26,319 --> 00:37:33,319
of in nature now as I go through my day to uh to be in touch with my breathing

222
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:38,359
and see how it shifts and changes and sometimes when my breathing changes and

223
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:44,319
gets tight or shallow it's the early warning system for me that oh now I'm

224
00:37:44,319 --> 00:37:49,800
getting tense I'm getting reactive to something and because uh this wonderful

225
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:58,560
close relationship in breathing and our attitudes and emotions and motivations that uh staying with the

226
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:06,240
um breathing is uh is a way then to kind of relax just come back and relax and

227
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:13,240
not give into um the Mind streams so I want to offer you a u

228
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:19,680
metaphor or an image for how to practice one-pointedness on breathing it's such a

229
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:27,200
classic idea in meditation to have a one-pointed focus on breathing and uh really stay present for it

230
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:37,000
and um and the the image of doing it then it may in often times in an unhelpful way is um if this if this uh

231
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:43,760
upright finger is the is the breathing and the my my other hand here

232
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:48,960
is the mind and if I think I have to focus and be one-pointed I've had a lot

233
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:56,599
of experience of getting tense and kind of pulling everything in and being kind of tense and focusing on it like this

234
00:38:56,599 --> 00:39:03,000
and this this movement like this to be one pointed this way is um uh creates

235
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,079
tension and I've even at at times when I was younger got headaches from doing

236
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:13,640
this um rather uh Relax The Mind soften the

237
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:19,520
thinking mind and let it in a sense feel like it's open no no tension in it at

238
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,960
all and then with a mind more like an open hand bring the breathing and the

239
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:32,760
mind together together right at the middle sign at the place where if you do it with finger here it comes to the most

240
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:38,760
sensitive part of the hand for me so sensitive right there at the middle of the

241
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:45,680
palm and then to stay and so that one point is right by where these touch the

242
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,520
one point is not by by narrowing and and and

243
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:58,880
um and piercing it's by touch touching and feeling in this most sensitive part

244
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,079
of the hand and then with time sometimes I start tightening up but I've learned

245
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:10,599
to pay attention to that movement and then to relax and to feel and then as

246
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:17,240
this uh one pointedness right at this most sensitive place um pulls my

247
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:22,960
attention or I allow for it and enter into that world then it

248
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:29,960
um it um the rest of everything else begins to Fall Away the room Falls away

249
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:35,079
the sounds around me the sometimes even the body seems to fall away and thoughts

250
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:40,319
fall away and things get very simple uh in this right in that little place just

251
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:48,160
there being with it so um so one of the things you might try with mindfulness of breathing is

252
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,640
these what I've offered in meditation today this attitude of receiving on the

253
00:40:53,640 --> 00:41:00,599
inhale and allowing on the exhale this is a a way of learning to keep the Mind

254
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:08,240
very open like when you receive something in an open hand when you allow something to be free same gesture with

255
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:14,800
the open hand so open mind the Fist of the mind gets

256
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,079
opened and with that openness um and you almost don't have to

257
00:41:20,079 --> 00:41:25,400
go go to the breathing um yeah let the breathing find

258
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:33,599
awareness um there's no need to move the mind and have the Mind move to and focus on the

259
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:39,079
breathing um breathing will come to you if you're open and are receptive to it

260
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:44,880
if you set your mind you know if you open uh you know the window when a day

261
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:51,560
when there's a breeze the breeze will find its way in through the window if you open your

262
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:56,800
awareness to welcome the breathing the breathing will find you

263
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,960
and then so that way the mind doesn't do this doesn't Focus doesn't kind of have

264
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,520
to work so much it's more of a allowing and then

265
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:15,040
um and then uh the mind will wander off and um be aware of that that's not a

266
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,920
problem for mindfulness just one more thing to know and what's important for meditation

267
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:27,119
is not how often you wander off but how often you begin again on the breathing

268
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,920
and I say this in a very Choice way to begin again the breathing as opposed to

269
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:38,520
um uh bring your mind back to the breathing the the idea of bringing it

270
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:43,800
back for many people can be this tightening up and this kind of tension

271
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:52,079
but uh to begin again with the breathing the mind doesn't have to do anything it just opens and allows and makes that

272
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:58,240
connection here and then we stay with it and then maybe if it's helpful to use

273
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:04,359
Mental noting and I like to think of it as the simp absolutely the most relaxed

274
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:12,440
simple non forceful non-ex expecting a mental note that kind of opens the

275
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:18,000
fields almost like an each notice invitation feel this more fully

276
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,119
in out so

277
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:29,480
um so I hope that what I've taught this week about

278
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:37,480
breathing uh is maybe not easy to do but maybe has made you curious to experiment

279
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:45,160
and look into it and pay more attention to breathing in daily life pay more attention breathing

280
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,520
as you wake up in the morning as you lay down to go to sleep um as you eat as

281
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:56,119
you're in conversation with people um kind of make breathing kind of a theme

282
00:43:56,119 --> 00:44:02,040
them and get wiser and more knowledgeable familiar with how your breathing

283
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:08,839
works for some people mindfulness of breathing doesn't work very well and um

284
00:44:08,839 --> 00:44:15,200
so this week might not have worked so well for those of you who that's the case and there's no nothing you know

285
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:22,800
wrong with that um uh there are perfectly good other ways of meditating without using the breath and I'll talk

286
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:28,520
about some of those next week when I do mindfulness of the body and um and that

287
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:35,920
will include a little bit of mindfulness of listening which is one of or mindfulness of the body itself that

288
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:43,760
those two can be a nice alternative for some people for people for whom the breathing doesn't work very well as an

289
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:48,920
object so thank you very much and uh I

290
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:57,960
hope you have a that you some of you will have a breathing weekend and um

291
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:05,200
uh and um and you'll come to enjoy your breathing thank

292
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:08,680
you
