1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,560
so welcome uh to you all I've been thinking about you much

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:11,559
today and uh happy to to uh sit

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:20,279
together so most common kind of misconception

4
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:27,400
about meditation is that uh thinking thinking is it's the problem if I'm

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:36,640
thinking can't meditate right it's not that thinking is uh the problem

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:45,920
but maybe we can say our our overtrust in the capacity of language to solve our

7
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,960
problems that's a problem and

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,559
so language is like the hammer and every problem every

9
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:05,400
unpleasantness is a nail and part of what we're doing in in

10
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,759
our meditation practice is uh renouncing

11
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,240
the seduction of language

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,759
renouncing and the Dharma is um is a

13
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:31,280
therapy not based in words but in action in awareness

14
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:37,000
and so um we'll sit with this in mind I'll un unfold this

15
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,240
more uh after we sit so uh finding a a posture that feels

16
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,880
sustainable e

17
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,319
relaxing whatever can be relaxed

18
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:13,080
relaxing whatever can be relaxed and and whatever tension remains just granting full

19
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:16,400
permission for

20
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,760
imperfection

21
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,760
e e

22
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:56,080
part of why we relax is

23
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:04,120
uh the urgency to fix

24
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:12,199
unpleasantness recedes when there's more neutrality

25
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,919
so we do what we can to relax and we do what we can

26
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,080
to uh prepare our heart for the

27
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,120
inevitability of unpleasantness of

28
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,880
imperfection of all the things that feel urgent and

29
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:27,560
become like a very sticky for our attention

30
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:42,280
rather than be surprised that something any

31
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:51,360
moment could feel wrong we just know that's a part of the human

32
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:01,400
condition and it drain some of the urgency

33
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,360
to fiddle with

34
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
conditions

35
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,479
e e

36
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,279
just

37
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:55,640
resting you don't need words to rest

38
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,320
but whenever feeling comes

39
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:14,560
up we're so accustomed to soothing and medicating that feeling

40
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,000
with our

41
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:33,079
words so part of what we're doing doing in mindfulness practice is

42
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:38,600
absorbing the intensity of The Human

43
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:48,399
Condition without resorting to language as our

44
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
savior

45
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

46
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
e e

47
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,200
so there's

48
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:03,440
breathing we uh might have a kind of

49
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:09,880
subtle image kind of visual subtle

50
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:14,560
thought the breath arising and

51
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:25,720
passing but uh we're just feeling the breath we don't

52
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,160
need or words

53
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

54
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:32,079
e e

55
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,440
how much of a n

56
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:25,040
uncertainty can we tolerate before we need to tell a story about it

57
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:55,000
God is Not uh the enemy there are no enemies in experience

58
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:09,560
and we're emerging from our overtrust in

59
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:19,240
language we're renouncing the ways we habitually use

60
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:26,920
our language or thinking to control our inner

61
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
life

62
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

63
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

64
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

65
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

66
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

67
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
e e

68
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:25,320
there are times when this is not at all the case but very likely right

69
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:33,520
now language doesn't make us any safer in this

70
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:58,159
moment and so we let go into the world of feeling we let go into

71
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:00,640
silence

72
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:12,240
relax or over

73
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:18,799
trust words the hammer

74
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,520
every intensity the

75
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
nail

76
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

77
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

78
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

79
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

80
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

81
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

82
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

83
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
e e

84
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:21,120
anich feels like

85
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:30,200
Risk and words feel like safety

86
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:43,200
but uh the deeper safety is

87
00:25:44,679 --> 00:25:53,080
um the cultivation wisdom and

88
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
love

89
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e e

90
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,159
all for

91
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,919
okay um it's good to uh good to sit with

92
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:35,039
you

93
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:45,440
so so I I appreciate uh kind of interdisciplinary dialogue

94
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:53,039
where uh Buddhist Scholars scientists are are talking genuinely trying to

95
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,600
understand and uh where there's um maybe

96
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:04,480
we say respect for the capacities or the many chambers

97
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,320
of the heart and also respect for um empiricism

98
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:17,080
for the for the the sense of um you know that yeah evidence counts

99
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:22,519
and we can always be wrong so this comes from one of those kind

100
00:29:22,519 --> 00:29:29,840
of interdisciplinary teams uh Davidson and colleagues so I

101
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:36,399
wanted to to read um their kind of very condensed version of what what they

102
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:45,559
hypothesize mindfulness meditation training does so the um the authors write and

103
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:52,360
I'll post uh I'll post the article in the YouTube um description

104
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:58,559
afterwards so they hypothesize uh they say core capacity is gained through

105
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:05,760
mindfulness meditation training can be stated as follows the capacity to sustain present

106
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,080
centered awareness is facilitated by the moment by moment focus on the meditation

107
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:17,760
object meta awareness is cultivated primarily through monitoring for

108
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:24,159
distractions when as is frequently the case a distracting Chain of Thought captures attention and pulls it away

109
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:30,559
from the object D reification is trained by recognizing that the

110
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:37,399
thoughts are just thoughts and not reality nonreactivity to experience is

111
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:45,399
cultivated by rehearsing the non averse or curious non-judging stance towards

112
00:30:45,399 --> 00:30:53,780
experience and changes in self-related processing occur through

113
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:59,559
[Music] deification of self-concept and a

114
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:05,880
decrease in autobiographical narrative

115
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,960
thinking we're going to cover that in 11

116
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,559
minutes so

117
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:27,559
the the movement of this path and I'm sort of on this trip around it these

118
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:33,519
days but the movement the the movement of this path is towards a life less

119
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:39,320
mediated by language it's a kind

120
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:46,240
of progressive move towards a life that's less uh

121
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:52,679
mesmerized by the realm of thought and it might seem like language

122
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:58,720
is just what we use to describe the world I'm using it right now of course

123
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:04,279
but actually uh shapes experience more than

124
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:10,399
we we tend to imagine and so the authors say we're

125
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:15,799
training in present centered awareness there isn't there isn't a thing called

126
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:22,760
the present that we pay attention to really what's often meant by be

127
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:29,840
present is simply not to be identified with discursive

128
00:32:30,679 --> 00:32:36,399
thought we uh use the meditation anchor

129
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:41,880
as as um uh oh you know in a sense it's it's

130
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:50,679
almost like a snack that we feed our hungry attention the breathing right we we feed

131
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:57,480
our hungry attention something and we do that because part of

132
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:05,399
what we're we're cultivating nonidentification with discursive thinking with auditory

133
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:12,559
thinking and uh this so we initiate and sustain that contact with the meditative

134
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:18,840
anchor and then meta awareness is cultivated by monitoring for distractions we're tending to the

135
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:24,200
breathing or whatever it may be but the sense of like the connection to the

136
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:31,720
breathing is fraying it's fraying meaning the kind of

137
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:40,120
gravitational force field of thinking is pulling and we can still feel the pull

138
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:48,639
consciously before we abs are absorbed into it and so these sort of like kind of

139
00:33:48,639 --> 00:33:57,840
like embryonic thoughts that just beg us to think them

140
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:05,399
and it's almost like if you know the feeling I have is like if if if they could talk those embryonic thoughts it's

141
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:10,480
like I need you Matthew I need you do

142
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:17,118
not neglect me you know and then it's like

143
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:24,118
well I don't want to neglect you I want to take good care of you I'm

144
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:30,358
a nice person right I'm teasing of course right but

145
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:38,158
it's it actually it's serious don't neglect me

146
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:43,398
it's kind of like don't neglect me or you may suffer don't like neglect me or

147
00:34:43,399 --> 00:34:48,760
you may die to make it the most dramatic

148
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:54,599
right that gravitational pull that just feels like we must be get

149
00:34:54,599 --> 00:35:01,880
involved as I said in the sit a un unreliability uncertainty

150
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:08,280
impermanence it's it's felt as a risk it's felt as risk the Buddha like

151
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:17,440
put Finger on something that um it just um un unbelievable you

152
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:24,680
know the anicha felt as risk and thoughts feel like the only tool we have

153
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:31,000
to manage anich and so we feel the kind of gravitational

154
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:36,880
pull and it's like a black hole you know it's just like I don't know anything

155
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:46,000
about black holes but I think there's like this pulling right there's like some kind of a vent Horizon and before

156
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:54,880
we're devoured before we cross over the Event Horizon and the black hole does whatever it does to us we reconnect that

157
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:02,839
frayed connection with the meditative anchor once we cross the Event Horizon

158
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:10,480
right it's like we're gone we're absorbed in thought we um don't know

159
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:18,359
we're meditating we don't know we're human we don't know anything we wake up from the dream of

160
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:25,000
identification and then you know the kind of bubble of that thought pops and

161
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:32,400
we train then they say in reification thought is known as thought

162
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,720
thought is known as thought mindfulness is about appreciating phenomena as

163
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:44,720
phenomena rather than phenomena as the world as the mirror of the

164
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:51,560
world right we normally just take the world to be the world and

165
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:59,119
we're learning to just appreciate um appreciate the six sense Gates

166
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:06,960
Right the five sense gates in the mind to appreciate phenomena as

167
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:13,599
phenoma and so we're no longer mistaking auditory thought as

168
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,560
essentially God's word we're appreciating it as phenomena that arises

169
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:26,160
and passes D reification and you say like wait wait

170
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,520
wait wait but some thoughts are are true right and yeah for sure some thoughts

171
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:36,599
are more true than others you know lunch

172
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:42,359
is uh before dinner not after absolutely

173
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:50,000
yeah but taking that very simple statement as true does something to the

174
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,680
mind when we're identified with thought there's some

175
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:01,920
confinement and maybe if we're being um if we're being poetic we might say that

176
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:06,160
not knowing is more free than

177
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:15,760
knowing they go on non-reactivity is cultivated by rehearsing uh a curious

178
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,359
non-adverse relationship stance towards experience this is this is equinity

179
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:27,720
right equinity and it is

180
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:36,720
absolutely amazing how much smoke arises off the kind of engine of resistance to

181
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:45,040
unpleasant feeling how much smoke Rises off the engine of resistance of friction in

182
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:52,640
relation to unpleasant feeling so we we practice as as uh

183
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:58,760
shinzen Yang called it like a radical permission to feel

184
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:03,280
equinity as a radical permission to

185
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,880
feel in a way um are that present centered awareness is parasitic on some

186
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:18,119
measure of equinity right without without

187
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:25,800
equinity um we're always kind of like rehearsing or

188
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:32,280
clinging right we've we've um our contact with the

189
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:40,000
present moment is buffered by the strategizing that clinging

190
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,960
involves and so um we're releasing that

191
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:54,000
kind of friction so that we can make more and more unmediated contact with

192
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:57,920
sense experience

193
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:05,240
and then they make a little bit of a leap to say you know

194
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:11,280
um that changes in self-related processing occur through

195
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:19,359
they use that same word deification but this time not of the random thought of dinner or whatever but

196
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:25,480
deification of self concept and a decrease in

197
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:30,960
autobiographical narrative thinking deification of self-concept right first

198
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:37,400
we see the emptiness of whatever stray thought we have you

199
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:45,800
know it's not so hard to see the thought about dinner whatever you know it's like

200
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:54,000
um uh it's just phenomena arising and passing the image of whatever the object

201
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,280
of sense pleasure arises and then there's the the identification

202
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:06,319
is broken you know we wake up to that's a thought we it's

203
00:41:06,319 --> 00:41:13,119
deified it's just we were mesmerized by it for a moment but it arises passes we

204
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:18,160
become un mesmerized and the thought is it's not

205
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:27,240
like it didn't happen or something but it's just a million light years away from the project of my life

206
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:34,119
okay that's a thought about dinner right but thoughts about me about

207
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:39,960
Matthew oh my goodness the the pros and cons of

208
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:47,359
Matthew that's kind of a big deal those thoughts are really real

209
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:53,319
how's this night going this Dharma talk

210
00:41:53,560 --> 00:42:02,839
stupid those thoughts deification no thank you reification right

211
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:09,560
wait okay no they're made of the same

212
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:15,040
thing the grasping and aversion we have with respect to our

213
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:22,400
self view to the story of self that that begins to dissolve in the same way that

214
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:27,480
the identification with the thought about dinner dissolves more phenomenon

215
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:35,520
not actually more personal than the thought about dinner or

216
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:43,040
whatever and so the most potent gravitational force in the universe

217
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:48,599
me that starts to weaken and we don't retreat to the kind

218
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:56,839
of house of self to assess our life to navigate the complexities of Being Human

219
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:01,920
the story of um self becomes dramatically less

220
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:09,119
sticky and there's less self but much much more

221
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:15,319
life so I offer this for your consideration and

222
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:23,280
um I hope that um it serves you in some way look forward to uh being back next

223
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:28,960
time and um yeah may we all uh I'll be

224
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:32,960
happy okay
