1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,920
good evening welcome

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:15,320
welcome yeah it's nice to

3
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:22,000
arrive this moment and to practice

4
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,400
together wherever you are

5
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:34,239
so we'll do a little bit of a guided

6
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:46,360
meditation just allowing the mind and the body to

7
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,878
arrive maybe some deep

8
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,439
breaths and noticing with that exhale there can

9
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:10,118
be a little bit of relaxation a little bit of Letting

10
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:17,000
Go little bit more ease with the exhale

11
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:44,479
and feeling the contact of the body with whatever is supporting the

12
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:52,600
body and our feet our

13
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,078
legs our seat

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:18,920
and then checking in with the head and

15
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:26,360
face just seeing if there are any obvious places where some Letting Go

16
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,640
might happen

17
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:50,040
without making it a project that we have to let go or get rid

18
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:57,480
of so more it's an invitation or an

19
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:04,640
opportunity than a instruction or

20
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,000
imperative checking in with the neck and the

21
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,920
shoulders the upper back back and lower

22
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:45,519
back the chest and

23
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:57,280
belly arms and hands

24
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:19,479
and then to allow the awareness to rest on the

25
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:23,359
sensations of breathing

26
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:37,240
feeling the movement associated with

27
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,680
breathing e

28
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:05,000
and when the mind wanders just very gently

29
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,479
simply begin again with the sensations of

30
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
breathing

31
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:02,560
e e

32
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,479
for

33
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,879
we might notice that thoughts come thoughts

34
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:18,400
go maybe there's some swirling around a

35
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:24,159
particular notion or maybe there's a family of

36
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,800
thoughts but they're coming and going

37
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:51,560
we're not asking to have particular thoughts we didn't order them from the

38
00:08:51,880 --> 00:09:00,639
menu they just arise or maybe I should say arrive

39
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:06,560
and then they

40
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:29,360
go we can't grab on to them

41
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:37,079
we can't control them so

42
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,399
much they're

43
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:04,000
ephemeral and yet we are often give them so much Authority

44
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:43,480
to be sure thinking is very helpful we need it to navigate Our Lives

45
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:48,440
it's important healthy normal of

46
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,880
course and for the purpose of

47
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,240
meditation for this meditation

48
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:10,200
period can we let the thoughts be in the

49
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:19,800
background and in the foreground could be the experience of

50
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:26,399
breathing or perhaps some other bodily Sensations

51
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:51,560
as best we can we let the thoughts think

52
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,680
themselves without our getting tangled up in

53
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
them

54
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
e e

55
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:08,320
in a simple kind-hearted way can we just begin

56
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,560
again with the sensations of

57
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,639
breathing Begin

58
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
Again

59
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

60
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

61
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

62
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,959
e e

63
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,959
we don't have to make thinking the enemy we don't have to make it wrong we

64
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:30,800
don't have to struggle or wrestle with thinking and thoughts

65
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,639
we just begin again we recognize

66
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,759
that most likely there's a momentum to

67
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:50,040
thinking it's natural that there might be some lot of

68
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:57,839
thoughts so we just Begin Again the sensations of breathing or the

69
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
body

70
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

71
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

72
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

73
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

74
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

75
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

76
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

77
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

78
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

79
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

80
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

81
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

82
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

83
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

84
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

85
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

86
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

87
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

88
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e e

89
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:25,279
if we recognize that thoughts come and go and

90
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:31,399
come and go sometimes we

91
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:35,960
invest so much Authority into

92
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:46,640
them even when it's not helpful we find ourselves caught up in

93
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:54,760
them so this practice of Simply beginning

94
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:04,039
again helps to recog ize and shift our relationship to our

95
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,240
thoughts so that we have more space more

96
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:21,640
freedom we're not being pushed around by our thoughts but we can use them to support

97
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:28,679
us so that we might be of Greater support for others

98
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:35,760
so that we might be available to help others to fully see

99
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:41,360
others to be with others and to see and be with

100
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:50,200
ourselves so in this way may our practice be for the benefit of all

101
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,200
beings

102
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:04,679
everywhere for [Music]

103
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:51,640
good evening welcome I I I always want to say it's

104
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,440
nice to be here but I guess even though I'm here by myself but it's I am

105
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,480
imagining that uh there are people out there that are

106
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:10,640
listening and whether it's in real time or at a later time I'm just appreciating that there are

107
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:19,039
other practitioners so I think it's probably

108
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:25,120
safe to say that it at least once in the history

109
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:32,000
of everybody's meditation practice there's been a time in which there's been difficult experiences or

110
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:38,640
uncomfortable experiences and there might be a time in

111
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,039
which the inner critic gets activated and then there's this little voice saying I can't do

112
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:51,240
this everybody else can do this it seems but I can't do

113
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:57,679
this or maybe there's this uh voice that

114
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:05,159
saids say why am I even meditating anyway like it probably doesn't

115
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:12,120
work or something along the lines of uh I'm not sure about this

116
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:20,320
practice that teacher they don't understand their life has been probably easy peasy and they

117
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:26,440
don't understand the difficulties that I have and these suggestions for practice

118
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:35,320
that it's for other people not not for me or the Buddha that was so long

119
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:43,320
ago do we even know that the Buddha existed so these kinds of thoughts these

120
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:51,600
thoughts that really aren't supportive aren't helpful but there's um a sense of

121
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,039
agitation with them kind of like a lack of settling down and there's also a

122
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:03,559
sense of whirling maybe that they aren't really Landing anywhere or going

123
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:08,840
anywhere they're just kind of I can't do this and I don't know why I think I can

124
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:14,960
do these things and here's just proof that I can't do it or you know something along these

125
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,840
lines of course we we don't have these kinds of thoughts when our meditation is

126
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:26,600
settled or when there's a certain amount of ease we're not questioning the validity

127
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:32,320
of the practice or or the the uh or our

128
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:38,159
capabilities but it's only when there's some difficulties and It's Perfectly Natural right when we have some

129
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:43,200
resistance some difficulties it's that there might be some thoughts that arise

130
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:49,080
around this but a consequence of this type of

131
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:58,039
thinking is that we stop being engaged with what's actually happening instead

132
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:04,799
we're lost in this thought pattern this thought train that's going and we like

133
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,399
is this practice work is it going to work for me and what is the best

134
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,320
practice maybe I should be doing meta like have some openhearted and then go

135
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:22,320
to the mindfulness but it's hard to do mat unless I'm settled maybe I should do some concentration practice don't even

136
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,360
really know how to do concentration practice okay so I'll just do mindfulness but mindfulness is hard

137
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:35,760
right we could spend our whole meditation period doing this kind of thing and if you find yourself doing

138
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:42,559
this I assure you you are not the first one to do this so instead of actually

139
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:49,799
being with our experience we're having a type of debate in our mind and we're lost in

140
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:54,960
these abstract ideas that don't really have

141
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:03,480
answers I mean the question about is this practice going to work the answer to that of course is try it and find out

142
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:08,558
right that's really the only way to to know for

143
00:34:08,919 --> 00:34:15,560
oneself so the Buddha recognized this this tendency for humans to do this to

144
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:21,599
kind of get lost in abstract ideas and to kind of have questioning our

145
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,878
capabilities and having a this hesitation or this vacillation maybe I

146
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:34,040
should do this andbe I shouldn't do that is this really right this type of thing

147
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:42,118
and he called it vcha it's kind of a nice word it's often translated as doubt or

148
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:47,878
skeptical doubt and maybe I would like to say it's more like swirling

149
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:55,079
doubt this idea of like having reservations having hesitation having

150
00:34:55,079 --> 00:35:02,720
vacillation being indecisive maybe even being suspicious so it's this way in which we

151
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:10,000
kind of go around and round in our thoughts but we're not really getting anywhere and we're not really Landing in

152
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:16,760
the present moment busy with these kinds of thoughts that

153
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:24,200
undermine our capabilities undermine our capacity to actually land here and be

154
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:32,400
mindful of what's happening and this hesitation this wavering this vacillation it gets in the

155
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,000
way it gets in the way of practice and we end up not really going

156
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,920
anywhere or it's not so much that the purpose of meditation is to get

157
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,599
somewhere in particular even though we do have this model of uh development but

158
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:56,400
instead there's a feeling of spinning one's wheels or just going into circles

159
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,440
cuz we're lost and endless speculation or endlessly trying to decide which way to

160
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:12,040
go and the Buddha he used a simile to uh describe this as um crossing a

161
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:18,440
desert and I in my imagination it's a desert that's with these giant sand

162
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:25,720
dunes like nothing but sand dunes and maybe it's windy so it's kind of like hard to walk

163
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:31,119
through right you know sand dunes are not so easy to walk and because it's

164
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:38,040
windy when you look behind there are no Footprints so your Footprints are getting washed away and because it say

165
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:44,599
sandunes there aren't any um landmarks so you feel lost like you

166
00:36:44,599 --> 00:36:50,520
don't know which direction to go it's not clear where you've been and it's not

167
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:57,160
clear where you're going and it's this uncomfortable experience to everywhere we look is just

168
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:04,240
more sand more sand which is really

169
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:11,280
uncomfortable but if we pay a little bit closer attention we can see that this

170
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:17,319
doubt vcha is simply a loose collection of a

171
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:25,720
certain family of thoughts that aren't onward leading but are going round and round so this doubt

172
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:32,359
is just to maybe like um drive home this point because when we use this word

173
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:39,319
doubt we might think well of course does this mean that we have to believe everything we shouldn't have doubt and

174
00:37:39,319 --> 00:37:45,000
that's not what we're saying we're talking to about the doubt where it's

175
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,880
this uh not clear where to go next maybe even unclear where you are now and no

176
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,200
sense of anything that's onward leading or um sense of something that might be

177
00:37:56,200 --> 00:38:01,960
supportive because sometimes to be sure doubt is

178
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:07,680
healthy doubt is helpful in the same way that we might

179
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,599
have this idea H the price of this object seems too good to be true what's

180
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,400
the catch right that's a healthy type type of doubt that we have in our daily

181
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,920
life but it's this part what's the catch that we ask

182
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:32,400
ourselves and then we try to find it we read the footnotes we look at okay is it this

183
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,599
amount of money once or is it do I have to pay that monthly or what was there a

184
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:43,960
catch maybe I can never uh uh unsubscribe or I can never return it or

185
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:50,200
you know whatever it is this idea like what's the catch so we look more closely

186
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:58,160
to see okay what's What's Happening Here We engage with what uh seems to not be

187
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:04,720
quite right we investigate in the same way we don't

188
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:12,440
believe or disbelieve something simply because somebody told us but often we hold

189
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:18,440
things true provisionally like and we do maybe a quick mental check or maybe it's

190
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:24,200
not even mental it's just maybe it's somatic as well as mental like H is this

191
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,359
consistent with my experience

192
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,760
is do what do other wise people people that I have respect for and that I

193
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:40,079
believe um have some wisdom or some knowledge on this topic what do they say

194
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,000
about it so it's not that we have to believe or disbelieve but just to

195
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:53,000
investigate a little bit more and this is very healthy this is

196
00:39:53,000 --> 00:40:00,760
very helpful to be sure Buddhist practice is is not about just adopting a certain

197
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:06,760
amount of beliefs and there you go that's all it is certainly in especially

198
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,079
there's a emphasis in this tradition of Buddhism of um practice practice

199
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:17,119
practice some meditation practice this being mindful some concentration

200
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:23,079
practice getting settled loving kindness practice softening the

201
00:40:23,599 --> 00:40:31,200
heart and then with practice things unfold and we start to learn and understand things

202
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:38,960
differently and this healthy doubt asks the question does this

203
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:46,160
teaching and does this practice help lesson Dua does it help uh free the

204
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:51,839
mind with this recognition that really the answer how we can really know it for

205
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:58,960
ourself is to actually do the practice run the experiment and actually do it

206
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,760
we can also maybe read what other people have to say about it there is no shortage of Dharma books these

207
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:13,880
days we can talk to a teacher we can listen to a Dharma talk we can have a

208
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:19,440
what we call kalamita friends spiritual friends other people that have a practice that we can

209
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:25,000
talk with but sometimes this doubt is

210
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,119
unhealthy and unhelpful and that's what I'd like to talk a little bit more

211
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:38,280
about this when we're lost and stuck just going around and around teaching um

212
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:44,720
asking questions and it's maybe less asking specific questions and more just

213
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:51,319
wondering are these teachings from so long ago is it really relevant thousands

214
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:56,480
of years ago and and we can get stuck in this kind of

215
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,680
like endless conjecture or this endless speculation and it takes it takes us

216
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:08,039
away from the experience before it teaches us

217
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:16,319
anything and in some way having this kind of speculation also supports a

218
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:21,920
indecision which can um support a habit of undermining

219
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:28,720
ourselves so it's also just exhausting to always be wondering and

220
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:35,280
not to actually settle down and try the practice instead of trying to figure it out and wondering

221
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:41,520
things okay so how can we practice with this when we see that it's

222
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:51,280
arising maybe first I'll say as doubt is rarely recognized as doubt

223
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:57,440
initially so often we can say some of the instructions are

224
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:05,160
for other hindrances or for other experiences or just to recognize that hindrance or that experience but doubt

225
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,880
is a little bit difficult to recognize so instead we might

226
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:17,559
say we might recognize the hesitation recognize the vacillation recognize the

227
00:43:17,559 --> 00:43:24,280
indecision recognize the confusion and recognize the way in which

228
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:32,240
we might be in a debate with ourselves of uh about this practice or which practice we should do or which Dharma

229
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,920
talk we should listen to or something like that so just notice that the

230
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:44,200
vacillation the hesitation the maybe some

231
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:53,480
confusion and as best we can can we just allow that experience to be

232
00:43:53,480 --> 00:44:02,440
there without making it go away or without um allowing all our aversion to

233
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:08,480
rise up but can in the best as best we can can we allow it to be there and one

234
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,520
way to support allow it to be there is first I'll maybe I'll offer this that if

235
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,559
we have this sense of confusion like I'm

236
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,760
confused just to even say I'm confused is to recognize that you're confused and

237
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:35,079
then you're no longer confused you're not confused you know that confusion is present and then that can shift uh the

238
00:44:35,079 --> 00:44:41,359
experience just being with what's obvious and maybe we might recognize

239
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:49,200
that with this vacillation hesitation confusion speculation endless speculation there's also some

240
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:56,599
restlessness right it's the opposite of being settled right it doesn't support being settled so maybe we just recognize

241
00:44:56,599 --> 00:45:03,920
that oh the body feels like it wants to run up or jump up and run away and the mind is

242
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:11,240
running all around or something like this so we can maybe feel the

243
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:17,720
uncomfortableness like the uneasiness I'm like wiggling in my seat maybe that's has that kind of a

244
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:24,359
feeling or maybe there's this heaviness so in this way we could feel it in the

245
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:31,280
body heaviness wanting to get up and run away or this

246
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:37,559
uh maybe a yeah I I'll offer those we each have our own idea maybe there's a s

247
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:43,000
like buzzing in the head this kind of this electric feeling

248
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,839
or something like this maybe it'll just remind us that that's the first Foundation of mindfulness right just to

249
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:56,280
be with the sensations in the body so in this way just doing this recognizing

250
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:05,319
turning towards what's obvious if it's helpful using some labels buzziness tingling heaviness

251
00:46:05,319 --> 00:46:11,319
whatever it might be and there we are we're back into practice it doesn't mean that the

252
00:46:11,319 --> 00:46:16,680
thoughts won't arise again and maybe we'll get lost but then we can just

253
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:23,200
notice what it is again and be with that experience sometimes it can be helpful

254
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:30,440
if that isn't sufficient to remember thoughts are just

255
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:37,520
thoughts they're just thoughts and then we might actually have a just a gentle

256
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:46,960
inquiry what's the difference between a thought and a memory of a

257
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:53,079
thought are they the same is remembering the thought it's still a mental event

258
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:59,160
and and the reason why I'm asking this is just maybe to take some of the

259
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:04,520
substantiality that we might attribute to thoughts away to see like wait if a

260
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:12,160
memory of a thought is not different than a thought then you know then they somehow take some of their Authority

261
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:17,440
away and just to recognize okay we're having a lot of

262
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:23,960
thoughts and maybe to remind ourselves they're just thoughts they arise and

263
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,838
pass away just like everything else

264
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:37,440
and maybe we can also recognize that this is a mind when that's happening the

265
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,720
mind is experiencing vacillation restlessness hesitation

266
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,920
or and just recognize oh yeah the mind is

267
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:54,200
spinning in some kind of way that could be the third Foundation

268
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:59,240
of mindfulness you might recognize oh this is

269
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:06,520
doubt that would be the fourth Foundation of mindfulness recognizing a hindrance so in all these ways just kind

270
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:12,559
of like recognizing and being with the experience whether it's the bodily experience whether it's the quality of

271
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:20,400
the mind or it's just recognizing specific that thoughts arise can help bring us back to the practice and can

272
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:26,800
disrupt some of the momentum that we might have with all this thinking

273
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:33,839
but it might be that there is tremendous momentum maybe we have a this doubt is

274
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:39,720
showing up in our daily lives and with indecision and not being able to make

275
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:46,720
decisions for me I'll say that this um kind of doubt kind of shows up in when

276
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:53,680
I'm driving should I go this way well no maybe I should go that way oh but then the traffic but it might be shorter okay

277
00:48:53,680 --> 00:49:00,280
well at this time okay maybe I'll go there and some how I feel like I can't decide whether I should go this way or

278
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:07,440
that way this route or another route so there can be uh a more that we

279
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:13,000
could take that literally or maybe figuratively should I go this way or this other

280
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:18,880
way and if just recognizing what's happening and being with what's happening isn't enough to kind of like

281
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:25,640
undermine and interrupt the momentum then we can apply some antidotes can be a little bit more

282
00:49:25,640 --> 00:49:35,400
active about that and one is we could do this gentle

283
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:41,160
inquiry was there an uncomfortable experience that started

284
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:45,680
this whole Cascade of

285
00:49:47,559 --> 00:49:52,720
thinking or is there a view that I'm holding that things should be a a

286
00:49:52,720 --> 00:50:00,880
certain way that they have to be just right so this way it's a type of

287
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:07,359
investigation and investigation is the antidote to

288
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:13,720
doubt some religious Traditions have faith as antidote and this tradition

289
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:22,480
investigation is the antidote if you feel unsure do what you can to see what helps

290
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:28,280
you feel more sure talk to people read

291
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:35,400
or just investigate your experience so when we're on the cushion we could just do this gentle

292
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:43,240
inquiry like maybe unpack The Experience like okay I can see that I have this

293
00:50:43,240 --> 00:50:49,880
underlying view that things need to be just right and or I can see that this whole

294
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:55,559
thing started because yeah I'm feeling a little Restless all day I've been a little bit

295
00:50:55,559 --> 00:51:01,119
Restless or oh all day I've been really tired and have this sloth and torper

296
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:07,400
and now I'm then it just started the this uncomfortable experience met the

297
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:14,240
inner critic they got together and they kind of came up with these uh sayings like oh I can't do it or or this

298
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:20,440
practice I'm not sure this practice works so to do a little bit of Investigation to unpack like how did you

299
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:27,240
get here so that could be maybe a little bit more actively um getting being involved

300
00:51:27,240 --> 00:51:34,319
with the experience we might also gently inquire is there fear underneath this

301
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:42,200
sometimes there's fear that's really fueling our

302
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:48,799
doubt without this turning into yet another like big giant project but a

303
00:51:48,799 --> 00:51:55,000
gentle inquiry like dropping in the question opening up to the question and

304
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:01,079
then feeling into the answer so not so much like thinking our way to the answer

305
00:52:01,079 --> 00:52:06,119
of course thinking is involved but feeling our way to the answer right we

306
00:52:06,119 --> 00:52:13,720
don't want to just create the conditions in which we're just thinking thinking thinking wondering wondering wondering trying to figure it out but can we do an

307
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:20,599
inquiry in which we can feel our way we can drop in a

308
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:29,359
question and then open up and listen for an answer so that's one an antidote is to

309
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:37,200
investigate another antidote is to openly inquire to ask ourselves what do

310
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:44,480
I have confidence in what do I know about this practice

311
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,680
what do I know about what I'm capable of doing I have sat here during a

312
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:56,559
meditation period before this practice has brought some

313
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:03,960
subtleness some ease some insights I have heard things from a

314
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:11,280
teacher that really resonated with me and made a difference I do know people who are

315
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:18,880
Buddhist practitioners who seem to be moving in the world without causing harm to others

316
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:25,799
or not very much harm so we might just spend a little time reflecting what do I have

317
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:33,640
confidence in kind of like interrupt this vacillation and what do we know from our

318
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:41,319
experience what is uplifting what can support us maybe we know that meditation

319
00:53:41,319 --> 00:53:46,400
sessions don't end necessarily the way they begin so if we find ourselves

320
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:52,559
caught in this vacillation or hesitation doesn't mean that we're going to have it for the whole rest of the period

321
00:53:52,559 --> 00:53:56,240
meditation session

322
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:05,880
another way to work with doubt is to called apply what's called wise

323
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:12,119
attention yanis so Manas Sakara is the poly for this I say those words because

324
00:54:12,119 --> 00:54:17,640
I just like the way that they sound and the Buddha talks about this this is what

325
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:23,280
the Buddha says as an antidote for doubt there's an excerpt from

326
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:29,359
auta and the Buddha says there are things that are the basis for

327
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:36,760
doubt frequently giving careless attention is the nutriment for the

328
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:41,799
arising of unrisen doubt and for the increase of

329
00:54:41,799 --> 00:54:49,599
and expansion of doubt that has arisen so careless attention gives rise to doubt and if

330
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:56,440
Doubt's already there careless attention makes there be more doubt

331
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:01,839
and then continues and what is the den nourishment you know it's kind of a

332
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:07,200
clunky translation if we're going to say what is the nourishment of uh doubt in

333
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:14,760
poly it's just uh the opposite of nourishment so this translator is doing Den nourishment if we were say the word

334
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:24,119
starvation that just I don't know to my ear sounds cruel or something so we'll

335
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:29,200
use this word Den nourishment and what so the Buddha continues in the

336
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:35,520
suta and what is the den nourishment that prevents doubt from arising and

337
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:41,039
when doubt has already Arisen um prevents it from increasing and

338
00:55:41,039 --> 00:55:49,079
expanding there are wholesome and UNH wholesome states there are blamable and blameless

339
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:57,079
states there are inferior and Superior states there are dark and bright St

340
00:55:57,079 --> 00:56:02,799
States frequently giving careful attention to these is the den

341
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:08,480
nourishment that prevents doubt from arising and if doubt has already Arisen

342
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:16,520
to prevent doubt from increasing and expanding so recognizing oh wholesome

343
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:24,039
and UNH wholesome cusa and ausa helpful and unhelpful blamable and

344
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:31,799
blameless inferior and Superior dark and bright so to help so wise attention is

345
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:39,960
to bring in what we know from our practice from our lives like oh yeah this is helpful this isn't helpful to

346
00:56:39,960 --> 00:56:46,319
use some discernment to pay attention to those things

347
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:54,400
that are a support for practice if we are having feeling greedy

348
00:56:54,400 --> 00:57:01,359
or a lot of Desire or something that's um and that's getting in the way of our

349
00:57:01,359 --> 00:57:06,960
practice in our life we don't spend all our time looking at photos of those

350
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:12,160
things that we want we don't uh spend

351
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:17,760
imagining all those things that we want we don't like fuel the desire by always

352
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:27,079
bringing the objects of desire to mind or in the visual field or hearing them or whatever so why is attention is to

353
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:32,760
pay attention to what's supportive for us and to bring in mind what do we know

354
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:39,520
from the teachings that we have confidence in about what's wise and what's not wise

355
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:48,520
what's helpful and what's not helpful and then if we still if we have

356
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:54,000
paid attention to the experience of this vacillation and hesitation we've brought

357
00:57:54,000 --> 00:58:01,240
in antidotes and we still find oursel completely caught up and filled with

358
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:08,039
doubt one uh thing that we might do is to do something for somebody

359
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:14,280
else be generous with words [Music]

360
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:20,760
actions effort help somebody else do something for somebody else and in this

361
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:28,200
way it can help really soften and interrupt this kind of vacillation that we find ourselves El in and then it just

362
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:33,680
creates the conditions for something else to unfold if we were to do something for

363
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:42,319
somebody else so doubt is can be really pernicious it

364
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:47,680
can undermine our entire practice but there's a way in which we can be with it

365
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:54,880
and we can turn it instead of being an obstacle it can just be the object of

366
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,960
practice right instead of being a roadblock it can be a stepping stone to

367
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:05,960
just further practice it doesn't have to be a problem we can practice with

368
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:11,480
it in this way as we learn to practice with whatever

369
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:18,280
arising and this way can we be practice in such a way that it's a benefit for

370
00:59:18,280 --> 00:59:24,640
ourselves and a benefit for others thank you
