1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,000
so a really warm welcome

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,279
really warm welcome

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,519
it's quite something to be practicing

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,519
together i know i'm i'm actually in this

5
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:14,559
room by myself

6
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,880
but and perhaps you're in your room by

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,840
yourself too

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,840
but somehow we're practicing together

9
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:30,320
with the wonders of technology

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,238
so tonight i want to talk a little bit

11
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:33,520
about

12
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,960
these five strengths

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,960
five strengths and i'll start with

14
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,840
the story that comes from the suit and

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,480
the mahaparinibana suta

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,079
that is it's the suta that describes

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,480
the last few months of the buddha's life

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,920
and it's quite remarkable that the

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,960
buddha knows

20
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,480
when he's going to die and he proclaims

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,240
i'm going to die in three months

22
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,439
and then after he makes this

23
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,520
announcement he tells ananda his

24
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,400
attendant

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,880
to go assemble all the monks that are

26
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:13,920
nearby

27
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,799
all his followers and then the buddha

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,600
addresses them

29
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:23,280
and these aren't the last word he says

30
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,799
before he dies but um it's nearly

31
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:29,840
and he says those matters which i have

32
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,560
discovered and proclaimed

33
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,159
should be thoroughly learned by you

34
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,079
practiced developed and cultivated so

35
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,720
that this spiritual practice may endure

36
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,000
for a long time and be for the benefit

37
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,680
and happiness of the multitudes so he's

38
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,799
describing that what they have learned

39
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,000
what their practices

40
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,439
have been he wants this

41
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,479
his teachings to be

42
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,640
passed down through the generations to

43
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,759
endure for a long time

44
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,600
so they should practice them it's not

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,360
just so much memorizing all the

46
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,800
teachings but to

47
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,520
practice them

48
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,040
and then he says and what are those

49
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,599
matters

50
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:19,040
he says you know those matters which

51
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,959
i've discovered and proclaimed

52
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,840
and what are those matters and here he

53
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,000
summarizes his teachings

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,120
and he summarizes it in this way the

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,599
four foundations of mindfulness

56
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,200
the four right efforts the four basis of

57
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,400
success

58
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,840
the five faculties the five strengths

59
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,800
the seven factors of awakening and the

60
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,360
noble

61
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,000
eightfold path so it's a list

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,200
of lists and some people know this

63
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,760
as the 37 if you count up all those

64
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,959
different elements

65
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:59,840
there's 37 37 wings to awakening 37

66
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,800
aids to awakening sometimes also called

67
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,680
the seven

68
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:07,760
sets there's uh seven elements in this

69
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,480
in this list of lists and of course

70
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,319
there's a total of thirty seven things

71
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,200
so the

72
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:16,480
bori pakia de ma these

73
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,680
uh aids to awakening

74
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,920
so in that list there might be a few

75
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,000
things that you're not familiar with

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,239
foundations of mindfulness for right

77
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:28,239
efforts

78
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,200
five faculties seven factors of

79
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,360
awakening a noble eightfold path

80
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,840
plenty of dharma talks about these and

81
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:37,120
in the drama books

82
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,360
and certainly sprinkled throughout the

83
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,000
sutas but there's two that totally not

84
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,840
quite as well known one is the four

85
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,440
bases of success the

86
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,159
idi pada i'm not going to talk about

87
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,000
those this evening

88
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,959
i'll just say and a little aside those

89
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:53,280
are

90
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,920
really really difficult to translate and

91
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:58,080
to understand and even the commentaries

92
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
they're kind of like

93
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,640
there's such a different

94
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:05,920
interpretations of them and

95
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,280
it's not entirely certain that they

96
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,200
offer anything unique so that's often

97
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:09,920
why

98
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,280
teachers and scholars haven't really

99
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,959
fleshed those out and then the second

100
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,160
item in these

101
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,600
seven sets the five strengths

102
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,800
sometimes called the five powers

103
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
what are these

104
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,600
these are defined as the same

105
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,960
as the five faculties

106
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,919
that is faith energy mindfulness

107
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,400
concentration and wisdom

108
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,160
this list of five

109
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,320
i've given a number of dharma talks on

110
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,479
these and

111
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,800
um the first talk that i gave

112
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,880
was talking about when you cultivate

113
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,720
these five faculties you

114
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,759
slant slope and incline to nibbana in

115
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,120
the same way that the

116
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,240
ganges rivers slants slopes

117
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,280
and inclines towards the east

118
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,479
so kind of has this sense of

119
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,199
inevitability if you cultivate this and

120
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,560
it leads towards awakening

121
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,240
i gave a talk on like heedfulness

122
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,360
is or diligence is another way we might

123
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,240
understand it

124
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,600
is a key part in how to cultivate these

125
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,759
and one way we might understand this

126
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:30,000
list of the five faculties

127
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,759
and the five strengths

128
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,560
that begins with faith and ends with

129
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,120
wisdom

130
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,680
one way we might understand it it's the

131
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,520
progression of going from faith to

132
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,400
wisdom

133
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,520
passing through energy mindfulness and

134
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,600
concentration so using those as

135
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,479
tools to go from faith to wisdom

136
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,680
and i gave a talk on the importance of

137
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,520
balancing these different faculties

138
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,720
and in particular we can balance energy

139
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,639
and concentration this gusto we might

140
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,120
have or striving that we might have

141
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,240
has to be balanced with concentration

142
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,639
sometimes energy can be up and

143
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,600
concentration

144
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,000
can be down and is there a way that we

145
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,680
can have them work together

146
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,360
and then i gave a talk on the importance

147
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,960
of balancing faith and wisdom

148
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:31,199
not to be too much letting wisdom

149
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,520
slide into just knowledge accumulation

150
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:34,800
of knowledge

151
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,720
or faith lead to some dogmatism or

152
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,800
constriction and of course this

153
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,880
recognition that mindfulness

154
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,120
is the one that helps us to balance

155
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,560
energy and concentration

156
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,520
and faith and wisdom so now this is my

157
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:49,919
fifth

158
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,360
talk and this introducing this idea of

159
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:53,680
the

160
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,199
five strengths

161
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,080
of those seven sets that i introduced in

162
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,639
them

163
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,160
and then when the buddha is he's

164
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,560
summarizing his teachings

165
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,360
the five strengths the five powers are

166
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:09,919
mentioned

167
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,120
the least often

168
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,880
and for the most part they seem like

169
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,120
they're the same as the faculties so

170
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,199
why would what purpose do they serve and

171
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:22,720
perhaps it's why we don't hear about

172
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,840
them in

173
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:28,160
dharma talks and in dharma books

174
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,000
but here's a suta

175
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,160
that talks about what is the difference

176
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:38,319
between a faculty and a strength

177
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,400
and in the suta the buddha gives a

178
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,039
simile

179
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,560
of a river and he says suppose that

180
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,160
there's a river

181
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,599
and i'm paraphrasing now suppose there's

182
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,720
a river

183
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:55,039
and there's an island that's in the

184
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,120
middle of the river

185
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,560
and if you look one way you can see okay

186
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,919
the river splits and on one side

187
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:06,000
is part of the river and on the other

188
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,240
side of the island is another part

189
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,919
and then downstream they come back

190
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:12,319
together so you can see

191
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,319
where in this way if you look this way

192
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,960
this like maybe straight onto the island

193
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,759
you can see there's two streams of water

194
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,960
but if you look upstream

195
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,879
before where the island is you can see

196
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,840
there's one stream of water

197
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,839
so in the same way we can look at the

198
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,120
as these as these qualities

199
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,080
faith energy mindfulness concentration

200
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,120
as wisdom

201
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,399
as faculties or see them as strengths

202
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,519
depending on the way we look

203
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,800
depending on the perspective we take

204
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,720
for like are we looking straight on at

205
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,360
the island or are we looking upstream

206
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:59,920
or maybe even downstream for that way

207
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,959
so if we look at them as faculties we

208
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:03,920
can consider them

209
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,480
as something that needs to be developed

210
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,760
and cultivated

211
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,279
and certainly there's a lot of

212
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,760
talk or a lot of the teachings really

213
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,040
support this idea

214
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,000
that these are capacities that we have

215
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,800
but they can be

216
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,800
cultivated and developed in which they

217
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,480
might be

218
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,560
more perfected or come to fruition

219
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,000
or allowing them to blossom

220
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,200
show up in different ways so the

221
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:33,760
emphasis

222
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:37,440
is more on there's more to be done

223
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,600
they should be developed and cultivated

224
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,800
in contrast the strengths

225
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,959
or can we appreciate

226
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,000
what's already here what we've

227
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,240
already done and from this

228
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,360
standpoint from this frame of reference

229
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,800
we might be able to recognize that

230
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:09,279
because we have some faith

231
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,680
it's able to withstand its opposite that

232
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,000
is distrust

233
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,200
because we have energy

234
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,440
it's able to withstand some of its

235
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,880
opposite that is laziness

236
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,079
because we have mindfulness it's able to

237
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:26,959
withstand

238
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,839
some of its opposite that is

239
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,800
heedlessness

240
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,399
and because we have some degree of

241
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:36,560
concentration

242
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,600
we're able to withstand or over not to

243
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,640
be overcome by

244
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:45,120
some of its opposite that is distraction

245
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,360
and because we have some degree of

246
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,200
wisdom we're able to

247
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,000
not be overcome by confusion

248
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,360
it doesn't mean that distrust or

249
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,160
laziness

250
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,560
or heedlessness or distraction or

251
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,320
confusion never happen

252
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,120
it's just more the stance that we take

253
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,959
that is appreciating what is here

254
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:13,279
qualities that we already have

255
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,440
and what function they may be serving

256
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,320
how they might

257
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,519
be supporting us so often we

258
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:22,800
tend to be dismissive or ignore

259
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,480
those things that are cultivated and

260
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,959
developed and we tend to focus on

261
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,160
what we need what we should be doing or

262
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,279
what's not quite right

263
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,800
but what the buddha is pointing to here

264
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,959
is that these same qualities can be

265
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,800
viewed in different ways

266
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,839
something to be developed and not my

267
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:44,800
language

268
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,720
or something to be appreciated

269
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,360
and of course this brings to mind the

270
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,639
quote by

271
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,800
suzuki roshi which goes something like i

272
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,880
don't know what it is exactly

273
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,079
but the quote is you're perfect

274
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:03,680
just the way you are and

275
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,200
you could use a little improvement

276
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,079
from one perspective you're perfect

277
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:11,440
there's this

278
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,920
beauty and grace and perfection that we

279
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,560
all have

280
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:21,279
and not but and

281
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,760
maybe we could use a little improvement

282
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,360
so can we

283
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:28,800
hold both of these in our minds

284
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,800
can we appreciate both of these

285
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,760
sometimes it's very difficult because as

286
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,720
humans we have this negativity bias

287
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,600
we have this

288
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,600
and we have this um this word just

289
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,200
escaping me right now we have this

290
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,720
inclination

291
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,120
to look at what's wrong what needs to be

292
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,240
fixed and

293
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,880
of course we do of course we do i need

294
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:57,920
to coffee just

295
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:07,839
here just a moment here

296
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,760
yeah i just had a tickle in my throat

297
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,600
i'm not sick i just

298
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,959
had a little tickle in my throat

299
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,320
so we might have this inclination of

300
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,440
looking

301
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:31,120
at what needs to be better or somehow or

302
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:34,240
fixed or something like this

303
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:37,600
or we might be just

304
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,800
naturally or haven't have an inclination

305
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,399
where we tend to

306
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,040
notice that the glass is half empty or

307
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,880
we might notice that the glass is half

308
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,399
full we

309
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,160
i don't even know if it's really

310
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,720
possible to have a completely

311
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:00,240
neutral lens a neutral perspective

312
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,079
from that simple simile of what the

313
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,519
buddha taught

314
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,199
we're looking at the river one way and

315
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:07,279
we could see where it's split

316
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:10,800
and we can see the two streams of water

317
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,360
we look at it in another perspective and

318
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,160
we can see

319
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,279
where it's one stream of water but we're

320
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,320
always have one

321
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,880
at a perspective we can't see the stream

322
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,519
without

323
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,720
having a perspective

324
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,880
so we have a tendency to

325
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,680
when we have a tendency to lock onto

326
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,160
what's not quite right what needs to be

327
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,639
fixed what needs to be cultivated and

328
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,320
developed

329
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
sometimes we might use these types of

330
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,600
words as a

331
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:48,480
way to beat ourselves up a little bit

332
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,399
don't get me wrong i don't want us to

333
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,639
give let us all off the hook there are

334
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,199
things to be cultivated and developed

335
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,199
but can we notice that there's more

336
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,880
than just that there are things that

337
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,560
are that qualities that we already have

338
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:10,399
and that we can shift our perspective

339
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,880
and to see both to see the beauty and

340
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:18,160
perfection and to see

341
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,639
some work that night that might need to

342
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,279
be done

343
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,560
some room for improvement so to speak

344
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,519
often what happens if we have the

345
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,880
inclination to see

346
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,800
problems that's just the way that we

347
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,519
view the world is like just

348
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,360
one thing after another you know that

349
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,120
has to be fixed

350
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,279
then there might be a way in which we

351
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:42,399
are

352
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,639
seeing a perspective in which we might

353
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,959
be taking

354
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,320
which kind of uh increases the

355
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,440
problemness

356
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,040
so to speak of the experience

357
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:58,160
that is that if we see something that's

358
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,360
not quite right

359
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,839
there might be a sense of self that gets

360
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:04,320
reified that gets constricted that gets

361
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,240
solidified and

362
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:09,040
i have to be the one that fixes that

363
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,079
thing or

364
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:14,000
i have to fix this about myself or or

365
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,440
that person has to fix this thing and

366
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:19,120
there's kind of a way in which there's

367
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,560
this clumping or this narrowing down

368
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:25,199
around the sense of self either myself

369
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:25,759
or

370
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:29,519
some other self blaming them or blaming

371
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,160
ourselves

372
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,320
blame is a way in which we really often

373
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,360
can solidify

374
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,399
things to become kind of rigid in our

375
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,040
views

376
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,000
of ourselves or of others it's kind of

377
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,519
innocent

378
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,240
we're not meaning to harm anybody but

379
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:46,639
there's a way in which if we're

380
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,959
inclined to notice the way in which

381
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,839
things are problems

382
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:53,959
that goes along with kind of the

383
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:55,120
solidification

384
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:58,000
of a sense of self or a blame even

385
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,440
though it might be

386
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,720
kind of subtle and then

387
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,319
there might might be making more problem

388
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,558
than is needed for example

389
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:12,798
if we don't have the solidification

390
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:15,038
around a sense of self

391
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,480
then there might be more of an

392
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,199
opportunity to consider well what are

393
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,079
all the conditions that came together

394
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:25,438
that caused this event this experience

395
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:28,240
this happening

396
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,919
maybe i find myself

397
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:37,520
eating mindlessly cookie after cookie

398
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,160
after cookie

399
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,280
one way might be to view this or to

400
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,400
experience this

401
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:47,600
is to really kind of blame myself

402
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,080
diana you're always eating cookies

403
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,520
what's wrong with you you know it's not

404
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,600
good for you and there's kind of when

405
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:54,640
are you gonna

406
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,880
stop doing that you sh you know better

407
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,480
and you know there's a kind of this

408
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,080
blame that happens and it's all about

409
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:00,799
diana

410
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,679
and her not doing well around the

411
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:05,919
cookies

412
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:08,640
but there could also be there's a

413
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,640
certain relaxation around this idea that

414
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,480
there's a problem

415
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,960
there could be this recognition of well

416
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,600
okay you didn't have a

417
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,960
a proper lunch and you're feeling

418
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:24,240
tired didn't sleep well last night and

419
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
the cookies are right here on the

420
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,360
counter

421
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,679
and you're a little bit nervous about

422
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:30,720
what's going to happen

423
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:35,120
next so of course you ate the cookies

424
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,280
right so kind of pulling together some

425
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,400
of the conditions

426
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,039
so that we can see what's happening as

427
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,160
opposed to

428
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,160
like making a rigid sense of self

429
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,799
so in the same way can we appreciate

430
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,240
some of the qualities that we

431
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:58,240
have some of the strengths that we have

432
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:01,600
without having to make a strong sense of

433
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,720
self around it

434
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,919
and without having to only focus on the

435
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:08,720
problems

436
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,919
to be a not a glass half empty or

437
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,720
a glass half full but in order to have

438
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,799
the flexibility to see

439
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,919
yeah i can look at it this way it's half

440
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,120
empty and

441
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:24,000
there's a person or a self that's to

442
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
blame

443
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,080
i could look at it this other way that's

444
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,600
maybe a little bit delusional

445
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,840
and doesn't see that there's anything

446
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:32,640
that's a problem

447
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:35,760
maybe doesn't even pay attention but can

448
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,640
there be a third way

449
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,559
that can appreciate that the conditions

450
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,160
are coming together and

451
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:45,679
maybe there's a way in which there are

452
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,320
some of these qualities these faculties

453
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,080
that are

454
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:53,840
beautiful and are supporting and

455
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,520
maybe there's a little bit development

456
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,840
that can be done

457
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,039
you're perfect just the way you are and

458
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:07,840
you could use a little improvement

459
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,280
so this idea of this negativity bias of

460
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,919
course we have this you know

461
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:14,960
evolutionarily we

462
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,880
um are the

463
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:23,360
uh ancestor we are our ancestors

464
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:25,120
if they didn't take care of things that

465
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:26,960
were life-threatening of course then

466
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,000
they wouldn't have

467
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,440
passed their genes onto the next

468
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,679
generations and we wouldn't

469
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:35,200
have inherited them so of course there's

470
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:35,679
this

471
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,799
human tendency but

472
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,840
it's um i appreciate very much what rick

473
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,360
hansen says

474
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,360
about this idea about the negativity

475
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,280
bias that he

476
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:50,400
says that uh positive experiences or

477
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,200
maybe even appreciating ourselves a

478
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:53,919
little bit like

479
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:58,000
teflon it's actually difficult to do

480
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,919
the ways we've been socialized in a

481
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:03,200
little bit of our biology

482
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,159
so this idea of the strengths these five

483
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:06,880
strengths

484
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,159
faith energy mindfulness concentration

485
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:11,360
and wisdom

486
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:14,960
to appreciate when they are there

487
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,720
and to recognize that they might be

488
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,280
counteracting some of their opposites

489
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,960
that they are counteracting some of

490
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,280
their opposites

491
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:25,520
it takes a little bit effort so rick

492
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,520
hansen says that positive experiences

493
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:28,799
like teflon

494
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:32,559
they can just be wiped away

495
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,080
in contrast unpleasant negative

496
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,159
experiences are like velcro

497
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,400
we tend to stick to them and the mind

498
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,799
likes to ruminate and go over them

499
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,480
and this is often where kind of the

500
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,159
blame comes in

501
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,240
kind of like i can't believe he said

502
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,600
that i can't believe she

503
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,600
said that i can't believe they said that

504
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,760
i can't believe i said this

505
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,799
so something along those lines a way

506
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,919
in which there's

507
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,960
we can get sticky and can get stuck on

508
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:03,679
there and

509
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,679
find ourselves maybe going around and

510
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:08,158
around

511
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:12,720
so is there a way that we can recognize

512
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,080
when this is happening

513
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,200
and to allow both to be there allowed

514
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,159
this

515
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:20,880
to see the flexibly with it in a

516
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,679
flexible way

517
00:22:23,679 --> 00:22:26,080
both up the river so to speak and

518
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,200
straight on

519
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,480
when there's an island

520
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,880
so one way to view the

521
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,280
these 37 aids to awakening this seven

522
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:42,960
sets is that they're in numerical order

523
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,640
a couple of sets of four a couple of

524
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,640
sets of five one group of seven

525
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,679
and one group of eight

526
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:53,200
another way and to view it

527
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:56,400
is um as the path

528
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,760
that is it starts with mindfulness

529
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:03,520
and goes through effort and then these

530
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,760
bases of success which

531
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:09,840
are can be related to concentration

532
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:14,159
and then the faculties and the strengths

533
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:16,080
the seven factors of awakening and then

534
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,000
the eightfold path

535
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:20,400
so if we view it as a pattern as a

536
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,559
progression starting with mindfulness

537
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,640
and ending with the eightfold path and

538
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,000
maybe i'll say a little thing here is

539
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
the noble eightfold path

540
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,240
which also can be translated as the

541
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,960
eightfold path of the noble ones

542
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:36,320
and there's is a valid way we might

543
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,919
interpret that as

544
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:40,480
the noble eightfold path is just the

545
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:42,159
expression

546
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,200
of what it awakened people

547
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,799
do how they are in the world

548
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,880
so if we use that model of the 37

549
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:56,320
aids to awakening then the

550
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,360
strengths come after the faculties in

551
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,159
that list

552
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,400
that is it's after there's a certain

553
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,600
amount of

554
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,960
cultivation development of the faculties

555
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,080
then the strengths

556
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,440
come on board and are as a support and

557
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,159
are really flowering and blossoming and

558
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,520
leading to the

559
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:20,720
factors of awakening

560
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,559
so what isn't about

561
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:27,279
the faculties leading into this

562
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,480
strengths

563
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,679
maybe it's when faith in our own

564
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,720
capacity

565
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,159
and in this path of practice

566
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:39,919
is really strong faith is one of these

567
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:42,240
elements that is not in any the other of

568
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,960
these seven

569
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,159
sets we see

570
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,760
energy mindfulness concentration and

571
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,960
wisdom and some of the other sets but

572
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,240
faith is the one that's unique

573
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,919
maybe when we use that as a strength

574
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,679
it's a way in that it really can support

575
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,559
our awakening

576
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:10,159
so our inner critics may sometimes

577
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,880
rise up and say we shouldn't think about

578
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,080
our strengths

579
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:16,000
we should really just be working on what

580
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:19,120
needs to be developed and cultivated and

581
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,200
have to do better or strive do more

582
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,360
but i think that the buddha is pointing

583
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:26,960
to here

584
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,240
that the strengths we to recognize what

585
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:30,640
we

586
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:33,120
already have capacities that we already

587
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,760
have

588
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,760
and how they may be operating in our

589
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:38,640
lives is a support

590
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,159
for awakening as a support towards

591
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:45,679
finding greater ease greater freedom

592
00:25:45,679 --> 00:25:50,159
greater peace and not just for ourselves

593
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:53,039
for others so that we can be a support

594
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,759
for others

595
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,960
so may you find

596
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:02,720
an opportunity to notice that we can

597
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,480
be flexible in our view we don't always

598
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:07,840
have to be

599
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,400
focusing on what needs to be done what

600
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,520
isn't quite right

601
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,159
we can also notice and appreciate what

602
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,760
is working

603
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,760
what is doing okay so that we might help

604
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:20,720
others

605
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,919
so might you have an opportunity to

606
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:26,640
exercise to use this flexibility of you

607
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:29,760
this flexible view

608
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:39,120
thank you
