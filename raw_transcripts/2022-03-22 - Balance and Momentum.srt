1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,799
good evening

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,440
and welcome to imc it was a pleasure as i

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:17,039
entered this evening to hear one person who's here comment that this was the first time they've been

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:23,039
at imc in person and what a pleasure that is

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:29,119
my name is david david laurie very happy to be here sitting in for gil

6
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:34,399
tonight and uh

7
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,480
sitting in with you sitting sharing in the dharma together

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,920
i had intended to guide the meditation lightly in the beginning

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,719
and then as i looked around at people settling into meditation i i i just felt that

10
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,640
that would be superfluous tonight sort of very clear that people were

11
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:07,200
settling in and finding finding some nice stillness a quiet

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,159
evening not too many trains passing not too much traffic or sounds of

13
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,479
sounds of the street supportive evening what the buddha might call an auspicious

14
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,280
and auspicious evening so

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,000
gil sometimes comments that in the practice we balance

16
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,119
effort and allowing and if you've heard gil say this you may

17
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,399
have also heard gil uh talk about efforting and allowing just to make

18
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,720
a couple para parallel verbs and i thought that this evening we might

19
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:58,479
explore a little bit some of the uh some of the nuances of

20
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,560
this balancing effort and allowing in the practice

21
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:10,720
had i guided the meditation i i might have because i sometimes do

22
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,120
bring attention to how even in the uh even in the initial

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,920
entry into the meditative space even in some of the uh most foundational

24
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,360
instructions in our tradition there's a there's this balancing

25
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:35,440
there's a balancing and there's a rebalancing when we close our eyes for example if we

26
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:44,080
close our eyes in meditation we we rebalance we sort of re-um

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,440
refined our inner life among all the

28
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,360
all the noise and activity of the world we engage in with our eyes open

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,040
when we bring our eyes down in the meditation our attention tends to turn come inward

30
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:11,440
and downward a bit and we find some aspect of what's happening in the inner world in our inner life

31
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:17,840
when we follow the one of the essential instructions of our

32
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:23,599
practice when we find that the minds become sort of contracted around something

33
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:30,239
when we find that the mind has wandered off when we find ourselves in daydream

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,440
solving problems searching solutions remembering thinking about other people thinking about

35
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,480
ourselves you know the places the mind goes when it's being a mind

36
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,080
good and useful places um at times

37
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,360
when we bring our attention back gently without hurry to the to here and now

38
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:00,560
maybe using the breath as our anchor returning our attention

39
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,879
to the here and now we're doing this rebalancing we're sort of you could say adding a

40
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:13,360
little effort into the mix into a mix that maybe had become a little unfocused or a little

41
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,519
a little tangled a little caught up a little distracted

42
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,600
so what i'd like to do is talk about this just a little bit with a little more detail having sort of set the stage

43
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:36,000
i'd like to share a suit of one of the buddhist discourses this one from the on guitar

44
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,560
nikaya the collection of discourses ordered by number

45
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:49,680
and spend a little time thinking about how

46
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:56,720
when we find ourselves maybe pitched a little far in the direction of effort

47
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,840
a little too overly engaged with various things that come up in our experience

48
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:09,919
we could bring a little additional ease in or maybe maybe more importantly when we

49
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,280
find ourselves a little settling into the contentment that can come with meditation

50
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,880
settling into the ease getting a little foggy fuzzy a little unclear a little

51
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,680
unfocused how we might bring a little bit of uh um maybe a little bit of edge a little

52
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,840
bit of uh attentive curiosity back into the practice

53
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:40,240
part of the reason i emphasize that is we emphasize the other a lot frequently we talk about what to do with the mind

54
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:46,080
that's overly busy sometimes we um i think it's useful to look at what we

55
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:52,720
do when the mind gets foggy day dreamy or when in the larger picture of our practice we

56
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,759
find ourselves becoming complacent or maybe just sort of going along with what

57
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,199
can be a very pleasant flow of a meditation practice

58
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,600
um

59
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,479
along with this along with this balancing

60
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:22,560
there's also a momentum of practice and a lot of times the momentum of

61
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:30,720
practice is is closely related to this balance when we find ourselves in a in a

62
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,479
a time in practice or a place in the meditation where we

63
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,520
feel a strong leaning toward being more awake in our lives

64
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:46,960
it can be fairly easy to adjust the balance to come back to center to come

65
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:55,120
back to the place where effort and ease effort and allowing are nicely balanced

66
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,160
and so too this this attention to momentum

67
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:07,198
uh can be can be beneficial to the practice supportive of the practice

68
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:14,639
sometimes you'll hear gil and other teachers andrea

69
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:20,560
the co-guiding teacher here use metaphors to talk about um

70
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:27,039
balance and practice and very commonly the metaphor of riding a bicycle is used

71
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:33,039
andrea sometimes uses the metaphor of using a kick scooter

72
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,960
i don't know how many people grew up using kick scooters one thing i found about these metaphors

73
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:44,720
is that they're a little culturally specific i grew up riding a bike i guess i had a scooter

74
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:51,280
but not everybody did and some of the communities i teach in bicycle riding and scooter kicking are not actually

75
00:07:51,280 --> 00:08:00,319
part of everybody's experience so i've been trying to find other other metaphors that might be useful

76
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:06,000
the ones i've come up with tonight for some reason are standing and walking

77
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:12,080
i recognize that even these aren't universally human experiences and you know don't want to

78
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:17,199
would like to be as inclusive as possible but let me give an example from each of

79
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:24,080
these riding a bike we're going to start with but when you're riding a bike

80
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:31,440
particularly if you've become good at it not maybe when you're first learning we do this we do this rebalancing

81
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:39,120
extremely um as if it were as

82
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:45,279
um without real effort or attention because it's become so second nature

83
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:50,880
we we find that we can tip back to balance really without

84
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,240
thinking about it and similarly with the scooter

85
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:02,080
um if again and again my memory of the scooter is less distinct than the bicycle

86
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:09,360
a very similar thing when you're when it when once you've learned it's you could say it's like riding a bike

87
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,800
that is once you've become adept at it maintaining your momentum maintaining

88
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:22,200
your balance is second nature uh

89
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,240
standing and walking are similar and if you do any standing meditation which i do quite a bit

90
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,200
um you can um just enjoy the body's ability to balance without without thinking

91
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:41,040
about it if you want to experience it experience that

92
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:47,920
you can sometimes bring greater attention to it by closing the eyes for a period of time and doing it without a support

93
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:52,959
noticing the bodies this incredibly complicated little orchestrated uh

94
00:09:52,959 --> 00:10:01,040
second nature maintaining balance maintaining a balance between effort and allowing

95
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,320
the um these two

96
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:15,200
themes of balance and momentum are can be applied to any scale of the

97
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,240
practice that we that we choose it can be true

98
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:26,640
in tonight's sit and it can be true in almost any portion of the set

99
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,839
that as we meditate we find the mind moves off into fogginess or gets caught up in something that needs doing before

100
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:39,040
tomorrow morning or gets distracted by bodily sensation perhaps we're hungry or

101
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,720
overly full or sleepy

102
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:50,560
we bring it back to greater alertness and um

103
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:56,640
that's happening at this kind of microscale in the course of a 45 minute sit that's going to happen many times

104
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,279
this is a natural part of the meditation it's important to point out that we don't just establish balance as if it

105
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:08,320
were autopilot and then it's set for the rest

106
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:13,440
of the evening or the rest of our practice life but rather it's something we constantly

107
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:19,600
rebalance just like on a bicycle just like on a scooter just like standing or walking

108
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:27,200
the balance is constantly being adjusted constantly being reasserted constantly being

109
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:34,480
refound it also works on the on the scale of the

110
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:41,279
whole practice where um bringing ourselves back periodically in touch with our

111
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,839
fundamental intentions for the practice balances a tendency to over time

112
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:54,800
sort of take it for granted maybe not be as focused in it kind of frequently settle into the pleasantness

113
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,880
of it if we find it largely pleasant and lose a little bit of the um

114
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:07,200
the uh sort of the maybe the growing edge or where the the edge of the practice is where

115
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,880
there's something still to be discovered of interest something that may be

116
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:20,399
disturbing sometimes when there's a sense of stasis or static-ness in the practice

117
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:28,639
there's some avoidance something that we maybe have a little aversion to seeing or something that's frightening

118
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:36,959
so it can work from this very intimate scale a very micro scale of a of a portion of a sit it can work on the

119
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,320
scale of the of the whole practice i said earlier that

120
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,720
one thing uh i think we tend to focus a lot on the busy mind the mind that gets caught up in things

121
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,639
distracted by things lost in things wanders off and sometimes don't

122
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,320
maybe don't look as closely at the mind that that daydreams or that gets fuzzy and

123
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:07,519
unfocused and this can be particularly something uh in the evening and i

124
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:13,040
thought of this in particular because this is a rather late time for me to sit

125
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:20,480
and um i had a little a little uh cup of tea beforehand so that i wouldn't

126
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:27,519
nod nod off during an evening meditation but i wanted to

127
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:35,120
share with you a suita that talks about dozing off and

128
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:41,839
in which the buddha gives one of his principal disciples some advice about what to do

129
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,880
when one finds one's mind becoming unfocused unclear

130
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,480
daydreamy and perhaps dozing off

131
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:59,279
it's uh it's a suita that provides some tips that we can apply to the micro level to like what to do in meditation

132
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:04,959
if you find yourself dozing off sometimes which possibly we all have from time to time

133
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,320
or if on the larger scale we find ourselves becoming a little complacent

134
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:15,839
in our practice again sometimes we focus on over striving in

135
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:22,320
the practice sometimes we get a little bit i don't know if lazy's the right word

136
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:28,399
sounds sort of pejorative but a little complacent little a little maybe overly content

137
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,760
this suta tells us i think provides some good good and wise tips

138
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:39,519
about sort of that work at both these levels so let me read it and i'm going to read

139
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:46,000
it selectively and then go back and make a couple comments about it so this is uh

140
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:51,040
this is uh for those following at home this is from the ungutara nikaya from

141
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:58,399
the book of sevens and it's the 61st suta in the book of seven so i'm going

142
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:04,639
to turn that kaya 761 and it's called appropriately dozing

143
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:10,639
and i'm gonna as i read it i'm gonna correct for gender and i typically correct for

144
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:16,880
some a lot of the discourses as you know are shared with monastic followers of the buddha and sometimes a little

145
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,440
correction for lay practitioners is useful in this case i think it works fine as it is

146
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:29,040
it begins as so many suttas does with the phrase thus have i heard

147
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:36,639
on one occasion the blessed one the buddha was dwelling among the bhagas at sum summary era in the deer park at

148
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:42,399
besakala grove and on this occasion the venerable maha

149
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:49,199
mogalana was sitting in meditation and dozing off and some of you know may know that

150
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:55,199
mogallana maha mogulana mogalana the great is one of the buddha's principal

151
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,120
followers um equal to saruputa in his uh

152
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:07,040
his importance in the early practice community so here we have a senior practitioner

153
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,199
somebody who's practiced a lot sitting and dozing and the buddha

154
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:20,399
notices this that in the back of the room could be nancy but it's maha maha nancy

155
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:25,440
who has dozed often the teacher has noticed and uh

156
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:31,360
approaches and says are you dozing mogallana have you been dozing off sitting in meditation

157
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:39,839
meditation and mogallana confesses he doesn't confess it doesn't say that he just says yes ponte yes teacher

158
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,759
the buddha says because we're in the book of sevens he gives seven tips

159
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,440
seven ideas seven maybe practice suggestions as a as a teacher might

160
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:57,600
mogalana you could attend uh you could have

161
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,480
mogulana perhaps you should try not attending or cultivating the object that you were

162
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:10,000
attending to when you became drowsy perhaps by this means it would be

163
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,438
possible that your drowsiness will be abandoned if this doesn't work

164
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:24,160
if you're unable to abandon your drowsiness in this way you could ponder examine and mentally

165
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,840
inspect the dhamma as you have heard it and learned it then perhaps by this means your drowsiness will be

166
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,559
abandoned if this doesn't work if you find yourself unable to abandon

167
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:42,160
your drowsiness with this technique you could recite in detail the dumma as

168
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:47,200
you have heard it and learned it and perhaps by this means

169
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,840
it is possible that your drowsiness will be abandoned

170
00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:00,000
if this doesn't work you could pull both your ears and rub

171
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:07,360
your limbs with your hands and perhaps by this means

172
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:13,600
abandon your drowsiness if this doesn't work

173
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:19,280
you should get up from your seat rub your eyes with water look around in all directions

174
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,559
look up at the constellations and stars and by this means

175
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:29,720
it's possible that your drowsiness will be abandoned

176
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:36,320
if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in this way you should attend to the perception of

177
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:44,000
light you should undertake the perception of day thus as by day so at night and as

178
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,799
as at night so by day and thus with a mind that is open and uncovered you should develop a mind

179
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:57,919
imbued with luminosity with light and by this means possibly your

180
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,880
drowsiness will be abandoned if this fails

181
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:11,919
you can undertake the exercise of walking meditation walking back and forth perceiving what is behind you and

182
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:18,720
what is in front with your sense faculties drawn in and your mind collected

183
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:25,679
and by this means possibly your drowsiness will be abandoned

184
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:32,080
and then finally there's one more and this is the punchline he says but if you cannot abandon your drowsiness in any of

185
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:38,960
these ways take a nap he doesn't say it quite like that but if

186
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:45,600
you cannot abound in your drowsiness in these ways you should lie down on your right side in the lion's posture

187
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,640
with one foot overlapping the other mindful clearly comprehending and noting

188
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,240
in your mind the idea of rising when you awaken get up quickly

189
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:01,600
and think i won't be intent on the pleasure of rest the pleasure of sleep

190
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:08,480
but rather return to practice it is in this way mogallana that you should train yourself

191
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,400
so there's a lovely set of instructions and tips here presented in

192
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:21,120
this very supportive way that i think um

193
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,159
provide a sense that that there's nothing unusual or

194
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:31,600
in this kind of experience nothing wrong has happened nothing's gone wrong in the meditation the

195
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:39,919
practitioner hasn't done anything wrong but rather that one of the natural aspects of our practice is

196
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:46,240
this kind of occasional drowsiness if we're thinking about it at that small scale

197
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:53,039
or complacency or lack of focus in the practice on a maybe on a broader scale

198
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:59,200
and we can go back and just look at a few of these i want to make sure to leave some time to uh for people to ask

199
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:05,440
questions or raise uh share reflections or anything else

200
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,679
um but the first one here uh you shouldn't you should not attend to or cultivate

201
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:16,880
the object that you're attending to when you became drowsy very interesting suggestion

202
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:23,120
we we tend in our practice to get very um used to a particular object and yet as

203
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:28,400
we know from for example the sati patana suta the suta in

204
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:34,880
various ways and various approaches to establishing mindful attention in the here and now that there are a whole host

205
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:39,919
of practices a whole host of objects a whole host of

206
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,360
ways to cultivate the practice of mindful attention the practice of open

207
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,720
uh awareness and it's an interesting suggestion that

208
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:56,480
if drowsiness is there perhaps shifting your attention in various ways

209
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:02,400
can be a useful remedy or useful way to spark a little bit of greater alertness

210
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,120
in the practice

211
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:15,520
even with drowsiness sometimes there can be a great a great deal of kind of

212
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:24,799
very sort of small or laser focus on the

213
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:30,000
breath and it can be useful to broaden the focus

214
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:37,360
so i think there are many ways that that that this advice could be brought into play

215
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:42,720
it may also be useful in the broader scale of practice we get caught up in a certain practice

216
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:49,760
you can do so a practice for years and complacency can set in and

217
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:56,640
finding with the guidance of a teacher some additional ways to bring support into the practice can be very

218
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:02,880
beneficial the second one says if you cannot abandon your

219
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:09,200
drowsiness or your complacency i'm going to sort of add that in in this way you can ponder examine and

220
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:14,400
mentally inspect the dhamma as you have heard it and understood it

221
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,679
and this is true in a a sit but it's also true in the bigger

222
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:25,919
practice that it can be very useful if you're starting to find yourself drowsy to bring attention to a teaching

223
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:34,320
that uh is relevant to whatever's going on in your in your sit or in your larger practice

224
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:39,760
not sure i can think of an example at the moment but um

225
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:47,360
it can be useful here's an example two and i think i mentioned something like this a few moments ago

226
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:53,360
to notice whether the drowsiness has a version in it to notice whether there's something that

227
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,240
doesn't feel comfortable to see or know

228
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:05,279
or if there's a if there's a attachment to bodily comfort that's

229
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:12,640
there in the meditation that's kind of part of the drowsiness or daydreaminess if there's ideation in the daydream it

230
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:17,679
can be very useful to notice where's the how much wanting how much selfing is

231
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:25,120
happening in the daydreaming as i envision myself in a different position with

232
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:31,039
different accomplishments different friends different you know

233
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:36,240
different attributes that uh somehow are puffing me up

234
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:43,279
so even in the drowsiness there can be aspects of the teaching that if we bring our attention to it can sort of bring us

235
00:24:43,279 --> 00:24:49,200
back to back to the back to the here and now

236
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,240
if this doesn't work this is a slight change we can recite in detail the dhamma as we have heard and learned it

237
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:01,360
in other words we can ponder examine mentally expect it or we can recite it

238
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:08,320
and this one is useful to bring forward into our time at that time reciting was the way in a

239
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,520
sense you read or re-read the dhamma you would chant a suta if you were a monk at

240
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:19,760
any rate and that would be a way of in a sense re-engaging with what we would think of as a text

241
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,440
but this could direct us to a text and in a sit it can be very useful

242
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:30,799
you're drowsy or just before you sit down to read a paragraph from a book

243
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:35,520
or a sentence or

244
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,640
a poem but somehow to re-engage with a textual reference or the language of the

245
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:49,919
teaching obviously this can be true at the sort of larger scale of practice that we can

246
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,120
pick up a book we've read before or listen to a podcast or

247
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,240
you know go on retreat online or offline

248
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:06,640
and in that way sort of re-engage with formal teaching i think that's the distinction that's

249
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:13,360
being drawn here in these two the ones that follow

250
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:21,039
i think we could stretch them to that larger scale but they're mostly i think useful for actual sitting with drowsiness or

251
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:27,760
unfocus in the mind i have found i have to share that pulling the earlobes is a really good

252
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,799
solution for drowsiness and if particularly if you're in a place where it's not appropriate to just lie down

253
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,360
and take a nap which as we know is recommended by the buddha we'll get to that in a moment

254
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,760
rubbing the earlobes is a really good uh and who knows why this works because the earlobes don't have a lot of you know we

255
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:52,240
don't really think about them very much but if you spend some time twisting your ears and pulling your earlobes it can

256
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:58,080
bring quite a bit of alertness into your set if you find yourself nodding off and you're sort of thinking that that's

257
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:05,520
maybe something you want to you don't want to nod off and fall over

258
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:11,279
um the following one standing up rubbing your eyes looking around i don't know if

259
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:17,200
other people have tried this but if you're drowsy in a set standing up for a couple minutes and sitting back down

260
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,240
can really bring some additional energy the following one opening your eyes and

261
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:30,320
letting some light in can be very useful and we typically even at night

262
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:38,080
this has this interesting passage about as by day so at night so at night i mean as at night so by day

263
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:44,880
not sure exactly what that means but the um in our world i'm just looking at those

264
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:51,279
halogen lights over there there's usually a source of light even at night even in a retreat setting where

265
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:57,600
we can open our eyes a little bit bring some light in and in that way

266
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,240
bring some alertness back into the meditation

267
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,960
or standing up and walking you know doing doing some walking meditation

268
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:14,240
there's no rule that says at home if you're drowsy you can't get up and walk around

269
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:19,919
even here it's um if it's not disruptive to others getting

270
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:26,159
up and taking a few paces sitting back down can be entirely um

271
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:33,039
uh can can can wake up the practice and about the nap i would just say and

272
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,760
here here too i i sort of can refer to something gill says

273
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:45,200
a lot gil let me think how does he put it in the intro class to meditation he

274
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:50,880
frequently comments that more than mindfulness meditation americans need a nap

275
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:58,559
something like that and it's very true in our culture with uh you know with artificial light and

276
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:04,320
self-medicating with caffeine throughout the day you know we extend our days in a quite

277
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:12,240
unnatural way and i think we think we get away with it but sooner or later we notice it not infrequently in meditation

278
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,600
it's not uncommon as you all maybe remember when you first sat to meditate

279
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:24,320
that uh along with noticing how incredibly busy the mind is you may have noticed how fatigued both mind and body

280
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:31,200
are and that can still be there and just being aware of that fatigue and

281
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:37,200
making sure that it's that it's addressed as a support to practice as

282
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,880
the buddha counsels mogallana the idea is to take a brief nap as a way of supporting

283
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:49,360
practice so that it it that sort of addressing the natural fatigue

284
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:55,840
of body and mind can be can be part of practice

285
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:02,000
so let me leave a few minutes for questions and i would just say this this is a

286
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,640
lovely little suta it's fun to read um it's it shows the buddha in a lighter moment perhaps

287
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,080
or at least uh giving very gentle guidance to a senior practitioner who has

288
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,120
i think in in whom we can in whom and in whose practice we can see ourselves very

289
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,480
easily um and

290
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,320
it's uh in addition to giving these sort of tips and tricks and techniques i

291
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:37,039
think it does point to some of the deeper aspects of practice the idea as i said earlier in the

292
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:42,799
evening that the practice is always about not not setting a balance and expecting it

293
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:48,720
to stay but constantly rebalancing constantly looking for ways to add

294
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:56,080
additional curiosity inquisitiveness looking being attentive being present

295
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:02,080
but at the same time doing that in a way where there isn't a lot of for and against where there's ease

296
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:07,519
noticing as we do when we ride a bicycle or a scooter or when we walk or stand

297
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,840
just noticing when things are slightly out of balance and then coming back into

298
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:19,279
balancing to the extent that that becomes second nature it's useful even to be aware of

299
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:24,960
that process happening when it's very very subtle when we follow it

300
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:31,600
we we keep that momentum going because in that balancing

301
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,519
there is there is directionality that is that is a path that leads toward

302
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:43,039
awakening toward ease toward contentment of a deep sort

303
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,720
and so this idea of keeping attuned to

304
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:53,919
the balance of effort and allowing in the practice really is a way to keep

305
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:01,600
moving toward the direction that frequently we in some sense hold as our fundamental

306
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,880
intention for the practice and perhaps for our the way we take our practice

307
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,679
into the world so let me leave leave it there and then

308
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:20,080
ask if there are any questions or anything that anybody would like to share we probably have some couple microphones

309
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:27,200
we can pass around and i can repeat questions if if not

310
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,240
are there any questions any reflections any thoughts nancy

311
00:32:37,830 --> 00:32:43,840
[Applause] hi thank you

312
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:49,919
um during retreats i have

313
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:57,440
um usually a difficult time sleeping in the evening and

314
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,720
then in the morning sit usually the six a.m sit i doze off immediately

315
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:12,080
and i noticed that by the end of the retreat like a week-long retreat

316
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:17,679
i'll do better at staying awake early but i'll just be exhausted by the end of the

317
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:24,320
retreat and i'm wondering if you could comment on that phenomena

318
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:29,679
oh gosh um it's funny because for every

319
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,200
for every nancy with that experience on retreat there's the other you know there's the other half right there's the

320
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:40,720
uh what would it be the larks right as opposed to the the night owls

321
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,519
um but it would be you could ask the same question from that perspective uh people who find like i quite quite the

322
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:53,039
opposite you know quite alert in the morning um and it's interesting i've actually i

323
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:59,039
actually use these approaches a lot um yeah i i didn't read about them all of

324
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:05,519
them here first you know they were recommended also by teachers but i think

325
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:11,679
what we find frequently either in the evening or in the morning is that we're sort of fighting that experience instead

326
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:16,800
of um integrating it into the practice uh

327
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,760
among other things it's okay to nod off we don't usually fall over and hurt ourselves everybody does it so nobody

328
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:29,839
cares on retreat that is you know people nod off through the course of the day particularly in the first few days

329
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:37,200
so there's just like the buddha in mogallana there's a i think a sense of supportive environment to the experiences that come

330
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:43,839
up in the in the retreat um the last advice which is actually eighth

331
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:49,599
and even though it's in the book of sevens taking a nap there's usually time during the day to

332
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:55,200
take a nap i always take a nap on retreat after doing the dishes after lunch usually

333
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:01,599
and so you know you can make that part of your practice but anyway i think the main my main

334
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:06,640
thing is there's no you haven't described a problem you know

335
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:11,839
um very much as this is seen the buddha doesn't see this as a problem but he has some ideas for kind of how to keep

336
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:18,880
alertness there having said that if you were to find and i can say this to you knowing something

337
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,079
of your practice uh just that if you were to find that in that

338
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:29,440
repeated pattern there's some complacency right or some something that

339
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:35,040
is not ready to be seen yet that you feel like yeah you want to and i i don't know that i think that's there but

340
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:40,880
you know that that would be a useful thing to know and that's another reason to look at that drowsiness you know with

341
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:47,359
some curiosity instead of some judgment like oh instead of this shouldn't be happening oh is there anything else going on here

342
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:53,119
am i just tired am i just a night owl and if you were to find something like

343
00:35:53,119 --> 00:36:00,160
that you know that's a good thing to bring into your practice too with the support of your teacher

344
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:09,520
yeah other questions reflections

345
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:12,599
jim

346
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,520
well thank you david for your talk you know my practice i think a lot about

347
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:26,880
being sleepy in the morning and actually i kind of find that there's something

348
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,320
that happens in that liminal space between being asleep and being awake

349
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:39,440
where things do kind of present themselves to me in a way that they don't

350
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:45,359
if i'm upright and alert and paying attention you know it's kind of like

351
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:51,520
there might be things that yup you know are kind of in that liminal

352
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:58,480
space so a lot of my has kind of been in that sort of dream state between

353
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:04,400
sleep and awake and i was wondering if you've had that experience or might have something to say about it

354
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,160
yeah yeah and what what you point to i think is uh is a is a really productive

355
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:18,240
way to bring and integrate that into practice which is to notice what's going on in that in that realm

356
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:24,320
which sometimes when we receive the encouragement to return attention to the

357
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,720
breath uh it's done in such a way that we move we move our attention back to the breath

358
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,560
too quickly and we miss noticing where the mind's gone

359
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:43,760
and whether the mind's gone you know it's gone all tangled up in some you know compulsive spiral of thought or whether

360
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,599
it's found itself in daydream and i'm i've also found it very useful to be attentive to

361
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:55,440
i say daydream but i know the liminal space you're talking about that's sort of between it's in a way it's beyond

362
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:02,160
daydreaming you know toward but but you know maybe there's random things

363
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:07,359
that happen in mind but i think more likely than not there are

364
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:12,560
things that happen there that can be usefully noticed

365
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:18,480
so anyway i think you know the instruction always is to notice what's going on be curious about

366
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:25,119
what's going on be present for what's going on in a way that can sort of integrate that experience

367
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:30,560
instead of push it away or hold on to it so

368
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:36,880
it sounds sounds like good sounds like good practice

369
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:47,838
yeah other thoughts other questions

370
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,320
it's hard to tell with masks on quite how alert everybody is

371
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,160
and maybe how apt the advice of the buddha to mogallana is

372
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:10,880
um i'm alert now because i'm you know i'm i'm sitting up here but um

373
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:18,560
yeah i think i think we can

374
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:25,680
say again oh that's a good question i don't even know how this works

375
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:33,760
okay yeah thanks for reminding me nancy that there's a larger audience yeah

376
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:40,560
any other thoughts reflections

377
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:48,320
from the youtube audience or the audience here

378
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,520
okay so i can just um trying to think if there's any closing

379
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:01,119
thought any beyond you know

380
00:40:01,119 --> 00:40:06,800
making sure you get your rest take that nap that the buddha recommends

381
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,880
that mogalana takes it's funny because we we underestimate

382
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:18,000
the importance of that piece of sage advice from 2500 years ago

383
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,000
uh

384
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,480
i think um i've already sort of summed up these things but let me do it in sort

385
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,599
of the manner of offering uh the merit of the practice this evening

386
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:41,280
and just um suggesting that we

387
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,520
bring this aspect of our practice this aspect of bringing attention to the balance that gill

388
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:53,760
has mentioned and that i've just sort of been riffing on this evening between effort and allowing

389
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:59,359
that that that that's something we we take out into the world with us and make make

390
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:04,640
that part of balancing our practice something that we we do

391
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:11,280
in a way and do with the intention of benefiting benefiting others

392
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,440
and there's probably many ways that this could be thought of but i think

393
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,359
being curious about other people being open to other people's experiences you know

394
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:30,640
being listening with an open heart can be part of that sort of

395
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,720
making that effort and the allowing can be as we look around the world allowing our

396
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:43,520
hearts to break allowing our minds to be as open as they can

397
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:51,920
allowing ourselves to ask for help and give help allowing ourselves to care

398
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:58,640
be cared for so with that in mind may all beings be

399
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:07,440
safe secure may all beings be healthy in body and mind may all beings

400
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,200
be free from suffering and the roots of suffering may all beings be at ease content

401
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,240
may all beings be free

402
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,670
