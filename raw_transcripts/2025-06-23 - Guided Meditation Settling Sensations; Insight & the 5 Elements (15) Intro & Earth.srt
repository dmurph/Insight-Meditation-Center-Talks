1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,960
so welcome warm welcome everyone and delighted to be here subbing for Gil

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:16,560
while he's on vacation My name is Don Neil for those of us who we haven't met in person or um virtually

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:25,279
And just want to say a few words before we start the meditation for those of you who are already here that um this week

4
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:33,040
I'll be covering we'll be exploring the five elements which is both a contemplation and a

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:40,960
practice that is intrically related to the experience of insight especially as

6
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,800
um it is put forth and experienced in the um

7
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,719
classical Burmese Myanmar tradition that Gil and I have both practiced in

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,079
So with that as an orientation the invitation once you've finished all

9
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:07,280
of your greetings and warm hellos is to settle back into meditation practice

10
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,280
and noticing

11
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,080
how it is to be in your body this morning

12
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:27,640
Maybe taking a couple of deeper slower breaths

13
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:40,920
and allowing awareness to come to the forefront

14
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,880
Allowing this moment to come to the forefront this embodied

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,880
moment

16
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:56,629
[Music]

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,000
Noticing the weight of your body on the cushion

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,119
or chair or mat

19
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:19,760
Noticing the support behind or beneath you

20
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:27,120
whether it's firm or hard or soft

21
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,280
and yielding

22
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,239
Noticing the texture of any clothing on your skin

23
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:47,000
or on whatever surface you're contacting Is it rough or smooth

24
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:01,640
tuning in also to the heaviness or lightness in your body

25
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,360
Right now I'm feeling a sense of weight my hip points

26
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:18,959
A little bit of pressure against the back of the chair the back of my body

27
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:26,560
Noticing for yourself this feeling of being held

28
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:34,319
rooted in your place

29
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,640
held to the earth by gravity

30
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:50,920
Noticing too any feelings of lightness

31
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:02,280
Perhaps lightness in the chest or belly as air comes in

32
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,640
Perhaps a lightness in the heart being with Sana or taking time for yourself

33
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,959
to practice

34
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:31,479
Then attuning to other dimensions of the felt sense

35
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,400
of being here

36
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:43,440
Perhaps a sense of moisture or dryness in the air

37
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,960
against your skin or as it enters the nostrils

38
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,600
and becomes breath

39
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,080
Noticing any warmth or cool heat or cold

40
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,720
on the skin or inside the body

41
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,000
Perhaps a slight chill of air or warmth

42
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:29,560
of clothing or a wrap

43
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:47,080
When within this field of felt sensations

44
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,440
noticing the movement the aliveness

45
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,000
of this body

46
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:09,120
Perhaps the movement of the abdomen or belly diaphragm

47
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,199
This air breath goes in and out

48
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:25,880
or the play of sensations at the tip of the nose or the top of the lip

49
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,039
shifting and changing

50
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,520
and settling anchoring

51
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,759
the attention

52
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,560
in the felt sense of the moment

53
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:35,638
If distractions arise

54
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,120
allowing your meditation as the Buddha invited your meditation to

55
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,840
be like the earth

56
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:57,240
not allowing thoughts stories

57
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:05,080
to proliferate through the mind but returning to this body

58
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,840
A sense of weight integrity

59
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:16,840
sitting like a mountain

60
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:47,880
from time to time Reconnecting

61
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:55,959
with this experience this embodied moment

62
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:03,959
Noticing there are places of density

63
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:14,040
weight softness lightness

64
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:19,480
even within the breath itself

65
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:29,399
Sometimes on the outreath there can be a sense of settling

66
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,760
drawing the attention inward and downward

67
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:42,640
like sediment settling the attention

68
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:51,320
the heart in the body The moment

69
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:44,519
Allowing the attention to stay close to the felt sensations

70
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,548
shifting changing [Music]

71
00:12:54,079 --> 00:13:01,000
Rooted in now Grounded in now

72
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:42,799
In the last remaining moments of this meditation

73
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,799
The invitation is to notice

74
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,240
any ways that there might be more settledness

75
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:04,640
grounding perhaps lightness or spaciousness

76
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:12,039
And at the beginning of this time of practice together Feeling

77
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,679
into that

78
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:34,159
And then from that place whatever unfolded

79
00:27:34,159 --> 00:27:39,159
noticed with appreciation and kindness

80
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:47,720
casting your internal gaze outwards to all of those your life touches

81
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:56,320
Wishing that just like me just like you

82
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:02,840
they be happy as healthy as possible

83
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:06,760
peaceful

84
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,320
That just like you just like me

85
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,799
may be free of suffering

86
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,160
May all beings be safe peaceful and free

87
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:36,329
[Music]

88
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:54,520
Thank you for the sincerity of your practice

89
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:45,240
So good morning and a warm welcome to our online sit together

90
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:52,159
This week um as I mentioned to those who are on a little bit early I'm covering

91
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,279
um we will be exploring together the topic of the elements in Buddhist

92
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:02,880
practice sometimes four elements sometimes five elements I'm um offering

93
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,559
a teaching on the five elements and um

94
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:14,960
to say that this is both a meditation practice and what's called a

95
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:23,360
contemplation And by contemplation I mean there's a number of different kind of um

96
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:31,760
exercises that the Buddha gave for us to consider and frame our understanding of

97
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:39,679
felt embodied experience And those um both the practice and the

98
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:45,039
contemplation the imaginative exercise help to prime

99
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:52,000
the mind for insight or deepening of insight So this week is offered in

100
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,520
support of Gil's unfolding series on insight in practice right now

101
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:08,559
So four or five elements are earth water fire air and sometimes space And I just

102
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:17,919
want to name this is a bronze age framework So what does it have to do with us now

103
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:24,320
so there's a number of reasons that it's still relevant First as many of you know

104
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:31,279
maybe all of you know we still have elements those are not necessarily called elements anymore because we now

105
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:39,840
have the periodic table of elements and even beneath that there's a quantum level of elemental experience So we

106
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:46,320
think of them differently but the basic notion that folks had in and before the

107
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:53,440
time of the Buddha that we are made of the same stuff as the world around us as

108
00:31:53,440 --> 00:32:02,278
the earth still holds It's just a bit more sophisticated now perhaps

109
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:09,919
So this contemplation and meditative practice is a way of pardon unearthing

110
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:16,159
this felt experience and it's one of many cases where a

111
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,600
skillful means or a framework is introduced by the Buddha for developing

112
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,640
insight into inconstancy in nature and

113
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:33,200
not self or selflessness anata So I have an anecdote about this from my

114
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,720
time as a um practitioner in Myanmar Burma I was practicing with a contemporary of

115
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:46,320
Gil's teacher there upandita Um my teacher was Sid Jonica

116
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:53,760
and um I was practicing within the framework of the progress of insight the way that um

117
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,039
the rough framework Gil is using in his teachings right now

118
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:05,840
and um would have one-on-one or very small group meetings with the sciat

119
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,880
every day to see how things were unfolding And in the course of these practice

120
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:20,000
conversations in the course of my weeks there of practicing in one of these practice conversations

121
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:26,000
it came up that um the elements were apparent

122
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:34,399
and it happened just after the insight into anata

123
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,600
It was an organic arising that came up in one of these small group

124
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:46,960
conversations and seeing the shifting changing and

125
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:52,640
personal nature of elements and embodied practice could actually be considered

126
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,480
another form of seeing each That's what came up in the discussion And then later

127
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:05,440
I learned maybe that same trip or maybe shortly afterwards that the form of practice we

128
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:12,878
were doing the mahasi method it's called with which really involves noticing the movement of the belly the abdomen with

129
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,960
the breath was actually considered by the person who developed it for lay people people

130
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:26,800
like us say mahasi to be elements practice a very classic mindfulness of

131
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,079
the body practice from the four foundations of mindfulness

132
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:40,158
I'll say more about this as the week unfolds But to say that it's central

133
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:45,200
and it's not necessary if it doesn't resonate for you yet it is central It's

134
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:52,320
one of the central practices in that foundational text of our tradition

135
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:59,839
So as I said this is one of many forms of

136
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:06,560
meditation and contemplation which involve shifting and changing our

137
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,400
perceptual process our perceptions And among other things this shows how

138
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:20,079
the heart and mind shape our experience of reality for the purpose of cutting

139
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:27,920
through forms of clinging that amp up or even cause increase

140
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,599
unnecessary suffering duka in our lives

141
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:42,800
This week we'll explore both the contemplative and meditative dimensions of this practice

142
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,880
of elements practice especially how it can support insight including a practical perspective and of more of a

143
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:58,079
poetic or mythic perspective according to um

144
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,839
well actually it's not even according to the commentaries I'll talk about the commentaries in a moment but at the

145
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:12,079
introduction to many many of the Buddhist discourses there'll be this just kind of toss away line This body

146
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:17,200
composed of or comprised of the four elements or the five elements It's just

147
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,800
kind of taken as a given this notion that

148
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:29,920
we are the same matter the same stuff as the

149
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:36,320
world around us And that wasn't just a kind of

150
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:41,520
lifeless sort of quantum physics of the time though it was a material

151
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,920
observation Of course there was also this cultural soup in which the Buddha

152
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:53,839
lived and taught that was um kind of prehindu pre- breminical

153
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:59,599
and the idea in the ancient texts of the brahinss the aananishads

154
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:06,880
was that these different materials these different processes of earth

155
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:15,000
water fire kind of had a certain sort of aliveness

156
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:22,359
So it's about that felt sense of aliveness in the poetic sense

157
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,920
in the um so the first four elements

158
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:34,320
are experienced as objects of meditation Objects of meditation on the body The

159
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:39,760
first foundation of mindfulness In other words touch

160
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:46,640
sensation interosception the feeling of what happens within our bodies

161
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:53,280
and they have the power attending to them has the power of bringing us here

162
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,200
Now according to the commentaries they have

163
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,240
each element has experiential qualities and functions

164
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,400
So they're ways of noticing the experience of the body in the moment as

165
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:18,720
a process In other words direct experience

166
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:26,560
of embodied change in constancy

167
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:34,480
So elements practice can be a skillful means for experiencing that river of change and for disidentification

168
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:42,160
desentering from our attitudes or imagination or cultural projections about our bodies I don't like my skin

169
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:49,280
now that I'm over 50 or I don't like my hair or I don't like my belly Those are all thoughts

170
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:57,599
Instead this is the lived experience of kaya the body the aliveness

171
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,839
and our fundamental belonging to nonsparation

172
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,079
from nature the earth itself

173
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:16,240
So with all of that as context and introduction thanks for hanging in there with me We'll talk a little bit about

174
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:23,200
the earth earth element to start with a just a nod to a sort of

175
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,960
more mythop poetic perspective as I talked about the last time I was

176
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,800
subbing for gil on YouTube the night of the Buddha's awakening

177
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,160
he was assailed by the forces of mara life denying forces of

178
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:47,359
um doubt and ill will and the like And in some versions of this story well

179
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:55,359
in all versions he touches the earth You can see the touch earth mudra on many Buddhist statues

180
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:02,079
And in these myths some of them the earth shakes earth is

181
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:09,760
my witness I belong I have capacity to awaken

182
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:15,359
And in some of these stories it's described as the earth being her She

183
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:19,559
bears witness to him

184
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,440
So earth can be inspiration for meditation

185
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,480
as it is in that myth or as in one of the discourses the teachings in which

186
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:40,560
the Buddha advises his very own son Rahula to take inspiration from each of these

187
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,720
elements Take inspiration Make your meditation like the earth

188
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,119
you said and I'll say more about this in later talks because the same is true for

189
00:40:53,119 --> 00:41:01,280
water fire air space We too can take the earth as inspiration

190
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:07,920
for our practice the strength the solidity

191
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:13,319
the integrity the settledness

192
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:23,400
We can also attune to those qualities associated with the earth element

193
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:31,040
Are we feeling in this moment sensations of heaviness or lightness

194
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:37,599
hardness or roughness softness or smoothness

195
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,680
attending to their changing nature if you want to feel into right now what

196
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,000
heaviness or hardness might feel like on a more material level in the body the classic instructions are to notice the

197
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,760
teeth kind of put them together Notice your nails Feel into the way our bones our

198
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,880
skeletons hold us up There's an integrity there

199
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:11,680
Then there's the function The function of each element And the

200
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:20,720
function of the earth element is that it is the basis from which all else grows

201
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:27,599
on one level the base for the other elements In the samuta nikaya the connected

202
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:34,800
discourses the Buddha likens the mind to the earth element that it's the ground

203
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:41,440
for the other experiences This is picked up by the waiter Tibetan

204
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:48,640
tradition and I'm quoting here from um it's actually from a a wiki on um

205
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:54,880
Tibetan Buddhism The mind's ability to serve as the ground for all experience

206
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,319
is the quality of earth So essentially the Buddha's words but a

207
00:43:00,319 --> 00:43:06,800
little bit more um contemporary in their saying

208
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,640
So it supports earth element supports

209
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:20,960
all of the seeds of our minds All of the cultivation for good or for ill of our

210
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,160
minds I'll close with this poem attributed to

211
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:32,000
patachara These are poems based on the awakening

212
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,319
songs of the women in the terriata by Patachara

213
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:44,079
And she says "Farmers turn up the soil plant seeds

214
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:49,599
and wait all by itself Water pours down from the

215
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:56,640
sky and turns the earth into food After all these years sleeping on the

216
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:01,760
ground waking before dawn and begging for every meal

217
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:07,119
where's my harvest late one evening I was washing my feet

218
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:14,000
After another long day of sitting and walking the water poured over my feet and onto

219
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,520
the ground I let my mind go and it flowed downhill with the water

220
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,280
towards my little hut I went inside

221
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:36,319
sat on the bed and lowered the wick of the lamp all by itself The flame went out

222
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:44,160
and she awoke In some versions of that poem there's

223
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:49,920
talk about settling the mind with the flow of the water

224
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:57,200
And this this awakening poem sets us up for tomorrow's topic water

225
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:03,520
So your assignment homework assignment should you choose to accept it between

226
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:09,520
now and tomorrow is to notice notice in the felt sense of your

227
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:15,839
experience how sensations of heaviness or lightness

228
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:25,040
change roughness or smoothness density or soft spaciousness

229
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:31,839
Notice this in your day Maybe a few moments in formal meditation or informally through the day and see how

230
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:40,920
it connects you to the moment or doesn't Thank you for your practice
