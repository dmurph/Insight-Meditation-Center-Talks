30
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:55,439
i uh wanted to um give the guided meditation

31
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:02,000
inspired from a few quotes on happiness i wanted to share a few quotes on

32
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,840
happiness i thought that would be fun to do that tonight um given that this is happy hour so let's

33
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:16,560
let's talk about happiness so here are a few quotes that i want to share with you

34
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,120
um [Music] first one is from mother teresa and she says

35
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:29,199
there is no key to happiness the door is always open

36
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,199
i love this one there is no key to happiness you know how people say the key to happiness is blah blah blah blah

37
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,759
blah there is no key to happiness the door is always open i love that i love

38
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,919
that which is kind of synonymous with what something that we've worked with and

39
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,199
i've shared before the title of this book happiness is a choice you make it's just a matter of choice it's always

40
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,639
available it's always here [Music]

41
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:04,000
and so that's one quote let's keep that one in mind i love that one oh here's

42
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,479
another one um here's this one is from the dalai lama

43
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:15,919
happiness is not something ready made it comes from your own

44
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:21,199
actions i like that too it's not something that is made but it

45
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:28,479
just comes from your actions and i think with to that i also add because in buddhism actions are not just physical

46
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,280
actions but actions of speech and mind and decisions are actions of the mind so

47
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:41,199
these two quotes are are related um

48
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:48,800
uh and this one is from marcus aurelius a stoic philosopher and there's a lot of

49
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,479
similarity by the way between stoicism and [Music]

50
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,240
buddhism and this is a great one actually

51
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,039
very little is needed to make a happy life it is all within yourself

52
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:14,720
in your way of thinking i'll read it one more time very little is needed to make a happy

53
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:22,319
life it is all within yourself in your way of thinking

54
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,759
and we've we've seen echoes of that in the other quotes and also in what we've practiced

55
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:37,600
oh this one i like to this is a good one um this one is from

56
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,039
um chinma yananda saraswati

57
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:48,800
and they say don't put the key to your happiness in someone else's pocket

58
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:54,560
this is a good one don't put the key to your happiness in someone else's

59
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:00,240
pocket such okay i'll give you maybe i'll share

60
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:06,319
one more these are so good i was having so much fun i couldn't choose which one to just choose one so i

61
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:13,039
figured i'll just you know as my little intro i'll share these different ones and and let you um

62
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:18,240
maybe for yourself see which one you relate to the most um

63
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,599
this one is from milton erickson and they say life will bring you pain

64
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:31,039
all by itself your responsibility is to create joy

65
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:38,800
life will bring you pain all by itself your responsibility is to create joy

66
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,919
okay one last one all right here's the last one okay really really last one

67
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,919
this is from friedrich koenig

68
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,120
and the quote is we tend to forget that happiness doesn't come as a result of

69
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:02,960
getting something we don't have but rather of recognizing and

70
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:08,720
appreciating what we do have one more time we tend to forget that

71
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,000
happiness doesn't come as a result of getting something we don't have

72
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,440
but rather of recognizing and appreciating what we do have

73
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,520
okay so i could continue but i think that's that's enough to set the stage for

74
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:32,159
for tonight's practice together um guided meditation i'll bring some of

75
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:37,599
these themes in and um yeah

76
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:44,240
let's begin together let's begin so i like to invite you all

77
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,160
to get into your meditation posture whether it's lying down

78
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,720
it's sitting whatever it might be

79
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,680
inviting yourself to land to land in your body

80
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,839
greeting creating this body this moment

81
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,920
whatever is present

82
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:35,839
if heartache is present welcoming that

83
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:42,800
embracing that sadness if

84
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:49,440
challenges in the body pain it's all okay we don't have to push anything away for

85
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:52,720
happiness to be here

86
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:03,160
it can contain everything so embracing embracing whatever is here

87
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,120
and releasing releasing the body

88
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,760

softening softening [Music]

91
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,920
this part of the body the forehead

92
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,680
usually signaling how much tension tightness there is in the rest of the body

93
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,959
softening the jaw

94
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,120
inviting your teeth to relax this is almost like you call on

95
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,279

96
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,839
relaxed

97
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,440
inviting your ears to relax

98

the muscles behind your face

99
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,120
no need to hold up any mask

100
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,279
as if you're attending a loving-kindness spa

101
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,560
and your face is getting an internal massage

102

holding making space for whatever is present

109
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:22,720
especially if there's tenderness you've had a challenging day

110
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,600
or days

111
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:27,839

113
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,440
or warmed whatever the need is by the breath

114
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,480
comforted comforted

115
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:09,279
sit bones landing on the seat released

116
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:18,199
releasing the tension your upper legs your knees your lower lips and feet

letting the breath move throughout the whole body calming soothing

118
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,399
like a lullaby

119
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:45,480
if there is pain in your heart

120
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:52,320
are any challenges in the body and the mind

121
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:04,240
let them be held kindly

122
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:13,840
as if there is this loving presence loving embrace holding you

123
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,679
holding whatever's challenging

124
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:30,000
with care with worms you don't have to be any other way any different than you than how you're

125
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,880
showing up right now

126
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,400
knowing that trusting that

127
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:02,320
for every being there are ten thousand sorrows

128
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,080
this being human is tough and

129
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:11,840
there are ten thousand joys

130
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,960
letting the challenges the sorrow

131
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:05,799
be held with kindness with compassion

132
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:32,080
and knowing that the capacity of our heart is expansive it can hold joy

133
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:38,480
our good fortune can turn to it

134
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,280
at any moment

135
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:57,120
not putting the key to our happiness in someone else's pocket

136
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:03,840
or even in our own pocket it's all no key needed

137
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:11,679
no key needed mother teresa said there is no key to

138
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,000
happiness the door is always open

139
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:32,240
not in getting what we want which is endless the list of what we want is

140
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:38,320
endless the mind will always come up something else to want

141
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:44,240
of course it does it's the nature of samsara wanting this

142
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:52,159
wanting that not a sin to want not a problem just

143
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:59,159
it's not doesn't bring happiness but to appreciate

144
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,320
appreciate

145
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:12,519
what there is already this amazing

146
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,760
life being alive

147
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:28,880
having agency being able to think being able to touch other people's lives

148
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,720
so many gifts

149
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:11,760
to be alive to have this precious human life

150
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:21,360
i'll read another quote from the dalai lama let it

151
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:25,519
drop into your body into your heart

152
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,158
see what might bubble up

153
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,720
every day think as you wake up

154
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:46,880
today i am fortunate to be alive

155
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,559
i have a precious human life

156
00:23:56,000 --> 00:24:00,559
i am not going to waste it

157
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:10,240
i am going to use all my energies to develop myself

158
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:15,840
to expand my heart out to others

159
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:25,080
to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings

160
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:42,320
i'll read the quote one more time

161
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:52,080
not to think about it let it shower your heart

162
00:24:55,039 --> 00:25:01,840
feeling the energy of this quote in your heart and your body

163
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,360
maybe something [Music] rings true for you

164
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:20,158
comes alive here we go

165
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:27,360
every day think as you wake up

166
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:33,039
today i am fortunate to be alive

167
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,440
i have a precious human life

168
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:45,360
i am not going to waste it

169
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:56,600
i am going to use all my energies to develop myself

170
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:02,080
to expand my heart out to others

171
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:12,600
to achieve enlightenment for the benefit of all beings

172
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:48,640
let us sit with the reverberation of these words in

173
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:55,840
our bodies in our heart not thinking just breathing

174
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:03,279
or being breathed see what else might bubble up

175
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:12,400
profound time for reflection in silence externally and maybe even

176
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,400
internally

177
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:35,760
and whatever arises whatever percolates can we have

178
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:43,200
kindness acceptance towards whatever arises

179
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:55,480
even if it's a crowd of sorrows can we be kind to whatever arises

180
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:01,919
mated with a smile

181
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:07,480
a generous smile

182
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:17,320
the security blanket safety blanket

183
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,440
and also knowing that every moment we can turn we can

184
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:53,200
know that our heart is so expensive you can contain challenges can contain

185
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,919
joy aspiration to contain happiness

186
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:06,399
knowing the blessings of our precious human birth

187
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,200
and all the opportunities we have been given

188
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,799
all the gifts we have

189
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:01,840
every day think as you wake up

190
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:08,600
today i'm fortunate to be alive

191
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,278
i have a precious human life

192
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,880
i am not going to waste it

193
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,080
i'm going to use all my energies

194
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:55,799
to develop myself

195
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:16,440
to expand my heart to others

196
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,840
to achieve enlightenment

197
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:46,760
for the benefit of all beings

198
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:38,560
as we approach the end of this practice period

199
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:50,000
knowing in your heart that you are cultivating yourself

200
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:57,359
you're using your energies to extend your heart

201
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,280
to others to yourself to others through mental

202
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:14,599
that you are walking this path towards awakening

203
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,240
and knowing this not evaluating your progress every moment every five

204
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:30,720
minutes but knowing that you are practicing

205
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:39,200
this in and of itself is a cause for happiness

206
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:48,240
[Music] knowing this

207
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:55,680
brings up happiness in the heart

208
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:04,240
and let us together gift with generosity another act of cultivation

209
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,320
generously give generously offer our goodness

210
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:15,760
our actions of mind speech and intention [Music]

211
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:21,599
decision to create joy happiness to extend our heart

212
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:30,320
offer this goodness to all beings everywhere may all beings be happy

213
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:36,920
may all things be free including ourselves

214
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:57,838

217
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:30,640
as we've weaved through few themes through quotes unhappiness and

218
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:37,040
joy that it's about turning our minds to it

219
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:42,720
and also the inspiring invitation

220
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:48,720
from the dalai lama any reflections that came up for you anything that

221
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:55,920
shifted or moved and [Music]

222
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,240
or anything that didn't work it's all okay

223
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:08,800
sharing your reflections for the benefit of others fred i see your hand or

224
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,200
trying to raise your hand i say it's a clap but i think you're trying to raise your hand i was touring thank you sure

225
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:24,000
um so i i i just like to say what i experienced and see

226
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:30,079
see what you say um so i was feeling

227
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,480
a little agitation um you know some sorrow

228
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,920
and i was trying to then [Music]

229
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,800
open my heart simultaneously so that all these things would exist

230
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:53,839
together um not like a mental process

231
00:41:53,839 --> 00:41:59,280
where you can't really think of three disparate things

232
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:06,800
simultaneously it seems that emotionally or psychologically you can

233
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:14,079
i think and um i wasn't trying to have a battle royale

234
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:20,240
between them but just um let them

235
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:26,240
coexist because they were going to anyway though though maybe maybe the sadness

236
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,160
and agitation would would be there without my bidding and i needed to

237
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,240
um to open up to the heart being

238
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:45,838
more more welcoming and and and more loving um

239
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:52,249
so that's my experience and um [Music]

240
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:59,599
what do you think love it love it fred i i love how you're talking

241
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:05,520
about these um disparate perhaps or different

242
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,280
um emotion states coexisting their sense of um

243
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,400
sadness agitation and then opening your heart opening your heart letting them

244
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:23,040
coexist in their way like it's it's that's what i'm hearing there's this coexistence of

245
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:29,920
and and i think that's what i was actually inviting you to do tonight which is invite allow

246
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:35,680
the the heartache or challenge to be there and for it

247
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:42,880
for there to be also be a soothing for it to be a soothing comforting and welcoming of it and to know that maybe

248
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:50,240
there could be a little bit of joy happiness acknowledging that oh yeah there are gifts here as well as

249
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:55,359
aspiration so it's like a big soup it's it's like that's our human condition

250
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:02,079
right all of these things present at the same time um so that was that was the crux of my

251
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:08,560
invitation and what i'm hearing is that actually yeah you were working with that like yeah it's not like i'm pitting them against

252
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:14,160
it's not like the comforting supposed to make them go away it's like yeah it's all present that's what i'm hearing was

253
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,920
what's happening for you and that's lovely i don't have a sense of it being

254
00:44:19,920 --> 00:44:25,440
a success you know it's just all things are present yeah and i

255
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:32,720
i've been thinking um off and on sometimes during happy hour of the ending of a novel that i'm

256
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:37,839
embarrassed to say i can't remember but it was written by anthony mara

257
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:43,599
and it involves um really terrible things that happened in the

258
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:49,680
chechen war and at the very end there are a couple of survivors who are

259
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:56,880
maintaining a hospital in the midst of immense suffering and they do this with a kind of

260
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:02,560
they do it with duty and determination and occasionally joy

261
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:09,040
against all odds of things turning out well but but a young girl escapes and they

262
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:15,119
know that she's alive and that she will go on to do good things in the world she's like

263
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:21,040
their she's their heart who is their who is their missionary out in the world

264
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:27,040
it's um it's almost worth the pain of reading this book to reach the the last pages of

265
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:33,119
it um so anyway thank you um thank you fred

266
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:38,319
thanks for sharing that and and also what you're sharing about the the book

267
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:44,560
there's a sense of yes even in the midst of so much challenges

268
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:50,640
there was sense of joy that you were talking about this book and and also referring back and connecting that to

269
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:58,240
what you were saying it doesn't feel like a sense of success or like oh yeah i've managed and yet that is what the

270
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,880
quote-unquote success here is is it's allowing all of this to be it's is the

271
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,800
is the recognition that's it it's the recognition that all of this can be

272
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,240
that the sadness the challenge can be there with the comforting the soothing

273
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:23,119
the meta and with the aspiration and with the joy that all of these can be present together it doesn't have to be

274
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,839
one or the other and actually that is amazing you you may see you know i i

275
00:46:29,839 --> 00:46:35,440
wonder if you you feel like there is is there more to this well maybe there is more to it maybe there isn't maybe

276
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:41,599
this this is it maybe this is exactly it i don't know if there's more you want to comment or if

277
00:46:41,599 --> 00:46:47,359
it feels complete for you but yeah this is this is it this is exactly it

278
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:53,839
it's it's the full catastrophe of being human and can we embrace the beauty of

279
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:58,880
the full catastrophe as you beautifully just talked about

280
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:04,640
thank you thank you fred thank you yeah

281
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:09,000
sophie and one reflection

282
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,359
um one reflection coming privately and

283
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:23,440
uh it is i have been feeling jealous and being left out for the past week i tried

284
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:28,640
to be mindful of it but it feels a bit overwhelming i was wondering if you have

285
00:47:28,640 --> 00:47:35,838
any suggestions on how to be with it yeah yeah um

286
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:40,079
yeah um

287
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:47,040
i think being mindful of it um it's the person

288
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:52,800
who wrote the reflection you know when when jealousy or envy arises

289
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:59,520
feeling left out i think um what can be

290
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,640
even more helpful than than just being mindful of it mindful of it is like okay

291
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:10,000
i know you're there i know you're there but i would actually recommend being with it

292
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:15,520
with compassion really holding it with compassion because there's a lot of pain

293
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,960
when one is feeling left out one's feeling envious just there's so much

294
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:27,200
pain so holding that pain with a lot of compassion instead of blaming oneself like oh you shouldn't be jealous you

295
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:33,839
should be you should rise and rise above as well in this moment sweetheart it's okay it's just it's hurting for whatever

296
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:39,200
cause and conditions in the past childhood this that the world zeitgeist

297
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:44,480
yeah this is this is what's here right now so that's that's what i would invite

298
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:49,520
the person who wrote that and others who might be going through this to to

299
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:56,240
really turn towards it with compassion just give it a lot of space hold it with compassion

300
00:48:56,240 --> 00:49:01,599
and see what it might what's underneath it what's underneath the feeling jealous

301
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:08,400
feeling left out what is and is and as you hold it with compassion and care

302
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,599
maybe there is a sense of generosity that arises from that generosity towards

303
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:20,319
yourself generosity towards others when it is cared for when it is really held

304
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:28,160
completely i hope that makes sense if you give the the

305
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:33,839
hurt attention and really hold it with compassion and some generosity from the

306
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:39,599
hurt can arise you're welcome

307
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,520
when reflection on youtube touch the nerve the guided meditation i think they're referring to

308
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:52,720
so many tears and so much love and comfort thank you ah thank you for sharing that

309
00:49:52,720 --> 00:50:00,240
lovely so dear friends let's turn as the dalai lama talks about

310
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:06,240
to expand my heart to others let's expand our heart to others

311
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:14,160
in small groups so i'll create the breakout rooms and see if you can extend your heart to others

312
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,760
in any way that that is accessible extend your heart to yourself

313
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:25,280
um not pushing not trying too hard but just extending your heart

314
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,359
what what is it like to to show up with an extended heart that holds

315
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:36,400
suffering and joy and aspiration and and

316
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:45,040
jealousy and all just it just holds holds the full catastrophe of being human for yourself and for others

317
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:52,400
and again speaking just from your own experience not managing others or or

318
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:58,079
managing the group just offering what you like also you can just offer your silence

319
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:03,359
when your turn comes a pass for one sentence or you're one one

320
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:08,800
nugget of one of thought the next person the next person they'll come back to you so

321
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,400
you'll go through it a few times so the rooms are created

322
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:20,559
and um actually hold on let me

323
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:25,680
there we go the rooms are created take care of yourselves take care of each

324
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:29,640
other here we go

325
01:00:19,119 --> 01:00:26,880
okay the rooms are closed we're all back and we are at time so

326
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:32,799
i'm thinking we let's respect the the time i will stay a

327
01:00:32,799 --> 01:00:40,160
couple of minutes extra on zoom if there are new reflections questions you like to share but let's bring this session to a close

328
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:47,040
i hope you had a a nice time connecting with each other thank you all for showing up for

329
01:00:47,040 --> 01:00:54,000
practicing for cultivating your heart extending your heart to others may all beings be well may all beings be

330
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,839
free including ourselves

331
