1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:14,559
so warm greetings from redwood city

2
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:23,520
and as we continue this

3
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,840
series on mindfulness of breathing

4
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:40,000
the mindfulness practice has both a deliberate side of the practice

5
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:47,280
and that which is non-deliberate or to say it maybe

6
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:55,520
maybe in a clearer way that which is active that we do and that which is

7
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:03,120
passive that we allow for and the balance between those two shifts and changes as the practice goes

8
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,640
along so certainly if a person has never heard of meditation before

9
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:16,400
and they maybe read a book about it and say i'm going to meditate they have to actively put themselves

10
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,520
maybe into a meditation posture and kind of get themselves started and

11
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,680
change the maybe the the momentum of their mind even from what

12
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:35,759
they have been doing to have the momentum of the mind being being a little bit um different uh now the moment of the

13
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:42,799
mind is uh to be present to be present without a lot of thinking about things or reacting to

14
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,399
things but to have some ability to stay present and maybe to stay present in a very simple way in the

15
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:56,719
present moment with something like the breathing just being with the breathing staying on the breathing

16
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:03,600
and and so there's a deliberateness to that there's an active quality to that that that needs

17
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,440
to be there as the practice deepens or as it were able to stay more and more in the

18
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:15,680
present moment there's uh less of the deliberateness is needed

19
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:22,239
it's almost as if the deliberateness has set in place the motion to let go of all the distracted forces

20
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:28,160
all the different things we might be doing and uh and so now we're kind of

21
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:35,440
at rest staying here present and we don't have to do any more deliberateness in it

22
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:44,239
and so to borrow from an ancient metaphor um if a um

23
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:52,720
someone who herds sheep a shepherd is you know this the sheep have

24
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:58,319
gathered all over the mountainside and the shepherd deliberately travels around

25
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:05,840
the mountains searching looking trying to find the sheep to gather them together so there's a deliberateness and

26
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:13,280
active looking for those sheep once all the sheep have been gathered and they brought back to down by the

27
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,319
river where they're in the core pasture areas perhaps

28
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,480
and they're all gathered there and they're happily eating in the in the pasture then the shepherd can lean back against

29
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,720
the nice trees trunk of the tree and the shade and a warm day maybe

30
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,840
looking out across the pasture and then there's not much deliberateness in the looking anymore

31
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:43,280
there's not much intent to look and find and find the sheep now the shepherd can just

32
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,959
sit back and gaze in a kind of more receptive open

33
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:56,959
uh passive perhaps way of just kind of gazing upon and rather than looking

34
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:04,319
for the sheep the shepherd is content just to see the sheep to allow the seeing to happen without

35
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,920
needing to search or look or be intentional so the same way with mindfulness practice

36
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:18,160
as it initially there's an active quality a the training come back focus be there

37
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:24,240
and and with time everything gets gathered together all the desperate parts of ourselves

38
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,280
that have been lost up in the mountains and wandering around have been gathered

39
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,880
together come back to the pasture where they can kind of

40
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:41,600
eat what's nourishing and supportive the buddha called mindfulness

41
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,440
when it's really gathered in and centered on the body the feelings the mind and the mental

42
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:53,520
processes to be a pastor for the meditator and everything's gathered together here

43
00:04:53,520 --> 00:05:02,080
and now what we can do is we're not so active but we just we just observe there's

44
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,039
there's seeing but no looking in since that looking being the active

45
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,440
engagement of the eyes and seeing is just what happens when we allow the eyes to operate

46
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,840
like a difference between listening which is active and hearing which

47
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:28,639
doesn't have to be active it's just we hear something without trying to hear it

48
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:37,039
so the emphasis today is um is to kind of begin appreciating

49
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:45,199
the the way in which mindfulness can be a passive receptive quality

50
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:52,000
that doesn't require so much work it's not so deliberate because it liberates has brought us to

51
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,880
the point where we can let go of that deliberateness and and so at this point the buddha

52
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,840
actually uses the language of observing just observe

53
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:11,280
and so this is the direction we go today in the meditation

54
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:19,440
so taking a comfortable upright posture

55
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,639
upright meaning engaged and intentional the deliberate posture

56
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:29,840
even if it's laying down

57
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:41,520
and then taking some long slow deliberate breaths deliberate way of

58
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,000
deliberate ritual almost of turning towards this experience here and

59
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,199
now and deliberately as you exhale to relax

60
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,039
the body settle in

61
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:06,000
deep breath in and then settling into this body

62
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:17,840
letting your breathing return to normal and then to

63
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:24,880
as you exhale deliberately bring your attention to different parts of your body

64
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,520
and deliberately actively relax those parts

65
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:39,680
so and sometimes a sense of deliberateness is a way of being definitive or

66
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,720
clear that this is what i'm going to do now is be here in the present moment

67
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:55,599
so bring the attention to the face and relaxing on the exhale

68
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,840
all the muscles of the face

69
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,560
softening around the eyes

70
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:13,840
and if the eyes are trying to look

71
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:22,400
intentionally searching for something maybe let the eyes rest

72
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,840
soften the eyes in their sockets

73
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,839
into as you exhale

74
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:54,480
to soften the chest

75
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:09,839
bring the attention to the shoulders soften the shoulders

76
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:23,839
bring this the attention to the belly and as you exhale softening the belly

77
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,600
and then bringing the attention to the global body whatever way is easy for you

78
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:41,279
to have a global awareness of the body

79
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:51,839
and as you exhale relaxing the body

80
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,720
and there can be a deliberateness around the mind as well

81
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:12,240
to bring your attention to the mind where you feel the mental

82
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,839
activity and thinking the most

83
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:25,519
and as you exhale to soften

84
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:33,839
the mind to quiet the mental activities

85
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:47,839
calming the thinking mind

86
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:55,760
and part of the reason we get pulled into distractions

87
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:04,160
is because there's some emotional force motion emotions that

88
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:14,079
are kind of pushing us in a direction or evoking the thoughts

89
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:22,480
whatever anxiety there might be

90
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,839
see if you can relax it and soften

91
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:38,480
in a way that's reassuring to your selfie it's okay to be here

92
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:43,839
relaxed

93
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:55,600
if there's excitement or desires or aversions or resentments

94
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:03,120
annoyances that are driving your thinking

95
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:13,360
on the exhale perhaps you can gently lovingly settle those

96
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:25,839
quiet those

97
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:05,120
and then to settle into your breathing to deliberately maybe even

98
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,839
lovingly

99
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:21,839
turn your attention over [Music] to the experience of the body breathing

100
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:41,760
making room in your body for the body to breathe just the way it

101
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:48,480
does lots of breathing rumor

102
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:56,399
to breathe as you're breathing as the breathing is breathing itself

103
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:06,800
in whatever way you're breathing is okay make room for it feel it

104
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:17,839
hang in there with it

105
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:18,079
and then imagine that you're at ease resting against the

106
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:23,920
trunk of a tree looking out upon

107
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,240
a pasture perhaps an expanse

108
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,440
and simply see the breathing

109
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:43,120
the receptive allowing non-deliberate way

110
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:47,040
but more receptive way

111
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:55,199
from the kind of observation

112
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:00,000
it doesn't interfere with what's being seen

113
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,959
seeing just allows the breathing to be as it is

114
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:19,040
simply as something to be seen to be observed

115
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,839
as a naturalist would observe

116
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:31,839
animals and nature without disturbing them just observing them

117
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:37,839
without judging them just observing

118
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:48,959
settle down settle back and observe the inhales and the exhales

119
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:56,160
allowing everything else around you to settle down and relax

120
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:05,839
because all you need to do is to observe your breathing

121
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:24,400
when your mind wanders off intentionally deliberately bring it back

122
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:32,960
and then when you're back see if you can relax the deliberateness

123
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:42,000
to observe to just sit back and watch observe the breathing

124
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:46,880
observe your experience in the present

125
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:54,440
moment as an uninvolved

126
00:23:54,440 --> 00:24:05,840
non-interfering observer just observing

127
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:05,039
when we actively are intentionally deliberately

128
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:13,679
looking we might not notice the things we're not

129
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:20,480
looking for but when we're seeing settling back

130
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:28,399
opening up relaxing we might see a wider range of things the observation

131
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:35,840
the observing might be broad and more inclusive

132
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,440
as we come to the end of this sitting i'd like to say the same thing is true

133
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:49,360
for love it's wonderful as

134
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:56,559
intentional deliberate love and acts of love can be

135
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:05,360
there is loving which is not so deliberate intentional

136
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:13,039
it's more of an open field like observing

137
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:21,279
just observing the scenery there's something about

138
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:27,840
love when it's not directed not so deliberate

139
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:35,200
that can grow wide and broad and encompass so much more

140
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,640
than what we're direct directing our love towards

141
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:50,559
and so with our good will to bring these two together love and

142
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:56,880
observation to settle back and just observe the

143
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:04,559
the layout the scenery the broad open non-interfering way

144
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:11,120
can make room for our love to be the same

145
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:18,960
broad expansive encompassing without interfering

146
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:24,080
without directing without needing

147
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:31,279
sitting in with our trunk our back against the trunk of the tree

148
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:38,960
looking out across the pasture with a love a good will a kindness

149
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:47,840
for it all the full expanse of love

150
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:59,440
so in the last moments of this sitting perhaps you can feel your way or

151
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:06,960
to a way of kindness good will love which needs

152
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:14,480
nothing from others which is secure in itself

153
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:22,320
that can just be broad and encompassing at all

154
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:29,200
broad and non-interfering kindness good will

155
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:37,840
expressed in the words may all beings be happy

156
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:46,398
may all beings be safe

157
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:54,480
may all beings be peaceful

158
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:05,840
may all beings be free

159
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:16,240
and resting in this kind of goodwill

160
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:23,840
may we deliberately express this good will

161
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:29,039
in some of the details of our contact with other people

162
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:39,120
may we live this day for the benefit of others

163
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:47,840
and for ourselves

164
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
okay

165
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:46,720
okay so

166
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:54,960
we continue with this series of talks on the 16 steps of mindfulness of breathing

167
00:32:54,960 --> 00:33:03,200
and we're now coming into the last tetrad that i tried on um

168
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:10,399
observation on observing the last tetrad is the last steps

169
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:16,880
13 14 15 and 16 and they have in common all four steps

170
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:25,039
the introduction of a new verb a new and that's the verb to observe

171
00:33:25,039 --> 00:33:32,320
and it goes something like this one trains to observe x

172
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,960
or tr on trains observing x when breathes in

173
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:49,200
when trains observing x when it breathes out and so in these last four steps there's

174
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,159
something we're observing and and we continue with the breathing

175
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:04,240
and there's something about the continuity of mindfulness or breathing which is allowing us to observe things

176
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,358
but helping us not latch onto them helping us not to cling or hold on

177
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,760
there's a kind of way in which by staying with the breathing there's a continual kind of letting go

178
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:23,200
that breathing is where the mind is resting and we notice all kinds of things happen but in a

179
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,240
certain way we're kind of letting go of our involvement letting go of any prioritization or

180
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,919
doing anything with it or changing it or or thinking about it

181
00:34:33,919 --> 00:34:39,919
we're just kind of going along with the breathing going back to the breath being with the breath and it's a way of keeping

182
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:44,960
ourselves soft fluid relaxed letting go

183
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:50,720
and allowing the psycho physical system and have a break from our active

184
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,480
involvement our active deliberate kind of engagement and doing and wanting

185
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:02,560
and uh and letting something deeper to happen that could only happen if we get out of the way

186
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:08,400
and so in these last four steps this is uh represents represented very

187
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:15,119
strongly by the work this verb to observe the idea of observing

188
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:23,200
and it's the first time in the panasati this discourse 16 steps where observing comes into play

189
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:28,400
and and if you go if you read through the

190
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,200
teachings of the buddha in the suttas we see that most commonly observing as a

191
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:41,440
practice is a very well developed practice when the mind is able to be really centered

192
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:49,200
in the present concentrated a strongly concentrated present mind is the one that begins

193
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:54,960
doing the practice of observing and um so there's a lot of preparation in in

194
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,240
the 16 steps you know the first 12 are preparing ourselves for

195
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:05,440
this capacity to to lean back and just kind of watch and just observe

196
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,920
what's happening without being involved some translators translate this this

197
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,839
verb anupasati as contemplating and

198
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:25,359
contemplating uh in in the way that i relate to that word is closer to

199
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:31,599
thinking reflecting about something thinking about something it suggests a kind of more active

200
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:36,960
thinking process observing which is actually the etymologically

201
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:44,400
what the word that anupasati the prefix means towards something and the pasati

202
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,760
means to see seeing and uh and so put him together

203
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:57,920
we're we're gazing onto something seeing looking towards something in a sense and

204
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:05,040
but because of this uh i think observing works very well as a as a translation

205
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,960
we're observing and observing does there is a kind of deliberateness kind of uh

206
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:19,040
uh in observing but it's not quite the same as as actively looking

207
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:25,119
it's just settling back and just being being an observer and i liken it to being a naturalist who

208
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:30,720
goes into some kind of natural setting to observe some natural behavior of animals or

209
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:39,200
birds or something and it's very important that the naturalist not interfere with a life there and

210
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:46,400
somehow stay kind of unrecognized by what's happening so they watch nature unfold without the

211
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:52,640
interference from the humans and just but and then just to observe

212
00:37:52,800 --> 00:38:01,440
and so earlier in in these 16 steps it begins with

213
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:06,480
breathing in one nose one is breathing in breathing out one nose or breathing out

214
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,359
so this idea of knowing is one of the attentional faculties we have to know

215
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:20,640
as we begin knowing the breath and no we never stop knowing the breath we recognize with breath we bear with the breathing

216
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:26,160
but then we're also what's happening we're experiencing things we're experiencing the body

217
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:33,119
we're experiencing joy and happiness we're experiencing the mind we're experiencing gladness we're

218
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,800
experiencing subtleness steady concentration and we're experiencing

219
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:45,920
uh liberation and this experiencing is also a little bit passive it isn't that receptive it isn't

220
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:52,240
so much like we're doing something we're just allowing yourself to experience knowing also

221
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,560
we're just knowing something and we're not judging it or criticizing it we're just knowing it clearly

222
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:04,160
and these two activities of knowing and experiencing are here to ground us here in the

223
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,280
present moment and so at some point then it shifts to

224
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,560
just observing and and so this is where the art of

225
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:20,079
deeper mindfulness is to observe and um in the other mindfulness

226
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:25,920
discourse of the buddha the sati patana there there's a lot of language of

227
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:33,520
observing and there also if you read the text carefully it's there the observing is the higher stages

228
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:41,359
of mindfulness that's where observation comes in and and so it was earlier

229
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:47,119
than knowing the experiencing is kind of grounding us in the present moment helping us stay present

230
00:39:47,119 --> 00:39:53,200
learning to develop concentration to be resting in the present and when the ability to be focused and

231
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,359
present in the moment is becomes easy and light and we feel really grounded and

232
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:04,880
centered here that is when observation becomes stronger

233
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:10,400
and because we're going towards being less and less

234
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,079
intentional deliberate even less and less

235
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:24,560
activated or active in the mind because the more activated we are in the

236
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:32,319
mind the more kind of waves or agitation or clouds there are over our capacity to see clearly

237
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:39,359
and so as we get quieter and quieter and quieter what we're left with is this ability

238
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:46,640
just to observe and then we learn to trust that to settle back okay now i'm just observing

239
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:52,480
i'm not needing to interfere or again not judging i don't have to fix anything or adjust

240
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,520
anything or make anything different i'm just just watch just watch

241
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,640
and you can feel that in this kind of very centered place that

242
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:10,240
if we start reaching out to do something to fix something to judge something or think about something

243
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:16,000
it feels a little bit like we're losing something we're losing the open field we're out losing the

244
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:22,240
freedom we're losing the peacefulness of just observing and so it's very clear that observing

245
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:27,680
is a better place to be in this deeper states of meditation

246
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:34,240
and it becomes very important in these final steps because we really want to get out of the

247
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,760
way and not overlay concepts ideas

248
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:46,880
judgments should shouldn'ts on top of our experience we want to really be able to take it in

249
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,359
things much closer to actually how they're perceived now actually how before the experience

250
00:41:53,359 --> 00:42:01,680
before a lot of judgments and concepts and generalizations that we make about things just to observe just to observe

251
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:08,800
and so uh so there's a turning

252
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,839
with this last tetrad from the practices that are more meant to

253
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:22,079
be concentrating settling focusing to now we're switching to vipassana

254
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,560
observing is uh where the personal insight practice begins

255
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,880
and uh and classically inside practice is built or or is done

256
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,960
on the foundation of of a mind which has gotten very stable

257
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:47,920
concentrated still joyful happy soft at ease

258
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,400
content safe and liberated from the hindrances

259
00:42:54,400 --> 00:43:02,800
and and so and now the mind is ready for inside practice and the inside

260
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:09,839
practice is built on this capacity just to observe just observe the experience and

261
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:16,880
in fact vipassana the word that we translate as insight has the same

262
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:25,359
verbal root as anupasana vipassana and and pasuna in vipassana

263
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:32,000
again means to see and the v is usually understood to be a prefix here meaning um

264
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,400
to see clearly or to see in a it's kind of a prefix of emphasis to really see or

265
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:45,359
clearly see or to observe to clearly observe to clearly

266
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:51,200
be aware so um

267
00:43:53,119 --> 00:44:00,000
to observe and that's the that's the medium through which

268
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,440
we're going to explore these next four sets of practices of mindfulness of

269
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,599
breathing then someone asks why is vipassana often

270
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:21,440
taught as an intro to mindfulness it also works that way and it doesn't

271
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:26,720
have to be done only um with the strong base of concentration

272
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:33,440
and um and so it can be done at fact practice directly but a lot of what people are doing when

273
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:40,800
it's practiced directly and immediately is sorting their way through all the ways in which they are not concentrated

274
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:48,000
and so they're beginning to become wise about the hindrances about distractions and and so rather than kind of more

275
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:53,839
directly getting concentrated there's a concentration through a lot of understanding and wisdom

276
00:44:53,839 --> 00:45:00,640
about all the things that keep us going distractedly so then we can settle and

277
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,920
and with wisdom rather than settling with sometimes they say settling with faith

278
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:11,119
when person just is dedicated just being simple and focused

279
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:17,040
and but sooner or later if you start with mindfulness the

280
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,800
concentration is brought in and mindfulness and concentration become partners

281
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,280
if we start more of the concentration then later mindfulness is brought in so they become the partners

282
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:36,800
so both are true and both are valuable and this anapanasati

283
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,680
can be seen as kind of a hybrid of these two with a lot of emphasis on the settling

284
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,520
relaxing concentrating that that sets a stage for

285
00:45:51,520 --> 00:46:01,119
a strong mindfulness so thank you all very much
