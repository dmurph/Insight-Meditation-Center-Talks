00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:07,040
So hello and welcome to this morning meditation

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:12,400
and for

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:18,880
we're in the middle of this series on insight and coming to the part of insight meditation

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:27,119
insight practice where we're looking at um the amazing poly word

5
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:34,079
pronounced duka And uh as I'll talk more about it, it's an adjective.

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,360
And um and in English uh sometimes

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:47,840
there's um the preposition before one translation of duka is suffering and

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,920
the word that sometimes precedes it is suffering with or follows it. someone

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:02,000
suffers with something and um and what I'm trying to say here

10
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,680
is that um and in poly it's an adjective.

11
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:15,360
It's always something that is painful.

12
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:23,439
And when there's something pain something that's painful there's also something which is not painful.

13
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:30,438
When there's suffering, there's also that which is not suffering.

14
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,799
When there is affliction, there's also that which is not afflicted.

15
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,400
When there is something with suffering, suffering with something

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:50,320
that uh it is um there's that which is not suffering, not with suffering. And

17
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:55,840
so this in this meeting of what is suffering, what is not suffering is a

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:02,560
fascinating place. And um and sometimes we emphasize things

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:11,280
are either one way or another. But in the dharma, it's helpful to think of them as uh as not either or, but there's

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,800
an and. And the dharma happens in the and the

21
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:26,959
and in between. It's it's not just suffering and it's not just happiness. There's an and

22
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,120
suffering and that which is not suffering. Happiness and that which is not happy.

23
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,519
Exactly. But it's not yet suffering either. It's that that's even happier than

24
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:45,519
happiness. That and that is freer of sufferer of

25
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,959
suffering. So to have a meeting

26
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:56,800
to feel where things are stressful, tense, uncomfortable

27
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,360
and know it with a knowing that is free of

28
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:10,640
suffering, knowing that's free of stress, knowing that is free of of um

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:17,280
contraction, tension in relationship to it. that meeting place of what is

30
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,120
suffering, what is not suffering. Look for that in this meditation.

31
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,440
And uh don't try to have it one way or the other. Don't try to have it only no

32
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:35,760
suffering. Don't try to only focus on suffering. But try to find the place

33
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,840
where then that which doesn't suffer can meet what is suffering. So that the in

34
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:49,440
the end you can find stability in the end you can find a steadiness

35
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,280
in the end you can find freedom even

36
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:01,879
so to assume a meditation posture

37
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:10,319
and to gently close your eyes and take a few moments to feel your

38
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:19,079
posture. ure and maybe swaying back and forth.

39
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,639
Kind of adjusting the positioning of your weight in your

40
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:34,400
body to find a feeling of balance

41
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,040
with your posture.

42
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:47,360
loosening up places of holding. I was long ago was taught when I did Zen

43
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:52,960
to um flap my elbows a little bit when I'm sitting cross-legged or sitting in

44
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:59,120
the chair to loosen up any subtle ways the arms

45
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,600
are being held.

46
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,280
I've also been taught to gently kind of

47
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:20,840
uh shake or move the fingers so they can loosen up. The hands can loosen up.

48
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,600
Sometimes it's nice to

49
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,280
rotate the head a little bit. Sometimes just like almost like you're saying no,

50
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,400
but not to say no to anything, but rather to loosen up

51
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:47,240
in the neck, maybe in the shoulders.

52
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:01,360
And then gently taking some deeper breaths.

53
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,800
And on the exhale softening the whole body

54
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,680
on the exhale like the whole weight of the body can settle

55
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,960
into the pull of gravity.

56
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:50,199
And then to let your breathing return to normal.

57
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:01,919
And with a normal exhale, relax different parts of your body.

58
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:06,919
Soften in the body.

59
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:32,560
With the exhale, softening

60
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:40,240
some of your tension or holding in your

61
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,720
thinking mind.

62
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,279
And then to settle into your breathing

63
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:42,479
or to settle into the present moment here

64
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,440
in the body this time and place

65
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:58,120
in whatever way allows you to feel a settling, stabilizing

66
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,800
and entering into a fullness of this moment.

67
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,720
A fullness with the body breathing

68
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,200
And to

69
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,519
soften, relax.

70
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:35,800
how you're aware, how you're mindful,

71
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,839
but clear, being aware clearly,

72
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,440
knowing clearly

73
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,200
the present moment experience.

74
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:03,920
So the sense of present mo present moment knowing

75
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:11,800
present moment awareness is valued is appreciated

76
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:20,959
is its own thing that's being established

77
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:29,839
separate from being entangled with thoughts emotions s

78
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:38,120
attitudes. Entering into

79
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,200
knowing awareness mindfulness

80
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:52,519
of the present moment with every breath.

81
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:17,120
And if there's any strain, tension in how you're aware, how you're

82
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:22,880
mindful, see if you can

83
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:29,639
soften, relax,

84
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:37,240
open up. How you're aware There.

85
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,560
There is breathing and there's how you're aware of

86
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,560
breathing.

87
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,839
And then noticing

88
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,560
that in the meeting of breathing breathing

89
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:06,399
and awareness. Notice if there's any part of that

90
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:11,680
experience where there's an absence

91
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:18,360
of suffering, tension, stress.

92
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,199
Notice that absence.

93
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:37,560
Breathe with that absence.

94
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,920
Open to that absence.

95
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:35,839
And then as we continue, if there's any if you're feeling any

96
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:40,880
suffering, any stress,

97
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:48,519
tension, emotional pain.

98
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:58,320
Allow it to be there, but let it be there in the meeting place

99
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:04,360
with what is not stressful, what is not suffering.

100
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:13,760
Don't lean into suffering or hold on to it or react to

101
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:19,959
it. Let it coexist

102
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:24,918
with awareness which is not suffering.

103
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:37,880
Let it coexist with something here that has no strain in it. No tension.

104
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:25,520
Rather than feeling or believing that

105
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,039
suffering, uneasiness

106
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:36,120
is global global experience.

107
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:42,919
It's always a partial experience

108
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:51,960
where a global experience includes that which is not suffering.

109
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,600
And with this practice of mindfulness,

110
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,559
hold them both together.

111
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:23,080
The meeting place of suffering and non-suffering.

112
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:35,880
and then leaving suffering alone.

113
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:43,000
Any uneasiness you might feel, however subtle, leave it alone.

114
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:50,240
And settle into some of the feelings, characteristics

115
00:22:50,240 --> 00:23:00,120
of that which doesn't suffer. Maybe there's a feeling of spaciousness.

116
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,520
Stability,

117
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,840
stillness,

118
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,039
openness,

119
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,600
aliveness.

120
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,799
Enter into

121
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:56,919
that which doesn't suffer and breathe with it. Feel it. Sense it.

122
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,480
Let it grow and spread.

123
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:51,679
And as we come to the end of this sitting, may it be that the practice of

124
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,880
mindfulness shows us

125
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,880
how not to be afraid of suffering.

126
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:13,360
May it show us how to be how to show up for s the suffering we have the

127
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:22,360
sufferings other ha other people have to meet it to know it

128
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,799
without suffering.

129
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:40,400
to meet suffering in a mature, honest way. With that part of us that has stability

130
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:48,679
and openness, receptivity, that doesn't suffer.

131
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,080
And may this ability to meet suffering

132
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:11,640
our own and the suffering of the world, may it allow

133
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:21,279
for for us to meet the suffering of the world, to meet our own suffering. ing

134
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:27,480
with love, with wisdom,

135
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,600
with compassion and care.

136
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,960
May we find a new way to be with suffering

137
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:51,400
that can transform the world,

138
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,158
transform ourselves

139
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:06,799
to make this a peaceful world, a safe world.

140
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:13,240
A world where happiness and care and love can flow.

141
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:20,960
A world where we feel free. We can breathe freely and easily

142
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,799
and be at ease with each other.

143
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,720
May all beings be happy. May all beings

144
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:40,480
be safe. May all beings be peaceful.

145
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,559
May all beings be free.

Thank you.

149
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,640
So, hello everyone and welcome to this series on insight. And

150
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,840
it's um we're now into the second half of the year. And

151
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:20,640
what we're in what I'm introducing this week is um built on all that we've done

152
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,360
the first half of the year. So this is not out of the blue. It's not meant to be

153
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,080
self-standing. It's meant to have a phenomenal support that we're ready to

154
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:42,679
bring mindfulness to uh to excuse me

155
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:50,960
we're ready to bring mindfulness to that part of our life that's quite difficult

156
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:56,799
uh to the world that the Buddhist English Buddhists call suffering

157
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:03,039
and uh an essential Part of Buddhist practice is a mature, clear, honest

158
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:09,360
encounter with suffering, with stress, with tension, with um the emotional

159
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:16,320
difficulties of our life, the ways that life can be so uh challenging for for

160
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:23,679
all of us and how to be able to meet that in an effective and useful way. to be able to

161
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:31,919
be present and not uh collapse in the face of challenges. To meet it and stay

162
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:39,440
in some way strong and open. to meet it and not be defined by the suffering, not

163
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:45,039
be overwhelmed by it, not be um

164
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:52,159
uh confused by it, but to be able to really be present for it um in a clear,

165
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:59,520
effective, and honest way so that we find our way to freedom. So we find a a

166
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:05,200
radically different way to be with suffering than how ordinarily we might

167
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:11,440
be. And um and so

168
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:19,360
uh to hear this emphasis and come ready hopefully many of you who've been doing this now for six months this feel like

169
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,360
you have this is in the background to be able to uh meet this in a new way. So

170
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:34,159
the the word for s uh that we translate by suffering is duka in in the ancient

171
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:41,919
language of the Buddha poly we call it the way it comes to us and uh duka d u k

172
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:48,399
k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h j is in the ancient language is actually an adjective

173
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:55,120
whereas the English word suffering uh is usually considered a noun.

174
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:03,760
kind of maybe a verbal noun but a noun. And um but in in poly it's an adjective.

175
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:10,799
So that very different. It's um it uh means that it's always referring to

176
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:18,320
something. It's a characteristic of something. It's not its own thing. It's not its own

177
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:28,000
event that's there. And um so a little bit uh uh maybe uh demotes

178
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:34,640
the word suffering from how it can be seen as being this grand uh catastrophic

179
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,919
kind of catastro catastrophic kind of thing that is so big.

180
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,720
Um uh so the literal polyme of the word

181
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:54,159
suffering is painful. uh uh and it doesn't uh distinguish

182
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:03,200
between emotional pain and uh physical pain. Uh it's whatever is painful and

183
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:10,640
human life has pain in it. But the Buddhist orientation is to uh give uh

184
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:17,200
extra attention to the emotional pain that that we might experience because

185
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:24,720
the emotional pain is uh uh or the psychological pain that

186
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:32,320
part of the pain that we feel that um in one way or the other we are contributing

187
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:39,039
to. We're not necessarily responsible for our suffering, but there is a way in

188
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:45,360
which we contribute to it and that adds to it that makes it much

189
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:51,600
more difficult. There are certain forms of emotional pain which um comes with

190
00:33:51,600 --> 00:34:00,080
being a human being. Uh to grieve is painful. But it's not ne it's not wrong

191
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:05,120
to feel that pain. There's something sacred about grief and about that pain

192
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:12,158
of grief uh that's very tender and very human to experience and make room for and allow for.

193
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:21,358
And it's not it's fairly easy to be able to add uh a degree of stress tension that's not

194
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,358
necessary to it. And we can suffer more by how what we contribute to it. the

195
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,040
fear, the resistance, the the u collapsing into it, the excessive

196
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:40,800
reactivity to it, the the heavy beliefs that we live under around what we're

197
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,638
experiencing. So, we have a contribution that we we we make.

198
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:54,158
And so the duka as an adjective is the uh the stressfulness, the painfulness,

199
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:59,200
the uh tenseness that uh we contribute

200
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:07,040
to whatever the experience it might be. And it's um

201
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:13,119
it's uh maybe um challenging to to talk about our

202
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:20,960
contribution because then we feel like maybe that we're wrong or that we did something a

203
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,440
mistake or that somehow now I'm being blamed for the suffering that I have.

204
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:33,200
And that is not what we're trying to do here uh at all. We're actually trying to

205
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:39,119
free us from this complic comp more complicated way of interpreting and

206
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:44,480
concluding what who we are, what we are, what's going on here and learn how to be

207
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:49,760
very simple, very quiet and simple so that we can

208
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,280
feel the the the ways in which we add

209
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,200
stress, the way where there's tension, the way in which there's um um

210
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:07,920
suffering. uffering uh that can be met with with that which

211
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,880
doesn't suffer that can be met with something that uh holds it caringly,

212
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,079
compassionately, openly, some way of holding it. So there's a peacefulness.

213
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:27,359
We don't add second arrows. We don't add ways that we make it worse.

214
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:32,480
uh if anything we're what we're adding is how to be how to make it better for

215
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,280
ourselves in relationship to suffering. So some people uh translate the word

216
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:45,440
duka as stress and the advantage of that is that it doesn't that's that's not

217
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:52,560
such a big word and it's not necessarily so automatically tied to our psychology

218
00:36:52,560 --> 00:37:00,480
to our identity uh that it sometimes does if it's the word suffering and stress is kind of an

219
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,720
inherent part of human life as well and it maybe it's easier to appreciate

220
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:13,280
that stress is extra and that uh we can kind of work with our

221
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:18,320
stress in a in a responsible way to

222
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:25,839
de-stress. And the advantage of stress as a translation of dooka is that as the

223
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:32,079
samadei gets really strong as the meditation goes really deep and full uh

224
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:38,000
we wouldn't call it suffering anymore what's there but we can feel very subtle

225
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,920
tension very subtle stress uh that's maybe even right in the midst of feeling

226
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,359
a lot of joy right in the midst of feeling a lot of happiness right in the

227
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:55,839
midst of in a very subtle way in the midst of feeling a lot of peace.

228
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,599
And um and so to feel that stress, to feel the subtlest little pieces of

229
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:09,359
tension uh is part of the onward leading nature of freedom. And even there to

230
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:16,000
find tension and stress in the subtlest in the deepest kind of peaceful states

231
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:22,000
of meditation uh expands the fullness of that which

232
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,359
doesn't suffer. the experience of freedom of openness, the absence of

233
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:33,599
suffering into which we can um fall into

234
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:38,960
which we can open.

235
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:45,119
So um so the idea that uh duka

236
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:51,200
is not its own thing. It's an adjective

237
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:58,160
that means that it's part of something which means that suffering is never the

238
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,200
whole thing. That it's always a piece of our

239
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:08,640
humanity. It's a section. It's a it's an aspect of it. And and I know that

240
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:18,480
sometimes the whole atmosphere, the whole world can just feel distressing and fearful and and u dis you know

241
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,000
dismaying and difficult and the weight of the world can be on our shoulders.

242
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,040
The idea in a mindfulness practice is to practice with the world that we have,

243
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:34,800
the experience we have. Not to make it worse, not to suffer more because of it,

244
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,240
but to be able to find some degree of stability, steadiness,

245
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:45,359
stillness, some ability of clarity, clear

246
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:50,800
awareness. So, we begin to recognize there's always

247
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:57,440
more going on here than whatever it is we're calling suffering, whatever it is

248
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,560
that's painful for us, emotionally painful, physically painful,

249
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:09,599
and to um and to begin to feel that which is more, feel that which is not

250
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:17,599
suffering. So that so we can be with suffering in a mature, responsible,

251
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,880
caring way and a wise way. And what uh

252
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,480
uh when there's enough stability, enough ability to meet suffering without adding

253
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:35,839
second arrows, without making it worse, then the hope is that uh we have we can

254
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:41,599
think more wisely, more clearly about it and know how to address it

255
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,800
appropriately. And sometimes uh something needs to be

256
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:51,839
fixed, something needs to be addressed. Sometimes we need to speak to someone or

257
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:59,440
take care of something or do something. Sometimes we need to take a break or we need to kind of find relief. We need to

258
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,040
find a vacation. We need to find some way to um even occasionally to distract

259
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:10,640
ourselves so that something can relax and e be easeful. But it's never meant

260
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:18,079
to be an escape. Buddhism is not Buddhist practice is not an escape from suffering. It's to learn how to work

261
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:24,560
with suffering in a wise way. And there comes a time when the

262
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,720
meditation, when the mindfulness, the practice is strong when the

263
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:37,920
best strategy is to learn to suffer better.

264
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,160
And that's a a provocative statement to suffer better. What I mean by that is

265
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,000
not to just suffer for the sake of suffering. Suffering better is to suffer

266
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:55,760
in a way that's wise. Suffer so there's less suffering. Suffering so that

267
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,440
suffering is met with that which doesn't suffer. Suffering is felt is only part

268
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,880
of the picture. something we can breathe with, something we can find our ease with, something we can practice with.

269
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:15,280
Where the idea of practice, we identify more with us as a practitioner of peace,

270
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,280
of mindfulness, of clarity, of stability, of calm, then we than we

271
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:27,520
identify with whatever suffering we have. We can meet our suffering

272
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,680
with that with that which doesn't suffer. And if we can't

273
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,200
to be mindful and clear about that, it's okay.

274
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:45,359
If we can't be together with our suffering in a clear and useful way because we're

275
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:50,640
spiraling out, then the appropriate thing to do is to find another way. Then

276
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:58,640
mindfulness is not the way at that moment. Then it's to do something, shift something. Uh go for a walk, talk to our

277
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:03,920
friend. um um you know maybe do some

278
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:11,520
exercise or occasionally as I said we distract ourselves so that we retreat

279
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,880
only so we can come back later and begin addressing the edges of what is

280
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,640
difficult and not to address it to try to fix it

281
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:30,079
but rather to um to uh and this is the amazing thing about this practice is uh

282
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:36,079
we're not trying to fix something but we're trying to find our freedom with it.

283
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:42,800
Find our freedom with suffering not be and so that suffering and that

284
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,960
which doesn't suffer can meet each other and there and that and between them

285
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:57,040
that's where we find our freedom. So thank you very much and um we'll

286
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:02,800
continue this topic of insight into uh suffering.

287
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,040
Thank you.
