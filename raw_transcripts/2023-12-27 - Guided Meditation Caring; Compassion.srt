1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:07,839
welcome everyone welcome to the morning meditation I'm really enjoying being

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:14,160
with you and reading the chat greetings from everyone to

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:21,600
everyone this week is dedicated to cultivating wholesome beautiful states

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:29,599
of mind yesterday we discussed meta the Brahma vihara or Divine Abode

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:36,440
of goodwi friendliness loving kindness It's a wholesome inclination of

6
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:43,079
mind that can meet all of experience as well as a healthy way to

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:50,120
relate to ourselves and others when goodwi meets suffering it

8
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:56,600
manifests as Compassion or karuna in the ancient poly

9
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:02,239
language compassion is many things but it's a

10
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:10,040
sympathetic vibration of the heart or response of the heart that knows looking

11
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,960
at someone else's suffering that if we had the same conditions we would be

12
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:24,360
struggling in the same ways and compassion wishes for suffering to

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,240
end it's a practice that helps us grow beyond the self-concern that can keep us

14
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:38,799
wrapped up in the problems and suffering struggle stress dissatisfaction in our own

15
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,520
lives and if we're fortunate enough not to be experiencing difficulty compassion

16
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:53,640
practice helps us prepare for the future pain or suffering that's likely to occur

17
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:01,840
when we experience loss sickness aging death

18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:09,520
this is a time of year that can seem to magnify excuse me magnify the suffering

19
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:17,000
that we see around us and make clear the need for

20
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,640
compassion the disparities to which The Human Condition subjects people stand

21
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,879
out really strongly to people many people lately in particular

22
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:38,000
disparity surrounds us there's abundant wealth and there's crushing deprivation

23
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,519
Everywhere You Look Around the Globe and this was true at the time of

24
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,879
the Buddha two about 2500 years ago it's been true ever

25
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:56,480
since so there are ways that the Brahma vihara practices of loving

26
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:04,360
kindness compassion sympathetic Joy joy and equinity can support us in growing

27
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:11,000
our ability to feel compassion for all of what happens to ourselves and our

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,360
fellow human beings and fellow beings of all kinds on this

29
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:25,040
planet it helps us to stop and realize what suffering actually is and how it

30
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,560
affects all of life and as we progress through these

31
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:38,480
practices will also touch into how to hold it all with a balanced mind and

32
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:44,799
heart so that we're not crushed with despair looking at all of

33
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:51,040
this meditation practice and mindfulness in everyday life develop the heart and

34
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,239
mind in the direction of compassion and bit by bit we build this

35
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:03,920
capacity to be present and not a void or look away or pretend intense suffering

36
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:13,159
isn't happening as with the other Divine abodes we can also deliberately practice

37
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:19,639
compassion starting where it's relatively more doable or more uh we

38
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:26,520
have an ability to do it without succumbing to grief so with that let's

39
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,599
begin our meditation today

40
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,240
settling

41
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,759
in perhaps starting with a few long slow deep

42
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,720
breaths allowing the out breath to release any tension from the

43
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,600
body that can be let

44
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:28,560
go and letting the breathing return to whatever is normal for you there's no

45
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,880
special kind of Brea breathing needed for this

46
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:51,319
practice giving yourself time to find a comfortable way of

47
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:59,720
sitting standing or lying down that is also alert and it's okay during Brahma power

48
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:05,240
of practice to adjust the posture when you need

49
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:12,199
to during the course of our sitting being uncomfortable does not

50
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:21,639
support wholesome states of Mind especially if it causes pain that

51
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,440
lasts so taking time and bringing ease and

52
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:31,400
care to the body

53
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,560
the heart and the

54
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:55,080
mind receiving whatever is present whatever arises as it becomes

55
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:01,400
prominent in awareness

56
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:16,080
allowing it time and space to be known no need to

57
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,879
rush no need to go out looking for experience just allowing it to arrive in

58
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:28,479
its own way and no need to push anything away

59
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,360
there's no right or wrong thing occurring in

60
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,240
meditation awareness receives everything

61
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:51,680
equally and if there are difficult or unpleasant experiences that present

62
00:07:51,680 --> 00:08:01,319
themselves in Awareness meeting them with the kind of care you might offer a good

63
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:27,720
friend offering compassion to whatever difficulties arise during

64
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:37,120
meditation during the day perhaps with the silent wish may this difficulty come to an

65
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:51,160
end not as a demand or an agenda simply as a gentle

66
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:57,720
wish may it be so may this difficulty come to an

67
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
end

68
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,120
receiving the pleasant the unpleasant and experiences that are

69
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:39,120
neither Pleasant nor unpleasant receiving an all with care

70
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:41,399
with

71
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:06,560
kindness during this this meditation if if it fits for you I'll offer a practice of sending

72
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:13,519
compassion to a living friend you can pick someone with whom

73
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:21,680
you have an uncomplicated good relationship whom you know to be

74
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,560
struggling a little dissatisfied perhaps

75
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:34,440
suffering and if this does not suit where you are in meditation simply let

76
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:42,959
my voice Fade Into the background and continue in whatever way

77
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,399
suits

78
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:57,360
you for those who wish to engage in this compassion practice bring to mind the friend whom

79
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:04,920
you know to be having some difficulty perhaps not the worst

80
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:12,959
suffering or situations uh that tend to pull you into reactive emotions pick

81
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:19,560
something simpler to start with and when you're

82
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:26,560
ready letting your mind and heart fill with images and memories of

83
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,959
this person

84
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:44,399
a felt sense of what it's like to be with

85
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:53,040
them bringing to mind their

86
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,440
goodness and then seeing them in their current

87
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:10,639
struggle and noticing how they are in the face of that

88
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:29,600
difficulty and as you fill the heart and mind with them inclining your mind to

89
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,760
wishes of compassion without any agenda to fix

90
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:41,760
your friend without any idea that their suffering has to go away as a result of

91
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:50,320
your meditation not solving their problems accepting them just as they

92
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,560
are right

93
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:05,360
now and then perhaps taking in the following

94
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:12,480
phrases seeing which resonate with you for your

95
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:22,000
friend you can simply receive them hear them or you can silently

96
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,760
repeat them radiating them towards your

97
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
friend

98
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,160
I care about you your suffering matters to

99
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:53,199
me may you open to this difficulty with gentleness and compassion for

100
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
yourself

101
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:10,000
may you meet this suffering with ease and

102
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
kindness

103
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,600
may you be free of stress and

104
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,000
suffering perhaps continuing to repeat these

105
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:10,480
phrases or other phrases that come to your mind as expressions of

106
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:15,759
compassion for your friend without solving their

107
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:22,720
problems may you open to this difficulty with gentleness and

108
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:33,199
compassion may you be free of stress and

109
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:45,720
suffering and continuing either with phrases or with a felt sense of caring

110
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:51,759
and compassion as we continue the meditation in

111
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
silence

112
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:08,189
[Music]

113
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:36,440
and an invitation it's traditional uh to

114
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:43,399
continue meditating as you hear Reflections like the ones that I'll offer so you're

115
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:50,120
welcome to continue to receive experience as it arises in the body the

116
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:55,679
heart and the mind as I offer these

117
00:30:55,679 --> 00:31:03,200
comments and then you can see what sticks from the reflections I I used to

118
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:11,279
make an effort to take two or three things from each of Gill's talks for many years that I could

119
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:16,399
practice with during the day or during the week so the whole 45 minutes could

120
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:23,360
be considered a meditation so uh the poly word karuna is

121
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:28,600
translated as compassion and it's what good will or

122
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:35,639
loving kindness feels when it encounters suffering it wants the suffering to

123
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:42,200
end Gil has written that compassion is sometimes referred to as the jewel in

124
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:50,840
the Lotus the Lotus symbolizes the heart or mind that with practice blossoms into

125
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:56,679
freedom and the Jewel represents the compassion appearing in the center of

126
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:01,840
this blossom so that's how important this is in this

127
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:08,080
practice we can cultivate this wholehearted caring for anyone who's

128
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:15,440
suffering for ourselves and for others and compassion is not pity it

129
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:23,840
doesn't look down on suffering from a position of privilege when we practice compassion

130
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:31,399
wholeheartedly we put ourselves into someone else's shoes and we know only too well that if we

131
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:38,120
were living their life with their conditions we would be suffering in the same

132
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:46,880
ways so in addition to sending compassion to those who are innocent um

133
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:52,039
and on the receiving end of difficult conditions that just come with human

134
00:32:52,039 --> 00:32:59,440
life we can also cultivate it for people who are are engaging in unskillful

135
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:07,360
actions that cause harm and this practice does not come automatically or

136
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:15,200
easily it takes time and plenty of mindfulness to get Beyond anger at those

137
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:23,320
who harm others and to begin to see the way that greed hatred and delusion are

138
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:30,639
distorting their minds and their actions it also takes some time to separate the

139
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:38,120
person from their harmful behavior and to see that even if they seem

140
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:45,399
perfectly fine content happy as they perpetrate harm we can know that at some

141
00:33:45,399 --> 00:33:52,080
point their behavior rebounds into enormous suffering for them as well at

142
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:58,039
least in the terms of Liberation from suffering from from

143
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:04,399
harm so in terms of the full practice of the Dharma full liberation of our hearts

144
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:11,638
and Minds until we can grow to cultivate the compassionate wish for all people

145
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:17,118
all beings to come to the end of suffering suffering will not end among

146
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,480
human beings of course we can certainly take

147
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,560
action in the world um to bring harmful behaviors to an end

148
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,040
so true compassion especially if we decide to support or help another person

149
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:40,638
or group of people has this ability to differentiate we work at differentiating

150
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:49,079
between what's helpful and what's one's own agenda so it is most helpful to begin

151
00:34:49,079 --> 00:34:54,320
with respect listening to the person or the

152
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:59,560
people who are suffering and hearing what they might find helpful rather than

153
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:04,760
deciding that we know the solutions to their problems I there's a simple

154
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:10,079
example of this that I guess many people on this Zoom or YouTube have

155
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:15,760
experienced and that is when one member of a couple or family is upset by

156
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,839
something that happened at work or school or in one of their friendships and they tell they come home and they

157
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:29,599
tell someone else or they tell everyone and when somebody instead of listening

158
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:36,599
just listening with care when The Listener jumps into advice giving mode often the

159
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:42,280
person who's sharing either seems to fight back against the advice or grow

160
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:47,480
frustrated in some way very often when somebody's sharing from their heart like

161
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:54,720
this they're really just wanting someone else to understand and hear their situation not to try to solve their

162
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,800
problems for them

163
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:10,200
of course we can also be understandably unhappy about our own past unskillful

164
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:16,760
actions we've been if we've been around for a few decades there's probably something we've done that we've

165
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:22,920
regretted and we can cultivate an expansiveness or an inclusivity of heart

166
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:29,119
and mind that allow us to be open and be present with the resultant discomfort

167
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:34,319
that's that discomfort is a healthy conscience at work we can move forward

168
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:41,359
into compassion for the ignorance in our own past that led to our harming

169
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:47,480
ourselves or harming others and BEC this is because endless

170
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:53,000
self-punishment won't do the world any good it won't do you any good so

171
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:01,839
recognizing what was harmful and growing towards what is nonharming will help those around us as

172
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,400
well as ourselves release from the suffering and move towards

173
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:15,480
Freedom as we start this process we're using words to begin to embody

174
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:21,680
compassionate wishes uh and sometimes when people hear the word

175
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:26,760
compassion they believe they have to feel highly emotional or kind of almost

176
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:32,880
oozing Compassion or or sentimental and that isn't the case so the word

177
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,400
compassion in one dictionary definition means to feel with but that doesn't mean

178
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:45,000
we jump down into the pit of suffering with someone else the heart and mind can

179
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,319
be moved uh we can care a great deal and

180
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:55,240
still be equanimous a bit

181
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,520
objective um today some of you may have experimented with this practice of

182
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,680
silently saying compassion phrases as I offered that and that can start any of

183
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,760
these practices of Brahma viharas and saying phrases can start as a feeling

184
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,359
like they're just words but over time the more we bring our hearts and our

185
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:26,160
heads together in mindfulness and in meditation the more we see the benefit

186
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,079
of wholesome inclinations of mind the more the heart gradually opens to this

187
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:39,880
and in the process we grow the capacity to be with suffering in a caring way

188
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:46,680
instead of keeping it at arms length at a distance or instead of pitting anyone

189
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:53,280
who is suffering or instead of being hard on ourselves because we're

190
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:00,280
suffering we can start by offering care for the difficulties we're

191
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:06,000
experiencing if that's relatively accessible uh that can provide a

192
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:12,040
reference point from which we can genuinely develop a caring compassion

193
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:20,520
for others um and there's there's a phrase that sort of exemplifies this just as I

194
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:27,119
wish to be happy and free from suffering so may that being may all being

195
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:30,720
be happy and free from

196
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:39,280
suffering excuse me the next person to whom we might

197
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:45,599
traditionally offer silent wishes of compassion might be someone towards whom

198
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,880
you have a loving respectful relationship could be a mentor a valued

199
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,160
teacher or someone who's been completely supportive in your life

200
00:39:57,160 --> 00:40:02,599
um and th by the way this practice is intended to develop to develop your

201
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:07,839
Capac capacity to be compassionate towards the

202
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:13,400
living so when you choose people to whom you'd like to direct these phrases or

203
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:19,000
this feeling pick someone who's alive after being able to offer

204
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:25,839
compassion to someone with whom you have this very supportive relationship that helps develop us

205
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,640
towards being able to offer silent compassion for a friend or a family

206
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:37,119
member someone who we dearly love but maybe we have a relationship that you

207
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:45,720
know has ups and downs the next step in developing compassion to its fullest is to offer

208
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:52,119
compassion to a stranger and this is usually someone you see in your life

209
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:58,359
regularly like a letter carrier or someone whose name you see on this chat

210
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:04,920
but it's someone you don't really know and then the the final stage in

211
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:12,599
formal compassion practice is to direct thoughts of compassion towards people

212
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,720
with whom you have difficulty or you dislike them traditionally it's called

213
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:24,880
the enemy but maybe you don't feel like you have enemies or you might as you become able to do that

214
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:30,240
you're really developing this state of mind that can really understand and kind

215
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:37,440
of get on a visceral level that people are not fixed in their nature nor are

216
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,200
you nothing is everything is in constant and

217
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:50,119
changing sometimes rapidly sometimes very slowly and all conditioned

218
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:56,640
phenomena including the behavior of others it's all subject to suffering or

219
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:03,040
Dua in the poly language it's all has this

220
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:11,359
unsatisfactoriness when we still on some level believe that uh there are things that

221
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,960
can be in this conditioned realm of human existence that can be relied on

222
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:22,680
all the time for happiness or that things will remain stable and satisfying

223
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:29,760
or that they have a fixed nature that we can use as a sense of security as long

224
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:35,760
as we believe on any of that and sometimes we don't even know it but underneath we do believe that we

225
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:44,160
continue to have stress dissatisfaction and suffering but we can grow um with caring

226
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,960
and compassion in the same way that we can grow Good Will and the other Divine

227
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,640
abodes by paying attention to them in daily life and also by meditating them

228
00:42:55,640 --> 00:43:01,839
with them in this formal way that really gets absorbed in who you're sending the

229
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:09,079
feelings towards and filling your mind and heart with them and then really

230
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:15,680
staying with this practice it develops this quality of collected mind fully

231
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,839
gathered mind a Sade that ultimately is

232
00:43:20,839 --> 00:43:26,839
a source of growth and in in insight and in

233
00:43:26,839 --> 00:43:36,160
wisdom and wisdom is one of the keys to becoming free from stress and

234
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:42,760
suffering so the meditation practice and daily life practice with these Brahma

235
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:49,000
viharas tends to support they tend to support one another so they come to a

236
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:54,319
point if we do them frequently enough and keep keep at the mindfulness they

237
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:59,920
tend to arise more naturally in Us in response to what's happening around us

238
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,359
uh the Mind becomes very stable and flexible able to deal with ups and downs

239
00:44:05,359 --> 00:44:12,559
without reactivity um and we get to a place where we can remain capable and calm in

240
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:20,040
the face of whatever comes our way so for those of you who want to

241
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:27,400
continue or start to treat today and this week like a

242
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:33,400

time of course if you're in a position to actively help taking the time to listen

247
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:08,240
deeply and carefully to what that person wants in the way of support but this is
