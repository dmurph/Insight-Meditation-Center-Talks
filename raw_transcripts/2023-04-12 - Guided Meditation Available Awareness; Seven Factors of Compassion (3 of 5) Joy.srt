1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,919
so good morning and it would be nice for me to do a sound

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,420
check and uh

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,480
reducing a different sound system than at IMC and so make sure that it's all working

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,520
sound is fine sounds good great this is wonderful thank you it's also nice to

5
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,340
get a little bit of exchange going back and forth between saying something getting replied

6
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,260
directly so thank you very much

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,739
so hello and greetings from inside retweet Center

8
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:03,960
and it's like I feel kind of delighted to be here with you today and being here in

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:11,299
this room so thank you for being here and um

10
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:19,979
um so in doing mindfulness practice

11
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:27,560
one of the simple ways of describing it is that we are

12
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:34,560
recognizing what's happening in the moment as it's happening and there are two general ways that

13
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,380
maybe people are pro can approach this recognition in the present moment being aware of the present moment

14
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:45,540
one is um to see things as they are

15
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:52,740
where how they are is a is a conclusion so when we're mindful we're concluding

16
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,799
something this is what's happening so if we're mindful of the breathing say we're mindful of the in-breath

17
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,860
the recognition of the in-breath is kind of like the end of the story like breathing in

18
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:11,940
and then I'm you know breathing out and that's the end of the story or you hear sound the recognition the

19
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:19,560
sound is the recognition of that brief event or the sound and I recognize it if the sun might go on but it's kind of

20
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,319
like the recognition is a conclusion or as a is a thing in itself that's

21
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:32,160
has recognized what has just happened the other way of doing it is not to be

22
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:41,160
aware of things as they are but be aware of things as they are occurring things as they are becoming

23
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:46,260
and so there now mindfulness is not a conclusion

24
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:53,040
but rather it's a beginning and so to be aware of a sound it's kind

25
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,640
of like you're in in maybe if you use Mental noting or something you know you're quiet or quieter where there's a

26
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:06,420
decision to to then turn your attention to feet you're not just recognizing the sound but it's kind of like you're

27
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:12,720
making yourself available to experience it as it's occurring

28
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,379
if you're recognizing breathing the the mindfulness of breathing is not a conclusion about yes now I'm breathing

29
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:25,319
but rather is it's a beginning of the experience of being available

30
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:32,459
to know feel experience breathing as it's occurring

31
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:38,519
and if there's a brief sound um the recognition can still be that way

32
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:44,099
so it's kind of like you're opening the door say you're in a in a

33
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:50,700
in a stuffy room and you open the door to the outside and it becomes a beautiful wonderful fresh Breeze coming

34
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:56,159
in and you just make yourself available for feeling that fresh Breeze

35
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,879
and so the idea is to always kind of use the mindfulness to help you be available

36
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:09,180
for for the fullness of the experience as it's occurring and it might just be momentary

37
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,400
so being available for the in-breath breathing in and then but then there's a

38
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,600
kind of opening to that the very very recognition is a opening the door to be

39
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,979
aware of the of of the full inhale or if you're in the exhale be aware of

40
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:34,020
the exhale to be really aware of it as it's occurring letting it register as

41
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,360
it's occurring the ongoing experience of it and if you get to the end of the exhale

42
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,060
and that being available door being open is still there that spills over into

43
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:50,759
being aware of the transition from breathing out to breathing in

44
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:57,600
if you're thinking it's useful to note that be really clearly aware that you're thinking

45
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:02,780
but not as a conclusion but as a beginning of making yourself available

46
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:08,820
to register to feel to experience to know what this is like

47
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:14,880
even if the thinking stops the particular thoughts you have they're still lingering kind of what's

48
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,139
that lingering effect and what's the effect of being available

49
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:27,900
so you're also letting yourself be available to the experience of being available

50
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:35,100
so things as they're occurring so um

51
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:39,620
so assuming a meditation posture

52
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,440
and

53
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,340
gently closing closing your eyes

54
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:06,419
and just checking in with yourself if you are mindful at this moment if you

55
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:12,740
open your awareness at this moment what do you become aware of

56
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:22,340
what is occurring within you

57
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,780
and what would it be like to

58
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:44,940
open yourself to experience what is occurring as an ongoing event

59
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:49,880
where the mindfulness is being making ourselves available

60
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:57,860
for the occurring to feel it to know it to be aware of it

61
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:35,699
and then to do this with a breathing in taking a gentle long deep inhale

62
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:41,400
and exhale being available

63
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:48,319
in your body in your mind to know to experience the full

64
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,160
occurring of breathing in

65
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:10,340
being available to experience the full occurring of breathing out

66
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,780
and letting your breathing return to normal

67
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,520
and the inhale is a process it takes a little bit of time

68
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:42,979
however short or long it might be

69
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,260
pretty relaxed easy way

70
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:59,360
open the door of awareness to let the breeze of breathing come in

71
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,700
if something else has happened happening that you become aware of

72
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:28,019
open your awareness to register to feel

73
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,459
how that is occurring

74
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,920
mindfulness is a as a particular continuing action

75
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:54,860
of opening to things as they occur

76
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:45,620
where each moment of allowing being available

77
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,779
might be quite brief before you open the door again

78
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:09,480
through mindfulness to be in availability

79
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:13,579
an opening to experience

80
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:23,180
it's important that we're not crowded with thoughts and agendas and wants

81
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:34,040
desires and thoughts agendas become quiet

82
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:38,899
so when we open the door of awareness

83
00:14:39,959 --> 00:14:47,579
what we're mindful of can flow through it

84
00:14:47,579 --> 00:14:55,399
whatever is occurring is allowed to pass through

85
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:03,480
for however long awareness

86
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:11,000
is open and then we do it again

87
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:53,340
when awareness is an opening to experience as it's

88
00:18:53,340 --> 00:19:00,600
occurring when we're allowing something to register or be felt or

89
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:11,220
known there can be a subtle Joy or pleasure

90
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:17,220
in the allowing even when the experience might be

91
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:22,500
unpleasant see allowing the experience to be

92
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:32,120
registered allowing it to arise and Flow in Awareness however brief it is

93
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:40,799
can have a feeling of freedom pleasure

94
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,639
Joy

95
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:51,440
in the openness in the allowing

96
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:01,640
in the feeling of being available to know and to feel

97
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,360
putting aside what you want to have happened

98
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:56,480
putting aside what you expect to have happened

99
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:10,820
so that you can better be available

100
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:17,960
for the next moment as it's occurring

101
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:18,140
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

102
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:27,000
if you're able to have a sense of this opening awareness to what's available

103
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,520
or to what's happening to what's occurring in availability

104
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,658
and allowing of things to register to be felt

105
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:52,380
and if that could be a light feeling Happy Feeling or some pleasure and that

106
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:59,820
availability then maybe you couldn't under also do

107
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:05,520
the same for opening to experience

108
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,620
the suffering of others the challenges they have

109
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:18,960
or your own suffering where oddly enough

110
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,658
opening to be aware of it this way

111
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:33,960
there's a good feeling a rightness a kind of subtle pleasure or even Joy

112
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,559
not in the suffering but in our wonderful capacity

113
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:44,600
to be to open to it

114
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:51,980
to allow ourselves to feel it as it's occurring

115
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:58,760
lightly calmly

116
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:05,120
opening to The Suffering of the world

117
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:23,840
being available the sense of availability

118
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:29,240
as it's occurring

119
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,480
where there's no conclusions

120
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:49,559
there's no fixed ideas just a continual opening

121
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:58,100
to things as they are coming to be things as they are occurring

122
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:08,840
and in being aware of others and their suffering

123
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,080
the door of availability that's open door

124
00:28:15,419 --> 00:28:21,120
can then be the door out of which our care and love

125
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,880
and good will flow

126
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:34,140
an Open Door for what comes in

127
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,960
an open door for what goes out

128
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:50,600
an open door for breathing in open door for breathing out

129
00:29:00,659 --> 00:29:04,159
and on the exhale

130
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:14,299
let the last words of these phrases

131
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:23,940
flow out of you into the world may all beings

132
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:27,200
be happy

133
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:37,278
may all beings be safe

134
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:47,299
may all beings be peaceful

135
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:56,059
may all beings be free

136
00:30:03,530 --> 00:30:14,530
[Music]

137
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,679
foreign

138
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:28,278
thank you

139
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:46,020
so I saw some of the messages that the sound was low so I turned up the input for the

140
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:51,059
microphone on this laptop but in doing that I had to use laptop

141
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:57,720
and some of you heard the clicking so I apologize for that that and I don't know if they now the sound

142
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,760
is a little bit got louder and better

143
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,158
all right

144
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:19,398
foreign

145
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:39,419
okay so today the topic is uh the joy

146
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:45,720
factor of compassion and I think compassion is often not

147
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:53,520
associated with joy maybe it could be Associated better with joy if we realize that the word Joy is

148
00:31:53,520 --> 00:32:00,000
of maybe a a um you know has a wide range of what

149
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:08,159
it can mean but it was a big surprise to me very big surprise the first time that I

150
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:16,020
was feeling I was I was caring for someone someone who was challenged to make her way

151
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:21,840
around and needed support and and help

152
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:27,240
and I was just doing it in a matter of fact way it was just I was happy it was kind of like just it was natural to do

153
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:34,260
it but what surprised me as I was doing it um the sense of pleasure and joy and

154
00:32:34,260 --> 00:32:40,440
well-being that seemed to well up in my chest as I did it and um

155
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:46,940
and that it was um and I wondered is this okay to feel this

156
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:52,980
uh kind of sense of well-being and joy in helping this person or supporting this person

157
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:58,200
and and I and then I've even wondered how am I

158
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:05,039
doing it for the pleasure of it or doing it to to to help her get her get around her

159
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:11,399
um but I was so surprised by how good it felt and and since then I've discovered that

160
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:18,059
that uh when I feel compassion that um it's possible that compassion

161
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:23,100
comes with a sense of rightness a sense of Joy a sense of pleasure

162
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:28,799
and sometimes when the suffering is really huge it's a little hard to see it's being or see it or recognize that

163
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:35,159
it's being joyful or you know or exactly like pleasure exactly but it just feels

164
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:40,260
really good it feels right to be a witness for the suffering to be open to

165
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:46,860
it and um and the uh

166
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:52,260
um and so how is it that compassion which is the awareness of suffering and

167
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:58,080
oneself and others how is it that that can be associated with joy

168
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:04,799
um the dilemas I think is you know has gone around the world with their teaching that if you want to be happy be

169
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:11,040
compassionate and um so how is it what's associated with that there's many answers to that

170
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:17,398
it's a you know our inner psychology has many different facets but one of them is

171
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:23,878
um that uh how we're being compassionate that if compassion comes along with a

172
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:31,440
lot of sense of Duty and obligation it can feel quite heavy if it comes along with a sense of uh

173
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:39,000
conclusions like deciding that this means that life is really frightening and terrible it can really feel also

174
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:46,080
oppressive to experience compassion but if compassion comes along with an

175
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,898
awareness that's open and available like an open window where the wind can

176
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:57,480
flow through um Nothing Stops it it doesn't nothing

177
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:06,000
blocks it it just kind of just goes right through US almost but we're available for this opening we um we have

178
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,180
this availability for as things as they occur it's part of that Joy is in that

179
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:17,820
availability because we're not Contracting we're not resisting we're

180
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:23,520
not coming to conclusions we're not uh elaborating with you know this means

181
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,920
that the world is a terrible place or whatever it might be and we're not kind

182
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:35,040
of immediately caught up in I have to do something I'm responsible but this the

183
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:43,560
simplicity of compassion the simplest version of it to be open to experience what is

184
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:49,020
and this openness this ability to be available is a is a kind of a very

185
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:57,079
important aspect of mindfulness practice um the mindfulness

186
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:03,780
some people use mindfulness as as like the end of a the end process of a very

187
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:09,540
short few moments of concluding oh this is what's happening done I've concluded

188
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:16,200
it's got some it's extreme version It's a checklist approach to mindfulness people use Mental noting

189
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:23,579
um and I used to do that I would I would note that breathing in in just as I began breathing in

190
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:30,060
and if the if the in-breath was a little bit long I would kind of check out I would kind of wonder if draw from my

191
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:36,240
thought for the last three quarters of the inbred because I'd already done my mindfulness practice

192
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:43,140
and then I would try to be the beginning of the exhale and out you know and and done that and then I would kind of

193
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:49,020
wouldn't be there very present for the out breath and I learned that rather than you know

194
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:54,599
to do what instead is to be available to be open to experience

195
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:01,500
so the word in for me if I do is um is an invitation is an opening like

196
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,540
okay it's the beginning of a process okay I'm breathing in that's what's

197
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:12,660
happening now let's feel that it registered let it let it be felt more

198
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:19,700
deeply in the system in the body and um and uh exhaling

199
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:25,920
this is the beginning of really feeling this now it might be very brief something might

200
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,859
be very fleeting and that's okay and one of the things one of the great Treasures is as we do this availability

201
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:37,380
being available to what's happening is um

202
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:43,200
is we're also then feeling what it's like to be available

203
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:50,280
we're feeling what it's like to have the door open as opposed to having it closed and that feels good

204
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:57,119
that has a nice feeling so when we do that with compassion we're open we feel so we see the

205
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:04,740
suffering of the world we don't come that's not a time to come to conclusions this is it for compassion's sake this is

206
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:12,720
a time to allow something to begin and at the minimum it's a beginning of

207
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:19,980
becoming more fully aware of it and um and so this sense of being aware

208
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:26,640
is the joy of compassion at least for me

209
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,859
so the we're doing the uh the

210
00:38:31,859 --> 00:38:38,820
the seven factors of compassion today this week and so we're back into this

211
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:45,720
mindfulness how mindfulness is and as mindfulness is we're being mindful of it in a calm relaxed way

212
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:52,859
we become aware of how we're not open how we're closed or resisting or or

213
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:58,560
we're tight or we're suffering in terms of compassion we become aware of how

214
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:05,640
we're suffering because of the suffering we're laying air laying layers of suffering on top of experiencing the

215
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:10,740
suffering of the world their judgments our fears and taking it

216
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:16,020
personally and all kinds of things so then we learn to make a distinction

217
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,599
between these other layers of suffering and just being open to the Simplicity of

218
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,940
the original suffering we're present for as we make that distinction we learn how

219
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:33,359
to be mindful in a more relaxed way in an open way and we make the effort to do

220
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:39,240
so we make it at a different kind of effort to be be present for the suffering where

221
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:46,680
we're not tightening up and stressing around it and that leads us to This Joy Factor the

222
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:53,760
network available we're open in Awareness without stress and awareness without force and awareness which is

223
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,220
calm light open and in some ways the lighter and more

224
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:05,940
calm the awareness can be the cleaner and Fuller can be the

225
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:11,460
experience of compassion experience or the way of experiencing suffering

226
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:17,700
and that can be against the grain for some people because with when we feel suffering of the world suffering of

227
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:23,160
others we better take it seriously we better get gear up and do something big

228
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:30,380
and this is really important there's some some sufferings are huge and so it can be very counterintuitive

229
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:37,200
that the way forward is not to take it too seriously or take it so seriously

230
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,540
that it's so important that you can't afford to get tense you can't afford to

231
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:47,940
get stressed out that they it's so important that to let

232
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:53,940
the best qualities of who you are come forward forward and your best ability to think and to act and to do

233
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:59,700
is in fact to relax and open and be available in like a nice way

234
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:05,820
so to go back to the example I gave the first day about the girl in The Playground who's

235
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:12,540
uh injured herself scraped her knee um if the caretaker comes over he cares

236
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:18,900
for her is distraught is upset is angry is feels

237
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:24,839
like that this is a disaster it's a crisis and and as yelling for help and

238
00:41:24,839 --> 00:41:30,180
saying this is a serious problem the poor girl is going to learn all

239
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:35,880
kinds of unhealthy things she's going to feel frightened she's going to feel oh maybe things are much

240
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:42,900
worse than I thought and uh it's bad enough I got my knee my knee scraped now it's maybe it's a

241
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:48,540
disaster I wonder if they're going to call 9-1-1 and the ambulance for me or or now now that now the little girl

242
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:54,180
learns that the world is a frightening place to be in that all kinds of secondary things

243
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:59,520
because the caretaker got so alarmed and took it so seriously

244
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:06,900
if the caretaker takes it respectfully carefully lovingly fully but has a

245
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:14,060
lightness and ease and a calm and even has a sense of of uh

246
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:19,500
enjoying or appreciating or feeling the rightness of him here are they

247
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:26,579
comfortable in being here doing this this little girl learned something very different about life

248
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:34,020
she learns that this is available in life she learns that life is a place where things are not a crisis that you

249
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:41,940
meet your experiences and difficulties with a certain level of calm and lightness and ease and love and care

250
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:49,140
so the ability to find sweetness and compassion

251
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:55,079
is one of the Great powers of compassion it's one of the

252
00:42:55,079 --> 00:43:01,319
great capacities compassion has so the in this week we're calling it The

253
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:08,460
Joy factor of compassion so I would like to suggest

254
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:14,700
that if you have occasion today to encounter suffering however small or

255
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:19,800
large it might be and you don't have to maybe it's best if you don't have to

256
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,500
act you know quickly and immediately for it that you have you know that doesn't

257
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:30,660
require that of you see if you can find a way to register

258
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:36,000
and feel and know that suffering clearly not not denying

259
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,339
it not dismissing its importance but that you can take take the time to let

260
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:47,520
it register and be known in you that in the knowing in the being available for

261
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:54,119
it you actually feel some sweetness you feel some goodness it feels some rightness

262
00:43:54,119 --> 00:44:00,500
and then what difference does it make for you If you experience compassion that way

263
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:07,800
how do you then maybe respond differently with that

264
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:16,200
so the joy factor of compassion so thank you and um

265
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:20,000
I look forward to continuing tomorrow
