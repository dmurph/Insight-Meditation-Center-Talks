okay excuse me so welcome uh welcome folks good to uh good to be with you

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,960
it's a certain Wednesday and

3
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,840
um yeah happy to uh to practice good time to

4
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:33,440
practice um yeah so settle uh settle into your

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,760
your posture

6
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,360
just uh set yourself up as right as you

7
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:25,360
can meaning uh

8
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,600
comfortable maybe even cozy

9
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,880
alert

10
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,640
or some part of our mind it can feel neglectful to stop

11
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:21,920
clinging can feel neglectful to stop

12
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:34,680
worrying as if it's our vigilance that keeps us

13
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:54,400
safe maybe it can feel like avoidant to relax into tranquility

14
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,280
but our agitation and vigilance

15
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,360
clinging does less for our life than we

16
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:28,760
imagine and so give oursel permission to

17
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,760
relax

18
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
e

19
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
e

20
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,680
e e

21
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:35,560
just let your your breathing fill out your

22
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:55,120
body sensing your breath in the back of your body

23
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:10,440
feels like life is in front of us but life's

24
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:18,080
everywhere so we breathe and sense the sensations of breathing in the back of

25
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,360
our body

26
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:06,319
and breathe some life into these zones of numbness the areas

27
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,479
of your body habitually neglected

28
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:21,960
forgotten I'm so familiar with my chest but much less

29
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,360
so with my belly

30
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:39,919
so unify your body with the breathing breathing

31
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,759
into the zones of flatness or

32
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
numbness

33
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,479
e e

34
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,079
so we breathe into the cold places but also the hot

35
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:20,200
places the intensities and the swirls of energy or hyperarousal

36
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:45,680
it's the gentle soothing quality of

37
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:54,839
breathing is it unifies our body our body feels uh

38
00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:01,320
suspended in awareness

39
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

40
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

41
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

42
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

43
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:32,160
e e

44
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:22,320
perhaps with our bodies

45
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:28,760
suspended in uh awareness

46
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,839
may feel skillful to

47
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:42,720
turn mind to uh

48
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:54,680
compassion beginning with the gentle tending

49
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:59,320
to your own suffering

50
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,720
just here in this

51
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:19,680
moment wherever there is sorrow or

52
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:31,000
pain wherever there is grief or rage

53
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:34,320
age or

54
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:46,920
fear tend lovingly to

55
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,040
it for

56
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:55,160
in the gesture of compassion uh we're becoming

57
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:59,639
unintimidated by our pain

58
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:05,040
yeah of course it

59
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,560
hurts maybe hurts a

60
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:25,519
lot compassion is here

61
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:38,040
and so you're infusing that

62
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:48,399
struggle and disease infusing it with this particular species of

63
00:16:52,120 --> 00:17:00,680
love the love that tends and heals

64
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
heartache

65
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

66
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

67
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

68
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
e for

69
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:11,480
I uh care about uh my

70
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,440
pain you have to

71
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:34,159
Words May I be free from suffering and my heart be

72
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,400
at

73
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:48,600
ears may I be released from torment

74
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:08,360
we each find the words the images and their particularity

75
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,520
that speak to our own

76
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,960
heart that remind us of the vastness of

77
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:26,600
compassion that tie ties

78
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:30,520
are suffering

79
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:37,080
to all other

80
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,919
suffering and meeting it all with the

81
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
love

82
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

83
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,480
e e

84
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:18,600
compassion doesn't need to make pain go

85
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:30,120
away it's a very patient

86
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,440
love in the face of

87
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:53,000
suffering and continually The Compassion

88
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:57,440
says I'm here

89
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:06,679
I may not be able to do everything but I'm

90
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:27,320
here and sometimes we find ourselves abiding in a Kind of

91
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
Love

92
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

93
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

94
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

95
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

96
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

97
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
e e

98
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,039
e e

99
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:41,399
okay it's good to uh good to sit with you and I just I don't I don't say that

100
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:48,360
to like put a nice Dharma bow on it it really is I'm sitting too you know not

101
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:57,840
just faking it you know so um yeah appreciate being together this evening

102
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:03,679
so I I was um speaking with somebody

103
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:09,240
who has a struggling with a a personality

104
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:16,639
disorder psychiatric designation I'll say something about and

105
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:22,760
um and um I just had the sense that um

106
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:29,639
the the layers of their suffering were were very thick

107
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:36,840
and uh not to be uncompassionate or something but just like the sense of the

108
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:43,080
wrong view felt so visceral

109
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,799
multi-layered and it made me reflect on the ways that the fruit of

110
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:59,440
Dharma practice is often something like the diametric opposite of you know person personality

111
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:04,679
disorder and this condition um is

112
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:11,960
characterized by severe instability in in Emotion

113
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:19,600
identity interpersonal relationships behavioral disregulation and

114
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:27,320
um and you know borderline personality disorder which Marshall linahan developed uh you know dialectical

115
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:33,440
behavior therapy for which are kind of like mindfulness Zen based treatment

116
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:39,760
right anyway a whole backstory there but um but narcissistic personality

117
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:50,159
borderline personality borderline personality is something like 10% of outpatients um and um the diagnosis is

118
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:58,639
um is known to generate a lot of of Agony and Chaos for the person and often

119
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:03,799
Co a lot of collateral damage for for others in their

120
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:09,880
life and it strikes me that in some sense uh

121
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:17,919
personality pathology is almost like The Logical conclusion of egoic life egoic

122
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:23,919
life taken to its extreme destructive

123
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:31,960
and a kind of folly and tragedy of egoic

124
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,799
life and that egoic fragility that is almost infinite is a cause of problems

125
00:33:38,799 --> 00:33:46,840
but it's also the attempt to solve great problems the fragility is not merely a

126
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:54,639
kind of bad problem but a bad solution and the rigid sense of self

127
00:33:54,639 --> 00:34:02,240
then we're all somewhere on the Spectrum the rigid sense of self is an attempt to

128
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:08,079
um to shore up our pain to manage it in some

129
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,638
way and sometimes in the clinical literature it's characterized personality disorders are characterized

130
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:20,760
as a a disorder of self self disorder of the

131
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:28,960
self and we know from Dharma practice a Hallmark of sakad diti self View

132
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,118
is its rigidity the rigidity of self viw this

133
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:42,520
is who I am it's what's right how we do things what I believe what makes me

134
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:47,599
valuable and um in personality disorders

135
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:54,878
um patients persevere in in rigid strategies that don't work right we have

136
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:00,880
things that are important to us and we have to find ways of pursuing them but

137
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:07,079
one strategy is never enough to pursue valued goals we have to be flexible and

138
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:13,960
our fluidity is dependent on some fluidity in the sense of

139
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:23,599
self if all we can ever do is maintain Fidelity to a story of self we can't be

140
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:28,760
flexible so part of our kind of fluid Flex ible

141
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:35,079
coping means that we have to be fluid and flexible in relation to

142
00:35:35,079 --> 00:35:42,680
ourself a Hallmark of sakad diti is defensiveness when

143
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:50,839
we claim the territory of self we have a kind of um deeply

144
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:56,119
emotional emotionally charged connection to some aspect of self viw that

145
00:35:56,119 --> 00:36:02,960
guarantees defensive iess right and so the world of ego

146
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,440
becomes split into groups of enemies and

147
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:17,400
VIPs and all information coming in either goes in the column of the pros of

148
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:26,839
me or the cons of me a Hallmark of Sak is is comparison

149
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:34,760
and en the so much of the way the self gets built up is

150
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:43,560
through comparison and comparison guarantees some measure of Envy so the ego we come

151
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:49,560
to see it tolerates no goodness outside itself you

152
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,599
know it's um there's no mudita

153
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:01,880
sympathetic joy in egoic processes the ego must either kind of

154
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:09,359
align and acquire that goodness or vilify those who represent that

155
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:16,240
goodness a Hallmark of self-view is the capacity for cruelty

156
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:22,200
ego is life and so if you have to

157
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:27,680
fight you fight and cruelty

158
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,078
is an option that's very much on the

159
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:40,200
table now I'm not in the clinical world anymore but one of the kind of Hallmarks

160
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:46,160
of Personality pathology is how easily it gets

161
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:53,519
under the clinician's skin into your

162
00:37:53,920 --> 00:38:01,640
bloodstream and really clinically you kind kind of enter a world deranged by

163
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:06,880
the kesas by the forces of greed hand and

164
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:13,640
delusion and in fact one of the kind of diagnostic markers you know the clues

165
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:19,400
that there's some personality disorder present is the clinician exits the

166
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,839
Consulting room and they have no idea what

167
00:38:24,839 --> 00:38:30,760
happened and there's often a kind of like like vicious counter transference

168
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:38,680
the experience of the clinician in relation to the patient can be very destructive counter

169
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:44,280
transference and the symptoms and behaviors of

170
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:51,960
Personality Disorder they it's like often like heat seeking missiles aimed

171
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:58,839
precisely at the soft spots in one's own Consciousness the pain points in one's

172
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:05,560
own heart life and so almost as if by

173
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:11,400
Magic um these folks Infuse the mind of

174
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:18,960
clinicians and the clinician is drawn into a disordered world of

175
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:26,000
experience and it's difficult to stay

176
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:32,520
clear it's difficult to remember the goodness of the patient to remember one's own

177
00:39:32,520 --> 00:39:39,000
goodness it's difficult to know that hatred does not cease through hatred but

178
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:44,319
through non-h hatred it's difficult to remember that

179
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:50,280
this person desperately needs help

180
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:59,720
compassion so what why why am I talking about this you that may be a frequent

181
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:06,920
question you have you know why is Matthew talking about

182
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:14,000
this why am I talking about this um

183
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:21,720
because uh it strikes me that um personality disorder symptoms of

184
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:27,800
course constellate at the individual level but it's also like like they

185
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:33,880
constellate at the national level too the societal

186
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:39,599
level and this country this one I know we've got

187
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:45,599
Switzerland in the house and other countries I imagine but this country the

188
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:53,920
US and its electoral politics and it a decade of Donald Trump and the social

189
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:03,280
media environment and um all of this is unfolding as a kind of

190
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,800
personality disorder manifested at the national

191
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:19,040
level and greed hatred delusion um have been disguised and

192
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:27,760
dignified and thoroughly colonized National consciousness

193
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:36,520
and good-hearted uh people everywhere are vulnerable to the

194
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:43,800
symptoms are getting drawn into a vicious counter

195
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:54,359
transference and so if it feels like you're fighting for your moral

196
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:59,880
sanity it's because a little bit you

197
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:09,040
are and I'm trying to find balance to stay with my commitments none of what

198
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:16,319
I'm saying is uh uh compatible with um political

199
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:23,319
quietism or something I'm staying with my commitments but I'm trying to find a

200
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:28,599
pathway between frenzy and n

201
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:37,000
ISM I'm trying in other words to uh protect my

202
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,359
love and there's a sense of like one stays

203
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:51,240
sane morally sane only through some

204
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:57,319
discipline and some softening and through the Buddhist

205
00:42:57,319 --> 00:43:03,200
counsel a mind not clinging to

206
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:14,040
anything one stays saying through action wholesome seeds planted yeah feels

207
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:20,960
negligible but acting wholesome one stays sane through

208
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:27,880
spiritual friendship spiritual friendship that's what we're doing here

209
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:37,359
you know and um one Stay s through a very

210
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:44,359
