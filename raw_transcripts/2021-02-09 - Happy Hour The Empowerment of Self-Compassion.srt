1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,200
so a warm welcome to you or a cool welcome if

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,920
if that would be welcome if it's summer and something something cool would be refreshing so a

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,480
refreshing welcome to you warm cool whatever your heart needs in this moment your body needs in this

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:25,920
moment um lovely to be with you from around the world

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:32,200
in this moment in time and to practice together so uh we've been going through the

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:39,360
brahmaviharas one by one we went through metta and now we're going through karuna compassion

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,039
and we're lingering with self-compassion for a few sessions so tonight we

8
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:52,079
all do self-compassion uh in a different way than we've done the past couple sessions

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,800
because you can never have enough self-compassion it's it's really the salve it's the

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,878
um support in in many ways it's the support for

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,920
many of the other practices because when we fill our own cups with

12
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,400
care with meta with compassion self-compassion self-meta then we can be more available for the

13
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,759
world and there is less neediness love me love me take care of me take care of me we can take care of

14
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:29,759
our own heart and the sense of resilience can also build so

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,840
so self-compassion

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:47,759
um so one thing that sometimes comes up when we try to practice self-compassion

17
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,479
is this voice that says oh if you're too

18
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:02,159
compassionate if you're compassionate to yourself then you won't get anything done

19
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:09,520
you just become a couch potato so you have to be hard on yourself

20
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:16,080
to get yourself accomplishing things that you need to accomplish in life

21
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:25,120
and that's unfortunately not the voice of wisdom

22
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,200
it's more the voice of fear and it's very common it's very common

23
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:36,400
plenty of work and research has been done on this and it's very common having

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,400
taught having practiced it myself self-compassion practices and also having taught it to many people

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:48,160
it often comes up there's a sense of suspicion of self-compassion as weakening it will

26
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:56,239
make me too weak in so many ways and this is one story um so

27
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:01,200
i invite you to distinguish between

28
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,080
when something is challenging and there is suffering for

29
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:15,200
us to hold ourselves with care for the suffering that is happening for for the suffering

30
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,120
that's arising for us in our heart emotionally in our bodies etc

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:28,000
as a way to support and empower us to be in our power

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:34,080
to really be ah a sense of when i actually say it i want to sit up

33
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:41,120
straighter because i'm holding myself in compassion in my own care there's a sense of

34
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,680
empowerment of care and love and this feeling that oh sweetie this

35
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,439
hurts and it's okay it's okay and an empowerment to actually

36
00:03:53,439 --> 00:04:01,439
take on things that are more challenging instead of if i was beating myself

37
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,439
up say i'm hurting say um something has been challenging let's say

38
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:15,280
um i didn't get what i wanted to get done done today and now i'm beating myself up oh you're no good you're you're a loser

39
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:23,280
you never um complete your deadlines ouch ouch ouch

40
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,360
that's that feels very belittling it feels i i'm feeling even more hurt now i want

41
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:36,800
to go and crawl under the covers and not talk to anyone and so it's it it diminishes me it it

42
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,280
makes me even more powerless whereas a sense of oh okay i messed up

43
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,240
oh that feels really bad okay sweetie i realize various things that were going on and

44
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,080
also yeah maybe you didn't do your best i still love you i still love you i still care for you

45
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,280
and yes maybe you didn't have to watch netflix for two

46
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,800
hours maybe that was not a good maybe we should just not do that yeah you're right

47
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:13,039
okay but it's okay i still care for you and okay let's try to do better so

48
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:20,560
there's a different kind of a narrative there's a different kind of an attitude that self-compassion can bring in

49
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:27,039
and i bring this up because it it has come up before

50
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,720
um both here and and whenever i teach it of course it this this comes up

51
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,840
as um does this um self-compassion make me

52
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,720
a couch potato so i invite you to experiment with the with these different narratives and

53
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:53,840
see how actually it's not about um self-compassion is not about lying on

54
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,360
the sofa and eating bonbons it's not about cutting yourself complete slack

55
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,720
in every matter it's about caring for yourself and taking more responsibility

56
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:10,720
in many ways so all right so let's get started without

57
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,080
further ado let's practice self-compassion in a different way tonight

58
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,360
so i'd like to invite you to get into your meditation posture as always we start by the breath with

59
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:35,840
the breath and the body landing and settling

60
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,759
landing in the body

61
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:56,639
with the breath

62
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,840
receiving the breath

63
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:17,840
tethering tethering the attention

64
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,080
tethering the awareness

65
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:45,039
with the breath with the movement of the in-breath and the out-breath in the body

66
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:52,560
the entire breath the entire body of the breath in breath

67
00:07:52,560 --> 00:08:01,039
and out breath and the pauses tethering awareness

68
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:13,840
to the breath in the body

69
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,720
letting go of thoughts memories

70
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,839
conversations realizing you don't need to have them

71
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:48,160
right now giving yourself to this practice

72
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:54,000
giving your heart to this moment

73
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,120
inviting your attention

74
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,079
to be tethered to accompany the breath intimately

75
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:28,640
not leaving the breath as if your life depended on it

76
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:43,839
as if your liberation depended on it

77
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:17,839
now i'd like to invite you to bring to mind

78
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:24,880
a being that represents unconditional love for you

79
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:32,639
it could be a living being in your life someone who's passed away

80
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,880
a human a pet or an archetype

81
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:48,720
it could be kuan yen representation of compassion

82
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:55,360
or the buddha or jesus the being of light whatever works for

83

and unconditional love

85

it could even be the sun the ocean a well-rooted tree

86
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:27,839

87
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:43,600

00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:50,880
how their love acceptance compassion

89
00:15:52,839 --> 00:16:09,839

in their presence you feel completely loved and accepted

91
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,279

92
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:05,839
or accomplish

93

175
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,079
myself could give me the compassion that you know i was at the beginning i

176
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:41,680
searched you know for different beings faces people i've known and

177
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,760
but then it came down to me and that was strong that was very strong

178
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,280

181
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,480
what you just shared and why is we have a line of of poem

182
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:25,599
by hafez in farsi it's roughly translated to the

183
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:32,400
um do we we often beg strangers whereas we actually

184
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:39,920
we we often beg strangers whereas we have this um this gem the the gem

185
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,040
this this whole all these gems within our own hearts

186
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:50,880
so instead so looking outside looking inside it's

187
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:56,000
already here that gem of compassion and love it's already here

188
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:04,480
beautiful thank you for sharing genie lovely yeah um

189
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,000
reflection from one person who says nikki this was transformational for me i

190
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,520
felt i was relaxing in a healing way that i have not experienced before

191
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:23,520
thank you you are very welcome i'm cheering you on also dear one dear practitioner

192

193
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:38,319
send in to everyone then i'll say in your name out loud this is what i'm starting to do emily says i found saying this is hard

194
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:44,240
to myself instead of the usual critical and self-judging thoughts has been

195
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:51,280
really helpful i've taken on mickey's challenge from last week yay emily that's great that makes me very

196
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:59,040
happy yay that's awesome i'm i'm so glad you're finding it supportive

00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:08,319
um and and really helpful it's fantastic it brings me so much joy and delight thank you

198
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,480
and violet says i tried to give compassion to myself for a small problem being behind and

199
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:20,400
grading but i found it extremely challenging almost like the

200
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:27,839
smaller the challenge the easier it is to invalidate myself oh interesting that's a very interesting

201
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:35,280
observation um so is it okay if i ask you what what was the challenging aspect of it

202
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,440
and you're welcome to unmute yourself if you wish what yeah

203
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:49,440
um it's like oh it would have been so easy for you to

204
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:54,960
grade this morning instead of going on facebook it's just like so easy for me to like try and

205
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,319
correct what i did instead of like accept what i did [Music]

206
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:07,760
i see i see interesting so okay so so um

207
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:15,839
yeah so here's here's what i suggest working with it in this way because in

208
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:22,800
some ways small big you know um this is a standard maybe for

209
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,920
something else too so so here's what i would suggest there is pain right now right there is a pain of oh i'm behind

210
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:36,560
in grading this this hurts right so for a moment i'm going to suggest

211
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,240
separating it from judging yourself in the morning

212
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:50,880
and just feel like oh this is this this is painful being behind is painful so can you for a

213
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,078
moment in your mind to separate these two for a moment

214
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,240
yes i see you're nodding yes okay so and can there and we'll get to the taking

215
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:08,880
responsibility in a moment but is it okay to say oh this is really painful right now ouch

216
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,480
sweetie ouch this this hurts this is and for a moment yeah to keep it

217
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:20,800
separated for a moment like oh this ah sweetie this is hard this is oh

218
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,640
this is painful i don't like this situation this is ouch it's interesting

219
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:33,280
i have so much aversion to feeling that i would rather beat myself up over not grading than actually feel that hurt

220
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:38,880
oh interesting okay so there's something there i invite

221
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:44,079
you to to feel into have a question mark

222
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:52,240
why is that because feeling that hurt and having compassion to that for that then the next step would be to

223
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:58,400
actually take responsibility okay well that wasn't very wise and instead of beating yourself up so

224
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:03,839
so i'm going to leave this as a an inquiry to see why is it so difficult to let

225
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:10,640
yourself feel and and be and and hold that with care with kindness

226
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:18,000
is that okay thank you thank you for bringing this up powerful

227
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:26,000
yeah so okay dear ones let's see anything else here

228
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:32,800
um okay so let's wait um more reflections

229
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:39,280
well after we come back from groups attend to more but so here's the invitation before you sign off if you

230
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:46,319
have to to go it's perfectly fine but if you're signing off out of fear of not interacting with

231
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:53,520
other human beings believe me they're really really nice this sangha is really really nice

232
00:44:53,520 --> 00:45:00,400
so and challenge yourself extend extend your um limits a little bit

233
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:06,000
if it scares you stay and see it's not that it's it's what scares us what's

234
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,119
difficult to be with sometimes that can actually be a gift of grace if

235
00:45:11,119 --> 00:45:18,960
we stay with it if we touch into it so the invitation for the small groups

236
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:27,280
is start again with 30 seconds of silent

237
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:32,960
meta silent compassion for each other just silently as if you are each other's

238
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:38,880
compassionate being giving and knowing that you're also receiving others or giving it to you

239
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,920
giving and receiving then you're welcome to share if you wish as much or as

240
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:50,079
little as you want supporting each other which i know naturally comes up in these groups so

241
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:56,880
so with that i'm going to create the breakout rooms and

242
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:06,000
hope that you can stay and practice together um okay here we go opening the rooms now

243
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:13,040
welcome back welcome back and we have a couple of minutes

244
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,960
left [Music] for any reflections you may like to

245
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:25,920
share from the group so the or the practice and um and one

246
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:30,960
reflection also i wanted to share before we went in to groups uh

247
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:38,160
then typed the uh let's see where is it the um which yeah the part of self will

248
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:43,200
be rates the part of self who comforts which one of them actually wants you to

249
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:48,640
succeed rhetorical inspired by the book there is nothing wrong with you by jerry huber i

250
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:54,640
i love that question uh which part of you um actually which one of them wants you

251
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:59,680
to succeed the part this is the part of you that berates or the part of you that comforts

252
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:05,599
and what brings up for me is you know if you have this boss who berates you this manager will just be

253
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:11,440
raped every time you make the smallest mistake berates you another boss that

254
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:16,720
understands but really expects is kind but expects the best of you

255
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,480
you'll probably be um you'll you'll be burnt out by the sec by the

256
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:29,599
first boss you'll be in living in fear of being let go of being fired any moment and

257
00:47:29,599 --> 00:47:35,839
you'll have a nervous breakdown probably but the second boss you might do you might you may want to

258
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:41,359
actually work for them and do your best anyway some reflections on that thanks for

259
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:46,640
sharing that ben so your turn please

260
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:53,839
what's up

261
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:03,760
thank you for the reflections that are coming the gratitudes and blessings coming in chat you will take one

262
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:09,839
verbal reflection if you haven't talk if you haven't shared for a while

263
00:48:12,079 --> 00:48:20,800
yes mary please so this is my second time with you on on

264
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,880
happy hour and in the small group which i always find so powerful to be in small

265
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:35,838
groups with strangers um i came to this question of

266
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:43,359
the grief that i'm encountering and and

267
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:50,720
is it okay to be with the is it is it okay for the grief to be okay i don't know if i'm making any

268
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:57,200
sense but that there's so much grief how can it be okay for there to be so

269
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:03,839
much grief you know how can i be okay when there is so much grief

270
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:09,520
not just my grief but all of the grief and i i feel like that's a place where

271
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:15,599
i'm stuck yeah that it's not okay for me to be okay

272
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:24,240
yeah yeah yeah yeah thank you for bringing that in so

273
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:32,800
here's the invitation for maybe

274
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:39,760
a different way to see it is you know what one view as you were

275
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:44,880
saying is that the grief is there's so much grief not

276
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:52,480
just my grief not just your grief but so much grief in the world is it okay is is it okay to

277
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:58,880
be okay with so much grief oh it feels so overwhelming it it's just

278
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:05,280
oh you one with one wants to hang one's head and just like enough

279
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:15,440
this is just so much is it okay to even be okay with with it all is it that's what i'm hearing you say yeah so

280
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:26,400
the perspective i want so that's one perspective that

281
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:32,319
it's sorrow and suffering that's just senseless and it's not okay to be with

282
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:37,599
any sorrow and suffering because it's unjustified as unjustifiable

283
00:50:37,599 --> 00:50:44,240
there's no point it's extra it's there's no point it's suffering and more

284
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,680
suffering and more sorrow so so i would say there

285
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:56,000
are two types of suffering and i'll come back to the word grief for a moment i'm going to use suffering there is

286
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:02,400
suffering that is just causes more suffering and sorrow and

287
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:08,319
then there is suffering that leads to the end of suffering

288
00:51:08,319 --> 00:51:13,440
as aj i think beautifully said this forest master

289
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:19,040
i hope i'm attributing this correctly but so there are two different kinds of

290
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:26,559
suffering there are two different kinds of grief and what makes the difference between

291
00:51:26,559 --> 00:51:33,870
the two is how we hold it it's how we see it it's how we relate to it

292
00:51:33,870 --> 00:51:39,520
[Music] and i'm going to say something that's going to sound radical

293
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:47,680
and strange but i will say it nevertheless drop it in and that there is grace

294
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:51,838
and beauty and meaning

295
00:51:52,880 --> 00:52:05,838
in grief

296
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:29,160
and so much more and so much more so opening up to the possibility of its

297
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:35,760
transformational power to serve one and to serve to serve everyone to

298
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:43,119
serve the world thank you mary

299
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:52,160
thank you so

300
00:52:53,839 --> 00:53:01,440
so thank you all thank you for your practice thank you for being part of happy hour

301
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:06,078
sharing yourself supporting each other

302
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:14,400
may all beings everywhere be free

303
