1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:11,440
so hello everyone and welcome to our meditation together

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,920
and uh thank you for all the greetings on the chat

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,679
so

4
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,960
sometimes meditation is associated with having a quiet mind

5
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,200
and that can be certainly be one of the pleasures and

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:44,480
and wonderful aspects of meditation and sometimes a quiet mind is associated

7
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:53,760
with having no thoughts that also can happen but all in its own time

8
00:00:54,480 --> 00:01:01,760
something that you might want to think about is that part of what medi

9
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:08,640
we do in meditation is to change our self-talk how we talk to ourselves

10
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,680
the nature of our thinking itself and sometimes it's more useful

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:20,560
to think about adjusting or thinking or self-talk than it is trying to fight it and trying

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,840
to stop it and partly that's to create the

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,759
conditions where it's easier for thinking to become quiet and calm but if thinking

14
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:38,880
is very active and assertive and afraid and a lot of strong drive in

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,079
it it can be almost kind of counterproductive to struggle against it

16
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:53,040
but kind of um kind of join it in a certain way in order to

17
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:58,159
adjust it and now just like you would adjust your speech

18
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,240
if you were at a i don't know if you were at

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,239
a loud party you were happy to see your friends again and for a long time and you were talking

20
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:19,280
loudly versus if you go into a nursery uh nursery school when the kids

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,040
are napping or you go to uh into uh some kind of sacred ceremony where

22
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:32,720
everyone is quiet and so you would quiet your voice maybe in these different settings

23
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:38,720
so um so to think of entering into meditation

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,480
as a time to also certainly quiet your thinking but shift

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,760
your thinking so that um you're thinking uh well of yourself that you're

26
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:58,640
bringing you're not dwelling and ruminating in in your challenges your negative

27
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,760
self-talk but there's a gentle movement towards

28
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:10,640
thinking in ways that are supportive that's generous to yourself that the generous to the world and it

29
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,720
involves an active shifting to thinking well and

30
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,920
asking yourself what would be beneficial right now and how could i address my pain my suffering

31
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,920
how can i uh think about it in ways that are supportive and compassionate

32
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:35,840
um how can i uh appreciate the good qualities and strengths that i have when

33
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,360
i sit to meditate and not get uh have the negative negativity bias and to look for the

34
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:46,720
problems all the time but to look at what's beneficial how you're

35
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,239
fortunate uh in this moment and and it's not to be

36
00:03:52,239 --> 00:04:01,120
um sentimental or pollyannish about it but uh sometimes uh

37
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:08,000
the excessive criticalness which we live in and the drive-drivenness of thinking is not

38
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,080
really beneficial for anyone and uh and it's quite appropriate to

39
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,000
somehow shift the way we think so you don't have to make this a you

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:26,960
know a full-time practice during this meditation but you

41
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,960
might in the beginning and from time to time see if it can be helpful for you to shift how you're

42
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:40,080
oriented to your thinking and think in ways that are beneficial and positive supportive especially what's

43
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,600
supportive for the meditation practice itself so your thinking begins shifting

44
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,639
towards the present moment here and now and not about things that are other

45
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:57,759
places other times and plans and memories and things but having a positive kind of a positive regard to

46
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:03,520
what i hear and as you do that you might find that it becomes easier to begin also to let

47
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,560
go of thoughts and to begin settling down into the meditation

48
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:17,440
into the breathing and being here so taking a upright alert posture

49
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,800
or any posture that supports you in your meditation

50
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:33,120
and to gently close your eyes and before doing anything else

51
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,639
could you consider a few mo take a few moments to consider

52
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:43,840
what ways can you think about yourself and your circumstances right now

53
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:52,800
in a positive way in a generous way in a kind way

54
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:02,639
here now maybe with appreciation for yourself

55
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:10,400
a caring caring thoughts for your own well-being

56
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,840
and then to take a few long slow deep

57
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
breaths

58
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:34,000
aware of the body as you breathe deeply but may be aware slightly

59
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:41,680
conditioned by influenced by your good thoughts as you said here

60
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,440
as you exhale to relax and let go

61
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

62
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:14,960
and perhaps i know with thoughts that are generous and caring let your attention

63
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:21,840
direct your attention to different parts of your body and as you exhale

64
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:26,400
generously relax or soften

65
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:35,520
and if you're able to relax some parts of your body don't rush on to the next thing

66
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:45,840
but have some thoughts of appreciation that you had this opportunity

67
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,840
especially relaxing the shoulders

68
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,280
the belly

69
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:27,840
sometimes the hands can be loosened up a bit

70
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:48,320
and as you exhale you might also relax any tension associated with

71
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,120
thinking any pressure to think

72
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,839
tightness contraction around thinking

73
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:08,160
relaxing the thinking muscle

74
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:13,519
and perhaps gently and calmly quietly

75
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:23,839
appreciate anything that's a you can appreciate about these first few minutes of meditation

76
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,279
thoughts of appreciation of being maybe a little bit more connected to yourself a little bit more

77
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,920
calm a little bit more relaxed

78
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,320
experimenting with thinking where the self-talk

79
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:00,959
has a tone of of support and warmth and

80
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:08,560
good will for yourself putting aside any harshness

81
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:19,839
criticalness that might be there

82
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:31,120
and then have a few thoughts gentle quiet thoughts about turning your

83
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:36,640
attention more fully into the breathing

84
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,839
thoughts about

85
00:10:49,120 --> 00:11:01,839
how is the inhale different than the exhale

86
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:43,519
simple thoughts about how might you rest in the experience of

87
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:57,839
breathing more fully

88
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:18,880
maybe you can have a few simple thoughts about how there's so little you need to

89
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:35,839
think about right now it's enough just to be here breathing

90
00:16:53,440 --> 00:17:01,440
if you do find yourself thinking notice whether the thinking is

91
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:05,839
supportive or kind or wholesome

92
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:13,678
and if it isn't switch your thinking to something that's wholesome

93
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:19,839
in relationship to being here meditating

94
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:33,840
and then maybe let go of your thoughts or quiet your thinking

95
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:18,559
maybe you can gently quiet your thinking

96
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:24,158
relaxing the energy the pressure to think

97
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:31,760
the forcefulness of thinking let it become quieter and quieter

98
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:39,600
softer and softer making more room in awareness

99
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:45,840
for saying for resting on the breathing

100
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:59,840
for experiencing breathing more fully

101
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
uh

102
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,559
and then as we come to the end of this meditation

103
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:58,240
maybe you could have a few wholesome thoughts

104
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:07,520
as you consider the world around you

105
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:14,159
the people who you are liable to think about or encounter

106
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:21,840
today or in the next period

107
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:35,840
to have wholesome thoughts about them maybe of appreciation

108
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:49,840
may be of good will well wishing for them

109
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:02,399
and to have a few wholesome thoughts about yourself

110
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:11,120
appreciating yourself and appreciating anything about how you are at this

111
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,840
moment

112
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,360
and maybe think about how you are at this moment

113
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:34,559
might support you in supporting others in being friendly

114
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:45,840
to the people you will encounter or think about

115
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:56,158
and may it be that any med benefits that have come from this meditation

116
00:28:56,240 --> 00:29:04,080
that you consider how you might quietly and and

117
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:10,640
wholesomely use them to benefit others

118
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:18,000
contribute to the welfare and happiness of the world and may it be that meditation practice

119
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,600
for us is a means by which we can live a better

120
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:30,398
life contributing to the welfare and happiness of all

121
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,720
may all beings be happy

122
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:41,600
may all beings be safe

123
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:55,840
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere be free

124
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,840
uh

125
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:22,320
so the topic for this week is how to replicate at home in your

126
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:28,480
daily life some of the benefits that come from

127
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,720
living a kind of a religious life in in the dharma so for example living on a

128
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:40,480
retreat at a retreat or living in a monastery

129
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:45,919
some people will have a strong desire to really plunge more deeply into the

130
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:51,279
practice and and sometimes because of family and

131
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:57,200
work and stuff they can't go off and maybe spend some serious amount of time kind of devoting

132
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,440
themselves to the dharma and uh well that's a quite a you know a

133
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,919
wonderful desire to deepen that way and i support it wholeheartedly

134
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:18,559
you can get a lot of the benefits in your daily life by practicing in ordinary life and

135
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:25,840
and sometimes they're practicing in everyday life and not leaving to go someplace special the practice has a kind of honesty to it

136
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:30,799
or in a richness and a in a

137
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,200
you know it uh it's really addressing some of the issues of our life rather than avoiding them and thinking

138
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:44,159
that by avoiding them often a monastery we can somehow make progress and

139
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,080
so there are some simple ways that in principle are not very complicated i

140
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:58,320
think but uh in practice uh you know it can be quite significant profound and

141
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:04,000
the um and uh so yesterday i talked about you know

142
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,080
just bringing more attention to the body uh living a more embodied life coming back to your body over and over again

143
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:16,960
throughout the day whatever you're doing and seeing and understanding what's happening in the body and

144
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,600
the experience of the body learn from it today i want to emphasize speech how we

145
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,799
talk and that can be uh talking with our

146
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:35,919
voice it can be the communication we do electronically it can be

147
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:43,679
how we talk to ourselves how we talk you know self-talk and um and there's many things to say

148
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:50,640
about right speech and speaking well there's a tendency in buddhism when we speak about

149
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:57,279
speech and right speech to look a little bit more on the ethical sides of it than like i did in this last sunday where we

150
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:03,120
evaluate it in particular by the impact or how it is we're doing it

151
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:10,799
but the other way is to practice mindfulness of speaking so

152
00:33:10,799 --> 00:33:16,080
not so much looking at whether is it beneficial what we're saying is it true

153
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,440
what we're saying is it kind what we're saying is it timely what we're saying all good

154
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,760
criteria for knowing how we speak but uh but just to simply bring a

155
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:34,240
non-judgmental awareness mindfulness to speech itself and to our communication

156
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:39,519
itself and and then as we do so to become more aware

157
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,120
of what's uh how we are as we speak what's what's uh prompting us to speak what are the

158
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,159
emotions what are the body sensations what how's the body activated as we

159
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:56,799
speak are we settled in our body are we outside our body are we leaning in our body pulling back

160
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:03,760
with our body what's happening with our body as we speak uh what emotions are there with this

161
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:11,599
speaking we have to what degree is there impatience when we speak to what degree is there kind of a

162
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,960
forcefulness like you have to get your word out and can't the person stop speaking so i

163
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,800
could speak there's all this there's a whole slew of things to become aware of

164
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:30,878
if we simply stop or may not to stop literally but if you start becoming attuned to

165
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:37,040
what's happening with you as you speak so just practice mindfulness of speaking

166
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:44,079
and one of the reasons why this is so powerful is that speaking is a tip of the iceberg

167
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:51,599
it represents so much of our beliefs or assumptions or desires or aversions or orientation

168
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:59,440
about life or belief about what purpose of life is and um our the sense of self that's been

169
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:05,839
reconstructed and lived with there's so many things that are kind of like underneath that tip of that iceberg

170
00:35:05,839 --> 00:35:12,560
that if we just stop and take a good look at it we start seeing some these underlying

171
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:19,760
things and we learn so much about ourselves and and if you want to like for example

172
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,119
if you want to do one thing that can reveal so much is

173
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:30,560
before you speak ask yourself why are you speaking now why do you want to

174
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:36,480
speak and maybe don't settle for the first answer if i want to speak because they

175
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:41,520
asked me directions so i want to give them directions maybe that's true

176
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:47,040
but that's maybe a little bit this you know might overlook the benefits of this exercise

177
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:54,960
and instead you ask yes they asked me directions and so i wanted to give it to them but more deeply why am i speaking oh i'm

178
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,119
trying to prove them i'm a good direction giver or i want them to like me or or i don't

179
00:36:01,119 --> 00:36:06,800
want to be seen as being unfriendly and so i want to try to make up for it or

180
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,160
i mean there's all kinds of things that can be there and there often isn't just one reason why we

181
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:19,680
speak but there's multiple reasons why we're going to say what we're going to say and it can be quite humbling to see all

182
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,960
the motivations we have as part of it and so it's a window into

183
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,800
what's under the water of the iceberg you can see so much more of who we are

184
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:39,359
one of the interesting areas to look at with speech is through the the

185
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:46,960
idea that sometimes given that leaders sometimes lead in front

186
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:52,480
and sometimes lead from behind leading in front it's like they're leading the charge and

187
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:59,040
pushing ahead and and bringing everyone along or encouraging everyone to follow

188
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:05,760
leading from behind is more encouraging it's more like letting other people take the lead and

189
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:11,680
giving them kind of you know enough space to be who they are and go forward and then to kind of offer like a

190
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:17,200
shepherd offered support guidance from behind encouragement from behind

191
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,359
um that other people don't feel like they're in the wake of a leader they don't feel like they're

192
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:28,880
becoming you know that they're only doing someone else's bidding kind of

193
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:36,800
thing so in the same way uh and when you when you have self-talk

194
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:43,920
when you talk to yourself are you asserting yourself when you are speaking

195
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,839
are you to others are you asserting yourself are you pushing ahead you have some agenda that you want to do

196
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:56,240
are you kind of leading in the front are you kind of pushing yourself into the forefront

197
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:01,680
or is there some appropriate way to lead from behind

198
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:09,599
with your self-talk or with your how you talk to other people um where leading from behind means that

199
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,920
we're not asserting ourselves we're not uh trying to manipulate or change situations so much

200
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:22,000
as that in a driven kind of way but rather we certainly can still be

201
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:27,280
involved in changing what needs to be changed but uh maybe there's more of a sense of

202
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:33,680
cooperation more sense of receptivity more sense that we're coming from a place of uh

203
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:42,319
really more in touch with ourselves more connected to ourselves than sometimes if we are if we're uh

204
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,079
you know advancing in the front and leading the whole show sometimes by being ahead of ourselves

205
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:56,640
and trying to focus on what we want and what we want to accomplish in our speak we often kind of lose touch with

206
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:02,320
ourselves we're not so much in touch with the feelings the emotions the center-ness

207
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,880
we're not resting on ourselves and i've certainly talked sometimes where i felt like i was in front of myself i was not

208
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,359
really inhabiting my body and so when we lead from behind

209
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:21,680
then um you know then we're at rest here we're connected to ourselves we know what's happening we can track our

210
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:29,599
feelings and emotions we can recognize when we're speaking in unwholesome ways much more easily

211
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:36,560
than if we're leading in the front we're not really following and tracking ourselves as carefully because we're trying focusing on the

212
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:43,280
what we're trying to accomplish what we're trying to get across so so to become aware of what are we

213
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:50,560
doing and we speak why do we speak why are we saying what we want to say

214
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,440
um and go through the layers of that be aware of the mindfulness of the body

215
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,640
as you speak be aware of what's really happening in the bigger picture of yourself

216
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:09,280
around what you're speaking or wanting to speak and say and um and then where do you where does

217
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:16,960
this are you being uh are you being driven by your speech is the speech kind of in is your speech

218
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:23,440
and your thoughts your ideas ahead of you pulling everything else about you with it so leading from you know leading from

219
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:28,640
the front or is your thinking uh coming along

220
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:35,200
with something deeper motivation deeper way of being in the world and is supporting and guiding and and um

221
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,200
and offering some leadership but from behind rather so where you're connected and

222
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:49,040
supportive for everything it's who you are so mindfulness of speaking

223
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:56,319
and that leads us to have the wherewithal to have more choice about what we say

224
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:02,480
to track what we're about to say to notice what's wholesome and what's unwholesome what might have

225
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:09,359
negative kind of consequences what might be hurtful what we want to say versus

226
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:15,760
saying things which are supportive and kind positive and

227
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:22,800
and then being better able to choose not to say this but wait and say wait

228
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:30,720
don't speak until i have something better to say something more useful to say or or more useful way of saying it

229
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:39,520
and so there's a saying that i think it's an ancient saying that

230
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:46,160
a speech is more like arrows than a sword you shoot an arrow

231
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:53,359
you can't go pull it back but you pull a sword out of a sheath you can always put it

232
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:59,359
back in the sheath so um be careful with our words

233
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:06,480
what comes out of our mouth and uh and by practicing mindfulness of speaking uh we might have the

234
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:13,119
and kind of leading from behind in a sense so we're seeing what's coming we're seeing what words wants to be said

235
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,240
then um we have much more wisdom and if our words are going to be a sword that

236
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:23,520
we're going to stab someone with and we can see it then you can put it back

237
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,640
put it back in a teeth and and see if you can say something more

238
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,119
supportive or helpful or beneficial in a situation

239
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:39,359
so my influence of speaking so of course you don't have to do this

240
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:45,119
but if what you want is to live a dharmic life and have the dharma much more fully in

241
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,680
your life in a way that is as beneficial as going on retreats or going in a monastery

242
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:56,960
um this is a way to do it it's it's a tremendous benefit tremendous good to

243
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:03,200
come out of this do it and start slowly

244
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:10,160
don't feel like you have to do all or nothing you know don't go from zero to 60 with mindfulness speech speaking in

245
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,280
three seconds maybe you do it over days where you slowly begin to

246
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:20,319
stretch yourself into this world of speaking so that you're leading from behind so you're

247
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:28,319
tracking and watching and and attentive to what's the whole world that's happening in yourself as you speak

248
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:34,480
and one of the great benefits of this is certainly you

249
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:39,680
can speak into the world in a way that's more beneficial for others

250
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:46,640
but also you begin kind of shifting how we talk to ourselves and maybe you'll find yourself with more

251
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:54,480
often with uh wholesome self-talk instead of unwholesome self-talk

252
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,839
so in these next 24 hours certainly

253
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:07,440
you might want to take time to practice with this and look at it and one way to do this that supports

254
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:13,440
this is to talk with friends about this thing i'm mindful of speaking and ask them what they've learned or tell

255
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,800
them what you're learning or what you're experimenting with and then do the experiments do the

256
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:24,960
exercise and see what you can learn today by pausing more and

257
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:33,280
and pausing more and thereby be more mindful

258
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:37,839
thank you
