1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:05,279
okay we'll get started

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:14,320
um so in this uh last few days um we've been doing a sequence of a guided

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:22,600
meditation and that is related to um opening to explore the nature

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,039
within ourselves in this body heart and

5
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:37,239
mind and we started the week uh with a um uh sense of a grounding grounding

6
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:42,879
through uh sitting like a mountain Inner

7
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:53,079
Mountain uh letting the Earth element to resting on Earth and then yesterday um we added an

8
00:00:53,079 --> 00:01:00,760
aspect of a breath and kind of the aliveness and movements of the breath

9
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:09,159
and kind of alive Mountain within and so offered this sense of En

10
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:16,520
liening and today we'll expand even further uh to include our emotional

11
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,200
thinking world uh in our this in our

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:31,920
exploratory um Discovery I guess and the word I'll be using is

13
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:38,720
enriching and so grounding enlivening and then

14
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:44,880
enriching and today and we'll um explore

15
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:53,159
that and my sense of the emotional thinking world is a rich world you know sometimes

16
00:01:53,159 --> 00:02:02,680
our relationship to them is a little tricky um and yet overall it's a very

17
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:09,160
enrich enriching Dimension uh of Being

18
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:15,280
Human so those are my uh introductory words and then we'll go into a

19
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,400
meditation right now

20
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,819
[Music]

21
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:42,120
arriving here arriving

22
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,800
now arriving at where you are and how you

23
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,080
are just as it is

24
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:13,519
you may notice how easy and quickly the Mind wants to go somewhere

25
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,480
else but we always start with where we

26
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,200
are and how we are

27
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,439
taking a few long deep breaths as you breathe

28
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:49,519
out settling downwards towards the Earth

29
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,519
sensing the ground

30
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:25,880
underneath allow this earthy body resting on Earth

31
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:44,680
feeling the skin flesh bones making contact with the floor

32
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:48,680
chairs beds

33
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:23,000
resting on the ground of Mother

34
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,800
Earth it feels like

35
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,680
this for

36
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:07,440
you may feel

37
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,199
pressure Sensations in the

38
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,199
contact temperature

39
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:47,039
the Earth element in the body is

40
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:54,360
solid heavy and a firm

41
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:16,360
grounding with the felt sense of the Earth element in the body

42
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:38,319
sitting like a mountain

43
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:48,599
within quiet

44
00:07:53,319 --> 00:07:58,240
Mountain releasing commentaries

45
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:26,280
Stories the stability and the Stillness of the Inner Mountain May

46
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,440
highlight the movements of the breath

47
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:47,399
naturally open to receive the felt

48
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:51,920
sense of the movement of the

49
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,760
breath a life Mountain

50
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:04,120
where the breeze

51
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:31,360
went your breath May expand and contract

52
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:34,680
throughout the

53
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:52,600
Torso it may expand throughout the

54
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:01,200
body en lifening the cells and the nerve systems

55
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,079
of the whole

56
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:21,160
body open to include a sense of Al

57
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,839
liess tingle in

58
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:41,959
Sensations pulsations

59
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:48,839
vibrations shimmering

60
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:14,639
the movements of the breath en livens the whole body

61
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,040
open to include the felt sense of the movement

62
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:52,639
of the emotions or emotional

63
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:58,279
thoughts are they just the thoughts

64
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:13,120
they may have a kind of embodied energetic feel to

65
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:28,480
them may feel like a waves or a thought bubbles

66
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:44,880
[Music] this aspect of being

67
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:54,880
human is Rich filled with a range wide range

68
00:12:54,880 --> 00:13:01,000
of emotions and thoughts and

69
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,839
without going into the content of the

70
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,880
thoughts feel and

71
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:20,199
sense the rich

72
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,160
Dynamic of the emotions

73
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:50,240
there may be lightness or the

74
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:59,279
weight associated with thoughts and emotions

75
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:09,909
or maybe a sense of color associated with [Music]

76
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:29,120
them open to receive the richness of this aspect of Being Human

77
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,680
like there are weather systems in the

78
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,000
mountain releasing judging

79
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:06,240
releasing

80
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:24,720
ideas open to receive the richness

81
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,040
this aspect of a Being Human in

82
00:15:53,560 --> 00:16:01,959
riches our [Music] experience e

83
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:46,319
may stay connected with the breath while

84
00:16:46,319 --> 00:16:53,040
opening to the felt sense of emotions and

85
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
thoughts

86
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

87
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840

88

e

90
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

91
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

92
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

93
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

94
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

95
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520

96
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520

97
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440

98
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

99

100

e

105
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,200
e e

106
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:56,559
and surely the mind will wander off from time to

107
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:02,518
time into this stream of thinking

108
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,398
thoughts whenever you

109
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,480
notice simply come

110
00:28:17,399 --> 00:28:20,399
back

111
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:30,120
period and I'm in it period

112
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:39,279
releasing judging criticizing

113
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:45,559
complaining blaming I should I could

114
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:17,919
just here and

115
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:24,840
now again and

116
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:31,240
again and again again

117
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,679
with the humility and the

118
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:17,880
dignity now we're back on the path

119
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:42,280
[Music]

120
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:32,519
so this week in our dads um I've been uh sharing some um ancient similes in the

121
00:31:32,519 --> 00:31:41,919
poy Canan sutta and yesterday I shared a simile that spoke about and how chicken

122
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:48,279
um incubate and hatch uh allow the uh chicks to

123
00:31:48,279 --> 00:31:56,000
hatch as a way to highlight the process of cultivation and

124
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,240
development and and this particular Sim kind of described how and there is a

125
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:10,039
need for a proper cultivation and wholehearted sincere

126
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:16,080
committed cultivation like the chicken sits on the

127
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:21,639
ex and then um but the Buddha wasn't done with that and so apparently he has

128
00:32:21,639 --> 00:32:28,519
more to say so he offered a second simile and to describe

129
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:34,120
how um and the kind of characteristics uh we

130
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:42,080
have in cultivation and the development and this is a simile of uh

131
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:47,919
o or you know I'll say acts maybe that's

132
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:56,840
something where we can relate a little more and this is a carpenter with um

133
00:32:56,840 --> 00:33:04,600
using the Hearts uh in some way let me read this um similarly to you from the

134
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:11,440
sutta and the Sut is Sam nikaya SN

135
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:22,039
22101 for those who are interested in looking it up and so here it is suppose a CER or

136
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:29,480
their Apprentice sees the marks of uh his fingers and and a thumb on the

137
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:37,200
handle of his ass they don't know how much of the handle was worn away today

138
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:44,240
how much yesterday and how much previously they just know what has been

139
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,600
won away in the same way when a practitioner

140
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:55,240
is committed to development they don't know how much of

141
00:33:55,240 --> 00:34:03,720
the TS or defilements were worn away today how much yesterday and how much

142
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,919
previously they just know what has been worn

143
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:18,000
off uh this is quite interesting that I thought uh wow this is simly carries a

144
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:25,760
very different flavor or a texture uh than the chicken and the eggs um and

145
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:33,200
this similarly kind of point out another aspect of the

146
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,358
practice um particularly it's highlighting that the measurements of

147
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:48,240
our practice how long it takes how much it has been done how much more is

148
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:56,679
left I mean this kind of questions kind of make no sense because honestly we

149
00:34:56,679 --> 00:35:01,800
really don't know oh and so in the

150
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:07,839
sutta the words used here they don't know they don't know how

151
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:13,720
much was worn off yesterday or how much was was worn off

152
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,160
previously and so that's the truth of it that we really don't

153
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:27,200
know and this can be so challenging for uh our human psyche or the ego's

154
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:35,040
normal way of orienting Our Lives is we really like definitive lines at the end

155
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:43,960
of the race track you know the goals the expectations uh ever since school days

156
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:51,800
you know we have grades to measure ourselves and we have I don't know

157
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:58,200
uh bonus to to measure how we do at work and um

158
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:04,520
we have all the things that we use to measure ourselves against did you get a

159
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:12,680
house did you get married and so we are very trained in this way of orienting

160
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:20,000
our lives and uh this kind of a Tendencies

161
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:26,560
can lead to quite excessive judging evaluating

162
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:33,520
calculating comparing fixing striving so you name it

163
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:44,000
right and yet the Dharma doesn't work this way the Dharma unfolding doesn't happen

164
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:51,839
this way um I remember there were times that in

165
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,880
my my own mind I'm like constantly asking myself am I there yet am am I

166
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:04,880
there yet you know and not knowing what they there means but that's the kind of

167
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:11,440
orientation we can have

168
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:19,839
um the nature of the Dharma unfolding is not based on our logical

169
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:25,200
analysis measurements or expectations it is

170
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:29,520
lawful and yet

171
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:38,560
unfathomable I'm aware that uh you know many of us may not have been uh in

172
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:46,200
carpentry um yet with this assimil um we can feel into this process

173
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:51,640
and Buddha used this assimile I thought quite vividly that

174
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:57,760
illustrate um our cultivation process and for example

175
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:04,280
and this is simly at the beginning of our practice for a long while that may

176
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:15,280
not be very obvious signs of thumb prints fingerprints on us or we can say in our

177
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,680
practice uh there's nothing really visible on the

178
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:26,240
surface that uh changed and yet are we still practice

179
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:34,160
with commitment and as best as we are able I remember early days I was really

180
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:42,079
kind of uh sitting with the community maybe I'm borrowing the faith or the trust from the community I'm practicing

181
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:47,440
with or borrow borrowing kind of a trust from the

182
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,960
teachers and um intellectually the teachings make sense and so there are

183
00:38:53,960 --> 00:38:59,680
this different ways to allow us to continue to

184
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:09,359
engage and um the thumb marks the finger marks uh may become kind of a visible um

185
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:14,440
after a long process but it doesn't mean that we

186
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:20,440
wouldn't know anything uh in this unfolding I think that will be pretty

187
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:27,720
hopeless at least to my mind you know so and that's what the cryptic and

188
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:35,119
the Intriguing statement at the end of this assimile comes in it says they just

189
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:42,280
know what has been worn off so you know you're holding the ax

190
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:49,730
and you keep using it at some point and you do see your marks on the on the

191
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:54,960
[Music] handle and so the statement is and they

192
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:01,640
just know what has been worn away I don't actually know exactly what this

193
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,720
line means but I can think of some different

194
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:13,319
cases that may be relevant here so I'm going to share a few different things

195
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:21,119
here for example through the practice um in the

196
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:29,280
moment sometimes uh we can know that maybe a moment of

197
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:35,359
frustration arises and they fade it fades

198
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:43,440
away when we don't react to it or criticizing ourselves or others and so

199
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,520
there is a momentary knowing of something Fades

200
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:56,880
away that so often that we otherwise would have reacted to it so in this way

201
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:03,400
we can know for ourselves oh we're actually suffering

202
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:12,119
less even if it's just a for a moment and also through the practice

203
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:18,960
over time I don't know exactly how long this may be kind of U for

204
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:25,359
individuals uh rather subjective for individuals to feel in their own way and

205
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:30,440
there's no for formula you you know we can reflect for

206
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:37,400
ourselves sometimes at times we can recognize that the some of the habitual

207
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:46,400
reactivities or unskillful reactivities of a a body mind speech has a lessoned

208
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:54,040
or they thinged out like yesterday my husband and I um were sitting over

209
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:01,079
lunch and uh he made a comment com to me I said oh your sharp edges is softened a

210
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:06,960
lot still comes out occasionally and I took that as a

211
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:14,680
compliment so so there's a process it does allow us to smooth

212
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:20,960
out uh some of the sharp edges of our

213
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:32,400
reactivities and allow us to have this um uh marks of a change uh in uh in

214
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:39,880
our uh in our ways of being and I myself want to share a a

215
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:45,359
story that I discovered um in the process of my U

216
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:51,000
practice there was a very habitual pattern I recognized and that U I think

217
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:57,319
through my early years that I um was very Thrifty

218
00:42:57,319 --> 00:43:05,160
and so I would uh notice that I often stand in the grocery line and looking at

219
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:10,359
items prices and discounts and I would have started calculating you know how

220
00:43:10,359 --> 00:43:16,760
much would I save this even though I've got everything in my heart you know I don't need to buy anything but this

221
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:22,720
would just start churning and at some point I realized

222
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:27,880
wow this is kind of a weary sum

223
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:35,720
in my mind uh why would I keep doing this and so I uh started a letting go of

224
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:41,720
this whenever I notice this calculating mind is

225
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:48,599
happening and at some point one day I stood in the grocery

226
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:56,040
line waiting to check out I noticed oh there was no more

227
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:02,319
calculating in my mind that was

228
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:12,200
interesting and so um through the practice some of the patterns do s thing

229
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:19,839
out so we can know this for ourselves and they may not be completely

230
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:29,400
gone but we can notice and their momentum has maybe settle a bit and so

231
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:38,480
we can know something about defilement the things uh being worn off worn away

232
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:44,640
and so that can give us a kind of a trust and confidence in our

233
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:51,880
practice and so that's the simile of um

234
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:01,640
o may we all grow uh the degrees of confidence and Trust in

235
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:09,800
our practice may we all benefit from it and may it benefit all beings around

236
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:15,119
us thank you for your attention and

237
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:21,880
so be well everyone see you tomorrow

238
00:45:27,290 --> 00:45:34,989
