1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,280
well a warm good day to everyone very happy to be with you this

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:14,040
week and yesterday we discussed how generosity is one of the

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,960
foundational virtues that help us cultivate wholesome states of mind and

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,519
one invitation from yesterday was to notice forms of generosity throughout

5
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:33,000
the day if anyone would like to type examples of generosity they noticed

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
yesterday into the chat please feel welcome to do that and I'll read a few

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,680
of them aloud in a few minutes um they are examples uh that not

8
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:52,960
only show generosity but also frequently contain an attitude of kindness and

9
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,239
Goodwill towards ourselves towards other people other beings in fact towards

10
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:06,960
everything we experience and I'm dedicating this week's talks to beautiful qualities of

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,360
Mind wholesome qualities of mind starting with generosity and including the four Divine

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:21,159
abodes or Brahma viharas these are wholesome places for

13
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:27,880
the mind to hang out to dwell the intentions that motivate the

14
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:35,200
Divine abodes of good will compassion appreciative joy and

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,720
Equanimity are relational they seek the well-being and happiness of other others

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,920
and in doing so they actually support one's own well-being and happiness uh so

17
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,079
today we'll focus on this wonderful intention of Good Will towards others

18
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,880
meta in the ancient poly language and often translated as loving kindness

19
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:07,840
friendliness or benevolence I'll read a few of the examples that you typed into the chat

20
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:12,920
and as I do that you might want to begin the meditation with these beautiful

21
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,800
examples of Goodwill of friendliness loving kindness so one person shares

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,599
someone wrote me a long email letter another kindness from my son

23
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:32,160
towards my old dog my grandson's taking care of Grandpa who balance is poor a

24
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:39,239
friend's flexibility Christmas cards full of humor and warm

25
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:45,519
silliness yeah beautiful making books with grandchildren during a busy dinner

26
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:54,120
with a long arm stapler fun for me and my kids um Cindy's daughter made them

27
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,720
cinnamon rolls and it took most of her day that's wonderful so so as we settle

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:08,120
into the meditation holding these beautiful forms of kindness in our

29
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:15,920
hearts and sitting lying down standing

30
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:23,200
whichever posture you're in settling in

31
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:31,680
with a way of meeting conditions just as you experience them in this moment

32
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:49,560
noticing Sensations in the body perhaps and

33
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,319
deliberately consciously meeting that whether it's Pleasant or unpleasant or

34
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,360
neither meeting any Sensations that are arising

35
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:06,239
with as much benevolence as is available to you right

36
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:15,239
now these bodies need tender loving care very

37
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,280
often and they return tender loving

38
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
care

39
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:46,440
meeting the State of Mind the heart moods emotions with

40
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:58,600
kindness our feelings come and go Pleasant unpleasant very difficult

41
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:05,120
very joyful greeting it all with

42
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:31,160
friendliness if the mind is preoccupied with something meeting that with Goodwill

43
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:38,639
not viewing thinking as the enemy as Gil was so eloquently pointing to last

44
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,280
week meeting it with some thoughts just letting them

45
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:53,120
drift by if others are very

46
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,520
preoccupying perhaps inviting them to drift into the background for now and

47
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,280
and promising to pick them up

48
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,560
later if they're important they'll

49
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:33,639
wait what would it be like what might it be like to receive everything that

50
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:40,199
arises in meditation as you would greet a

51
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:02,520
friend whether this friend is bringing happy news or is sharing their most

52
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:08,960
profound difficulty with us receiving the friend

53
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,759
with a heart of

54
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
caring

55
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:44,360
in a very kind simple way receiving whatever is arising in

56
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,800
Awareness In This

57
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,440
Moment whatever is most

58
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
prominent

59
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,440
feeling it sensing into

60
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:22,960
it allowing it to be

61
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
known

62
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:48,560
and knowing what's arising at its own pace there's no need to go

63
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,720
out looking for things there's no need to

64
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:00,880
dig and there's no need to push away simply allowing experience to

65
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:08,800
arrive some will arrive and stay for a while some experience will be

66
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:36,040
fleeting receiving whatever arises with

67
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,399
benevolence with

68
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:56,560
kindness even what's unpleasant what you thought might not

69
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:03,320
be part of meditation but actually is part of

70
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,040
meditation taking your time

71
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,199
resting with what comes into

72
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
awareness

73
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,320
and if it's useful to you perhaps silently inclining the

74
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:14,680
Mind towards wishes for your

75
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,279
well-being they might sound like what I'll offer here or they might be your

76
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:32,399
own unique wishes may I be free from

77
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:45,440
hostility free from Affliction from physical

78
00:11:55,079 --> 00:12:00,959
suffering may I be free from distress

79
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:07,000
from mental

80
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:25,079
suffering may I live happily with

81
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
ease

82
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,279
may I be

83
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,839
well may I be safe

84
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,000
may I be

85
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,760
happy may I live with ease

86
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:48,320
allowing your heart and mind to send these kind

87
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:57,560
wishes to all of you to all of your experience nothing left

88
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:03,800
out wishing for

89
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:10,829
well-being freedom from harm inner and outer [Music]

90
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,880
harm happiness and

91
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,279
contentment and

92
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
ease

93
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:42,919
if there are difficult conditions that are arising restlessness

94
00:20:42,919 --> 00:20:50,080
Pain any kind of difficulty receiving it with the same

95
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:56,120
kind of goodwi knowing that prior

96
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:01,480
conditions sometimes result in these

97
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:06,679
ways and causes and conditions come and

98
00:21:18,039 --> 00:21:28,400
go sending it a kind wish may I be calm and patient with

99
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:31,000
difficult

100
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
conditions

101
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:17,000
and if as you receive what's arising in Awareness what's most prominent is

102
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:23,360
thoughts of other people in your lives allowing that as well and perhaps

103
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,480
sending them wishes for well-being

104
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,799
for safety for

105
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:40,960
happiness and for ease or particular wishes that apply to

106
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:45,049
their [Music]

107
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
situation

108
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
for

109
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:39,840
yesterday I shared and all of you shared about generosity and how it's considered an

110
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:47,279
important strength to develop in order to begin to ready the mind to fully take

111
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:52,600
in the teachings of the Buddha and move towards freedom from

112
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:59,360
suffering aan suito uh lists generosity as one one of three fundamental

113
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:07,000
trainings of the mind that we need in order to benefit from the Dharma the other two that help us get

114
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:13,799
started on the path to Freedom include cultivation of Virtues

115
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:19,240
ethics and the cultivation of renunciation which I like to think of as

116
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:26,159
letting go of unh wholesome impulses in favor of what's

117
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,200
wholesome so one of the wholesome kinds of States

118
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:38,279
we can let go into is the first of these

119
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:44,039
Brahma viharas these Divine abodes and that is meta in the ancient poly

120
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:52,679
language So Meta can be translated as Goodwill as loving kindness friendliness

121
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:59,799
benevolence and it's a quality that tends to develop naturally over time with dedicated regular practice of

122
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:06,559
meditation and mindfulness and sometimes people are surprised to find it welling up

123
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:12,320
spontaneously um find themselves just feeling almost close to tears from

124
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:17,440
feelings of kindness or feelings of compassion that well

125
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:25,279
up so it's also a quality that we can deliberately cultivate by inclining the

126
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:30,960
mind in meditation and daily life towards these silent wishes of Good Will

127
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:38,639
that we were offering in the meditation some of us uh offering goodwi kindness

128
00:32:38,639 --> 00:32:45,240
friendliness towards oneself or others um both really as well as good

129
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:51,240
will towards all experience so greeting what happens what comes up in meditation

130
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:59,600
with friendliness and there's this quality of kindness that rests on this fundamental

131
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:05,559
kind of willingness benevolence towards other people and towards experience um

132
00:33:05,559 --> 00:33:12,880
the the first phrases I offered to you were from uh suta called PTI Sam

133
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:19,360
Maga sorry that's a mouthful and it goes may they be free from

134
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:28,720
hostility free from Affliction free from distress may they live happily

135
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,320
acharia Buddha was a monk who took ordination at

136
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:42,200
the age of 26 um after resigning from the military after World War Two and he became a

137
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,600
prolific writer who established the mahab Bodhi Society of Bangalore he

138
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,159
established schools hospitals um hosts and in addition he

139
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:01,760
wrote 150 books so this is is one of the generous people in the last century in

140
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,799
the beginning of this Century who offered a lot of support to people

141
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:14,919
around him and to us in an essay about meta he pointed out that the aim of meta

142
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:20,480
practice is to grow boundless with practice and

143
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:26,358
to overcome all social religious racial

144
00:34:26,359 --> 00:34:34,118
political and economic barriers meta is indeed a universal unselfish and all

145
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:40,240
embracing love so that's pretty amazing to hear that we begin to understand that

146
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:47,040
this practice of friendliness a kindness is aimed at nothing short of complete

147
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:54,398
freedom from suffering for all of humanity without exception it is the medicine that can

148
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:01,160
heal the world and this is why we cultivate ated it's the ultimate in ethical

149
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:07,760
conduct so I thought I'd read aloud to you Gill's translation of the

150
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:15,200
meta and it offers a flavor of how thoroughly we can develop this loving

151
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:22,079
kindness this Good Will and it also points to the benefits of meta how you

152
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,960
can reach the state of peace and no longer be caught in round after round of

153
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,520
stress suffering so I'll I'll make a few notes as I read it the first section is

154
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:43,040
actually talking about ethical conduct to reach the state of Peace one

155
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:49,839
skilled in the good should be capable and upright straightforward and easy to

156
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:55,040
speak to Gentle and not proud contented

157
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,079
and easily supported living lightly and with few

158
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:08,359
duties wise and with senses calmed not arrogant and without Greed

159
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:15,359
for supporters and should not do the least thing that the wise would

160
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:22,839
criticize notice that the last line is actually talking about renunciation letting go of unh wholesome behavior and

161
00:36:22,839 --> 00:36:28,079
should not do the least thing that the wise would criticize

162
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:37,280
the next section describes the meditation or reflection we can do that leads to a collected mind somadi a

163
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,000
collected mind that's wholesome and if you practice meta very

164
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:52,680
sincerely it does reach uh levels of concentration and Sade so one should reflect may all be

165
00:36:52,680 --> 00:37:00,400
happy and secure may all beings be happy at heart all living beings whether weak

166
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:05,920
or strong tall L large medium or short

167
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:14,800
tiny or big seen or unseen near or distant born or to be born May they all

168
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:23,319
be happy let no one deceive another or despise anyone anywhere let no one

169
00:37:23,319 --> 00:37:28,599
through anger or aversion wish for others to suffer

170
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:37,040
and the final section has to do with making a total commitment to meta to Goodwill for

171
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:43,040
everyone for society as a whole as a parent would risk their own

172
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:49,760
life to protect their child their only child so towards all beings should one

173
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:56,240
cultivate a boundless heart with loving kindness for the whole world should one

174
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:03,280
cul CV at a boundless heart above below and all around without

175
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:10,160
obstruction without hate and without ill will standing or walking sitting or

176
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,480
lying down whenever one is awake May one stay with this

177
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:22,760
recollection this is called Sublime abiding here and now one who is virtuous

178
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:30,760
endowed with vision not taken by Vi use and having overcome all Greed for

179
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,960
sensual pleasure will not be reborn

180
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:42,760
again I love this Su I memorized it about 16 years ago and I for many years

181
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:47,960
I would say it every every morning first thing in the morning mentally recite it

182
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:53,240
and reflect on what it was saying uh living in the ethical way

183
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:58,920
described in this muta is actually wholesome behavior and it has a number

184
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:06,319
of beneficial results increasing happiness and peace of mind uh the mind that no longer gets

185
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:12,319
stuck in remorse worry and restlessness over time this cultivation

186
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:19,079
of meta is wise speech it's wise action and it's wise livelihood in other words

187
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:25,200
as a whole wise conduct that enables us to progress in this practice on the path

188
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:33,240
to Freedom so by behaving in an ethical virtuous way and also letting go of unh

189
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:39,440
wholesome behaviors the result is inner happiness and

190
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:45,839
goodwi as expressed in another translation of two lines of the muta may

191
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:53,200
all be well and secure may all beings be happy that's really wishing for the best

192
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:00,520
for everyone not only does this ethical Behavior Uh you know or virtue result in

193
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:09,079
your own well-being and the opportunity to make progress in the Dharma but it also means giving a gift to other people

194
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:15,920
and other beings and that gift is fearlessness and security two beautiful

195
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,760
words in paully Abaya Don and Kema Donna

196
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:29,880
giving those to others can you imagine giving every every being fearlessness and

197
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:38,720
security the planet would operate a lot differently if that were given the meta is also in poly called A

198
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:46,040
parita and A parita is a spiritual formula that safeguards one's

199
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:52,760
well-being protects us against all dangers and is said to rescue one from

200
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:59,119
mishap and Misfortune I it doesn't really for me it doesn't need to be a spiritual formula

201
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:05,560
it creates an inner state that makes it unlikely that you'll

202
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:11,440
do things that have unfortunate results it makes sense to me that when you're

203
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:19,520
coming from a place of Goodwill towards other people you're not harming them you're not doing unethical

204
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:25,200
things other people are much less likely to want to harm you they're much more

205
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:34,359
likely to greet you friendliness and with Goodwill in return so I hope uh that you enjoy this

206
00:41:34,359 --> 00:41:40,440
cultivation of kindness and friendliness uh for yourself and for

207
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:47,240
other people for other beings and maybe if you are interested in treating this

208
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,720
week as a retreat you can cultivate these wishes of Goodwill these wishes of

209
00:41:52,720 --> 00:42:00,119
benevolence all day today for you know anyone you encounter send them some silent wish for their health and

210
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:05,160
happiness their safety uh their ease and they'll they

211
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:11,359
won't even know that that's what you're doing and that's one of the joys of this meditation you're silently sending these

212
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:18,720
things to other people and other beings all day long and um by doing this you're

213
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:25,839
really growing your own practice in your own heart uh so actually I there's a good

214
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:33,800
question in the chat where do I find the written copy of the meta Gil published a book called the

215
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:40,280
issue at hand which is available on the IMC website you can uh link to resources

216
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:45,520
and find the books that he's published and I think that one uh is available

217
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:52,000
free of charge offered freely and um the metas is printed if if I recall

218
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,200
correctly close to the back cover or the last few pages and it's really lovely

219
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:03,599
practice to memorize it and practice with it every day so I wish everybody a

220
