00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:13,440
hello everyone and welcome to our morning on meditation and

2
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,240
maybe for some of us to be productively uncomfortable or wisely uncomfortable

3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:28,080
because sometimes in meditation things are uncomfortable and to learn how to sit quietly

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,600
peacefully non-reactively with our discomfort is

5
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,640
one of the great values of meditation

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,559
people often think meditation has to do with becoming calm and peaceful

7
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,239
and that's the end of the story but we're probably more important is to learn how

8
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,399
to be wisely present attentive to whatever is happening in

9
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:05,360
our life so that no matter where we go we can find a wise way of being present

10
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,799
and maybe that means there's a kind of calmness and peacefulness in the

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,159
attentiveness or maybe it's we've learned how to rest

12
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,680
in a certain kind of way in our discomfort things that are difficult

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,479
so we will meditate

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:34,560
and if anything feels uncomfortable

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,600
maybe avoid if you can

16
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:48,880
seeing that as being unfortunate in some ways it might be

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,560
but maybe there's no other perspective that would be useful for this period of time

18
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,799
and maybe the perspective that would be useful is that maybe for now maybe there's a way of

19
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:07,280
resting in the discomfort breathing with the discomfort

20
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,360
that will teach you something that will serve you throughout the day

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:22,440
throughout your life maybe even so assuming a up upright

22
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,120
meditation posture

23
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:37,840
and it doesn't necessarily doesn't necessarily mean physically upright but a posture in which you will not collapse

24
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,879
that you will somehow stay present and open [Music]

25
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:51,080
in lowering your gaze softening

26
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,040
your focus and if it's comfortable gently closing

27
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,280
your eyes

28
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:18,440
and taking a few moments here to familiarize yourself with how you are right now

29
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,959
and perhaps becoming aware of how you are in your body

30
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,680
and if you're uncomfortable maybe at the beginning here if there are simple ways of shifting

31
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:47,400
your posture so that it's more comfortable please do

32
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:19,040
and then if there are ways now that you're uncomfortable in your body

33
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,080
let it be and gently lovingly

34
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,080
breathe through it breathe with it as if the breath lovingly accompanies

35
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:40,600
the discomfort while allowing it to be there

36
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,880
taking a few long slow deep breaths

37
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:20,800
as you breathe in deeply maybe take feel your body globally

38
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:27,759
feel whatever is pleasant unpleasant comfortable uncomfortable

39
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:31,479
take it all in

40
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:45,120
and as you exhale long quiet exhale

41
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,960
let it all settle let it all settle together

42
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:55,960
here

43
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,000
letting your breathing return to normal

44
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:27,600
and in whatever way it's easy as you breathe

45
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:35,080
have a sense that you're breathing aware of your whole body

46
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:42,000
global awareness of body with breathing in the middle

47
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,800
the movements of the chest the belly

48
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:02,160
a global awareness of what's comfortable and uncomfortable

49
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:11,520
pleasant and unpleasant all held in a kind of global awareness

50
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:17,240
with breathing accompanying it all

51
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,400
a global awareness where you're not defined by what's pleasant

52
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,560
and not defined by what's unpleasant not focused on one or the other

53
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:46,479
exclusively but for now a global broad

54
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:51,759
panoramic awareness of your body

55
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,639
breathing with it

56
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,520
and then whatever is most comfortable for you letting your attention become

57
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,200
more focused on a particular place in your body where you're breathing

58
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:44,080
or have it focus in a particular place in the body where that's calling your attention

59
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,319
or continuing with a global awareness

60
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:57,920
that holds it all openly calmly

61
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:04,399
without prioritizing what's comfortable or uncomfortable

62
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:12,120
but takes it all in in the cycles of breathing

63
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,820
[Music]

64
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,480
so

65
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:24,960
and as we come to the end of the sitting

66
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:30,960
to once again have a global

67
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:36,158
experience of your body whatever way that's easy

68
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:47,440
wide angle lens for your embodied experience

69
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,840
aware of the movements of breathing as it moves through your body

70
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:02,640
the chest the belly the shoulders

71
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,799
the rib cage front and back

72
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,080
a global experience of the body

73
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,480
and to whatever degree you're able to

74
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,880
see if you can rest in this body

75
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:34,720
maybe a feeling that attention settles and rests throughout the body

76
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,919
letting go of tension holding

77
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,600
and then staying in this global body

78
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,320
relaxed as you can turn your attention outward now

79
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:50,720
to the people you'll encounter today the work you'll do activities of the day

80
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:01,679
and become aware of it all remember it all while staying

81
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:08,720
rooted in your body relaxed in your body

82
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,440
the best you can

83
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:30,080
and from a place of goodness within place of warmth or kindness

84
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:35,759
a place where you care your care is born

85
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,200
to awaken a well-wishing for all the

86
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:53,600
people you'll encounter all the activities you'll do and for yourself in those

87
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:02,158
activities and offer words of well-wishing

88
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,320
may all these people all of us

89
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:16,640
be happy free of stress and strife

90
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:25,679
may all of us be safe free of hostility and

91
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,320
ill-will

92
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:39,039
may all of us be peaceful free of agitation

93
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:47,760
conflict and may all of us be free

94
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,919
free of compulsivity and oppression

95
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:08,840
may all beings be happy may all beings be free

96
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,960
and may we be messengers of this into the world

97
00:30:28,970 --> 00:30:32,239
[Music]

98
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:38,079
[Music]

99
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,159
so again good morning and this week we're

100
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:29,519
exploring the topic of discomfort that is a

101
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:35,360
common experience of life and becoming wiser about it

102
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:43,679
so discomfort so one of the things about discomfort that's useful to practice

103
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:49,760
is to make a distinction see the distinction between the discomfort which is

104
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:56,880
physical pure and simply physical and that which is more emotional or

105
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,399
mental and the reason for the distinction is that um

106
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:07,440
if it's physical discomfort if that's the one of the primary characteristics of

107
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,840
the discomfort or if you see the physical discomfort as the

108
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:18,000
the um you know the most obvious part of it

109
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:23,440
then uh what what we can do is rest in the discomfort

110
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:29,760
and this might seem paradoxical but to find where the discomfort is in the body

111
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,120
maybe the stomach is uh in knots or maybe the chest is uh swirling and

112
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:43,200
agitation or tight whatever it might be there's a restlessness that we feel in

113
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,799
our arms and our legs our hands and wherever it might be the physical

114
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:54,720
symptoms of being uncomfortable is um

115
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:00,480
you know you might be in pain is uh to see if it's possible to have

116
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,240
the attention or have your yourself rest into the discomfort

117
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,799
and um so that the discomfort is not a source for agitation

118
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:18,640
but rather is the basis where we kind of we stop to really

119
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:23,679
rest in it to be with it to allow it to be there

120
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:28,799
but not allowing it to be there um to do whatever it wants

121
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:34,320
but allowing it so something inside of us stays close to it and rests in it

122
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:41,120
it's kind of like a friend of ours might be really upset and agitated about something difficult that just happened

123
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:46,960
and maybe obviously very uncomfortable and um and you might come over and just

124
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,519
sit next to your friend or you might come over next to your friend and and uh and hold their hand

125
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:58,559
and you're the calm presence you kind of rest calmly with the with a person

126
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:04,080
so to feel the physical restlessness or the discomfort and

127
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:09,679
breathe with it feel it in your body center yourself on it and

128
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:14,720
find a way of being grounded or centered through it

129
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:21,919
not around it and uh you know by avoiding it and

130
00:34:21,919 --> 00:34:27,599
so partly what this is doing is learning

131
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:34,560
to not give in to the reactivity of the discomfort the subject of yesterday's talk all the different ways

132
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:41,760
we might react to it but rather to not allow the reactivity to take over but to find how to rest in

133
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:47,760
it and sometimes this physical discomfort if we do that we'll begin

134
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:55,760
relaxing itself and it also allows for a

135
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,079
the second part of stopping and that is seeing and there's this pairing in buddhism of

136
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:07,680
stopping and seeing we stop we slow down we calm down

137
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,160
in order to see more clearly and when we're uncomfortable and agitated by that there's not going to be

138
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:19,440
a lot of clear seeing so to find find find out where that is in the

139
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:24,640
body and rest in it and breathe with it and so if it's

140
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:31,520
a social discomfort rather than spitting out in the mind and

141
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:39,040
the thoughts about what's happening socially find the physical discomfort and rest in it or stand in it or

142
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:45,599
open to it or breathe with it and that's a this is an art form or it's a skill to learn

143
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,480
this skill of turning towards a discomfort and resting in it um and

144
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:58,240
you'll probably you might find that there's a kind of rest there's a kind of calmness that can be found in the middle of the

145
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,760
storm by resting attention and just being with it for what this is uncomfortable in

146
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:11,040
being with it if it's a emotional or psychological discomfort a

147
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:18,720
social discomfort what has to do with the ideas and thoughts and experiences that happen interpersonally

148
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,800
if it is a if there's physical manifestations of that then

149
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:31,440
it's really useful to rest in that to stop and really feel it it might be the simplest way the easiest

150
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:38,640
way to begin relaxing and not being caught in the grip of the social uh

151
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,240
emotional discomfort that might be there the discomfort doesn't have to go away

152
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,839
so that's a little bit of a trap to think you're trying to get rid of it but there's a way of resting in it

153
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:56,640
that gives us a vantage point in which to see more clearly to not be

154
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,079
seeing through the reactivity we might have so not of course not all social

155
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:07,119
situations we find ourselves give us a time to do that but there are some where we can just

156
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:14,319
take take our time which is okay i'm really uncomfortable here let me feel it and be with it

157
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:19,920
occasionally there's a there's something that's uncomfortable that's not so much physical but

158
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,040
primarily mental or emotional and then it's interesting to also come

159
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:31,119
to your body and find uh you know find the little remnants of or

160
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,960
little places where traces of that discomfort in your body even though the primary thing is psychological

161
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,400
and and maybe it's easy to relax that way or maybe we find the body

162
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:49,520
becomes the the holder or the grounding from by which we're not caught or

163
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:55,599
trapped by the thoughts the stories the judgments that are involved in the

164
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:00,800
social discomfort we have or if there's uncomfortable things

165
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,079
happening around us we're not so much we're not taking it in as deeply

166
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:12,720
uh if we feel the body the body becomes more porous or balanced or that sometimes the body becomes more of

167
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:18,400
a shield even from the social discomfort coming into

168
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:25,920
the mind or into the heart so to uh to find some place of rest

169
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:31,440
and in the body in relationship to discomfort

170
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,480
get grounded get stabilized in the body and sometimes that can involve changing

171
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:42,480
your posture if you're standing stand and stand in such a way that

172
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:49,119
you're kind of like a that really balanced and strong in the posture like you're both feet they're

173
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:54,960
firmly on the ground and you're standing tall and maybe even if you can if it allows the situation allows it close

174
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,480
your eyes and really feel be with the body if you're sitting in a chair

175
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,599
uh they're also make sure you don't you're not in a posture that collapses or a posture that is overly tense

176
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:13,760
but take a balanced kind of upright posture uh that where the body

177
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,880
support the body supports embodied awareness

178
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:24,960
so they keep coming back to the body and then the second part of it is the seeing

179
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:31,680
to stop to rest in to stop for the discomfort really feel it

180
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:38,960
in such a way that the mind quiets down just enough that there is space to really now

181
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:44,480
study what is really going on here and maybe we can look at all discomfort as a

182
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,560
messenger and the question is what is the message what is it to learn here in the

183
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:57,440
situation and there's many things that can make us uneasy and sometimes the uneasiness discomfort

184
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:04,960
is actually a wise thing to listen to there's some real message here something is wrong here something is off and maybe

185
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:11,599
i need to listen to this maybe i need to pay more careful attention what is going on here and many times in my life i felt

186
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,760
uncomfortable about by about something and it didn't really stop to look at it or take it take it in

187
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,040
and so i i overrid overwrote it and did something or said something that

188
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,880
or participated in something that later i regretted where initially there was the warning this is this doesn't feel

189
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:35,440
right and now that not feeling right is part of this discom why is discomfort

190
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,200
in other times where my discomfort was limiting me i was afraid and

191
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,720
and so i was uncomfortable because i was somehow neurotically anxious about something

192
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:54,240
about what was happening and i felt myself pulling back or shutting down and limited by the discomfort

193
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,800
and and i learned that if i stopped and really brought presence to it attention to it

194
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:07,359
that i could see oh here i am holding myself back i'm anxious i'm i'm afraid

195
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,400
do i need to be afraid should i give into the fear

196
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:20,400
sometimes it's appropriate to override the fear or open up to the situation be willing to be vulnerable

197
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:26,880
like for example if it's uh someone is you know has a lot of warmth a lot of

198
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:32,400
kindness and care and love it can be it can be frightening sometimes to have

199
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,880
someone really love love us but is it necessary to be frightened is it possible to open

200
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,119
what's the message what is the discomfort about and and so sometimes we stop we learn to

201
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,440
rest in the discomfort rest in the physicality of it so we can begin

202
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,079
investigating considering what is the message of discomfort what is it telling us what

203
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,839
is it how is it useful to know and what is the useful way of being

204
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,680
with it is it to open up is it to heed it this is to to

205
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,280
step back is to stay quiet is it to step forward is it to understand ourselves

206
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:21,200
better is to investigate what is happening here for me so

207
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:29,040
this willingness this ability to stop for discomfort and to rest in it kind of resting

208
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,560
in the agitation resting in the unresting discomfort is a kind of something is not

209
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:40,720
really at ease and so resting in the unease

210
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:47,920
and see what happens discover what happens what opens up and so this resting in discomfort

211
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,960
is a stepping stone to begin being able to ask ourselves what's the message here

212
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,560
what is it to learn here is this discomfort useful and wise is it

213
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:05,599
not useful is it unwise and we can answer that question much better if we've stopped and figure out

214
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:13,119
learn how to rest in it and make room for it in space for it and chances are

215
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:19,520
is that chances are that uh more often than not

216
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:26,400
there will be at the time you'll have the time the space maybe even just a minute or a few seconds to

217
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:32,160
step back and and rest in the discomfort and rest in the body the physicality of it and see

218
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:38,720
what happens see what opens see what you learn see what might relax

219
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:41,839
so um

220
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:52,319
and uh so i wish you well some of you will be traveling and going in places where

221
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:58,560
maybe lots of joy and might also be a fair amount of discomfort as well and

222
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,720
gatherings that might be happening and so maybe it'd be a wonderful laboratory

223
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,000
to explore your discomfort and develop greater wisdom and

224
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,480
self-understanding around this territory of discomfort and maybe

225
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,599
these next days will go easier for you thank you
