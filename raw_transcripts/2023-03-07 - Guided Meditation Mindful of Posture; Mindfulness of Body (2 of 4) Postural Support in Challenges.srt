1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,759
good morning everyone or hello good afternoon in some places evening

2
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,000
and others happy to be here with you

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,779
and we continue uh you know this overall series on

4
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,719
practice working with challenges

5
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:39,379
one of the important principles of Buddhism is that

6
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:45,440
our inner life what we how we engage it how we work it

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,460
is the nutriment the food for certain

8
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:57,539
things to grow so we want to be careful what we feed and one way of understanding this is

9
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:06,060
that our capacity for attention is a kind of food this that feeds whatever it

10
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,119
goes into and so if we give all our

11
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:17,960
attention to fear to despair to

12
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:23,520
anger to preoccupation to

13
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:29,520
our imagination our projections of what's going to happen

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,400
if all our attention goes in there we're actually feeding those very things in a certain way or feeding something which

15
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:40,799
is not actually so beneficial for us and the analogy would be maybe something

16
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:48,720
like if a person has two Good Feet that they can walk on

17
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,140
and and they've learned to walk and they can be walk stably and well and

18
00:01:55,140 --> 00:02:01,680
and um but if they give no attention zero attention to

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,940
their feet as they walk and all their attention goes into the hands swinging making sure they swing

20
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,040
far enough and far enough away from the body close enough to the body the right

21
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:19,739
whatever just everything goes into there absorbs and just The Swinging of the arms

22
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:27,660
then the feet might be functioning but the full support the full

23
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:34,379
um benefits of those feet might not be available to us we might not notice

24
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:42,599
where we're stepping we might not notice that there's a cliff we're walking into we might walk on difficult gravel and

25
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:49,379
not really pay attention to where to walk or slippery ground and not pay attention so because we're not paying

26
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:54,959
attention to our walking and our feet and where they go we are not benefiting

27
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:01,500
from what's possible how they can support us so the same way if we're most of our

28
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:07,260
attention is going into our preoccupations our fears our all these things

29
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:12,959
then we're not available for a broader support as we go through our

30
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,319
life one of those supports the Buddha gave is

31
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,120
our posture and he talks about in mindfulness

32
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,000
instructions clearly knowing that you're sitting when you're sitting the posture of sitting

33
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,700
know that you're standing when you're standing know that you're walking as you walk and

34
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:43,019
know that you're lying down as you're lying down it's so simplistic this instruction it's easy to dismiss it ignore just kind of

35
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:48,060
sail right over it then reading it but it's actually pretty fundamental and

36
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:56,060
it's fundamental in working with challenges if we can have uh really

37
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:03,780
engage our posture as a place to inhabit or in in body

38
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:10,500
awareness embodied posture just when we're standing really no clearly know and

39
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,659
embody standing sitting embody and know we're sitting

40
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:21,660
and so forth and whatever posture you're in then

41
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:27,120
um it's like then we have enough attention to our feet as we walk to get the support of the feet

42
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,020
then if we're in our in challenges then not all our attention is going into

43
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,180
the challenges we might be thinking about it focusing on it enough

44
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,660
but we're not lost in it we have a grounding we have a place of stability

45
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:53,040
we have a place that keeps us balanced more and uh and keeps us connected

46
00:04:53,040 --> 00:05:00,600
to the present moment in a vital way in a way that is um

47
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:05,940
uh wonderfully animated or wonderfully kind of connected

48
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:12,780
and um and so it's a protection from getting lost in just paying attention to

49
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:19,919
the hand swinging as if that's all there is it's a protection from getting preoccupied in our challenges in such a

50
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:26,699
way that um we're not really don't have available to us the full intelligence of our whole

51
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:32,880
system we can get lost in that world and finally

52
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,180
um it's one thing to try to do this when we're in a challenge

53
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,479
it might be too late but the more we can practice mindfulness all the different aspects of mindfulness

54
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:51,900
but the more we can cultivate an embodied presence in the posture or whatever we're doing

55
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:57,479
and that becomes a second nature becomes really a grounding or familiar with it

56
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:02,880
and and the channels are quite open and clear about why this is beneficial we

57
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,380
feel it then we're prepared for challenges then we bring that with us into the challenge

58
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:14,759
and we'll find there's a strength there's a grounding there's a a whole

59
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:20,820
kind of support system present that we wouldn't have if we weren't

60
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:27,660
mindful so cultivating this mindfulness of posture is one of the important steps

61
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,840
that the Buddha gives for working with challenges so

62
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:40,220
assuming a meditative posture

63
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:47,180
each person will find their own posture that's right for them

64
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,080
couple of guidelines around meditation posture is ideally it's a posture

65
00:06:55,080 --> 00:07:04,340
where there's no obstructions nothing is constricted or collapsed

66
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,199
some people you find it useful to loosen their belt if it feels tight then constricting

67
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,440
there

68
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:27,060
it's also useful to have a posture that does feel aligned and balanced

69
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:34,639
a lying so that both sides of the body are

70
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:44,599
as doing the same thing as close as possible given the circumstances of your body

71
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,520
aligned so that the muscles of your body

72
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,660
have the best opportunity to relax deeply

73
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:08,520
slumping in a couch to meditate might be better than being tense

74
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:15,080
but it also doesn't allow for the muscles to relax that deeply

75
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:22,879
some people avoid is upright align posture because then they feel their tensions of their body

76
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,979
that's okay we can still cultivate this embodied

77
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:32,419
awareness of posture

78
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,300
and also we begin we offer the creating the conditions for

79
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:47,220
that tension to really relax deeply that they wouldn't do if we mask it

80
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:51,500
by slumping in the chair or something

81
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:57,920
gently closing the eyes

82
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,560
and taking you a few long slow deep breaths

83
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:25,740
and those deep inhales if you really take a full inhale as

84
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:30,959
you're comfortable with and take maybe even hold the end inhale

85
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:38,180
a little bit at the top and with that adjust your posture

86
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:52,740
exhale a long exhale and at the end hold your breath for two

87
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:58,700
seconds and see if you can relax more of your body

88
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:13,220
and then letting your breathing return to normal

89
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:22,820
and for a few more breaths relax in your body

90
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:42,740
one of the functions of relaxing in the body is to bring your awareness into the body

91
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:52,100
so you can be more embodied a greater sensitivity

92
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:04,100
how the body reveals itself through Sensations

93
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:29,899
and then taking a few moments to feel your body globally

94
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:37,339
and with a global awareness of your body to whatever degree you can

95
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,779
have kind of a relaxed Global awareness of your posture

96
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:53,360
the sensations accompanying your posture

97
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,240
what your posture looks like from the outside doesn't matter

98
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,920
with your posture feels like from the inside does matter

99
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:31,220
and as the posture feeling the sensations

100
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,740
think of it as the support

101
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:46,019
the gentle holding of a deeper embodied attention to

102
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:52,380
breathing posture

103
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:57,199
is a grounding Here and Now

104
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:04,940
that holds the sensations of breathing

105
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:12,600
and in some ways if you're aware of the breathing in your torso

106
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:17,540
the expanding and Contracting of the breathing

107
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:26,720
touches up against your posture at least there in your torso

108
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,019
in the posture touches your breathing

109
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:22,380
perhaps giving a little bit more attention to your posture

110
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:31,460
just a little bit so the posture grounds you more Here and Now

111
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:37,500
it maybe supports your attention to breathing

112
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:40,760
through the present moment

113
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,620
and as we get come to the end of this sitting

114
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:55,460
to again bring some attention to your posture

115
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,919
but imagine

116
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:08,279
that you're sitting with someone who's a friend or someone you respect and

117
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:14,220
who you trust feel comfortable with

118
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:24,360
and the person is sitting in front of you with a posture that shows presence

119
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:30,679
balance they're fully grounded in themselves

120
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:36,900
aware and at the same time they seem fully

121
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,980
present for you

122
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,778
not leaning forward not pulling back

123
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:58,140
eyes are soft the hands and arms are soft the

124
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:04,400
shoulders are relaxed but the spine seems almost like their torso seems like

125
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:11,000
embodiment of attention

126
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,179
balance a certain strength

127
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,720
and as they're sitting there in front of you you become more aware of your own posture

128
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:35,240
hopefully without any Judgment of what what it is

129
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,820
but how would you adjust your posture for a few seconds

130
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:45,500
to resonate with their posture

131
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:58,740
how would you adjust your posture to be more grounded

132
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:03,620
so your torso is more present and

133
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:12,600
maybe even next curtain certain kind of strength

134
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:18,140
of presence of being here in the present

135
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:22,760
maybe your chest a little more open

136
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:43,440
and then the two of you close your eyes and then you realize that with your eyes

137
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:50,039
closed you're less self-conscious and allows your heart to open

138
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:56,600
allows your Good Will and your friendship your kindness to flow

139
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:05,279
and you sit here quietly with a friendly disposition a kind

140
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:11,220
disposition not necessarily wishing anything for

141
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:19,080
anyone but says present with your friend others

142
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:21,919
the whole world

143
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:32,299
or their friendliness or uh Generous Heart

144
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:35,720
with love

145
00:30:45,059 --> 00:30:48,919
with a disposition that

146
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:55,520
it would be easy for you to have

147
00:30:55,760 --> 00:31:02,720
thoughts words and actions of good will of care

148
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,600
spreading your welfare and well-being to all beings

149
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:17,159
so that in your small way

150
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:23,520
you contribute to the welfare and happiness

151
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:31,340
of everyone may all beings be happy

152
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:51,549
[Music]

153
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,480
thank you

154
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,120
hello everyone and welcome to this second talk and the series on

155
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,760
mindfulness of the body using the Buddha's teachings on

156
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:36,779
mindfulness of the body as a support for how to work with the challenges that life gives us

157
00:32:36,779 --> 00:32:42,840
no matter what the challenges are and the second instruction the Buddha

158
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:48,720
gives and his teachings are mindfulness to the body is mindfulness of posture

159
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:54,480
and posture can be a difficult topic for people and challenging sometimes with all kinds of

160
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:00,600
physical conditions that exist but it's also a part of

161
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,960
the integral part of human life is we always in some posture other physical posture

162
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,200
and the Buddha emphasized the value of bringing attention to it to really know

163
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:20,580
the posture we're in and um and then begin discovering the different

164
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:25,620
dimensions that different ways in which mindfulness of posture can support us

165
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:31,860
support us tremendously and um

166
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:37,860
and in terms of challenges one of the things that mindfulness of posture can support

167
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:43,620
is that it um is a preventive

168
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:51,659
from all our attention to go into our challenges into the our fear our dismay

169
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:58,740
or preoccupation or imagination or spinning thoughts

170
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:04,500
um and if all of it goes into the challenges we have it can be a dark hole

171
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:10,560
we can collapse sometimes it um it strengthens the sense of inner challenge

172
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,138
the fear perhaps or the dismay or the anger it fuels it and keeps it going and

173
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,179
some people will can spill out in fear or panic because of the loop between

174
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:26,760
their thinking and and causing fear and fear causing more

175
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:33,960
thinking and or depression the same thing there can be this Loop and that Loop is strengthened by the

176
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:39,858
degree in which attention is given to those thoughts or attention is given the

177
00:34:39,859 --> 00:34:47,638
solely to the emotions that are there and it's remarkable that when there's

178
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:55,020
fear or when there's anger when there's confusion when there's greed all kinds of these

179
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:01,380
strong forces in the mind people have a tremendous capacity for concentration

180
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:06,780
the very people who stand sit down to meditate and they say I don't have any ability to concentrate

181
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:11,820
give them a good threat and boy they can be focused on it

182
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:17,220
everything goes into it and all their thinking and thoughts and feelings

183
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:23,160
give them a good thing to be angry with and boy some people can be zero in you

184
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,040
know one pointed almost like boom they're right there they're not going to kind of leave it behind they're like

185
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,200
stuck on it so we do have a many people have much

186
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:39,900
more capacity of our concentration than they realize it's just harder to do it for some

187
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:46,880
people when there's nothing no threat nothing to blame nothing to

188
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:55,079
trigger self-preoccupation self-identity self-conceit which is kind of can be a

189
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:02,940
magnet for preoccupied attention and so to begin bringing attention to

190
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:08,160
the posture is to break the hegemony of

191
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,200
some of these strong difficult mind states that come into play when we're

192
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:21,180
with challenges not denying their real challenges but the excessive preoccupation Rhythm

193
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:26,579
the excessive absorption in them is counterproductive

194
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:31,920
and it's actually works it's we think that the more attention we can give to

195
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,980
something the better we can take care of it but actually sometimes it can be the opposite when we have the challenges in

196
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:46,200
our life and so we want to find some way for our attention to to be be more beneficial

197
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:51,599
for us as we go through these challenges and one of the ways is to have our

198
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,060
attention rooted or grounded in our body

199
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:03,480
and one of the ways to do that is to be cognizant of the posture we're in

200
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:11,640
and uh and more so uh in like in meditation for example the meditation posture there's a lot of

201
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:16,920
value to having that posture be in intentional

202
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:24,839
so you know you could just kind of lay down in bed and just kind of completely kind of collapse and for some people

203
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:30,599
laying in bed and just really relaxing is very powerful I don't want to undermine its value

204
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:35,820
but you might not get the same benefits uh in the long term and in daily life

205
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:42,140
when there's challenges if you don't somewhere or other begin cultivating

206
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:50,400
the value of a grounded intentional posture and intentional means that it takes a

207
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:56,460
little bit of internal effort intention to maintain it

208
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:03,660
it uh there's in order to maintaining consistently there has to be a consistent attention

209
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:10,920
so the upright meditation posture eventually becomes second nature eventually there's a kind of meditative

210
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:17,400
energy that keeps us upright and alert but there's a lot also a kind of a

211
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:22,920
foreground or background intentionality to stay upright and in

212
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:30,180
the beginning we're beginners we slump and we sit up straight we slump we say until we find this place intentionality

213
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:37,079
to stay present um and uh and to take an intentional

214
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:43,920
posture that allows for presence allows for really being there with something

215
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:49,560
so maybe turning towards something or sitting upright or standing upright in a

216
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:55,920
balanced way um not crossing the arms or crossing the legs in such a way that something's

217
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:03,060
obstructed something is limited something is closed down but just sit in a way that everything becomes kind of

218
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:08,400
open available present flowing unobstructed within an intentional

219
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:14,579
posture and to learn how to be embodied in it to be

220
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:20,040
grounded in the sensations to be inhabiting intentionally and

221
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:25,619
attentionally this posture not as the beal and end-all for sure

222
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:33,180
but so that it becomes second nature to be grounded and present in a good way as we

223
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:41,579
go through our challenges so we learn not to collapse physically in the presence of our challenges so we

224
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:47,579
learn now to get to tense up unnecessarily in the middle of our

225
00:39:47,579 --> 00:39:52,800
challenges the posture is a mirror for seeing what

226
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:59,099
our relationship is to our challenges and if you're if you have a kind of balanced

227
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:05,760
posture as a reference point a line posture that's open unobstructed present

228
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,460
you'll have a very wonderful reference to catch earlier if you collapse

229
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:17,280
if you slump if you kind of give up or if you give in to some kind of the

230
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,920
pressure of the anger the pressure of the fear and start spinning out

231
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:28,380
and the posture is uh was an earlier warning sign of what your relationship

232
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:35,460
is that might not be so beneficial for you it's also a to maintain a strong

233
00:40:35,460 --> 00:40:42,020
balanced posture rather than collapsing or or acting out

234
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:48,660
it's amazing how that it's not denying how we're feeling but it's almost like

235
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:56,820
giving a room for how we're feeling so some deeper process of unfolding evolving healing can happen that cannot

236
00:40:56,820 --> 00:41:04,260
happen if we collapse it cannot happen if we engage from a place of hostility

237
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:10,160
or blame or or something else

238
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:17,460
um this mindfulness really puts us in our bodies so that there's a deeper process of the bodily wisdom and

239
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:24,480
intelligence can kind of move and relax and open up what's going on so that we

240
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:32,300
can think more clearly so that we can see the situation more clearly without our projections and our fears and our

241
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:36,920
emotions kind of excessively

242
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:43,099
filtering our perceptions so to um

243
00:41:43,099 --> 00:41:50,000
to cultivate to make a practice of being of of

244
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:56,040
intentional balanced unobstructed posture in different circumstances you

245
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:01,980
might try it standing in line in a store I don't know what you usually do

246
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:10,140
standing there but you might stand there and you know both feet on the ground feet apart just balanced and and just

247
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:15,480
stand there with a full maybe their eyes cast down because you don't have to see much more than the person in front of

248
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:22,859
you goes forward and you can take the next step forward to the cashier but just really be there and and

249
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:28,020
practice this embodied intentional attention of posture

250
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:35,940
an intentional really to see what you can learn about a posture that allows for a kind of strength and

251
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:42,720
attention a strength confidence in your ability to be present and here

252
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:48,180
it might be how you sit in a chair you might experiment with times and

253
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:54,960
places where you don't slump or relax into the chair but you sit away from the

254
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,180
backrest and really sit there and if where you kind of are offering to the

255
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:06,380
room to lose there a stronger presence here I am

256
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:12,900
so standing walking it can be done laying down even when people need to lay down to

257
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:19,140
meditate there's a way of really being careful with a posture that it's somewhat intentional really laying the

258
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:25,980
body out carefully and and balanced and maybe the knees are up and that has a

259
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:33,780
little bit of intentionality some people who meditate laying down will have one hand with the upper arm kind of along

260
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:39,000
the sides of the chest and the forearm pointing right up to the ceiling so it's

261
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:45,839
a little bit of intentionality is needed to keep that straight and going upright so it's value of intentionality

262
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,480
and then walking walk with confidence

263
00:43:51,480 --> 00:44:00,540
because chances are that a confident walk begins offering you a beneficial posture

264
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:07,200
to be in if you give too much effort into the confidence you might over overshoot

265
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:14,280
but kind of take a confident posture as you walk and and be embodied in that

266
00:44:14,280 --> 00:44:22,560
confidence be embodied in the in the in the walking and and track what goes on in your

267
00:44:22,560 --> 00:44:27,720
posture what goes on in your body as you do so if you're in a kind of varied

268
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:33,839
place where a lot of different things are going on it's fascinating to watch the Kaleidoscope of little responses and

269
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:40,319
reactions in the body depending on something as simple as walking in the Sun and then finding

270
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:46,380
yourself walking in the shade walking down a sidewalk with no one's there and then someone comes opposite

271
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:52,319
direction um you know all kinds of things begin happening that maybe track and what goes

272
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:59,940
on in the body with your response reactions and and see if you can maintain this confident upright posture

273
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:06,200
in walking so there is um

274
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:14,700
it's a hugely valuable and multifaceted practice to practice mindfulness of the

275
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:20,099
POS of posture and I just scratch the surface of it now

276
00:45:20,099 --> 00:45:25,740
but if you start practicing it and discovering it and make it second nature

277
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:32,460
to have a balanced aligned mindful posture then you'll be ready for challenges in

278
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:38,119
the future if you're in the middle of a challenge and you try to have this

279
00:45:38,119 --> 00:45:43,859
support and refuge of a of your posture you might not have developed it well

280
00:45:43,859 --> 00:45:48,900
enough to really make a difference but building it up over time you'll be

281
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:56,579
surprised that one day you'll go through a challenge and you'll discover that your posture has provided a tremendous

282
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:01,040
support so you go through it in a balanced way

283
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:09,619
so thank you very much and we'll continue this series tomorrow
