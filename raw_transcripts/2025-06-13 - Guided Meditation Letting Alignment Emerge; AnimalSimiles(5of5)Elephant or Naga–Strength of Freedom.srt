1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:08,800
all right hello everyone let's go ahead and get started today

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,559
it's nice to see everyone arriving and I always appreciate how you greet each

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:22,080
other so in today's meditation

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:30,080
um we'll continue with this general theme we've had of settling in and

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:37,040
choosing an anchor of some kind even though that's not an exclusive focus of our attention

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,680
and then today the invitation um which I'll describe more as we get into

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,280
it is to allow the alignment that we

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,960
feel when we're oriented and mindful in the present moment to gain a momentum of

9
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,600
its own and kind of emerge and become less something that we do and more

10
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:08,400
something that we just orient toward and we're feeling almost that alignment that

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,040
feeling of being here as the meditation object as much as whatever our anchor is

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,400
yeah does that make sense so we'll um this is a way of allowing the meditation

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,400
to start to unfold on its own with less doing from us

14
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,439
so with that let's settle in

15
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:38,000
starting as usual by finding a posture that feels comfortable balanced

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,540
aligned [Music]

17
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,640
and gently closing the eyes

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:02:00,600
sensing that you are here it's not actually a trivial

19
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:10,360
introductory kind of instruction there's a whole art to hearness

20
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,440
it already brings in the sense of

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,440
can we have humility and dignity together

22
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,640
so we're here we're not shrinking away we're not hesitating

23
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:37,080
but neither are we asserting self arandizing

24
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,400
we're simply here

25
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:52,879
and in that we look for the possibility of ease

26
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,560
even within a body that may have some aches and pains or may actually be sick

27
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:05,760
or injured right now and within a mind that may have some

28
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:14,040
agitation due to whatever came in previously

29
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:21,760
that's how it is but even with today's this moment's conditions we can feel

30
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,920
some ease one way we do that is by inviting

31
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:33,040
softening though softening

32
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:41,720
the muscles of the face the eyes the jaw

33
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,000
the shoulders

34
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:06,040
i sometimes feel into the shoulder area like around the collar bone

35
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:15,200
shoulder blades and the shoulder joint the ball and

36
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,680
socket joint

37
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,880
and then down through the torso heart area

38
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,680
softening the diaphragm so it's not a tight band

39
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:59,639
and letting the belly spread out and down

40
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:26,840
reducing bracing in the arms or legs

41
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:55,919
and as some of the holding in the body releases there's a way in which there's an upward

42
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,840
release through the spine

43
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:08,720
maybe on the inb breath feeling how the spine would like to draw itself upward

44
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:17,400
slightly and allowing that if you feel that

45
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,080
Sensing whatever degree it's present a sense of alignment

46
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,638
through the body

47
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,080
things have settled into

48
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:04,759
a place of as much balance as is available right now

49
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:10,360
and that too contributes to a sense of ease

50
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,960
and then there's a way to do those same movements within the mind

51
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,879
allowing the mind to be present in a simple way

52
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:50,360
softening the attention in a simple way

53
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:15,120
noticing how when we meet the moment with just gentle

54
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:23,800
mindfulness there's a straightening up in the mind

55
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,440
an orienting

56
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:46,959
this aligning in the mind is separate from what is occupying the mind there

57
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:57,000
may be thoughts or feelings but the knowing of that the mindfulness

58
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,399
can be aligned and balanced in knowing that

59
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,320
and with all of that gathered together as well as it's available

60
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,640
then we turn toward our chosen anchor could be the

61
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,600
sensations of breathing

62
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,920
or other sensations in the body

63
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,839
such as the overall body sense or the touch points

64
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:54,920
where we're sitting where our hands are touching

65
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:16,839
or it may may be that the orientation towards sound feels more anchoring today

66
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:44,440
and just taking a few minutes now to sense

67
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:52,880
can I be aware of both the anchor and this background orientation and

68
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,800
alignment that we've set up

69
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:05,000
so healing both the object and how the mind is

70
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:17,440
And the invitation in this sit is from time to time

71
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:24,800
to return to this feeling of orientation and alignment

72
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:34,279
if the mind has wandered off or even if it's relatively present

73
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:44,959
taking a moment to feel the balance and uprightness of the mind

74
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:52,639
as it reathers around the anchor object or as it continues to notice This

75
00:15:52,639 --> 00:16:00,240
inputs coming in thoughts and emotions and sensations

76
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:07,079
include also this sense of balance alignment

77
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:19,240
almost like another object that we pay attention to

78
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,160
as we get more familiar with this feeling of alignment

79
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,679
or orientation in the mind

80
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:44,039
we may realize that it's not something we're exactly doing

81
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:52,280
although it is strengthened when we notice it

82
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:02,400
see if you can let it emerge naturally the way balancing on a bicycle

83
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:11,559
is done intuitively as the bicycle rolls along

84
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,600
it's not too hard to just shift slightly

85
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,559
to keep it upright

86
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,640
much easier when the bike is rolling than when it's standing still

87
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:35,760
so there's a certain emergent balance

88
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,120
on a moving bicycle and we can sense that in the flow of the

89
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,480
mind and body also

90
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:36,440
and as we move toward the end of this sitting

91
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,960
perhaps bringing in or considering that

92
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:51,200
this alignment is an attunement to the dharma

93
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:57,960
to a natural way that things are

94
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:07,200
bringing in our qualities of gentle mindfulness awareness

95
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:15,120
it's like orienting around the eight-fold path the path we can take through the world

96
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:23,120
it said that when we are attuned to the dharma it can feel like turning upright

97
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:29,720
that which has been overturned or knocked down

98
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:36,880
so there's a sense that we come into uprightness and this can work as we walk through the

99
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,000
world also maybe encountering people or situations

100
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,520
that feel out of balance in some way

101
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:56,080
and our inner sense provides balance balanced if you will for unbalanced

102
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:03,840
situations with other people it's also said that those who live by

103
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,880
the dharma live contentedly amid those who are

104
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:11,880
discontent

105
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:22,440
even live happily amid situations that are not happy

106
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:32,600
so bringing our practice naturally into the world in this simple internal way

107
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:40,960
has an effect of bringing some balance into a world that so much needs that

108
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:48,278
may our practice support others in that way

109
00:30:03,170 --> 00:30:10,099
[Music]

110
00:30:15,370 --> 00:30:22,490
[Music]

111
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:34,640
[Music]

112
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:51,520
okay so today we reach the end of our

113
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:58,159
sequence of animals that took us from the vulnerable quail and the foolish

114
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:04,559
monkey up through the humble cow and the confident deer

115
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:10,720
and the the mind gradually sees more and more about itself as we walk this path

116
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:17,279
and more and more about its place in the wider picture and about what it means to live in the

117
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:22,880
world with wisdom and some measure of freedom

118
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,840
so today's animal is one that represents a mind and heart that are strong and

119
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:37,519
fortified with good qualities this kind of mind is poised or ready to

120
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:43,760
have deep insights liberating insights and sometimes this animal represents a

121
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:50,880
mind that is free that is already free and uh that is the elephant

122
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:59,840
the elephant and we're also going to return to the simile that we started with 5 days ago or 4 days ago uh so hang

123
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:08,480
on for that but for now elephants um the poly word for elephant is hoti

124
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,640
and that's the literal animal with a trunk and these are really impressive

125
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:21,200
beings really we don't have native elephants where I live but I can

126
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:27,519
understand how in ancient India elephants would be chosen to represent

127
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:33,519
strength including spiritual strength they're large they're powerful and

128
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:40,640
they're smart and we now know and maybe maybe they did then also that elephants are quite

129
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:47,200
emotional they have an emotional heart that has some um apparently real kind of

130
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:53,519
compassion and connection to it so when a person's mind is likened to an

131
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:59,279
elephant there is usually also the implication that such a person has the

132
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:05,440
ability to train their own mind so in a sense we're the elephant trainer as well

133
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:11,679
as the elephant so these are some lines from the dharmapata

134
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:18,000
in the past this mind went wandering where it wished as it liked and as it

135
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:24,880
pleased now I will retrain it wisely as an elephant keeper does an elephant in

136
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:33,200
rut delight in vigilance protect your own mind lift yourself from a bad course

137
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:40,880
like a tusker sunk in mud so at some point we know what to do we

138
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,720
know how to practice we can bring the mind to its fullness its full strength

139
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:52,320
by training it and taming it and it become it can become like a like a

140
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:58,960
marvelous tamed elephant strong and useful and not going out to do harm in

141
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:07,279
the world so there's another word that is sometimes translated as elephant uh but

142
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:13,760
it's actually a more general term for beings that are spiritually powerful if

143
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:19,760
you will and that word is naga so you can call a literal elephant a

144
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:26,240
naga but nagas are also mythical serpent-like beings

145
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:35,200
we don't have them exactly but maybe sort of like our dragons good dragons that we have um and so the word naga can

146
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:40,638
also refer to an arant a fully awakened being

147
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:46,320
so there's a number of sutas also about nagas and I want to read one of them or

148
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:53,760
this excerpt from one of them it's about how the nagas um uh have their young and

149
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,359
then they get bigger and stronger as they as they grow so apparently um these

150
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:04,880
naggas go way up to the top of the mountains in order to have their their

151
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,960
babies and it says um the Buddha says based

152
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:17,119
upon the Himalayas the king of mountains the nagas nurture their bodies and

153
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:25,440
acquire strength and when they have nurtured their bodies and acquired strength then they enter the pools and

154
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,359
from the pools they enter the lakes and then the streams and then the rivers and

155
00:35:31,359 --> 00:35:37,520
finally they enter the ocean and there they achieve greatness and expansiveness

156
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:45,119
of body so too based upon virtue established upon

157
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:52,800
virtue a meditator develops and cultivates the seven factors of awakening and thereby they achieve

158
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:58,880
greatness and expansiveness in wholesome states so there's this analogy being

159
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,720
made right between the grow there's growth that goes on on this path we

160
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:11,599
won't go through all the seven factors of awakening today but it's maybe useful to know that the first one of them is

161
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:16,800
mindfulness so once again we have this as the foundation

162
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:23,280
where we started and where is always the safe place for us to be and to grow

163
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,720
so like the baby nagas in the mountain pools we may start small but then

164
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:36,079
there's this continual process of growing and also notice that there's a moving into new circumstances you know

165
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:43,040
from the pools to the lakes to the rivers and onward to the ocean so

166
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:49,599
I like to think of it as our life is not really the same as we grow along the

167
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:54,720
path maybe we're always in the water but it has a way of looking different and

168
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:01,440
feeling different as we gain insight and then in some way maybe internally uh

169
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:07,240
we're meant to become large and powerful through practice

170
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:14,480
so it's helpful as we grow to be aware of this and to actually honor the wisdom

171
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:19,599
and the insights that we've had no matter how simple they are i mean our

172
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:25,599
first insight might be something like wow there's a lot of restlessness in

173
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:31,359
this mind i had no idea I was living with this amount of craziness

174
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:38,800
great that is a great insight and one suta says that if we encounter a naga

175
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,640
whether it's a baby naga or a bigger one in our mind or heart we should and this

176
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:51,119
is quoting from the suta leave the naga serpent do not harm the naga serpent

177
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,040
honor the naga serpent so there's a way in which honoring

178
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:02,720
what's gone on for us in the practice whatever it has been so far supports

179
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,560
this on growing growth in the insights that we're having

180
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:13,839
another suta points out that the footprint of any animal would fit inside

181
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:19,920
the footprint of the elephant and in the same way any dharma teaching can fit

182
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,839
within the teaching of the four noble truths so in particular if we start to

183
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:31,440
understand something about suffering and the end of suffering in a deep way it

184
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,880
informs our whole practice and our whole life everything can orient around what

185
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:44,240
we're understanding about duca and release of duca everything fits into that

186
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:51,040
so that's another way that we become the elephant if you will

187
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,800
so now we can return to that same suta that we talked about on Monday with the

188
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:03,920
quail there was an image of a little quail being bound by a vine and it noted

189
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,960
that even a thin vine is a strong bond for a quail and that was likened to a

190
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:16,960
person who can't give up even things that are harmful to them they cling even

191
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:22,160
to unh wholesome ways of being and that's kind of where we start but in

192
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:29,359
this very same suta uh the elephant is the contrast that's made to the quail

193
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:36,720
and the so the suta says in the words of the Buddha suppose there was a royal bull elephant

194
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:42,960
with tusks like chariot poles able to draw a heavy load pedigreed and battleh

195
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:50,160
hardened and it was bound with a strong harness but just by twisting its body a little

196
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:58,000
bit it would break apart its bonds and go wherever it wants would it be right to say that for that bull elephant that

197
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,079
strong harness is a strong stout bond and a heavy yoke and the monks say "No

198
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:11,119
no for that bull elephant that strong harness is weak feeble and insubstantial."

199
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,359
And then in the same way the elephant is likened to a person who is not attached

200
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:24,160
even to high quality things in their life material things relationships even

201
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:31,440
wholesome qualities so I'll excerpt of it for brevity um suppose there was a

202
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:37,280
wealthy lay person with plenty of material goods of high quality and also

203
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:42,560
highquality family and relationships and they would see a mendicant sitting in

204
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:50,960
meditation in the cool shade their hands and feet well washed after eating a dectable meal and they would think ah

205
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,400
the aesthetic life or the life of the dharma is so very pleasant so very

206
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,000
healthy if only I could shave off my hair and beard dress in ochre robes and

207
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:07,839
go forth from the lay life to homelessness and they're able to give up their

208
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:14,720
highquality lifestyle in order to go forth so again we're lay people that are

209
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:20,160
staying lay people we're not necessarily going forth into the homeless life but

210
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:26,640
we are maybe trying to live more in line with the dharma which is not always the

211
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:32,160
same as how the conventional world is living and this can be challenging right

212
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:38,240
uh to live in that way so even a strong harness doesn't bind an elephant and

213
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:45,280
it's possible to release attachment even to things that would be considered good

214
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,560
enough in a conventional life hey you got the job the relationship the house

215
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:56,560
the dog all those things that should make you happy and we we may have a

216
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,680
feeling like not quite but if we release attachment to those things we can allow

217
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:06,800
the mind to move on into the deeper goodness and freedom that comes through

218
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,680
meditative development that comes through aligning our lives really with the eight-fold path so we do have

219
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:21,200
material things as lay people maybe a job good relationships but the attachment to those can hold us

220
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,400
back on our path to liberation so it's important to learn how to release

221
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,400
attachments that are limiting so the weak quail can't give up even harmful

222
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:38,319
things and the strong element elephant is ready to release attachments even to

223
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:44,240
high quality things it's a wide range but the elephant is not meant to be a

224
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:50,000
distant goal we're elephants right now whenever we can open the hand of

225
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:56,640
grasping whenever you know of course we're learning to release what is harmful but we can even learn not to get

226
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,720
caught up in benefits that we may have like money like good health like family

227
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:07,760
if we hold those things lightly then we can allow the mind to flow onward into

228
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:14,640
the deeper freedoms that come from meditation like samadei like insight

229
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:19,839
so elephants can see clearly what is truly onwardleading toward freeing the

230
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:25,359
heart and they can positively choose that over other things

231
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:31,280
so as a reflection as we come to the end of our week it's worth taking a little

232
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,720
time to reflect on what is most valuable to you what about the dharma is most

233
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:44,960
inspiring and be willing to choose that so the elephant or the naga represent

234
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:50,480
the strength of freedom that begins to flow in our mind and heart and can take

235
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:56,800
us all the way to the ocean so thank you for this wonderful week of

236
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:02,880
the menagerie of animals and I hope in some way it can be inspiring for your

237
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,880
practice as we move along and support each other in our general movement

238
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,400
toward more freedom more clarity and more wisdom and compassion in a world

239
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:20,560
that needs that so thank you so much for your practice and for living the dharma life in the

240
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:29,480
way that you do it's so beneficial please don't ever doubt that thank you
