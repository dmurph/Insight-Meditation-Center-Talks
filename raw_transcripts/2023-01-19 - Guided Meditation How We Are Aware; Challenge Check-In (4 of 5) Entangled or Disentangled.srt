1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,040
hello and welcome and welcome to

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,599
meditation session welcome to yourself may you welcome yourself

3
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:18,379
here in the meditation we're doing

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,900
and perhaps this expression of welcoming

5
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,300
yourself is relatively novel in the context of

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,719
meditation so it represents a reframing a kind of like little switch in the mind oh

7
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:45,239
something a little different than business as usual activity of the Mind as usual very different perspective

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:54,140
and in doing meditation it's often useful to to put a question mark

9
00:00:54,860 --> 00:01:01,020
after any kind of common way in perspective in which we see our lives and

10
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,360
to see things in a new way and one of the interesting

11
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,799
analogies for this is some of you might have had the experience

12
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,680
of driving a car maybe driving long distance and

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,799
so focused on the road that you don't notice that the windshield is steadily getting dirtier

14
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,820
and dirtier and then so finally something happens maybe a passenger points it out to you

15
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:37,979
and you shift your gaze from the road out there to Little Bits to the

16
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:45,840
windshield itself and say sure enough it's quite Dusty quite dirty and

17
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,619
and then you clean you start the car and you clean it and lo and behold it's amazingly clear

18
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:59,399
so the same way in meditation we can be so concerned with our concerns

19
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:07,320
that we don't see how we're concerned we don't see the windshield through

20
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:12,840
which we are looking the filter through which we're looking

21
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,900
add our concerns our challenges what's happening for us in our lives

22
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,940
and that can be internally with ourselves we could be sick or have pain

23
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:30,540
some kind of inner distress emotional difficulty

24
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:36,239
and it could be things externally and in no way to diminish the value and

25
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,879
importance of these challenges maybe because they're important

26
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:49,680
uh it's it's valuable to really be clear understand the nature of the filter

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,160
through which we're seeing the windshield driving safely is phenomenally important

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:05,180
and if the windshield is really all fogged up and dirty maybe driving becomes dangerous

29
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:13,319
so there's a simple but maybe not easy a way of looking at

30
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:21,540
this how we are it has to do with is the way in which we are

31
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:28,379
concerned about anything Are we more

32
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:36,780
are we harder or softer Are we more contracted or more open

33
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,420
Are we more assertive involved entangled or a more

34
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:49,500
receptive available soft ready

35
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,920
so this is something that we can feel

36
00:03:54,920 --> 00:04:01,860
and sense in the mind in the mind's eye or the mind's way of

37
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,379
perceiving we can see that the person we're perceiving through a kind of hardness

38
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:15,239
through a kind of the seeing the perception is soft we're asserting we're receptive we are

39
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:24,720
closed down we're open we are there's there's an ouch in how we're aware or

40
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:32,940
there's an ah so uh so today's meditation I'll

41
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:39,180
guide you into uh a little bit of this attention to

42
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:46,020
how we're aware not just what we're aware of

43
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:52,139
and um and it begins kind of immediately it's

44
00:04:52,139 --> 00:05:00,780
kind of like all of meditation in a sense can be understood as a settling opening of the how we are

45
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:04,880
so assuming a

46
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,320
meditation posture

47
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:21,320
that the posture itself manifests a certain degree of

48
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:25,220
embodied alertness

49
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,680
even if you're laying down and there's a way of adjusting the shoulder blades in

50
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,979
the upper back maybe letting shoulder blades kind of somehow let them come down the back and the chest to come out

51
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:46,860
a little bit if the feet are laid straight to

52
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:54,380
pull the feet up so they're your knees are up closer to the ceiling bent

53
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:02,600
and then gently closing the eyes

54
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:09,780
and spending some good time at the beginning relaxing the body

55
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:16,740
the more relaxed we can become the clearer we can see

56
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:22,560
how we are aware how we're concerned

57
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:25,880
how we attend

58
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:36,319
so taking a few long slow deep breaths and relaxing on the exhale

59
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:42,380
relaxing the whole body

60
00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:01,520
relaxing the mind as you exhale

61
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:20,600
and then taking a few that in your breathing return to normal

62
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,240
and relaxing the muscles of your face

63
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:45,080
almost as if the muscles gently fall away from the skull

64
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,819
softening around the shoulders

65
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,780
releasing the shoulders

66
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:19,199
and maybe a small adjustment in the hands where they are

67
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:26,539
their position can support softening of the shoulders

68
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:45,080
softening the belly

69
00:08:54,899 --> 00:09:01,140
and then in the most matter of fact simple way as if nothing is wrong

70
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:06,800
notice that if if your body is bracing itself

71
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:13,399
or pulled in tight anywhere

72
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:19,040
or activate it in a kind of upward Direction

73
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:32,540
and if it is on the exhale soften all that

74
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:21,019
and then taking a look at your mind the mental activity your thinking mind

75
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:28,760
is that activating

76
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:38,959
is it energetic and busy past thinking

77
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,540
is it tight or narrow

78
00:10:50,640 --> 00:11:00,300
and riding on the exhale can you let the thinking mind soften

79
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:05,220
expand

80
00:11:28,459 --> 00:11:34,940
relaxing The Source from which thinking arises

81
00:11:53,820 --> 00:12:00,000
and now calmly become more fully aware of the body

82
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,600
breathing

83
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:20,420
and notice how you're aware is how you're aware simple and relaxed

84
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:27,420
or is there any strain or

85
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:31,260
tightness resistance

86
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,620
any way in which you're aware attitude with which you're aware

87
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:48,079
which has some form of ouch in it something unpleasant

88
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:57,120
or is there anything in how you're aware that has an ah

89
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:06,240
that is Pleasant or feel has a good feeling maybe awareness feels receptive or open

90
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:14,000
soft maybe there's a gentleness

91
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:24,980
how you're aware is like the windshield

92
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:37,680
any way that your the way you're aware that has any ouch in it any stress or

93
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:44,060
strain in it that's the dust on the windshield

94
00:13:54,779 --> 00:14:01,100
relax soften how you're aware

95
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,160
see if you can feel the ah

96
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:14,279
in being aware that's not dependent

97
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:19,620
on being able to stay present continuously

98
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:26,639
but is dependent and whenever you come back to being aware

99
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:32,399
that you do so an easy relaxed way

100
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:36,200
as often as you can

101
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,800
okay

102
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:04,880
how would you characterize the way that you're aware

103
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:13,580
is it more on the outside or in the ah side

104
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:20,539
are you aware in a way that you enjoy

105
00:23:23,159 --> 00:23:31,640
if not how can you shift how you're aware

106
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:38,240
to be more enjoyable

107
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:47,280
and one way to do that is to shift your attention away from

108
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:54,919
your concerns away from your attitudes

109
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:11,780
to the simplicity relax soft

110
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:15,440
receptive awareness

111
00:26:45,659 --> 00:26:54,380
and then as we come to the end of this meditation to check in with yourself again

112
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,299
to how you're aware

113
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:10,460
are you aware through any filters of tension or strain or resistance

114
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:17,400
any fear or desires

115
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:29,279
and if that has to be for now can you relax around those ways

116
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:37,760
it's okay it's okay to be how you are

117
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:48,059
and maybe that's okayness is its own perspective its own way of

118
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:51,380
gazing upon yourself

119
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:01,880
and then in the same way to gaze upon the world

120
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:08,340
it's okay whatever attitude you have or reaction

121
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:12,140
you have to the world it's okay

122
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:35,760
put in that okayness is there a softer more receptive way

123
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:40,520
being present for the world and others

124
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:46,220
what can you what can you learn from meditation

125
00:28:48,779 --> 00:28:55,940
about a way of perceiving the world being present for the world

126
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:05,240
that is beneficial that's generous

127
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,299
that allows you to see things more clearly as they are

128
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:25,559
and perhaps we're that way of seeing that way of seeing can be a channel for

129
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:31,820
your good will for your kindness your care Your Love

130
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:38,640
and maybe these words can carry your Good Will and love out

131
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:44,700
into the world may all beings

132
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,940
be happy may all beings

133
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:59,299
be safe may all beings be peaceful

134
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:07,759
may all beings be safe be may all beings be free

135
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:25,450
[Music]

136
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,120
thank you

137
00:30:39,059 --> 00:30:43,039
so hello everyone and

138
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:50,880
kind of nice to begin speaking after having meditated a

139
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,700
little bit with you all of you thank you

140
00:30:56,659 --> 00:31:05,100
and the topic today is called this week is called The Challenge check-in

141
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:12,360
and the suggestion is that to take the time maybe a time to pause

142
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:18,600
to take time to have this checklist to go through

143
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:24,360
to find out how you are what's going on

144
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:30,480
not only is it useful to really understand and feel discover how we are [Music]

145
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:37,320
but it's also a reframing it's a changing of perspective from the usual way of checking in with

146
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,659
ourselves or knowing ourselves to something that is dharmic something

147
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:48,419
that the Buddha recommended it's really productive and useful for becoming

148
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:55,100
disentangled from our life from ourselves

149
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:02,700
and um and they often I mean oftentimes it's easy that that the common way of

150
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:10,440
being in the world of knowing ourselves is through the filter of our desires our

151
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:19,559
fears our aversions our confusions our strains our resistances

152
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:28,740
and and so we can take the whole package of Who We Are and uh and subjected to

153
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:34,860
General ized opinions generalist idea

154
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:43,679
about you know about who I am what's going on and maybe uh one of the most

155
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,960
General that the kind of judgment we can have about ourselves so

156
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:56,039
we can live under it can be a real real challenge is all the things that goes under the

157
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:01,620
category I am bad I am wrong

158
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:08,159
and not so obvious but all the ways in which we live under the category I am

159
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:15,659
right I am good can be also limiting for who we are and

160
00:33:15,659 --> 00:33:22,320
one way it limits us it keeps us from seeing more deeply what's going on within us underneath those

161
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,659
generalizations and um and to see more directly and

162
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:33,659
deeply and so the Buddha's check what I'm calling the Buddha's uh checklist

163
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:40,380
is a way of dropping below the generalizations below the kind of belief and judgments

164
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:45,600
we have and this is a phenomenally generous thing to do to ourselves

165
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,000
to free ourselves from the generalizations from the

166
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,100
judgments from the ideas we kind of struggled under

167
00:33:56,100 --> 00:34:01,440
where that represents being entangled that represent being kind of being

168
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,659
caught up and excessively concerned about something or

169
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:12,780
um and when we take the time to stop to do this checklist check-in

170
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:19,280
then we um we're actually stepping out of

171
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:25,560
the strong winds that are pushing us along we're stepping out of we're

172
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:31,320
stepping off the the you know the conveyor belt sidewalk

173
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:38,580
that's walking along in some building and we're not being carried along anymore we're stopping to take a step

174
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:44,940
back and see what's happening here and in a way that we can't see if we're

175
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:53,059
carried along if we're caught up in what's happening in these generalizations or the feelings we have

176
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,420
and um so to check in you know how am I on my body What's Happening Here

177
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,540
if there's 10 if you're tense and you didn't know it maybe it's useful to relax

178
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:12,119
check in with the feeling tones is this experience really unpleasant

179
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:18,320
or is it really Pleasant and if you're caught up in the unpleasant

180
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,460
is that the full story is there pleasure here as well or is there some shift of

181
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,980
orientation is the unpleasantness more product of my own mind

182
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:34,819
my own mind's reactivity than it is in the activity that I'm in

183
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:43,260
checking in with the state of the Mind is it contracted or is it expansive

184
00:35:43,260 --> 00:35:49,680
and then today the fourth foundation of the Buddha is that mental processes in

185
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:57,420
the mind in some ways are not too different uh they're kind of overlapping with the third Foundation

186
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:03,240
um and um and so the activities the process of the operating principles that

187
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:08,520
are driving the mind or supporting the mind what are they

188
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:14,940
and so is there um so the Buddha list gave a list of the five hindrances

189
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:21,599
and he also gave a list for the seven factors of Awakening and the five hindrances are ways of

190
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:26,760
being there are sticky entangled knotted up

191
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,940
with experience and the Buddha uses the word nodded up in terms of how we can get caught up and

192
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:40,260
stuff and then the um the seven factors of Awakening how we loosen how we untie

193
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:46,680
how we become clear the five hindrances are considered

194
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:52,440
things that hinder our ability to see clearly the seven factor is Awakening and what

195
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:58,560
supports us to see clearly so um so certainly if you know these

196
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,740
things you can kind of check in with yourself what oh how what should these are operating someone who does a lot of vipassana

197
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:10,920
practice should really be kind of second nature to notice what are the hindrances when they're operating

198
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:17,280
and also uh even in subtle ways in which the seven factors of Awakening operate for us

199
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:25,920
but for day-to-day and what I would like to say is um is noticing if how we're

200
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:33,000
oh involved in anything at all involved in thoughts involved in activities in the world

201
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:40,920
involved in conversations do we feel um entangled in it do we feel caught in

202
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:50,220
it and in such a way that there's an ouch or do we feel expansive in it open in it

203
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:58,440
are we agitated is the energy kind of activated and or or is the or is the energy the for

204
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,920
the the feeling energy feeling of it one of being suffused

205
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:11,520
and this has something to do with the source they see there's seven factors of these um the fourth foundations The

206
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:16,980
Source from which so much of our Behavior arises out of

207
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:22,740
the hindrances are behavior that rises out of a source which is very limited

208
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:29,160
and very tight and narrow and constricted or entangled Maybe

209
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:35,400
this what arises out of the seven factor of Awakening is also energetic but it's

210
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:42,900
an energy which is not entangled or agitated or activated but rather an

211
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:50,339
energy or a Vitality in the body that feels like it suffuses us it

212
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:58,099
spreads more widely it's and it's the difference between being

213
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:04,800
um in a tornado versus being in a really relaxing pool

214
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:12,599
of water so both of them can be energetic in a way these two states but the quality of

215
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:18,240
the energy the quality of the activation or the quality of the how we're engaged

216
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,119
how we are with our experience how we're attentive is radically different

217
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:32,579
so to um so what are the mental processes involved are they the hindrances or are

218
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:38,700
they more the seven factors of Awakening and are they more

219
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:46,740
something that feels unpleasant to be how we're involved uh more like a fight or flight the

220
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:53,540
hindrances could be analyzed from the point of view of a fight flight or freeze

221
00:39:53,540 --> 00:40:01,560
not completely but good but it's a little bit and um and the the seven factors of

222
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:09,240
Awakening can be more more like relax nurture soothe

223
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:14,960
um you know uh approach

224
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:21,900
so the operating principles of the mind that are the source from how we see the

225
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:28,980
world how we are in the world so this change of perspective this check-in that we're doing

226
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:37,380
comes to the point where the check-in itself is contributing to a positive way of

227
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:43,680
being present a positive kind of more something it cleans in the direction of seven factors of Awakening

228
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:51,839
so part of the value of this mindfulness check-in is that in and of its on one hand we're

229
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:58,980
learning how we are we're learning to see ourselves from a different point of view and on the other hand we are bringing

230
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:04,920
into the ecosystem a healthy way of being present and

231
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:11,460
seeing and checking in that is not entangled not caught up

232
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:18,660
so both of these work together and both of them are important changing the perspective of how we see

233
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:25,140
ourselves when we're challenged according using the perspective of these four different areas of what's happening

234
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:30,420
for us and bringing it's kind of like bringing

235
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:37,740
an adult into the room of a lot of teenagers kind of having a fight or something it's kind of like bringing a wise Elder

236
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:44,040
into the into the mix using the check-in

237
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:50,099
is bringing into the ecosystem a new way of being

238
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:55,320
and the whole ecosystem can change by that introduction

239
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:01,740
just simply stopping and checking in and maybe going through these four how am I physically

240
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:07,020
how am I you know feeling tone how am I my mind

241
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:12,420
stayed High Am I by the underlying processes of how I'm involved I'm

242
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:18,359
concerned so for today I would like to suggest for

243
00:42:18,359 --> 00:42:25,980
you is that uh through the day periodically to be if you like schedules you can

244
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:31,020
schedule it once an hour or some way or other

245
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:36,660
um do some quality take quality time it doesn't have to be law maybe it can be

246
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:43,920
two minutes to stop maybe even close your eyes

247
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:51,320
check in with yourself using these four different check-ins

248
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:59,280
but but notice as you do it or when you have done it if the if the check-in itself the

249
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,099
attention that we bring that is looking at ourselves in this way has that in fact introduced something

250
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:10,500
nice into the system is a check in itself

251
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:17,579
more like a wise Elder has entered the room and everyone relax and feels oh good

252
00:43:17,579 --> 00:43:23,040
there's someone here who's wise someone here who helps me to be present

253
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:29,220
see what the effect is on you of introducing their mindfulness check-in that we're

254
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:37,140
talking about this week so thank you very much and uh look

255
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,740
forward to tomorrow
