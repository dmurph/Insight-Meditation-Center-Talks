1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,960
it's good to be with you I am uh yeah happy happy to be practicing on

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:16,440
this uh day this kind of quiet uh strange week holiday week for some and

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:23,800
uh I don't have my headset which means you can see my ears which are fine they're just ears

4
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:31,840
I'm not embarrassed but I'm used to my Gamers headset and uh here I am in a hotel

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,920
without it so you know

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:46,879
flexibility anyway uh it's good to uh good to practice in this time and

7
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:55,239
uh um yeah conscious some people may be inundated with people others feeling a

8
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:01,199
lack of people a lot happens in this time and it's easy to get uh

9
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:10,400
disconnected from Dharma and uh kind of fog comes over and um easy to forget a

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,960
lot and so um we're here to to remember of

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,600
course and um and so let's uh let's sit find our

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,960
way

13
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,920
together e

14
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:11,119
it's just uh kind of uh beginning with the the whatever sweetness of the S there

15
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:32,640
is so we're we're linked up here by

16
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:38,959
technology sincerity

17
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:53,720
Love by a lineage of uh 20600 years that's seen it all

18
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,439
we uh find a way to settle

19
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:49,360
in to bring some some measure of soothing into your

20
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,720
body

21
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
e for

22
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:07,360
just feeling your your body on the

23
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:28,639
earth kind of uh Embrace of sorts of uh

24
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
gravity

25
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,639
for for

26
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,759
maybe meaning whatever agitation or

27
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:50,080
tension numbness whatever remains with

28
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:56,280
u sense of patience and tolerance

29
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:18,800
like very willing to Lavish our unsettledness with

30
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:24,960
awareness and a quiet

31
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
love

32
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,479
e for

33
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:45,440
and sometimes the Dharma just feels a little

34
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:52,320
remote the muscle memory of wisdom and

35
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,880
love isn't there

36
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,880
the rich set of associations and

37
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,680
silences feel

38
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:33,640
distant don't try to brute force your

39
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,839
way into the Dharma

40
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:52,640
field just lovingly tend to the wall

41
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,720
that seemingly separates you from

42
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
it

43
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

44
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

45
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

46
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

47
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

48
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,160
e for

49
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:56,279
we recall Buddha dhama Sanaa to help us

50
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
remember e

51
00:14:51,000 --> 00:15:00,079
we enter this kind of Realm of of sensitivity and care

52
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:11,600
you remember the the poignancy the great urgency of this matter of life

53
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,959
and death

54
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:49,880
our hearts becoming more Supple

55
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,519
simultaneously more strong

56
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,639
is the courage of meeting this

57
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:21,279
moment as it is never satisfied that we fully know

58
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,240
what this moment is

59
00:16:30,319 --> 00:16:35,120
we keep

60
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:44,680
looking willing to be surprised by this

61
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
practice

62
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

63
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

64
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760

e

73
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,480
e e

74
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:47,360
we uh we don't insist that the Dharma

75
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,880
work we just keep offering our heart up to it no

76
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,600
strings

77
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
attached

78
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

79
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

80
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240

e e

85
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
e

86
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,960
okay um so uh yeah good to sit with

87
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:58,279
you so um one of uh one of the the Hallmarks of

88
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:03,960
a of a successful animal animals like us is the um the

89
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,600
ability to stay secure and

90
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,600
protected and in a sense if you want to be safe

91
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:25,080
you better know a lot about danger and you better have a kind of

92
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:31,080
robust threat detection system system

93
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:38,360
and fear serves that function so here's bra brain scientist K Tha she writes

94
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:45,960
fear is an intensely negative internal state it conducts orchestration of

95
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:51,399
coordinated functions serving to arouse our Peak Performance for avoidance

96
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:59,039
Escape or confrontation fear resembles a dictator that makes all other brain

97
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:06,240
processes from thinking to breathing subservient fear can be innate or

98
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,679
learned and Nate fear can be a response to environmental stimuli without prior

99
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:19,519
experience such as that of snakes or spiders and humans fear associations are the most

100
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:27,919
rapidly learned robustly encoded and retrieved and prone to activate multiple

101
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:34,960
memory systems so in other words

102
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,639
um our system is pretty good you know you could say

103
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:47,679
that how many times has fear kept me safe I don't even know how do you even

104
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:53,880
count million right and how many times has the alarm

105
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:59,240
Bell of fear gone off but there's no actual

106
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:07,679
threat probably a hundred times that so on the one hand I'm glad we have

107
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:15,799
fear mechanisms but we've probably overlearned the lessons of

108
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:23,960
fear and so why why do I begin with all of this um couple weeks ago I think I

109
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:30,840
was talking about the difference between sensitivity to suffering and fear of

110
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:39,279
suffering and uh and I was very cognizant of being sensitive

111
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:46,320
to suffering even as a kid but I maybe haven't realized that just how much fear

112
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:53,880
is still still bound up fear of suffering particularly the suffering of

113
00:32:53,880 --> 00:33:00,840
others and so today I wanted to to continue around this question of fear

114
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:08,480
but I'm thinking about the relationship between fear and love and

115
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:15,039
generosity so there's a story um I just came across it again I read it seven

116
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:23,880
years ago when it was published and saw it again this week and um um and so the

117
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:31,480
the author writes a quiet man named uh jow quit his job running the human

118
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:39,600
resources department of an insurance company in Rio de Janeiro and began selling french fries from a street cart

119
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:44,799
the fries quickly proved popular in part because they were delicious thin and

120
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:52,760
crisp and golden even more enticing jaah often served them up for free all he had

121
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:58,960
to do was ask and he'd scoop some into a box no charge what money he did take in

122
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:06,519
he frequently gave away to Children begging in the street or used to buy them sweets day after day he came home

123
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:13,320
to his wife and son without any money in his pocket in his previous life jaah was

124
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,560
been Stern and serious prone to squirreling money away but after

125
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:25,158
surviving a Health crisis at the age of 49 he wanted to live differently I saw

126
00:34:25,159 --> 00:34:32,280
death from close up he would often say say now I want to be in High Spirits and

127
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:38,200
nothing made him happier than giving what's most interesting about

128
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:43,919
Joel um though is that his new outlook resulted not from a spiritual

129
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:51,760
awakening but from a brain damage caused by a stroke his neurologist says he became

130
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:58,240
quote pathologically generous compulsively driven to give

131
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:04,599
his Carefree attitude towards money led to confrontations with his family especially his brother-in-law who

132
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:12,160
co-owned the French fry cart but even when his family berated him and the cart went out of business and he was reduced

133
00:35:12,160 --> 00:35:19,400
to living on his mother's pension joah refused to stop giving simply made him

134
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:26,560
too happy so what's the what's the lesson

135
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:32,599
from this you know was maybe a surprise that pivoted

136
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:37,960
into a brain injury right rather than some spiritual awakening right is the

137
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:43,800
lesson maybe we might ask like if you don't have a brain injury if you have normal brain

138
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:48,880
functioning you're right to be less generous than

139
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,079
Joel maybe maybe

140
00:35:54,079 --> 00:36:02,520
not right our our brains we have to remember are designed for to help us

141
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:08,760
survive not be free and

142
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:17,240
um as the story unfolded the um we learned that uh Joel's um the the kind

143
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:23,319
of nature the damage to his brain you know associated with regions associated

144
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:29,079
with long-term planning and goal directed Behavior in a certain sense you

145
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:38,119
could say it eroded his capacity to worry it eroded his capacity for certain

146
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:44,119
types of fear and of course this is a loss in

147
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:50,880
some ways his family was suffering as a function of his generosity right fair

148
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,720
enough maybe we say that's not honorable here's the story concludes

149
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,480
uh we can talk about generosity in terms of dopamine hits or pavlovian stimulus

150
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:11,040
response Theory and that's not necessarily wrong but it overlooks something important about Joel that

151
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,720
giving truly did make him feel happy and fulfilled the Neuroscience researcher

152
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:24,520
said Joel was one of the happiest people he's ever

153
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:30,520
met and that made me wonder like okay I don't

154
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:35,720
want to throw away all of the mechanisms of my

155
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:41,400
fear but what would my love look like if

156
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:49,079
I were less afraid what would your love look like if you were less

157
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:56,240
afraid even if it were just 5% of

158
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:03,880
joal what would your love look like I can sense in me that that

159
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:11,480
my my love feels constrained by different forces it's not that I'm

160
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,680
not a loving person or something but I can feel that it's it's still

161
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:25,240
constrained it's constrained among other factors by fear fear this sense of like and it fear

162
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:32,319
just puts us into the deepest in Innocent but very primitive

163
00:38:32,319 --> 00:38:38,400
corner of self where the world is populated

164
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:45,200
essentially by threat that's the only Salient feature of the world what is

165
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:52,119
threat what's not threat and um how different how

166
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:58,400
different right would our vision of Life be

167
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:04,720
when the most Salient feature of the world is not threat but instead

168
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,040
goodness and

169
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,400
need my love feels constrained by um by social

170
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:22,800
custom you know in some ways we we celebrate generosity in some ways but um

171
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,280
view it with suspicion in others you know

172
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:33,319
my love feels constrained by the kind of prevailing standards of how much we're

173
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:39,200
entitled to privilege our own well-being over that of

174
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:46,640
strangers you know and there is just um for me just

175
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,839
like uh just reading reading about um

176
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:57,880
that story it it was a very kind of deep um d

177
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:03,680
you know just a deep Delight in it and it didn't feel sullied by the fact that

178
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:09,480
it was a brain injury rather than a spiritual awakening that led him to give

179
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:16,079
away all those fries and the the the kind of um the

180
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:23,160
Delight in doing that like I actually get I get that you

181
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,560
know right like the sense of um

182
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:38,000
yeah this sense of like this latent love in all of us you know that is somehow

183
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,920
constrained or somehow we're self-conscious or there's fear that um

184
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,200
limits Us in some way there's social niceties or whatever con you know just

185
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:57,640
following conforming to standard models of what goodness entails you know

186
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:04,960
but like I want to give away some fries bad you

187
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:12,839
know and I know I if I like did that for 15 minutes each day before

188
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:20,000
meditating that would be a nice sit that would be a nice life I think my the

189
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,920
condition of my heart and mind would be improved by that you

190
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,800
know and so the encouragement here is um

191
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:39,680
to uh to understand the relationship between fear and love more

192
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:47,400
deeply I'm cautious about simplistic formulations of you know the opposite

193
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,839
of um you know fear is is is love you

194
00:41:52,839 --> 00:41:59,000
know the opposite of Love is fear rather than hate or something like that like that in intuitively makes a lot of sense

195
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:06,280
but I'm sure it's complex but um it's worth even

196
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,960
considering as a kind of thought experiment what what shape would your

197
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:20,480
heart take if the nagging worries and control and

198
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:29,119
concern and fear Abad it you know even just a

199
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:36,640
little Tian says uh the only way to ease our fear and truly be happy is to

200
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:44,599
acknowledge our fear and look deeply at its source instead of trying to escape our

201
00:42:44,599 --> 00:42:51,000
fear we can invite it up to our awareness look at it

202
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:59,000
clearly deeply and it's my

203
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:06,599
sense that in in gathering some of our courage and feeling a little bit more

204
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:13,400
secure in opening to finitude and mortality and knowing we all already

205
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:20,079
know how the story ends that that helps melt away some of

206
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:29,359
the worry we become more um radical or our

207
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:39,640
love okay for this for your uh consideration so uh thank you all I'm
