1
00:00:01,140 --> 00:00:04,639
good morning Sangha

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,540
good morning everyone

3
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,300
hmm so welcome everyone

4
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,340
see I am not seeing myself here

5
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:50,420
um are you able to see me on YouTube some reason I'm not able to see myself

6
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:09,119
hmm okay so I'm going to

7
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,420
um started the meditation I'm hoping this everything is working

8
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:23,820
okay I'm not able to see the YouTube myself

9
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:30,180
but I do see the messages okay so let's begin

10
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,580
I'm gonna assume that everything works okay

11
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,299
um so this morning's we're being working

12
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:49,200
through um this uh words that start with R

13
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,040
and today I will add one more R to this

14
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,360
unfolding meditative process and this

15
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:05,399
um last a few days we've been using the word

16
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,780
we started with relaxing and

17
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:21,020
added to it in the relaxed field and we can recognize the things clearly

18
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:29,760
and with recognition uh we get to release any extra tension

19
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,280
that we notice with these scrap grasping cleaning

20
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:41,040
and today I will be adding one more word to this

21
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,660
and that is resting and so once any extra tension gets

22
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:54,019
released we can simply rest

23
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:02,720
and so that's the process that we'll go through and so let's begin with a meditation

24
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,879
so please take a meditative posture if you're not in one already

25
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:17,580
now again evoke this image of entering into a temple

26
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,159
maybe that's a conducive because of the

27
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:30,319
uh metaphors we've been using in our dharmette

28
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:39,019
so take a few moments to allow yourself to settle into the space you're in

29
00:03:42,019 --> 00:03:46,400
arriving Here and Now

30
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,159
as you forward entering into a temple

31
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:09,379
in Ancient Temple

32
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:17,880
the Temple of this body is mind

33
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,780
This Heart

34
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:36,360
just to this image of entering into the temple may already evoke

35
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:40,400
some felt sense in the body

36
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,639
are certain feelings in the heart

37
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,800
for me there is immediate quieting down

38
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,100
of my mind

39
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:12,080
and there is a tenderness respect in the heart

40
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,720
as we enter into the Temple of this body

41
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:30,259
and take our seat right in the middle

42
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,440
arriving Right Here and Now mistake

43
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:06,380
um rounding the body

44
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:13,919
inviting relaxation and ease

45
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,000
as if you're settling in the home

46
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,080
the homecoming

47
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,479
mindfulness is a front and the center

48
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:58,039
and maybe a heartfulness is front and center

49
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,639
as the sense of arriving arriving depends

50
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:42,979
and about the relaxation and the ease to deepen

51
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:59,720
maybe the relaxation can happen throughout the body

52
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,599
and maybe even add to the cellular level

53
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:14,840
microscopic level easing up

54
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:32,840
relaxing the thinking muscles

55
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:47,100
relaxing the heart in some sense of opening

56
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,560
but unburdened heart

57
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,140
in this relaxed field

58
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:25,640
and can begin to turn our attention [Music] to any familiar meditative object

59
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:33,860
whether it's recognizing the movements of the breath

60
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,220
your Sensations in the body

61
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:49,279
waves of emotions

62
00:09:53,779 --> 00:09:57,620
inflating thoughts

63
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:21,019
simple recognition fear recognition

64
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:36,300
maybe this recognition arises out of

65
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:44,540
the felt sense the immediacy of the felt sense

66
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,640
through the body

67
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:03,180
and we can let go of the conceptual overlays

68
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,320
the stories

69
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:24,860
staying with the felt sense of your experience

70
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:16,940
you notice any tension tightness

71
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:23,180
Construction that's creeping up

72
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:30,120
see if there is a way to relax

73
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:37,279
and release the extra tension

74
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,160
this is not a big project to undertake

75
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,360
very light touch

76
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:59,480
it's like opening the Palms

77
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:35,459
a simple unentangled awareness

78
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:43,100
allow our system rest

79
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,699
to deeply settle

80
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,060
your resting word resting

81
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:49,320
nice is such a flavor of peaceful

82
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:56,880
being peaceful in the midst of

83
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,019
what is happening in your experience

84
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:12,139
peaceful abiding

85
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:13,340
to rest is to stop doing

86
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:27,500
resting is simply being

87
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:16,679
and there's a process of relaxing recognizing

88
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:22,880
releasing and the resting

89
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,520
wherever you are is perfect a place to be

90
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:28,460
I'm sitting in the relaxed and restful field

91
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:35,600
our hearts and Minds can open

92
00:29:36,659 --> 00:29:40,039
to receive

93
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:46,880
experiences of the World At Large

94
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:53,840
the challenges and the beauty

95
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,220
and from this field we can receive

96
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:09,380
and challenges and beauty in our own heart and mind

97
00:30:42,750 --> 00:31:23,150
[Music]

98
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:10,020
thank you everyone and today I will continue from the theme

99
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:16,820
that um were being speaking about um this is the

100
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:23,520
multifaceted or multi-dimensional aspects of our practice path

101
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:29,820
we've spoken about how we practice the words kindness

102
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:35,760
embodiment you know holding the babies in the premature World

103
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:42,779
um word or practicing in family Dynamics

104
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:49,799
and yesterday we spoke about practicing in the relational field

105
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:55,020
and so today we'll continue with yet another story

106
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:01,700
from a monastery with ink and this is called

107
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,120
many ways of walking the path

108
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:15,360
the monastery held a big public event celebrating the birth of the Buddha

109
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:24,360
as crowds of the visitors came to commemorate the event emotion emotion and the noise rhymed

110
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:30,360
throughout the monastery in the early afternoon for young monks

111
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:35,880
decided to slip out the back gate they had decided

112
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:43,440
that they weren't needed that their absence would not be noticed

113
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,620
they decided to hike a well-trodden path into the mountains

114
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:55,080
as they hiked one of the monks said I'm so glad we

115
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:02,460
decided to get away from all the chaos of the monastery I was agitated by all the people and

116
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:07,919
activity another Monk replied it hadn't occurred

117
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:15,000
to me that we were trying to get away from anything I thought we left the monastery because we wanted to reach the

118
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:21,679
Outlook with a beautiful Vista that is along this path

119
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:29,339
the third monk then spoke up quite forcefully I am not interested in escaping what is

120
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:36,179
behind us or focusing on distant goals I thought we were simply walking the

121
00:34:36,179 --> 00:34:41,540
path to enjoy the views each step along the way

122
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:49,080
impatient with what the others had said fourth monk said I thought we headed out

123
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:56,158
on this path to get exercise the girls you all have

124
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:02,700
for our walk are all temporary by building up our strengths we will be

125
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:08,280
better prepared for even longer hikes that we may have to undergo

126
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:16,859
also it is such a delight to move and feel Vitality Crossing through the body

127
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:23,339
as each committed to his approach for walking the path they each decided to go

128
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:28,859
on their own way after all why should they be troubled to walk with someone

129
00:35:28,859 --> 00:35:35,040
who had a different understanding of what the walk was about

130
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,760
the further he walked from the monastery the less the first among felt obsessed

131
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:48,240
by the festivities he had left behind when he felt quite removed from the

132
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:56,160
monastery his motivation for the heart could disappeared and he sat down and took a nap leaning

133
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,099
against a tree this might remind you something the

134
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:08,040
rabbit and the second monk was so eager to

135
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,200
reach the Outlook that he didn't notice the rocks and the

136
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:19,500
roots that lay across the path he stumbled and fell often after a while

137
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:25,440
he was scraped and bruised enough that he sat down giving up on the hike

138
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,260
further along the path when the past passed us through a syndic

139
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:38,160
medal the third monk left at the past to admire the beautiful butterflies flying

140
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,280
among the colorful flowers thoroughly enjoying himself he stayed in

141
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,320
the middle until it was time to return to the monastery

142
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:57,359
the fourth month became absorbed in the exercise of a walking as the flow of a Vitality increased in

143
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:03,660
his body his attention was increasingly absorbed into his immediate physical

144
00:37:03,660 --> 00:37:09,060
experience when the path went by the Outlook he

145
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:14,940
didn't notice and kept hiking further into the mountains

146
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:21,180
that evening the apis who tended to notice everything that happened at a

147
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:28,980
monastery met with the four monks and asked why they had left together but

148
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,460
returned separately the monks explained that they had

149
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:41,640
disagreed about why they were on the path they said because they couldn't agree on

150
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:48,780
what they were doing they had to separate it each hiking according to his own purpose

151
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:55,560
for walking the path upon hearing this the abyss laughed and

152
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:02,460
then said the Buddhist path the capital P had only

153
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:09,540
exists when someone walks it while people walking on this path for

154
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:14,760
many different reasons they were equally all walkers

155
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:23,160
it doesn't matter what motivates them as long as they walk the path mindfully

156
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:28,740
if you're mindful the shortcomings of any purpose will be

157
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:35,460
overcome as Abyss my job is to help make sure you

158
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:41,160
keep walking the path your mindfulness and persistence will

159
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,680
take care of everything else

160
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:53,520
so well we can't talk about the practice or the path with without saying

161
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:58,160
something about mindfulness right

162
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:04,020
no matter why we started walking the path

163
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:10,140
what forms of the practice that we're engaging in whether it's the meditative a practice

164
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:17,820
or on Retreats and holding babies or caring for the family

165
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:23,359
caring for the community making a livelihood

166
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:31,640
mindfulness mindful presence places such a central role in our path

167
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,660
I loved this analogy that I heard early on in my practice and that is

168
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:46,099
mindfulness is like turning the light on in the Darkness

169
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:54,839
so when the light is on it has so many functions the path will begin to unfold

170
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:01,500
clearly and so in the story the first Monk walk

171
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:09,240
to the path out of the desire to escape the chaos in the monastery and some of it us may have started the

172
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:19,339
path out of desire to escape the chaos internally to ourselves or externally

173
00:40:19,339 --> 00:40:24,859
but when we began to pay attention

174
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:32,880
to our immediate experience we may notice so often I wouldn't say all the time but

175
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:39,240
so often they chaos is more or less like a

176
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:46,020
jumbled cluster of thoughts stitched together by

177
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:53,160
our views beliefs ideas and they become a story that we repeated

178
00:40:53,160 --> 00:41:00,180
to ourselves again and again and they can't be so dark convincing

179
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:05,880
right I can start with something very simple you know

180
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:14,900
my neighbor talks really loud well what's wrong with this man

181
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:21,839
how can that be how can you be so in considerate

182
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:30,060
you know maybe I should move away from this neighborhood I can't stand to the Sea anymore

183
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:35,579
well I've been thinking about moving away anyway for the other reasons

184
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:40,859
maybe this just is yet another reason for me to do this

185
00:41:40,859 --> 00:41:48,060
but wait a minute problem why should I move things should be

186
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:55,380
moving and you can see right and there's so many times

187
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:02,760
the chaos that we create in our mind it's just this kind of a jumbled set of

188
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:10,980
thoughts gets us stitched it together because of our opinions of views ideas

189
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:17,280
but if you're paying attention were mindful about it we can see through

190
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:24,240
oh ah this is just a whole jumbo of opinions

191
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:31,339
thoughts they're quite fleeting they're quite elusive

192
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:38,339
and so as we become mindful we can relax

193
00:42:38,339 --> 00:42:46,380
and the release release the holding the belief the solidity of the stories

194
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,299
that we may be holding on to

195
00:42:52,079 --> 00:43:00,359
and the second monk who rushed through the path to try to get to the end or get

196
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:06,900
to the Outlook he ended up with a lot of scripts and the bruises

197
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:15,960
giving up the walk all together and so without being aware

198
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:21,300
our goals can become a barrier at some point

199
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:28,200
I remember from myself the first Retreat the first to teravaga

200
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:35,280
retreat I had no other agenda but to get enlightened that was it you know I had

201
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:42,060
no other thing going on that was it and so I tried so hard

202
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:47,220
I got up early in the morning slept late in the evening

203
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:56,060
and I got a whole lot of bruises and scripts of my own kind I must Retreat

204
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:02,760
fortunately I didn't give up like the second Monk I did a persist

205
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:12,180
and at some point a little bit of a mindfulness lit up

206
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:19,380
and I realized that all that striving and trying were creating a bigger

207
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:25,880
barrier rather than being a support

208
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:33,980
and so that actually cracked open the path for me

209
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:41,640
and so mindfulness is a key part of the practice

210
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:50,280
and the third month was all about enjoying the scenery and got caught up by the butterflies and the flowers

211
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:56,940
and so just like the Monk um sometimes they can get caught by the

212
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:05,040
goodies along the path you know whether it's a pleasant meditative experience or some high

213
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:13,339
praises and your friends have been telling you how do we avoid getting caught

214
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:21,800
mindfulness we can become aware how we might get caught

215
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:31,079
and when we release that we can keep going the last month of the story kept on

216
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:37,680
walking by simply present taking one step at a time

217
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,319
this is simple immediate kind of walking a path

218
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:50,460
broad vitality and sustained him deep into the mountain

219
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:58,680
and so as the app is says the Buddhist path capital P only exists while one

220
00:45:58,680 --> 00:46:04,079
walks it so this last amongst the story is to be

221
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:09,319
continued tomorrow and so that's probably enough for today

222
00:46:09,319 --> 00:46:16,740
so thank you for your attention and thank you for your practice

223
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:22,619
and we will resume in our Global Sangha tomorrow morning

224
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:26,240
have a wonderful day everyone
