00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:07,980
hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:15,860
and I'm happy to be back here and

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,800
I was on Retreat last week at our Retreat Center in Santa Cruz

4
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:26,240
and that was very nice

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,500
so to begin with some comments relevant for the

6
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:40,920
meditation I believe that often enough

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,440
in different parts of the world different religions

8
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:52,800
that which is sacred is also considered to be dangerous or

9
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,920
potentially dangerous and so to approach the sacred with respect

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,460
because of that Danger so I would like to say something about

11
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,979
this in Buddhism that uh might sound like it goes against the

12
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:17,540
grain or contrary to what you've often been taught about Buddhism

13
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,140
and that is that uh desire

14
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:34,280
can be sacred but because desire is also dangerous

15
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,640
and that in Buddhism certain kinds of Desire

16
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,920
are the origin for our suffering and the origin for a lot of the

17
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,399
suffering that we see in the world because of that sometimes desire gets a

18
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,740
bad name or is considered to be only something let go of

19
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:04,220
let go let go let go is a kind of Buddhist refrain

20
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,420
and we want to come to the end of Desire there might be some truth to that

21
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:18,239
to some degree but having desire is a very important

22
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:25,920
part of the Buddhist path having some kind of Desire is a very important part of the Buddhist life

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,920
the Buddha advocated having particular desires

24
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:39,480
but as soon as we have desires we have expectations as soon as we have desires it all too easily slides into attachment

25
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:45,000
to the desire fear of the desire all kinds of things

26
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:53,160
can happen and so it's easy then to fall back on desire is bad we shouldn't have desire

27
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:59,459
but desire is important and as we meditate today

28
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:05,519
perhaps you can experiment with finding a desire

29
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:13,459
for meditation a desire for being mindful being present here and now

30
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:19,920
that is not just a simple desire not just following instructions from a teacher

31
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:25,700
like to be present follow your breath but rather

32
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:33,239
arises out of a deep wish a deep aspiration

33
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:39,300
a deep intention and that being present here now being

34
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:45,379
with a breath being present and attentive

35
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:53,459
is animated is motivated by

36
00:03:53,459 --> 00:04:02,280
such a inter such a deep desire within us such an integral desire within us

37
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:09,480
for such an important purpose that the desire has a kind of sacredness

38
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,959
to it it's something to respect maybe even have an awe that we have this

39
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:23,340
capacity for a heart's wish not to get excited and not to get

40
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:29,120
spitting up in thought but the opposite

41
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:42,900
and where we appreciate this desire and appreciate that the Fulfillment of

42
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:48,620
the desire is not found through thinking

43
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:56,100
but is found through knowing being aware being present here

44
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:03,259
with a quiet heart Quiet Mind

45
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:12,840
a fullness of art a full mind which is full of the present moment

46
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:20,880
peacefully to know that the desires goes in that direction in a certain way

47
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,919
or that the meditation is foundational

48
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:33,560
be useful for fulfilling other desires that we have

49
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,199
so to assume a meditation posture

50
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:50,759
a posture that is participating

51
00:05:52,560 --> 00:06:01,759
in the desire maybe the sacred desire to be present now here

52
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,979
gently closing the eyes

53
00:06:38,699 --> 00:06:44,780
taking some gently bigger breaths

54
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:51,199
establishing a connection Here and Now

55
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,560
in this body

56
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,259
letting your breathing return to normal

57
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:57,440
and feeling resting in your body for a few moments

58
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:04,940
and then doing it again and again

59
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:18,840
and each time you return to your body resting see if you can rest deeper into your

60
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:23,660
body settle deeper

61
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:39,560
maybe with each exhale settling deeper

62
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:03,980
relaxing the body

63
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:18,079
relaxing the mind

64
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:22,580
and then taking a few moments to feel your way in

65
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:31,500
assuming there's a place deep inside where desires can be peaceful desires

66
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:36,680
can be peaceful and profound

67
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:43,560
desires that have no expectation or attachment

68
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:50,360
but desires which are Maybe

69
00:10:53,820 --> 00:11:00,440
sacred Maybe integral to us

70
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:07,980
in and there be a clear

71
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:10,760
desire

72
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:19,100
for being present here and now

73
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:27,079
for being awake in this body and mind

74
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:37,320
desire to not have your thoughts take you away to other places other

75
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:45,500
times past and future at their events

76
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,240
desire or the heart's wish

77
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,700
to be here in the lived moment to find

78
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:09,980
the fullness the sacredness the vitality

79
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:25,560
that is being manifested

80
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:32,839
each moment stay close to that desire

81
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,560
as you stay present mindful Here and Now

82
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,700
foreign

83
00:15:17,699 --> 00:15:19,880
foreign

84
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:46,260
when you find your mind wandering off in thought rather than coming back to the breathing

85
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:52,740
coming back to the present come back

86
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:59,419
to the profound desire where the peaceful desire

87
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:05,179
to be here to be mindful

88
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:14,419
that desire that has no demand no expectation

89
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:21,960
but a desire which is sacred or valuable

90
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:35,120
a desire whose byproduct is then to be aware

91
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:34,220
said settling back into the desire to be present

92
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:42,799
and then discovering that you are then present

93
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:23,179
and then coming to the end of the sitting

94
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:34,200
compassion involves having a certain desire for the

95
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:39,900
end of suffering desire for the welfare

96
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:46,740
and happiness of others desire for the welfare and happiness of

97
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:55,200
oneself there are different kinds of love

98
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,240
one is the love that

99
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:09,919
is activated that is animated

100
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,059
by what we receive from others the love we receive the care

101
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:24,380
Another Kind of Love is a love that we generate

102
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:32,240
to care and love others wanting their well-being

103
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:39,679
wanting to support and to serve and to care

104
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:49,140
compassion and love can have within them

105
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:56,658
desire sacred desire the heart's wish desire

106
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,700
for the welfare and happiness of others

107
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:09,139
to feel that desire that wish

108
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:17,720
to feel that well wishing no matter how small it is

109
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:24,419
it's even significant if we wish we had

110
00:28:24,419 --> 00:28:31,620
good will for others just a wish to do so even if we think we can't do it

111
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:35,240
that wish is the beginning

112
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:45,360
and then to always find a way to give expression to that care

113
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:52,260
that good will many infinite numbers of Expressions but

114
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:59,880
to let it live in you and to manifest in you and at the end of The Meditation

115
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:06,659
it can manifest in expressing thoughts of Goodwill for the world

116
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:14,539
around you may all beings be happy

117
00:29:15,299 --> 00:29:21,500
may all beings be peaceful

118
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:26,840
may all beings be saved

119
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:32,240
may all beings be free

120
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:38,720
and may it be our desire to contribute to that

121
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,799
foreign

122
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:55,099
[Music]

123
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:20,898
foreign

124
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:31,080
so hello on this Monday morning here in California

125
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:36,980
and uh happy to be back

126
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:44,340
I was teaching a retreat at our inside Retreat Center this last

127
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:50,640
week with Bruni Bruni Davila wonderful retreat

128
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:56,640
and um happy to be back here at IMC I'm

129
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:03,419
beginning to feel here at IMC and IRC a kind of coming to life again more fully

130
00:32:03,419 --> 00:32:08,580
from um you know that's kind of gone

131
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:13,919
hibernated or during the pandemic and it's quite lovely to feel they act the

132
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,620
energy coming back and the people coming back and it uh here at IMC maybe from in my mind

133
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:25,260
a little bit is represented by um we're starting up offering day-long

134
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:31,380
Retreats here in person on Saturdays and this coming Saturday it's a

135
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:36,480
wonderful teacher I just talked with Bruni Bruni Davila will be teaching one

136
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,140
of the first day longs here I think from nine to 4 30 so if anyone lives locally and would like to come

137
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:50,360
and meditate for a day in community that's a wonderful opportunity

138
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:58,320
so the topic of this of these weeks from the beginning

139
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:03,899
of the year what I'm teaching here is practicing with challenges how to be

140
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:09,380
with the challenges of life and the challenges can be minor to being

141
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:15,179
the most major challenges in life of life and I've been hoping trying to lay down

142
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:21,779
the foundation that's applicable to all these different areas and for the big challenges that this is

143
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:27,659
also a very important foundation so that with time we can learn also how

144
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:33,679
to be with a really difficult things that happen to us within us

145
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:40,980
and the topic this week has to do with um strategies

146
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:48,600
for working with challenges and there are two general categories of

147
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:53,940
strategies of working with challenges the ones are

148
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:59,039
dysfunctional and ones are functional one

149
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:04,200
are wholesome and some and others are

150
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:12,260
unwholesome helpful and unhelpful and for the and I want to

151
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:19,858
use the teachings on the five hindrances and present them as common unhelpful

152
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:27,960
strategies that people use to cope with to deal with challenges that come up

153
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:35,760
but I don't just want to do that I want to say that each of those hindrances has an opposite quality

154
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,220
which is a healthy way of responding to challenges

155
00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:47,878
and to have these two working together to know the two as you get to know recognize how

156
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:54,780
hindrance is work in you it's a that itself is a prompt to think

157
00:34:54,780 --> 00:35:01,320
about to like oh what's the healthy form of the same thing I'm being challenged right now by some

158
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:08,099
difficulty and my coping mechanism is a hindrance is there another strategy what's the op

159
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:15,420
what would be the opposite and how do I tap into that opposite in me so it's integral it's got It's not a

160
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:21,440
it's not a overlay or pretend or something on top of everything

161
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:27,680
and um and often I I enough I think in Buddhism

162
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,180
that when the emphasis is talking about letting go and letting go of

163
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:38,820
the dysfunctional things that the Mind does it's often a left there just like oh

164
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:44,280
like a like oh and um and partly because as the practice gets deeper and deeper

165
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:50,820
and deeper as meditation practice is really the practice matures in fact there's a profound letting go of

166
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:56,480
everything but to have this attitude we're supposed to let go of everything

167
00:35:56,480 --> 00:36:03,540
right away that's not really appropriate um it's it would be like

168
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:10,500
you know if you were going to go swimming in a public pool you would go into a changing room and take off your

169
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:16,859
clothes and put on a bathing suit and um and uh and so

170
00:36:16,859 --> 00:36:23,099
you decide well you know that's I just take off everything and jump in the pool by going to the changing room

171
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:28,680
um you know it's there's a time and place for for um

172
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:34,859
you know letting go of certain things and so to do it all at once you know we

173
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:40,079
end up undermining ourselves or diminishing the

174
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:48,060
fullness and the strength and the I would like to say power of a human being that can come from the opposite of the

175
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:53,880
hindrances our strength resides there and if we don't have it there then our

176
00:36:53,880 --> 00:37:01,740
capacity for strength or energy can really flow into the hindrances and sometimes people put more energy into

177
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:07,760
the hindrances than they do in almost anything else so for example the first one

178
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,960
sensual desire is people who put more effort and energy

179
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,020
into their addictions than almost anything else someone has this really strong addiction they mean boy are they

180
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:26,640
motivated sometimes get out of their way and they'll do almost anything to you know satisfy their addiction it's a lot

181
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:33,780
of energy there and um but to have that have not that desperation but to have really a sense

182
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:39,060
of power and strength in the opposite of the hindrance is the healthy versions is

183
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:45,599
possible so first we have to understand this so the first hindrance is usually said

184
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,839
to be sensual desire the Buddha offered a separate list of the five hindrances only difference

185
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,200
being that the first one is Covetous covetousness wanting the things other people have and wanting something

186
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,200
someone else has so one is a little bit more the a strong desire for everything

187
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:09,599
in the world of sensual desire um not just for sex or not just for

188
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:17,339
alcohol or something but you know comfort and sensuality and uh in the Buddhist analysis of human

189
00:38:17,339 --> 00:38:23,579
beings this is one of the fundamental characteristics of human life is uh is a

190
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:29,099
sensual desire and um and uh sometimes the

191
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:34,740
acquisitiveness sometimes has very deep roots inside of us in the desire to

192
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:41,460
survive to manage in this life of ours so you know it's uh these things can have deep

193
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:48,000
roots in US but the there's a lot of dysfunctionality and sensual desire and

194
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,339
acquisite but this one of the things it does it um it kind of uh

195
00:38:55,339 --> 00:39:03,000
creates a very strong uh separation or shutting down or diminishment of our

196
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,640
full connection to others and to the world our connection to the world and to

197
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:17,000
others is through the lens of fulfilling that desire and some people will even confuse love

198
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:22,859
with a strong desire to fulfill it's not a strong desire to fulfill

199
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:31,500
their sensual wishes that person can provide me with that wonderful sensual possibility and and so

200
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:38,280
there's a strong kind of Drive that is you know fills our being fills

201
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,380
our heart the deep deep kind of Yearning and wanting and they can be confused

202
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:48,900
with love it can be seen as a Kind of Love but it happens to be that it's probably

203
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:54,300
more has to do with sensual desire than than what I think would be a heartfelt

204
00:39:54,300 --> 00:40:01,140
love and um so a lot of what a lot of mindfulness

205
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:08,460
practice has to do with or say differently of foundation foundational aspect of mindfulness practice is to

206
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:15,060
really become an expert really become attuned and skillful in recognizing the

207
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:22,320
hindrances and working with them so recognizing all the different flavors and colors and shapes of sensual desires

208
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:29,040
that arise all the time and not to reject sensual pleasure

209
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,160
which has a place in life it's maybe an important place in life at times

210
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,160
but it's the the drive the addiction the the way in which we get preoccupied and

211
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:48,560
kind of lose ourselves in this world of central desire that makes it a hindrance and so when we have strong

212
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:55,079
strong challenges in our life some people try to cope with it by getting

213
00:40:55,079 --> 00:41:03,599
something else escaping into a world of central desire uh or fantasizing about sensual desire

214
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:09,060
soothing themselves in a sensual way as a compensation for the challenge they're

215
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:15,359
in that could be useful at times but as a hindrance it's not useful and it's so

216
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:21,060
strong on the other end of what's healthy and functional

217
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:28,079
there are profound desires inside of us capacity for desire capacity if we're

218
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,359
wanting something that arises out of our our kind of heartfelt

219
00:41:33,359 --> 00:41:40,500
desire that opens us desires that open and connect us here to this moment rather than narrow us and

220
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:47,940
close us down one that kind of if anything frees us from addiction rather than submerges us

221
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:54,540
with addiction and we often don't get this message in Buddhism because of the strong idea that

222
00:41:54,540 --> 00:42:00,119
many people have that you're supposed to let go of all desire sometimes people even think that all

223
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:06,900
desire is wrong the Buddha did not say that there's certain kinds of desire which produce

224
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:12,900
suffering but they're also desired dharmic desires desires that connect to

225
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:21,000
the dharmic path the desire to be free the desire to be present compassion has desire and it care has a

226
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:26,880
desire and it's caring for someone and then so where does so when we're

227
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,940
challenged by life challenged by things to take the time to pause

228
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:39,720
having the faith that inside us deep inside there is a place of healthy

229
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,880
desire healthy wishes for for well-being for ourselves for

230
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:50,460
others for welfare and goodness

231
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:56,900
and to be present to be part of a healing process to be part of a

232
00:42:56,900 --> 00:43:03,180
transformational process towards for ourselves and the world to be a better place

233
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:08,940
and if we could take the time when we have big challenges to especially if we're caught in the

234
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:15,599
hindrances to see if we can shift gears take a deep breath try to find this

235
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:21,119
deeper place where we have these healthy desires and know that their place of healthy

236
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,819
desires no that's part of it now don't diminish ourselves or pretend it's not supposed to be there

237
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:36,060
but health is our desires are also the channel or the support for our personal

238
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:41,099
strength our our kind of a power of sorts even if

239
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:47,220
it's very gentle power uh there's a Kind of Wonderful strength in the gentleness of the desire and the

240
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:52,500
wanting and it can be the fuel or the catalyst

241
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:58,020
for Agency for engagement to know what to do

242
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:03,720
not assertively not selfishly not aggressively

243
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:09,960
but like water that just flows and flows around things and eventually wears all

244
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:17,579
kinds of things down we can have this give birth and give rise to and give expression to these

245
00:44:17,579 --> 00:44:23,940
healthy desires once we know what they are and we trust it and we know that it has

246
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:30,000
important place in our life in Buddhism we allow ourselves to have

247
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,000
dharmic desires until the dharmic desires no longer have a

248
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:42,900
role and then we can let go of them because they've done their job

249
00:44:42,900 --> 00:44:48,240
so um so you might consider this today spend

250
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,480
this day reflecting and feeling and maybe talking with friends about what

251
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,660
you know about the deepest desires you have that do not feel dysfunctional they

252
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:07,319
do not feel like they're hindrances or diminish you or frustrate you or or add

253
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:13,680
more problems to your life when we respond to challenges with hindrances we tend to create more

254
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:20,119
problems we when we respond to challenges by tapping into

255
00:45:20,119 --> 00:45:26,280
finding the healthy desires then we tend to be able to move towards

256
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:33,000
health and sometimes it takes it takes time to reflect and to think go for a walk or

257
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:38,040
spend time meditating or talking to a friend to

258
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:45,319
drop down below the layers of reactivity and hindrances and things that we have until we tap into

259
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:51,180
some of the deepest Wellsprings of Desire healthy desire within us

260
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:57,780
so what are your Healthy desires what is it that uh is it what desires

261
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:04,380
are valuable for you to stay close to especially when you have challenges that help you to help you go through a

262
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:11,480
challenge with um with um

263
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:19,560
without collapsing without being discouraged without succumbing to compensate the

264
00:46:19,560 --> 00:46:27,119
compensate compensatory uh kind of or escaping

265
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:33,540
