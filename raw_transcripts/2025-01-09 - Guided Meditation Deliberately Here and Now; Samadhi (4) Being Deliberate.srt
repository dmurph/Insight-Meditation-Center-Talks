1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,359
good morning or good day everyone

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:13,840
welcome and as we come here begin our

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:25,160
meditation one of the very valuable approaches to

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:31,960
meditation is to when you begin to do so deliberate

5
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:41,239
ately deliberately intentionally purposefully clearly this is what you're

6
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:48,399
doing it's invaluable to sit down to meditate and it's invaluable to sit down

7
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:55,760
to concentrate the Mind such a way that it enters into a degree of

8
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:03,000
somebody the Buddha said that to see things as they are in this

9
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:09,280
world cultivate somadi and to be able to see things as

10
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:18,280
they are in ourselves to be able to see things in the wider world it's as valuable to clear

11
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:23,960
the eyes in meditation as it is to get a good night's

12
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:32,399
sleep or to have the basic needs of food and and water cared

13
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:40,240
for so that there can be the subtleness and the clarity and the to be able to be

14
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:48,799
in this difficult World in a useful way so in the same way for somebody to

15
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:58,520
see things as they are and one of the ways to do this is um to be actually quite

16
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:05,960
deliberate that you are entering into a new situation if you're going to go to

17
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:13,120
sleep to do so deliberately just go to bed and people who are sometimes tempted to

18
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:18,920
bring with them their devices maybe have a hard time falling

19
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,239
asleep if you're going to clean yourself in the

20
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:31,840
shower don't do it casually and walk in with all your clothes do it deliberately and prepare

21
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,879
yourself and so when I started uh meditation regular meditation it was in

22
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:46,000
Zen tradition and every time we would sit down the practice was to bow to your

23
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,840
meditation seat and then to Bow away from the meditation seat which was

24
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,159
understood at least I understood it to be bowing to the whole world as we sat

25
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:03,360
down and and z and that I sat then we would sit facing a wall so in a sense you were

26
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:09,840
turning your back to the world and now but before doing so you would bow to the world you're not

27
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:16,879
abandoning it you're not leaving it behind and so this bowing made a clear

28
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:26,360
transition to really sit down into a new location New time this is what we're

29
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:33,200
doing if we go into meditation too casually we can bring along with us the thoughts

30
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,040
and concerns preoccupations of the day and uh and they kind of we're

31
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,400
swimming in those as we begin there's something very wonderful and clean and

32
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:51,239
appropriate that when we start doing some activities for example going into a

33
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:58,280
sacred Temple uh we're leaving behind for a few

34
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:05,879
minutes the The Ordinary World not to abandon it but to actually enter into

35
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:12,519
the world in a deeper way that we can if we still swimming in ordinary daily

36
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:20,519
preoccupations so we can see more clearly so that's the theme of this

37
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,240
meditation today the idea of starting the meditation

38
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:32,720
deliberately so to with a certain kind of purpose

39
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,680
purposefulness or deliberateness to care for your

40
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:46,479
meditation posture and you might sway

41
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:55,560
backwards and and forward side to side is a way of kind of

42
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:02,000
really feeling the center of gravity feeling the Pivot Point with your sitting

43
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,160
bones so you can find a way that if you're sitting upright that the weight

44
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:16,840
of the body is balanced aligned through the whole body

45
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,680
centered if you're lying down maybe there's a way of also

46
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:30,720
twisting or a little bit or adjusting the spine the shoulders

47
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,600
there's a way of having the shoulders roll back a little bit so they can the shoulder blades are

48
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,520
a little bit more tucked underneath the back allowing the chest to open and and

49
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:48,800
maybe the small uh straightening out of the

50
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,120
spine between the shoulder blades some people find laying down that

51
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:01,639
uh bringing their legs up up towards their bod so the knees are bent and

52
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:07,160
upright makes for more deliberate we have here I

53
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:15,039
am so the soles of the feet are you know flat on the

54
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,440
surface and then to close the eyes and spend a little bit more time

55
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:29,080
with the posture now from the inside out feeling is there any ways in which the

56
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:37,560
body want wants to be adjusted any ways that you've

57
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,680
overdoing a casualness or relaxation in the

58
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,160
body comforting yourself in a comfortable posture on a couch it's

59
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:57,120
possible to overdo that and it's possible to do it too

60
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,560
little and to adjust the posture so that it's an intentional

61
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:12,039
posture there's a sense that the whole posture is now is going to participate in the

62
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:18,440
meditation it isn't that you park your body in a comfortable position so you

63
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:23,759
can forget about the body and meditation is mostly

64
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:31,520
mental Samari is a full participation form of meditation

65
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:41,520
it has to be because it involves a unification of all of who we

66
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:50,919
are so a deliberate intentional way of having the

67
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:01,039
body generally it means to sit a little bit more upright

68
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:09,039
like if you heard a fascinating sound that you don't recognize

69
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,599
nearby some people would sit up straighten up to what is

70
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:24,479
that to not with tension not with fear maybe there can be an attitude of

71
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:32,080
delight in this intentional purposeful way of being here in the

72
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:42,240
body and this posture this purposeful inclusion of the

73
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:51,279
body provides a grounding in the present

74
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,680
moment in the present location

75
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:13,240
and then with the eyes closed almost as if it's a ritual of

76
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:20,680
beginning of putting aside The Wider World in whatever reasonable way that's

77
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:27,680
possible to be here for the purpose of meditating not

78
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:36,600
for the purpose of solving problem problems to take to assume to offer

79
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:45,320
yourself a few deeper breaths comfortably deeper Fuller

80
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,800
inhale and a longer exhale than usual

81
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,959
that's part of this deliberate coming to hear to meditate you could say to yourself as

82
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:13,399
you breathe in deeply

83
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:21,040
here and as you exhale a longer exhale

84
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:34,920
now letting those words invite you into here and

85
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:58,200
now and then letting your breathing return to normal maybe for some few more breaths

86
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:04,760
to use the words here and now but as you say

87
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:11,399
now for the exhale

88
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:19,440
gently without ambition relax your body

89
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:48,800
relax your body into

90
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:57,600
now so that it's a choice at least for a moment to

91
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,279
deliberately Orient yourself to

92
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:21,680
now and as you inhale

93
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:29,880
here deliberate orienting yourself to hear

94
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:35,720
maybe with the inhale also kind of settling into

95
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:03,839
here letting the words hear now maybe become quieter or fall

96
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,880
away but with the attitude behind those

97
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:17,680
words gently breathing in

98
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,389
here breathing out [Music]

99
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:33,240
now and as you breathe out to relax the thinking

100
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:38,839
mind Relax The Thinking

101
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
muscles

102
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:32,079
for for

103
00:15:28,279 --> 00:15:36,800
and then with a gentle relaxed

104
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:50,879
determination here as you breathe in can be a here just with this

105
00:15:53,000 --> 00:16:01,959
inhale now as you exhale just now with this

106
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:10,519
exhale not pushing anything away but letting

107
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:17,279
breathing the sensations the experience of breathing here and

108
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:24,240
now be at the center of all things

109
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,279
with a certainty maybe a provisional

110
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:49,720
certainty that breathing mindfully breathing with attention breathing just

111
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,160
breathing is invaluable

112
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:06,280
this is all you need to do so that you can

113
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,120
purposefully dedicating

114
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,038
L be centered on breathing in and breathing

115

be here and

now as if just fully here is the most important thing

134
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:55,360
and can you [Music] feel some healthy appropriate

135
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:03,520
difference between being just casually here or not really here

136
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:13,600
with drifting off in thoughts versus being here with a gentle

137
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:30,039
deliberateness maybe arising from deep inside a sense of intentionality

138
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:38,520
embodied intent to

139
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,440
inhabit Here and Now

140
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,000
and and as we come to the end of this

141
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:40,559
meditation is there a way of being

142
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:48,360
deliberately rooted Here and Now centered in your meditation

143
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:55,360
posture that provides its own important valuable way to turn your attention out

144
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:02,519
into the world to see things as they

145
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:09,760
are without losing a rootedness a centeredness

146
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,320
here gazing upon this suffering

147
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:24,200
World gazing upon this compassionate world of people

148
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:29,158
caring for each other suffering

149
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:40,720
gazing upon this world where people do feel fulfilled and feel Joy

150
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:49,559
too rooted here to gaze upon it

151
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:59,440
all and to wish well to gaze upon the

152
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:07,799
world and wish it well may all beings be

153
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:14,200
happy may all beings be

154
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:20,158
safe may all beings be

155
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,080
peaceful may all beings be free

156
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:38,519
and may all beings know that there are others who care for

157
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:42,679
them even from a great

158
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:54,159
distance let's not exclude anyone from the circle of our care

159
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:09,179
[Music]

160
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:14,158
thank

00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,919
you e

162
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,840
so hello and welcome to this fourth talk on

163
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:09,720
samadi and um as follows the this is still part of the in

164
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:16,320
introduction to this topic of samadi more will be revealed slowly as

165
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:23,120
we go along and so it began with the emphasis on

166
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,279
Discovery this is why mindfulness is invaluable is to really know oneself as

167
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:34,480
well as possible to know all the parts of oneself so

168
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:39,679
that when we when then the work of samadi begins all that begins to be

169
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:47,039
gathered together in a certain kind of way in which the inner life gets organized or

170
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:56,480
oriented and then to create the attentional space intentional context

171
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:02,600
for this Gathering together it's helpful to have

172
00:33:02,639 --> 00:33:07,760
a a form of attention to what's happening in the present that has a

173
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:13,600
lightness to it or openness to it or non straining non

174
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:19,440
forcefulness at the same time as not being casual or laxidasical

175
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:29,200
and then yesterday the emphasis that samade is um really a stepping away from

176
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,840
life as it's ordinary lived ORD ordinary concerns thoughts and activities and

177
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:42,000
even feelings not to push anything away but as deliberately stepping away

178
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:47,559
as uh you know as is going into the into

179
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:54,639
a shower to clean oneself or going to the bathroom or going to your bedroom to sleep at night or there's probably all

180
00:33:54,639 --> 00:34:01,279
kinds of activities where you go and you really put things aside maybe a nicer me

181
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:08,040
reference point for this was uh still very fond memories of visiting my son's

182
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:15,878
preschool and we could visit anytime we wanted to it was a very wonderful special place and um and somehow being

183
00:34:15,879 --> 00:34:23,599
there when all the all the children were napping and uh and so that's a time when

184
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:31,200
when you don't want to wake up a little preschool kid did um and uh so

185
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:37,280
entering into the space was to put aside everything else to just be there quietly

186
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:44,000
and it was a very clear way to be somehow now or in a different place so

187
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,440
somadi as being entering willing us to enter into kind of a different realm

188
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:56,599
almost and we'll talk more about this as we go along but the and then today I

189
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:03,040
want to make the emphasis said this uh that uh if the focus is going to be on

190
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,200
somadi uh it's really helpful it's as helpful when we do mindfulness but even

191
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:15,760
more uh Central to sit down and do so to meditate in a deliberate

192
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:21,760
way to be deliberate purposeful intentional like now this is what I'm

193
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:28,160
doing it's all too easy to bring with us uh uh the our life our consern our

194
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:33,880
preoccupation the habits the momentums of our mind and be a little bit too

195
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:39,800
casual laxidasical and just kind of sit down in a casual way or an habitual way

196
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:45,000
and and we sit down and we're just continuing to Roll Along in the how we

197
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:53,520
were thinking and how we're feeling from before and not to push anything away or deny any of it but um this this

198
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:59,079
deliberateness of now I'm going to do something different this is a time for

199
00:35:59,079 --> 00:36:05,520
this Sacred Space that now is a time for this uh to really be centered here and

200
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:11,040
if you feel like you're abandoning or the your world yourself you know

201
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:18,960
what's going on um to understand that the the purpose for samadi is not for

202
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:25,079
its own sake for the pleasures of samadi the purpose is in fact to be able

203
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:33,960
to see things clearly and and so it's a it's a approach to shift the

204
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:39,920
orientation of where the mind the concerns are

205
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,040
temporarily to create the the the conditions in the mind the heart the

206
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:51,000
body to be able to then later see the world more

207
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,240
clearly and um and so this is different than how sometimes mindfulness is taught

208
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:04,000
mind mindfulness is thought um that everything is practice everything is something to be mindful

209
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,560
of and um and there's not a turning away or deliberateness and saying now this is

210
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:14,800
the time to do just be centered in the breathing for

211
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:23,480
example uh it's uh uh samade is a kind of gathering inward to a particular kind

212
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:28,599
of focal point or center around which We Gather ourselves whereas mindfulness

213
00:37:28,599 --> 00:37:34,200
sometimes is thought as uh don't do that but rather stay completely open and just

214
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:40,640
know be aware of whatever arises in your experience this is also a very effective

215
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:45,720
way of practicing though sometimes it leads to

216
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,720
uh to just uh letting our mind Roll Along like it

217
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:57,560
usually does I've known people whose idea of mindfulness is letting things be

218
00:37:57,560 --> 00:38:04,720
just being aware of it to just let their thinking think what it wants to do and just kind of casually kind of just

219
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:10,880
follow along and um that's not really mindfulness if we're just kind of

220
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,720
letting you know the train of associated thought just kind of um think what it

221
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:24,440
wants to think um mindfulness is not stopping that but it's stepping away to

222
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:32,720
no longer participate in that to see it so clearly that some kind of participation and fueling of it stops

223
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:39,160
some part of our mind becomes quiet so so mindfulness is much more of

224
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:44,599
an open awareness usually samadi is more of a of a

225
00:38:44,599 --> 00:38:49,800
centered awareness where uh there it's a different

226
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:56,200
orientation and we'll talk more about this but these two don't have to be opposed they're actually can be partners

227
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,280
with each other and um and that's how I like to teach mindfulness is that it's

228
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,040
partnered with somadi but for now for this uh weeks we're focusing more on

229
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,280
just some by itself and the integration with mindfulness will come and so for

230
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,480
this purpose when it's somei to understand it's not letting uh the Mind

231
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:25,920
continue as it usually is it's really choosing to step into a different

232
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:32,880
approach a different way it's a deliberateness and it begins by uh how

233
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:40,119
in meditation you you enter into your meditation posture to think of that

234
00:39:40,119 --> 00:39:46,520
posture as almost like a ritual of deliberateness of purposefulness of now I'm going to do

235
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:51,640
this almost as if as a transition to go from one space to

236
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:58,640
another um and um and uh

237
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:04,839
uh you know there are playtimes in our world where we Mark the transition from one situation to

238
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:10,119
another and um sometimes in certain situations there's a minute of

239
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,880
Silence uh to prepare people for what's coming and

240
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:23,280
um so this deliberateness here I am and um

241
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:32,240
so uh so as you practice meditation you might experiment with for you uh what is a

242
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,119
good way to bring a quality of deliberateness purp

243
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:43,560
purposefulness intentionality to your meditation when you sit

244
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:50,560
down and to discover how to do that so it's not a strain it's not a stress it's

245
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:56,960
not uh uh an expectation that uh things now have to be different and you have to

246
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:03,200
kind of you know and your hold things at Bay but rather

247
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,560
a settling a a um

248
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:16,240
a a rootedness here and now now it's time to

249
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:22,760
do this now is not the time to compose shopping lists or not the time to review

250
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:29,000
the conversations from yesterday or um now this is the time to do

251
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:36,680
this and um so uh so part of

252
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:42,720
subma uh involves a Clarity of

253
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:49,640
purpose and the simplest way of saying that maybe is a Clarity that

254
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:56,800
now I'm going to Center myself root myself on uh something that's going to

255
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:03,880
be at the center of everything and so rather than I think

256
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:11,440
now there's a laser focus on something it's a centering on or settling on for example

257
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:19,280
the breathing and that's the reference point we'll use for this these weeks on samade some people it's another uh thing

258
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,760
they Center themselves it's a loving kindness and there's loving kindness is understood to be a Samar

259
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:31,119
practice some sometimes it's a mantra um so there's a variety of things

260
00:42:31,119 --> 00:42:38,640
but uh but for now it's breathing and this idea of centering yourself on the breath rather than focusing on the

261
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,960
breath um is offered as a way to appreciate that we're gathering together

262
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,680
we're not we're not creating a a separation with a mind that's

263
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:58,040
looking and zeroing in and focusing we're not um excluding things

264
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:05,040
uh we're not um but we're uh going into having something be at the center of all

265
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:12,680
things and at that Center we settle into it more and more we we we relax into it

266
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:19,040
we open into it we allow it to fill us and everything else either gathers

267
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:25,440
together to support that or it simply Falls away temporarily because it's not

268
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:35,400
really needed in this this uh centered way of um of living in the course of

269
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:42,040
meditation and this approach to living a deliberate life in how we are present

270
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:50,079
for things how we're rooted here and now uh you might want to experiment with that through your daily life as well uh

271
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:56,599
there might be all kinds of situations where uh you just end up doing it casually as you go through the day but

272
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:02,079
what would be like to do the things you do with a gentle clear deliberateness

273
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:07,359
now I'm doing this I'm giving myself centering myself on this if you're uh

274
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:12,680
washing dishes or filling the dishwasher to just Center yourself and do that

275
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:19,359
fully not casually cooking in the kitchen cleaning the house um walking

276
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:24,880
from your car car in a parking a lot to wherever you're going in store or work

277
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,920
or something is to do that in a deliberate way root it so

278
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:36,599
you're rooted here in the walking so uh what happens how's your

279
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:43,720
life differently if you at you insert an intentionality a purposefulness

280
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:49,680
deliberateness to really do what you're already doing but to really do it and

281
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,079
not to do it um you know as if it's

282
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:01,079
a not really what your life is about that moment what you're really about is

283
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:09,960
the proliferation of thoughts and concerns in the mind so may you live may you

284
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:15,599
benefit may you find a freedom in living

285
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,280
deliberately so thank you
