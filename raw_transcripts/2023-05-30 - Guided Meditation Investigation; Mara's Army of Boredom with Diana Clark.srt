1
00:00:00,539 --> 00:00:06,299
good morning or this those of you on this part of the

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:12,559
continent it's morning if you're on another continent it might not be morning

3
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:21,900
I'm happy to be here the second day and we're exploring the story of Mara

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,199
and Mara's armies and as usually happens in these 7 a.m's

5
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:32,000
we'll start with a guided meditation

6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,340
so taking a moment to settle in

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,059
breathing yourself sitting

8
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:06,379
I'm bringing attention to the posture let's begin there

9
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:19,080
if you're and a seated position just noticing if the spine has some

10
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,700
uprightness and some ease

11
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:37,380
noticing if the ears are over the shoulders sometimes it's helpful to push

12
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:43,140
the chin back just a tiny bit really small

13
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,540
may not even be noticed by somebody else observing you but

14
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:55,040
pushing the chin back not down but back

15
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,560
can open up the top of the spine the neck

16
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,680
in a way that really supports some uprightness

17
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,700
and ease

18
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:19,580
feeling into the sitting base

19
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:28,260
buttocks the legs the feet foreign

20
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:33,660
connected grounded

21
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,480
and then just bringing this aliveness of attention I like this expression aliveness of

22
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,739
attention into the body into the bodily experience

23
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:12,720
inhabiting the body alive to the way that it feels right now

24
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,099
including the posture but also more generally

25
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,640
and then noticing the experience of breathing

26
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:54,260
explore this experience or feel it on its own terms

27
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,819
is there a way that we can step towards

28
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,799
the experience of breathing

29
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:20,000
Getting to Know It without

30
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,040
The Experience needing to be different

31
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:31,819
we're just noticing how it is

32
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,020
can we bring some curiosity

33
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:54,960
to the experience of breathing as if you've never been with the

34
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,280
sensations of breathing before

35
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,479
Maybe in the same way that a naturalist

36
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:46,860
observes nature can we be a naturalist

37
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:53,880
to the experience of breathing we're not trying to figure it out or

38
00:05:53,880 --> 00:06:00,909
understand it we're just noticing [Music]

39
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,340
what does that feel

40
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:39,680
foreign

41
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:15,900
setting the Direction of our practice together as one of

42
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,120
kindness warmth

43
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:32,520
can we bring this quality of kindness in the manner in which we'll be paying

44
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:38,900
attention the way we're paying attention

45
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:49,919
can we imbue our attention with care

46
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,000
and warmth

47
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:52,800
and then when the mind wanders just very simply gently

48
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,019
with this warmth and kindness Begin Again

49
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:01,940
with the sensations of breathing

50
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:28,440
foreign and now

51
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:34,160
having studied a little bit settled a little bit

52
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,920
by resting the attention on the sensations of breathing

53
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:50,540
can open it up a little bit to other experiences that are compelling

54
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:02,160
sounds you know the sounds of airplanes

55
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,259
overhead or dogs barking nearby

56
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:15,140
someone who shares your household moving about

57
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:19,940
whatever it might be

58
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,279
just noticing no sound

59
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:41,040
and then can return to the anchor the sensations of breathing

60
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:45,440
in a relaxed easy manner

61
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,820
you don't have to pounce on other experiences we don't have to

62
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,380
jerk the Mind back

63
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:10,860
being mindful with kindness and warmth but not complacency or

64
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,420
just being casual

65
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,700
but being here with intention

66
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:38,040
maybe noticing that that sound is no longer compelling

67
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:44,820
but now perhaps there's a bodily sensation that's compelling

68
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:50,959
the pressure of the chair or cushion against the body perhaps

69
00:13:53,820 --> 00:13:57,380
just notice pressure

70
00:14:00,779 --> 00:14:05,839
and then begin again with the sensations of breathing

71
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:35,579
in this way we're open to The Human Experience

72
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:42,420
In This Moment bringing some curiosity

73
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:49,820
what does it feel like to be a human at this time at this moment

74
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,660
precisely now

75
00:14:55,680 --> 00:15:01,040
without thinking that things should be otherwise

76
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:07,339
instead having some curiosity

77
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:15,860
not trying to figure things out but just curious what is there to notice

78
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:29,279
so we stay with the sensations of breathing until

79
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:33,500
something else becomes compelling

80
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:39,440
can bring our attention to that

81
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,699
then when it's no longer compelling

82
00:15:47,459 --> 00:15:53,899
we return the sensations of breathing

83
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,820
foreign

84
00:19:16,679 --> 00:19:19,580
foreign

85
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,080
foreign

86
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:51,019
foreign

87
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,980
foreign

88
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,400
foreign

89
00:27:36,299 --> 00:27:39,200
foreign

90
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:32,220
in these last few minutes

91
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:41,279
what would it be like to bring some curiosity to the experience what's really

92
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:47,820
happening again not to figure it out or understand

93
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:52,759
it but to notice

94
00:28:55,740 --> 00:29:03,900
notice the texture of the moment notice they are rising and passing of

95
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:13,640
the experiences being present for what's happening

96
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:22,460
foreign

97
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:56,059
foreign

98
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:06,130
[Music]

99
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:49,140
again it's lovely to be practicing with you all

100
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:56,880
yeah so yesterday I introduced this idea of stories and some other role that they

101
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:02,340
play in our practice and certainly in our tradition and in our lives

102
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:10,399
and it turns out there are a few different stories about the Buddha's Awakening and one of those stories

103
00:32:10,399 --> 00:32:16,140
includes that as the Buddha to be was sitting underneath the Bodhi Tree having

104
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,240
this commitment that he's not going to move until he becomes a weekend that

105
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:27,840
Mara shows up and bringing his armies with him

106
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:35,279
so Mara if we might understand as representing or symbolizing that which

107
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:43,740
is obstructing or trying to prevent our movement towards Awakening or our

108
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:49,880
progress on the path towards greater freedom and peace

109
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:56,279
and so Mara as I said yesterday and I like to emphasize in this tradition Mara

110
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:04,380
is not a satanic figure it's the story of Mara versus the Buddha

111
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:12,860
is not a story of good versus evil instead it's a story of complacency

112
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:17,880
versus effort or complacency versus commitment

113
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,640
to practice and we have to be a little bit careful here because when we talk about effort

114
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:28,799
or commitment to practice there might be a tendency to think like we have to work

115
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:33,799
really hard and strive in some kind of way

116
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:40,740
but actually we we there certainly needs to be effort but too much efforting is

117
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:48,120
itself can be an obstruction to practice so part of the art of practice is knowing this right amount

118
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:54,240
so the story of Mara versus the Buddha is are we just

119
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:02,220
floating along in our life or are we engaged with it and and with

120
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:09,179
the teachings in our life in such a way that leads to Greater freedom leads to Greater peace leads to Greater

121
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:18,118
well-being leads to Awakening so part of this uh story is in modern

122
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:23,940
times of the arrow River Forest Hermitage in

123
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:31,520
Northern Ontario and Canada he's from the ajanta has written these kind of whimsical

124
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,618
stories of Mara kind of like fleshing out Mara as a character in a way that I

125
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:43,618
think it's delightful is a lot of fun so in these talks I'm just I'm

126
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:49,618
excerpting portions of this and gonna bring It Forward for us to explore and

127
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:56,339
enhance our practice so the setting is that this Mara

128
00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:01,680
character is in this you know Fantastical beautiful uh

129
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:08,099
Palace or Castle or something like this and he's dictating these letters to the

130
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:13,800
leaders of ten armies and these 10 armies are in the story

131
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:18,900
said two are the ones that assailed the Buddha and we might even understand that they

132
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:24,119
assail us today so here's the preamble to the letters

133
00:35:24,119 --> 00:35:30,000
and again I'm excerpting this so here's my rice we might even say

134
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:36,300
maybe in modern times he's emailing he's sending out a group email to the leaders of these armies

135
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:42,660
greetings to all my hard-working minions as you are well aware our overall

136
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:48,720
strategy seems to be working as smoothly as usual the vast multitude of beings

137
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,880
you wander in our little playground the great samsara

138
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:59,760
or by and large oblivious oblivious to the true nature of their predicament but

139
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,520
we must continue our unceasing efforts to maintain them in our power

140
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:12,180
so again Mara it's not that he wants people to experience pain and go to hell

141
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:17,760
or anything like that Mario just wants people to feel complacent and unaware

142
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:23,880
that greater Freedom Is Possible so it just wants to make them feel like

143
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:29,640
oh yeah this is good enough so then so that's the preamble to the

144
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:35,099
letters I accepted it but what I want to talk about today is that letter or email

145
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:42,000
that Mara is sending to the second Army I'm skipping over the first Army which

146
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,520
is sense desire but instead for this series in the in

147
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:54,599
these mornings I want to talk about those armies quote unquote that we don't talk about as much and so the second one

148
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:04,560
is boredom boredom as an army is a experience that

149
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,500
gets in the way of Greater Freedom so here's more here's Mara sending an email

150
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:16,520
to my second Army the host of boredom I extend greetings and congratulations

151
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:22,619
Your Role is to act in coordination with sensual desire the first Army we must

152
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:29,640
keep beings in a state of dissatisfaction with the present reality

153
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:35,579
what a scam we keep them craving always something exciting

154
00:37:35,579 --> 00:37:42,300
something new but the trick is to keep them from paying attention to the present moment

155
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:48,599
because once they're fully present here and now then they cannot be bored but

156
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:56,640
lately we've managed to foster a social climate that positively discourages calmness and

157
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:03,720
Clarity their whole modern culture is fast and frenzied and the last half half

158
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:09,420
century or so has seen many advances in our efforts to fracture the human

159
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:14,640
attention span television was a great help but I think

160
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:21,660
the single greatest advance in the Triumph of boredom was the invention of

161
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:27,420
the internet and all that and social media

162
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:34,680
we've succeeded so well in this department that being bored is now considered one of the greatest evils of

163
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:40,200
life but should they stray close to the true

164
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:47,720
escape which of course lies in the middle way then we must redouble our efforts

165
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:53,760
whisper in their ears tell them again and again these good old lies

166
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,079
this is really boring get out and enjoy life

167
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:07,320
so this is Mara right kind of telling uh these minions of his army to just make

168
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:13,980
sure that people are not satisfied and to whisper in their ears this is really

169
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:19,980
boring get out and enjoy life right we might have these ideas about

170
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,380
our meditation practice that it's somehow getting in the way of our

171
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:31,800
enjoying life or that the experience of meditating is boring

172
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:36,900
so I'll flush out just a little bit what is this experience to be bored

173
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:44,820
it's we might consider it as a state of aversion this way in which the input of the

174
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:50,220
senses whatever senses seeing or hearing or Sensations in the body or even

175
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:56,160
thoughts they're not providing this desired kick of pleasure

176
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,640
that we've grown to really crave that we've grown to think that this must

177
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:10,320
be what it means to be alive is to always be stimulated in some kind of way so we always are like seeking this new

178
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:15,660
and exciting stimuli and while we these days we carry these little smartphones

179
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:22,920
and in our pockets that make sure that we're never bored in fact we might even think that today's

180
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:29,099
society is built in such a way to ensure that we're never bored right we have these entire Industries

181
00:40:29,099 --> 00:40:36,180
those that develop apps and not to mention like the advertising agencies that are been created just to make sure

182
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:42,380
that we're not bored and instead we're always seeking this new stimuli

183
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:51,119
and not only that we've like become so accustomed to this idea of constantly doing something quote unquote whatever

184
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:58,320
that is exactly doing something you know maybe even if it's Doom scrolling on our smartphones like that's

185
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:05,099
better it seems than just to sit quietly

186
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:11,240
so there's a way in which not doing might make us feel a little bit uh

187
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:18,300
vulnerable or this way that makes us feel guilty

188
00:41:18,300 --> 00:41:26,220
because we've become so accustomed to this idea that we should be doing something that somehow our value or the

189
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:32,599
purpose of our existence is to be doing something

190
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:38,359
that's not true it's not true

191
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:43,920
is this just I kind of like this story of Mara right this creature that's like

192
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,740
oh yeah okay if we make beans uh really dislike being bored always seeking some

193
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:57,020
stimuli then they'll never find greater Freedom which is of course what Mara would like

194
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:03,720
so can we work with boredom or what do we do if we find ourselves to

195
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:10,980
connect this is boring well it turns out that of course

196
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:16,980
mindfulness is this great way to work with this experience of boredom

197
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:23,640
one how does boredom really feel

198
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:30,839
foreign what is the experience of boredom

199
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:36,720
is it this dullness well what does dullness feel

200
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:42,200
like not the ideas about it but what is the experience

201
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:50,400
because it come to find out the way to work with boredom is uh actually to

202
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,640
bring curiosity to the experience to bring investigation to the experience

203
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:03,480
whatever experience we're having that includes the experience of boredom

204
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:11,760
so can we just pay a little bit closer attention maybe like inhabit The Experience no

205
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,640
matter how subtle even if we feel like well nothing's

206
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:24,660
happening that's why I'm bored can we feel into the subtleness of maybe

207
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:32,760
that feeling of nothing's happening and maybe there's like this smart like little subtle contraction in the mind

208
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:38,640
I don't want to be doing this because one of the truths of life and

209
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:45,359
phenomena as all of us know is that everything is always changing

210
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:54,019
it's a rising and passing away it's inconstant it's imperf impermanent nothing stays the same

211
00:43:56,040 --> 00:44:03,420
so mindfulness is paying attention to what's happening as it's happening

212
00:44:03,420 --> 00:44:11,220
and just we haven't often trained ourselves to be accustomed to noticing this small and the subtle changes in our

213
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:16,800
experience because we're so used to like exciting stimuli

214
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,900
so that might take a little bit of patience to just recognize oh yeah can

215
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:27,660
we just be with exactly this moment

216
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:35,819
just this moment is it like how does it feel and the inside what is

217
00:44:35,819 --> 00:44:45,318
the breath what are my feet teaching it's the quality of the Mind state

218
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:52,319
and it turns out that with mindfulness practice is I'm sure many of you know

219
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:59,819
means that you will never be bored because there's always an opportunity to

220
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:06,960
be with the present moment and this is such a great way to increase our mindfulness capacity is it

221
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:14,160
we ever feel ourselves wanting to go towards that next uh stimulating thing that we think is going to be inside our

222
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:19,920
smartphones or on the other side of the computer screen

223
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,859
just bring some awareness to the experience to that Human Experience

224
00:45:25,859 --> 00:45:31,319
and just see if we can notice some of the subtle changes that are happening

225
00:45:31,319 --> 00:45:37,700
and then of course many of you know in the the stories of the Buddha include

226
00:45:37,700 --> 00:45:43,560
that Mara visiting the Buddha even after he was awakened and what does the Buddha

227
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:48,780
say to him he says I see you Mara

228
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:54,720
and then Mara disappears so in the same way

229
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,720
here's boredom I see you boredom and it feels like this

230
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:07,440
and that's the ending of boredom so thank you for your attention and I

231
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:15,380
look forward to exploring some of these other armies of Mara later this week thank you very much
