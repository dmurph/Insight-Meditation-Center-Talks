00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,399
self care self love self forgiveness just it's a blend of those it's a blend of

7
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:47,520
those it's really an invitation the theme tonight as an

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,160
invitation for examining how we often respond

9
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:01,760
to when we make mistakes and when mishaps happen and of course we're human it's error to

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,040
be human we say things that later we think ah hmm

11
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:13,360
that was not very skillful or we do things that um are

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,880
not helpful or or maybe even hurtful to ourselves or or to others in

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,360
intentionally inadvertently um and in those moments when we or when or

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,200
we even do things i don't know that later it seemed like they were not the best decisions in retrospect and so do

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,400
we kick ourselves do we berate ourselves oh you are

16
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:44,000
fill in the blanks stupid terrible mind mindless gosh do we berate ourselves how do we

17
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:49,119
treat ourselves in that moment oh you should have paid more attention you

18
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:55,360
should have could have should have like oh oh oh oh how do we treat ourselves in those

19
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:01,439
moments in these moments there may be plenty of them because again to er

20
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,479
is to be him with these timings not huge mistakes not but just tiny little

21
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,760
mistakes throughout the day or mishaps or or decisions that are not

22
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:20,720
ideal if we had spend more time etc so so how how do we how do we what is our

23
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:28,480
the way that we hold ourselves what if what if in that moment because we've already you know been hurt say by

24
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,360
our decision or our lack of attention or lack of awareness or or whatever it might be we've already been hurt right

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,040
it wasn't an optimal decision like oh what if we say oh sweetheart sweetheart

26
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,160
oh i'm so sorry well this is hard for you i know this is hard it's okay

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,599
it's okay sweetie this is hard yeah this is it's okay it's okay i still love you

28
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,840
i i accept you it's okay and it's all right let's

29
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:03,120
let's learn from it let's move on and i forgive you it's okay it happens it's

30
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:10,959
earth it's it's human to earth to er is human it's really okay

31
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:18,720
do we extend that acceptance that love that sense of forgiveness

32
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:25,760
to ourselves and in the guided meditation i will invite you to try the different perspectives on

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,280
and see how they feel physically in the body how do they feel in the body in the mind

34
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:38,799
and see for yourself which one is more conducive um

35
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,840
to to actually both recovery and also learning and also

36
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:51,599
um maybe more mindful behavior later there are some research results also um well maybe

37
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,280
i'll share the research results as i'm sharing uh as i'm sending the space right now

38
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,519
but there is there is a couple of very interesting studies one is um

39
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,879
that for people who actually have um who have made

40
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,439
some kind of mistake or maybe transgression in this study was a moral transgression that they tested

41
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,120
if they um if they were primed towards

42
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:28,639
self-compassion towards care for themselves they actually took more responsibility

43
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:38,160
instead of taking less responsibility because there was a sense of oh yes it's okay i it's just it was a mistake was it

44
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,160
um but i'm not wholly bad it was not the sense of throwing the baby out with a

45
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,720
bat or bath water it's the sense of it's okay i made a mistake and learning

46
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,840
from it instead of if you don't have that cushion of

47
00:04:55,840 --> 00:05:02,000
self-compassion then there might be pointing the finger to

48
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,320
others oh it's their fault that's why this happened right because there's no kindness towards oneself when there's

49
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:16,160
kindness compassion towards you you can accept that yeah you screwed up it wasn't optimal and it's it's okay it's

50
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,680
really okay there's that cushion to take responsibility

51
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,320
whereas when there isn't that cushion when there is the harshness of you should have done better you idiot

52
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,919
then then somewhere deep down inside that we don't want to take responsibility because if

53
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,680
we do then we're bad we're awful there's no recovery right so then people point

54
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,800
fingers to others oh it's their fault it's they dated their you know right

55
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,000
yeah et cetera whereas actually kindness to oneself

56
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:57,520
um allows one to to uh take responsibility so so

57
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:05,039
um and one last thing i would say is that as you know compassion towards oneself

58
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,479
and towards others it's not it's not just the sense of care and

59
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:17,360
warmth and and um uh softness gentleness it it does have

60
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,919
those aspects to it but also there's an uprightness there's a sense of power there's a sense of

61
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,440
goodness there's a sense of fierceness yes yes there was a mistake and it's

62
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,199
okay it actually makes you feel stronger in your

63
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:40,720
morality in your intentionality so it has the both softness the gentleness

64
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:49,440
as well as the sense of uprightness and the the energetic uh fierceness in it so it'll hopefully

65
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,960
all become more clear as we practice together all right i've said plenty to set the stage

66
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:04,400
so let's begin let's begin let's begin as i like to invite you

67
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:07,840

with a smile as if it's a beloved puppy that has

111
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,759
wondered

112
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,279
about our beloved child you won't beat them up it's okay

113
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:29,199

in the body

119
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:37,760
can awareness be imbued with appreciation for this breath in this

120
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,760
moment

121
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:52,279
the breath being known in the abdomen

122
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:01,679
a kindness with a smile greeted with a smile

123
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,720
inner smile

124
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:25,840
now i'd like to invite you if you want

125
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,440
if it feels okay

126
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:40,640
to gently bring to mind maybe something

127
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,600
that recently

128
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:50,320
you considered a mistake

129
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,069
something you did or said [Music]

130
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:08,080
that later you wish you had done differently you regret it you were upset you were

131
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:11,080
disappointed

132
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:24,400
be very gentle as you call this into your heart not into your head so much we don't want so much of a

133
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:31,480
story bringing the memory back

134
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:38,720
maybe a misstep oh stepped off the curve

135
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:46,240
twisted your ankle oh i wish i had looked or had been able to look more carefully

136
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:50,120
whatever it might be

137
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:04,080
see in your body what the habitual response might feel like

138
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:09,679
just to just to explore what does it feel like to have

139
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:14,720
the habitual response you tend to have of course we're bringing compassion in

140
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,400
the moment to compare but for now

141
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,799
is it disappointment sadness anger

142
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:34,080
whatever it might be how does it feel or maybe it's too hard to bring it up

143
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:41,200
and so don't don't try too hard it's okay it's all right see what's available

144
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:51,158
just recognizing just tiny bit of it is okay the tinge of that reaction reactivity

145
00:22:55,039 --> 00:23:01,279
or i wish it hadn't happened or how could you whatever it might be

146
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:10,159
and notice how tight that might feel sense of tightness contraction

147
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:16,080
physically that that brings perhaps in your heart center

148
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:19,120
center of your chest

149
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:29,039
maybe in your belly too maybe in your jaw maybe in your shoulders

150
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:38,960
and see where you feel it forehead maybe see where is the contraction for you

151
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,519
around the i could have would have

152
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:53,279
just to feel it i know it doesn't feel good so we won't linger here too long

153
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:57,559
just to get a sense comparison

154
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:13,278
and now opening opening the heart wide as if

155
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:21,520
there are these worn arms that are embracing you holding you

156
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:28,399
lovingly acceptingly compassionately sweetheart it's okay

157
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,400
ah maybe putting

158
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:40,320
a balm in your heart center or wherever there's a contraction the balm of

159
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:46,320
acceptance of recognition of forgiveness it's okay sweetie

160

family just like anybody else

171

it's okay letting yourself feel held

176
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:50,559
acceptance with forgiveness and if you need if you'd feel supportive

177

actually to put a hand in the middle of your chest as if you were putting this ball

178
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:01,930
[Music] was this this arm putting this hand putting balm

179

[Music] soothing accepting compassionate balm in your heart center please try that see

180
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:15,039
what that feels like experiment with it for a moment can be powerful

181
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:20,440
self-touch can be quite powerful

182
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:35,840
give it a try even if you've tried it before see what it's like in this moment

183
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,919
it's okay

184
00:27:54,320 --> 00:28:00,640
you did your best you did your best in that moment

185
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:08,799
you've done your best if you could have done any differently any better you would have of

186
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:15,520
course you would have of course you would have there's no doubt you would have

187
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:20,559
given all the causes and conditions in that moment

188
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,520
internally externally so many different

189
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:35,200
the things and conditions gave rise

190
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,440
to it happening the way it did

191
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:47,039
if you could have done differently you would have

192
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:53,919
so trust trust and forgive

193
00:28:53,919 --> 00:29:00,720
yourself and the causes and conditions that came together

194
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,440
forgive those two and the part that you played it wasn't

195
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:18,240
just alone you [Music] there's other things too

196
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,279
so recognize those recognized

197
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,039
the causes and conditions

198
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,000
forgiving them forgiving yourself

199
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:59,679
holding yourself with care with love you're already hurting

200
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:08,000
you've already been hurt not kicking or hitting

201
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:13,360
yourself as if it beloved a child or a little

202
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,720
puppy it's okay

203
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,240
you've done your best

204
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:30,720
letting go of the contraction

205
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:42,399
releasing there is no use there is no use

206
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:46,000
to feeling contracted

207
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:55,279
especially if there is shame or challenging emotions no use we can have

208
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:00,480
remorse learn

209
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,399
from what went wrong in

210
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:14,679
a sphere of compassion this fear of care

211
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,200
just holding yourself with care with kindness

212
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:45,360
you are both mother and the child there's the sense of power uprightness

213
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,960
forgiveness courage grace

214
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:59,480
that you can extend to yourself both give and receive

215
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,799
both the mother and the child sense of

216
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:13,679
energy fierceness uprightness powerful love

217
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:20,840
that holds the hurt and holds the tenderness

218
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:10,840
it's okay sweetheart it's okay

219
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:01,960
and as we move closer to the end of this sit together

220
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:10,480
releasing letting go or whatever rose or did not arise

221
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:17,760
letting there be a sense of appreciation we showed up we did our best

222
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:25,680
so many causes and conditions can we forgive can we hold with care with love

223
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:31,838
this being who is us doing their best

224
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:40,000
we could do any better could have done better we would have it's all okay

225
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,079
appreciating appreciating ourselves and all

226
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:51,839
who are practicing with us in community appreciating them

227
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:55,160
their goodness

228
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:10,160
and this way creating wholesome karma if we bring love care

229
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:16,640
forgiveness to what might have been challenging or

230
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,560
difficult or unskillful at least we're planting

231
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,240
wholesome seeds kindness forgiveness wisdom

232
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:33,760
instead of more anger aversion disappointment

233
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:39,680
self-flagellation and sharing this goodness

234
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:46,400
sharing this goodness with generosity with all beings everywhere

235
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:53,680
may all beings everywhere all us beings all us humans who make

236
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:59,760
mistakes may all of us

237
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:06,000
be happy be healthy [Music] be safe

238
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:12,119
may all of us have ease may all of us be free

239
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,800
thanks everyone thank you for your practice

240
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:41,520
so we have a few minutes for reflections

241
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:48,079
what you might have discovered what came up and you're invited to share

242
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:54,400
whatever you would like to share for the benefit of others for the benefit of sangha

243
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,400
um offering a gift your offering gift through your reflections

244
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,760
your questions maybe what went wrong what didn't work it's all okay

245
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,839
and you can [Music] raise your zoom hand if it's your physical hand i will not see because

246
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:19,200
there are multiple pages on my zoom and and uh you can type them in chat

247
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,880
um charles lee says thanks thank you charlie thanks for your practice

248
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,720
you can type them to everyone in which case i'll read your name or just to me privately

249
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:37,440
um in which case i won't read your name it'll be private so

250
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:46,280
so gifts from the sangha discoveries

251
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:57,520
did you notice a shift what was it like at the beginning with the habitual way that you

252
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:03,920
respond to the mistake um versus when you brought in the

253
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:10,400
embracing hugging arms and the balm did you notice the difference

254
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,640
what happened

255
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:28,560
and holding space of silence is perfectly fine in this community we know that

256
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:32,599
so it's all good

257
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:50,480
i'll share something with you as i wait not wait but as i hold space for any

258
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:56,800
reflections that might come up from you um for me as i was doing this practice yes

259
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:04,319
there's definitely it's so interesting just a little bit of contraction and for me it's more in the heart center like oh

260
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:10,960
i wish that didn't happen and then oh sweetheart it's okay it's okay and then there's a sense of

261
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,079
strength and uprightness really is as i lead you guys of course i'm i'm in

262
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:22,400
that space with you i mean that space with you elaine says i appreciated taking the

263
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:29,040
time to be gentle and have deep forgiveness with myself thank you lilly and jamie i do see your name for your

invitation to both give and receive a mother's love

266
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:45,920

267
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,920

as a human being as a cis man as the father beautiful

274
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:34,319
sarah says i like that notion that the more self-compassionate we have for

275
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:39,920
ourselves the less we need to blame others yes yes isn't that great

276
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,200
isn't that wonderful and see it for yourself just the study is pretty cool

277
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:51,200
and and i wondered if that came up for you experientially also in this practice

278
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:58,400
like oh it was their fault they should have done it this way or that way maybe like oh well it's okay it's all right

279
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:05,760
right it's okay i didn't see or something like that so

280
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:11,200
yeah pretty cool so [Music]

281
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,760
how about we turn into practicing

282
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:23,280
in community in small groups of three on zoom and

283
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:28,480
holding each other with compassion with with care

284
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:35,680
um and as always we only speak from our own

285
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,839
experience or you can be silent you don't have to say anything you can hold space when it times your turn you can

286
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:48,000
say pass and be present it's perfectly fine and

287
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,440
you're invited if you like to share what came up for you what did you discover and even if you fell asleep or

288
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:02,000
distracted that's okay too no problem that that's what you can practice with in the moment well usually

289
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,920
i would beat myself up because i fell asleep but no it's okay sweetie you didn't get a lot of sleep last night

290
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:14,800
right can you practice in real time with these instructions with these invitations

291
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:20,800
and so in small groups the invitation is

292
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,880
one person will share one nugget of their experience and then the next person and then the next person and

293
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:32,560
they'll come back to you and then we'll go around and round until they're the time is up

294
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:38,240
and and again please only share from your own experience

295
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:43,440
authentically as much or as little as you like to share silence is fine and

296
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,960
not managing directing probing others let let them have their

297
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:54,800
own experience just holding space this is part of the practice holding compassionate space

298
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:03,119
for all of us humans we're doing the best we can doing the best we can so

299
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,400
so with that i'd like to create the rooms the breakout rooms which i haven't

300
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:15,440
yet created here we go and um [Music]

301
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:22,800
let's see if there are any invitations that i usually give which i forgot and i think i think that's it so so here we go

302
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,839
i'm going to open their rooms be kind to yourself be kind to each

303
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:32,880
other what a fantastic way to practice

304
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:37,000
in sangha here we go

305
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,079
okay the rooms are closed welcome back everyone

306
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:53,280
and we have just about a couple minutes if there are any reflections questions comments um

307
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:01,280
after having practiced in in small groups so katrin please

308
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:07,760
um i was really grateful for this practice it's very very apropos for me um

309
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:12,800
i've had this question and maybe you can't speak to it in this short amount of time but it really

310
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:19,200
troubles me which is like the thing if we could do if we could have done something different than

311
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,720
we would have and but like how does that work in the present moment when we are

312
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:30,160
trying to make a decision it's not a philosophical question because it's really like

313
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,839
how do i make a decision if if that is the case i feel responsible

314
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:41,520
but but then it couldn't have happened any other way yeah yeah part of a greater issue of

315
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,560
decision making for me but oh oh it is yeah yeah i appreciate yeah it is it is

316
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,599
um given the 30 seconds left i'll try to do it justice here he goes a big

317
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,440
philosophical question think of it this way or feel into it this way

318
00:45:57,440 --> 00:46:04,119
that you know there are a lot of causes and conditions there are external internal and think of it as

319
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:10,640
probabilistic right because really the question you're asking me brings in the question of freeville free will do we

320
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:16,640
have free will or do we not have free will like if i can't do any different like why am i uh but i do feel like i i

321
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,839
have intentionality i want to have intentionality so all of those really

322
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:28,000
come together um it's it's really the weight of and the idea of

323
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:33,680
karma is it's not deterministic karma isn't deterministic or causes and conditions aren't deterministic it's

324
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:41,680
just that the problem the probability is kind of stacked this way right it's stacked this way but if you

325
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,280
really work hard and you know you just you can shift and change it but it's if it's

326
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:52,800
really stacked in a particular way like oh yeah that's the way it would have gone it would be really hard to change

327
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:58,400
it in that one but it doesn't mean that i can't keep trying and shifting and

328
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:04,319
setting the intention so that it becomes more likely so in the example that i gave with you know stop stepping off the

329
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:10,160
curve and getting it you know uh sprained ankle like oh yeah you know

330
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:15,520
maybe you know glasses were up from wearing a mask it's like all these causes and can be like

331
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:21,920
oh yeah okay and yet and yet i know i can change the karma like okay

332
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:28,319
now i know wearing the mask like this is what happens like i will change it i can but in that moment that's the best that

333
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:35,119
could have happened because this is just a simple so so there is free will in well anyway

334
00:47:35,119 --> 00:47:40,319
that's a bigger question i don't want to say that but anyway i'm just uh does that help

335
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:46,480
hold both of those uh for you both the past and then present

336
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:54,000
yeah and it's a yeah and it's a forgiving perspective that's like um that's evolutionary it's like oh yeah

337
00:47:54,000 --> 00:47:59,440
like things change like yeah it makes me think of life as that you

338
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:06,559
know sort of a practice and an experiment versus like a constant test of getting things right right hey i

339
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:11,760
appreciate that beautiful i appreciate you putting it there exactly it's just

340
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:19,440
just always yeah with kindness forgiveness we're going to keep trying keep intending turning turning keep turning

341
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:25,839
advertising changing the the stream keeps trying to change the stream and yet when it's there's so many forces

342
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:32,800
it's okay it's okay sweetheart so yay what a rich hour thank you all for your

343
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:38,640
practice thank you for your practice hanging in here thank you all beautiful

344
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:44,960
dedicating the merit may all beings be well may all beings be forgiving may all

345
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:52,559
beings be free [Music]

346
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:58,920
