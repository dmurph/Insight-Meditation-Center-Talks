3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,119

a regular high pr participant yay welcome lovely to be with you and

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:31,199
and practice together in this moment in time so for our practice this

6
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:39,120
in this moment in time whatever time zone you're in i'd like to um

7
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,920
build on a practice we did on wednesday and if you think oh wait i wasn't here on

8
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,120
wednesday don't worry everything you need i'll share with you no problem

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:58,800
and also to say this practice we've done before in other ways i just want to

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,840
relate to it in a different way so let me set the context as i always do in a

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,200
few minutes and then start the guided meditation so

12
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,640
so the practice i'd like to invite us to ex to a and to explore

13
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,159
is a merging a combination of

14
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,560
compassion karuna the second brahmavihara the second

15
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:33,200
heavenly abode together with mindfulness of the breath

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:41,600
also known as anapanna sati if that term makes sense to you so

17
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,600
mindfulness of the breath and compassion combined

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:54,399
and the reason why i'm saying it's building up on what we did on wednesday because wednesday

19
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,399
for those of you who might remember we explored meta loving kindness

20
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:07,840
and the breath just the sense of the breath being very easeful the the mindfulness of the

21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,319
breath the breath being infused with kindness with ease

22
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,840
as if you were petting a kitty and it would start

23
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:26,319
purring in the sense of calm and ease and many of you observed about that oh yeah

24
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:33,760
what a lovely combination of these two practices meta loving kindness in fact for ourselves for our

25
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,000
bodies that's what we did on wednesday together with the breath so

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,319
so related to that today we'll explore compassion practice compassion

27
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,920
when meta when kindness means suffering when

28
00:02:53,920 --> 00:03:00,159
challenge when challenges are held by love kindness care

29
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,239
and combining that together with the breath right

30
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:13,760
so and today what we'll do is we'll we can start with ourselves and then we'll turn

31
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,840
it outwards we'll turn it outwards

32
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:25,760
to both have a sense of nourishment of compassion for this being who's ourselves

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,640
as well as turning it outwards compassion for the world as we breathe in and out especially because right now

34
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:41,120
there's a lot of turmoil in our world and there are many beings who are suffering right now and in a war

35
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:49,680
zone so not to turn ourselves away or gaze away but to sit with to make space

36
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,360
with compassion with care and stability stability not to fall into it not to

37
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,840
fall into grief and despair but to hold to witness hold presence

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:09,120
with compassion with love with care for what is happening in our world

39
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:17,600
okay the last word i'm going to say about framing the practice tonight is

40
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,840
compassion practice plus

41
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:29,840
mindfulness of the breath is also what we have explored before

42
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:38,720
in light of some of you might remember tonglen the practice of tonglen

43
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,160
and yes in the later schools of buddhism not so

44
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,800
much in theravada but in later schools especially in tibetan it's a primary

45
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,919
practice and and we've practiced that before compassion and the breath it's a

46
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:03,440
beautiful practice many of you have shared that it's been nourishing to you so this is another way to enter into the

47
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,479
same practice i didn't mention tonglen at the beginning i mentioned at the end so that you think

48
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:17,520
you're you realize oh there are other ways to get into this practice on a panasonic mindfulness of the breath

49
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,720
plus compassion all right enough theory let go of theory

50
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,759
okay i've set the frame we can let it all go ah

51
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,360
let go of the thinking mind so now i'd like to invite you to

52
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,880
sit enter enter the sacred space of practice

53
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,199
together letting go of thoughts letting go of words if you need to move and

54
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:53,840
shift so that you are comfortable

55
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,478
whether you're sitting in a chair on a cushion

56
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:04,360
whether you're lying in the bed it's all okay

57
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:16,960
and arriving first and foremost we always arrive in the body letting go of

58
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,560

59
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:30,319

72

74
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:18,399

more kindness is breathed into the body

77

79
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:09,519
maybe with each in-breath we become more become aware of

80
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:19,240
the body if there are any challenges pain or tightness and with the out-breath

00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:19,760
expanding our blanket

169
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,559
as we have stability and care for ourselves

170
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,840

175
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,919
heart center to this magnificent

this heart center is not ours it is ours and not ours it's bigger than

181
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:51,840
ours greater than who we imagine ourselves to be

182

greater humanity access

183
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:11,600
to this amazing possibility of universal compassion

184
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:20,000

raise your hand richard

272
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:50,160
can you hear me yes okay well i i found myself sort of breathing

273
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:57,040
in the pain of from my loves and passions from my youth you

274
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,599
know and sort of the unfit finished element of those experiences and

275
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:10,480
and what i found you know and i tried to just breathe out vanilla compassion but what i what

276
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:16,240
finally finally worked for me was you know bringing out the gratitude you know

277
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:23,520
grateful that i had these experiences and that um you know not everyone does and um

278
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:28,880
and they were very you know deep-ending and transformative at the time

279
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:35,200
beautiful beautiful thank you for for sharing that richard and there's so many different

280

flavors of the brahmavihara right the heavenly abode it doesn't always go

281
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:46,880
where we want it to kind of go it's like yeah meta shape shifts sometimes to compassion sometimes your gratitude

282
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:53,359
sometimes to equanimity sometimes to joy so what you're actually describing is it's shape-shifting

283
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:58,400
to um to joy to vicarious joy for yourselves

284
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:05,440
