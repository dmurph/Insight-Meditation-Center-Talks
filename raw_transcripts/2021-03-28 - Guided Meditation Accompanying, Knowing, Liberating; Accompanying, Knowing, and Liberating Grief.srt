1
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:13,240
warm greetings to everyone and Welcome to our meditation session

2
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,640
together and there are many ways of talking about mindfulness

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,240
meditation one way is to see that it has three component parts or three aspects

4
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:32,119
to it they can be done SE separately each or they can be done Al together in

5
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:40,480
whatever combination and sequence but the first uh is to

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,559
accompany to really accompany our experience to attend with our experience

7
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:53,280
to be a companion to our experience it's a little bit different

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,079
than being our experience um and but to company and to

9
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:07,759
be accompanied by our experience the second is to know our

10
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:13,920
experience uh and to be known by our experience to be known to know our

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,560
experience to really let it register be fully acknowledged be really really

12
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,840
known and really known doesn't necessarily mean only in some conceptual

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,119
way but really known in some real clear way this is here this is what what's

14
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:37,200
happening there's an intimacy and the third is

15
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,960
liberating liberating our experience and um we could say

16
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,200
liberating ourselves but I think it's more kind of to the heart of the issue

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:57,320
really the heart of what really happens is we're we're liberating our experience so that all our experiences

18
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,640
are not entangled with self and desires and preoccupation and resistance and

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:11,120
running away and burying to liberate our

20
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:19,280
experience so to accompany to know and to liberate and um so in that way we'll sit

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:27,440
today and one of those three might be just the right one for you they each have their their time and place and each

22
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,720
of them feel just right um can feel just

23
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:39,760
right so to begin by assuming

24
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,400
a meditation posture that's appropriate for you with some care that that's it's

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,519
in a a posture that supports you to be

26
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,879
alert to be clear and present

27
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:06,159
a [Music] posture that supports you to

28
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,400
accompany your present moment

29
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,799
experience gently closing your

30
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:25,720
eyes and if you are going to accompany your experience What's Happening Here in

31
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:32,920
the present moment for you not the reason why you're experiencing ing what's here not your predictions of

32
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:40,760
what's going to happen but just the experience in and of itself with no need for it to have a

33
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:46,640
past or a future just to be present together with

34
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,680
what's here what would you be present

35
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:06,920
for and to ACC compy part of the richness of that word is that it's a

36
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,120
noninterfering attending to what's happening

37
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:22,320
it's it's a non-judgmental way of being with what is we're just here to be with

38
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,320
it

39
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:40,320
and then you might take a few long slow deep breaths right in the middle of how you

40
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,600
are as if you're massaging how you

41
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:57,440
are really meeting how you are

42
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:09,440
and as you exhale to relax your

43
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,840
body to relax around how you

44
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:30,039
are and letting your breathing return to normal and still as you exhale

45
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:34,919
just look around the body and see where can you

46
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,960
relax can be particularly useful to relax the

47
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:49,280
belly over and over again how much do we

48
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:56,360
hold against life resist life keep from feeling what we're

49
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:01,319
feeling by tightening the belly

50
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:09,240
relax the belly and maybe there's more to a

51
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:19,400
company more that we can be a companion to feel

52
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,400
softening in the shoulders relaxing the

53
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,000
shoulders and relaxing and softening the face

54
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:06,400
sometimes the muscles of the face can be tired from all the Expressions that we're holding

55
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,599
there and letting the face

56
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,280
rest and then dropping deeper into your

57
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:28,960
breathing to accompany your breathing

58
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:42,560
perhaps relaxing around your

59
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:02,319
breathing and then knowing your

60
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:09,879
breathing let it be a deeper maybe even silent knowing

61
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:15,840
recognition registering that you're

62
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,400
breathing an intimacy with breathing

63
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:47,839
and then liberating your breathing from judgments ideas of how it should be

64
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,080
or shouldn't be or wanting it different

65
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:01,720
and ideas that is not quite right that you liberating how your body is

66
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,319
breathing so you it can just be

67
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:17,160
itself and as we sit here there might be other experiences that come come that

68
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:24,160
become predominant and then you might see if you can practice mindfulness by

69
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:31,959
[Music] accompanying what's happening knowing what's

70
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,440
happening and liberating what's

71
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
happening

72
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

73
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

74
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240

e for

83
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:10,240
letting go of thoughts and thinking so you can be a better

84
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:17,680
accompanier of your experience so there's more attention

85
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:24,680
available awareness available for

86
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,920
breathing for your present moment experience

for e

109
00:31:02,399 --> 00:31:10,840
and then as we come to the end of this sitting these three parts of mindfulness

110
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:15,399
accompanying knowing

111
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,039
liberating is something we can offer to other

112
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:29,880
people from kindness we can accompany others

113
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:37,639
with love we can know others and with generosity we can

114
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:45,360
liberate others to accompany people others in

115
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,679
their lives is a is always a

116
00:31:50,679 --> 00:31:57,120
gift to really know someone else not necessarily their history or

117
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:05,399
everything about them them but to really when we're with them to know them

118
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:12,840
then and there to really be attuned to who they

119
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:20,320
what's happening how they're feeling and to liberate

120
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:28,240
others we can't get them to liberate themselves but we can liberate them from

121
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:33,679
our judgments our criticisms our

122
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,398
attachments even our needs and

123
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:47,200
expectations to accompany to know and to

124
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:52,440
liberate are a way

125
00:32:54,279 --> 00:33:03,200
to act on the wish may all beings be

126
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:09,638
happy may all beings be

127
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:19,320
peaceful may all beings be

128
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:27,518
safe may all beings be free

129
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:34,360
and may it be that the goodness benefits of this meditation

130
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:42,440
session supports us to contribute to this being possible for this world of

131
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:51,320
ours may may we support the happiness and well-being of all

132
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:58,120
beings may all beings be free

133
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:14,949
[Music]

134
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:30,720
for e

135
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,640
the topic for this uh talk

136
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,760
is grief and maybe the talk can be titled

137
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:39,680
liberating grief and what motivates this talk is in

138
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:46,240
big part is that the one-year anniversary of many of us going into

139
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,720
Sheltering in place and the dramatic way in which our whole world

140
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,920
has much of the world as 99% of it has been turned upside down down or inside

141
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:07,000
out or radically Changed by the pandemic and in marking this one-year

142
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,680
anniversary uh it feels important to acknowledge and make room for and bring

143
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,480
forth the grief that has been part of this

144
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:26,480
year and that um grief is not something that should be shied away from or be

145
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:34,440
embarrassed about but is actually a very important part of human beings and our human life and and

146
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:42,640
it should be acknowledged it should be understood and seen and um and what's uh significant I

147
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:48,800
think for many of us recognizes that the griefs of uh the last year have been

148
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:56,160
wide ranging I mean certainly there are some of them are huge I mean uh many

149
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,800
around the world millions of people have died in the United States well over 500,000 people have died directly from

150
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:10,119
the disease and the illness and then there's been many who have been seriously sick and uh some

151
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:16,680
with with the long-termers like Long Haul people people who there symptoms that continue for months and months and

152
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:21,920
maybe it'll be for years and so there's a grief of the loss

153
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:28,640
of so many things loss of people loss of family members friends from death than

154
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:35,520
sickness and then there's the grief of just loss of connections of people we've been regularly connected to are

155
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:40,920
Sheltering and place themselves and there's not much communication

156
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,880
and um the grief of not being social in the same way we were

157
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:53,560
before there's all these small griefs that goes along uh that uh we experience

158
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:59,440
of all the things we can't do that we're used to doing and that we value you doing and all the small ways in which

159
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:07,040
we've gotten energized and inspired about life and ready to go out and do it are not available and some people find

160
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:12,680
there's a slow slow steady attrition of energy of inspiration of motivation

161
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,160
partly from uh the slow kind of Drip by dripping of little griefs and sorrows

162
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:24,040
and sadness as that go on and then there's uh the things that

163
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:29,640
happen in our society the challenges the grief Bel the sorrow the sadness about

164
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:37,560
politics and about racial Injustice and economic Injustice and and um um

165
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:46,400
nowadays you know we were aware of medical Injustice and environmental Injustice and um and uh you know and

166
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:54,400
violence and hatred the violence against asian-americans is you know is

167
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:59,880
heartbreaking the violence against black Americans is

168
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:06,040
heartbreaking and um and the hatred that exists in our society that people go

169
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:11,480
around shooting each other so all these things together you know are forms of

170
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:18,000
sadness and grief and and uh that kind of accumulate or can accumulate if

171
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:25,560
they're not acknowledged and not known and not liberated so there's three ways of being

172
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:32,160
with grief there's accompanying grief there is knowing

173
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,800
grief and there's liberating grief and what I like about these words

174
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,960
accompanying knowing and liberating that grammatically they can both be a verb

175
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:49,440
and an adjective so knowing accompanying grief

176
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:58,119
means we are the companions of it we bring ourselves to be present for it and be with it but uh it also it the grief

177
00:39:58,119 --> 00:40:03,359
that does the accompanying it's a grief accompanying grief can also be the grief that

178
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:10,680
accompanies us and it's a mutual relationship uh you and your grief and

179
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:16,920
to feel and experience that mutuality is really really to allow the accompanying to be

180
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:23,880
full there is a knowing grief where we can know it but there's also the grief

181
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:33,280
that knows something uh grief is not just uh ignorant or dumb or you know uh

182
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:40,240
uninformed grief is something that's really well informed about something very important and what is it that grief

183
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:46,359
knows and so when we know grief we're also learning what does grief

184
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:52,040
know and then uh liberating grief is both you know we can Liberate the grief

185
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:57,640
perhaps but also there's the idea that there's a grief that is liberating

186
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:05,319
and uh and how can you know something as painful and difficult as grief can be at times how can that be liberating as well

187
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:11,319
and and to even to say those words or suggest that idea can feel like a

188
00:41:11,319 --> 00:41:17,839
betrayal or to the grief we have or can feel like a insult to the degree of pain

189
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:27,680
we can experience the grief so grief uh such an important topic for us

190
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:36,599
and I had this in mind and that that we could uh somehow uh do this uh talk together that

191
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:46,400
not just me talking but maybe those of you who have access to the chat we can have a little bit uh do this as in

192
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:54,078
teamwork the um so accompanying

193
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,119
grief grief is an ordinary part of human beings lives there's it's to be expected

194
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:08,000
that we'll have grief it's not a mistake to have grief if we're living and paying attention and caring about life and

195
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,160
caring about things there'll be grief there'll be sorrow there'll be

196
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,319
sadness and uh and so to spend time with that and allow ourselves to feel it to

197
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:24,960
trust it to be with it um and people who do mindfulness practices can really

198
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:33,640
maybe appreciate this how valuable it is to be with something be all this partly because we start feeling that um to not

199
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:39,400
be with it is to not be with ourselves that as we learn to be really

200
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:44,520
present for our experience present in ourselves and being opening up to all of

201
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:50,040
who we are there's a feeling of coming home to ourselves or feeling whole in

202
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:57,359
ourselves uh complete in ourselves or no part left out and it's uh in doing so we

203
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:04,680
become a refuge to ourselves we become the a refuge a a place of um of support

204
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:09,880
a place of Freedom a place of being we're allowed to be full and complete

205
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:17,160
and as soon as we have something like grief that's too painful for us or too embarrassing for us or too uh something

206
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:23,640
we want to push away or ignore or repress then uh we are dividing

207
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:32,000
ourselves we're no longer whole we're no longer able able to come back into our hearts and feel at home there and so to

208
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:37,720
um and to to accompany ourselves accompany the grief is a means to kind

209
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:44,839
of learn to stay whole learn to stay complete or learn to be a refuge to

210
00:43:44,839 --> 00:43:51,400
ourselves no matter how big and strong the pain is there's good reason why people want

211
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:56,720
to avoid grief and that is because it can be painful acute grief you know is

212
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,839
SE in is you know it's just like everything is torn apart and and um you

213
00:44:02,839 --> 00:44:07,960
know kind of the world the fabric of the world is torn apart and it can be

214
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:14,160
excruciating to feel some griefs so it's very painful and so the idea of accompanying

215
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:21,480
grief is to accompany our pain and if we don't do that then uh P

216
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:27,480
the grief and the pain remains but maybe it goes underground it gets repressed or gets

217
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:33,559
kind of ignored and um but it still operates it's still there

218
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:39,800
festering and uh and it's there if it hasn't really been dealt with fully

219
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:46,000
or with uh dignity or nobility then it can come back and come back in

220
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,599
unexpected and maybe unhealthy ways in terms of anger or excessive fear or um

221
00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:01,920
or being too closed and numb from what's going on so to accompany all this is to accompany

222
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:09,880
the ways we go numb to accompany also the ways we get angry the ways we get feel helpless and hopeless to uh just

223
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:15,599
accompany ourselves in the pain so I did that this last week uh to

224
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:21,559
some degree uh for me personally it was a very uh touching experience time for

225
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:27,079
me where um I uh moved my mother into

226
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:33,559
memory care home and um and uh I think the most

227
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:41,319
poignant part of it was walking across the parking lot of um of the you know

228
00:45:41,319 --> 00:45:48,119
the memory care place to bring her to the door and because of covid we can't come in someone comes out and receives

229
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:54,200
her and and accompanies her in where I stay behind so here I was walking across

230
00:45:54,200 --> 00:46:01,880
the parking lot very acutely aware of uh what was painful for me over 60

231
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:08,920
years ago and that was one of the earliest memories I have of my mother was uh her accompanying me when I was

232
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:16,720
about four years old across a school uh playground I was holding her hand and I

233
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,280
was crying because I was going to the first day of school in a foreign country

234
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:29,400
in a language I didn't speak in Geneva where they spoke French and I didn't speak French and um and going to a

235
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:34,680
Catholic that's best my memory kindergarten maybe uh something like

236
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:39,920
that um uh that uh was run by nuns and I

237
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:48,079
was uh so I was she was walking me across I was holding my head and I was crying and now over 60 years later um

238
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:53,280
you know the roles were reversed and and uh her memory was not such that she

239
00:46:53,280 --> 00:47:00,319
quite understood what was going on but I did and and so that came back and I'm

240
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:06,920
accomp I made space for it and then after I took her there I went for a long walk in the hills around here just to

241
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:13,440
accompany my grief accompany my sadness of what was going on and it was kind of kind of the

242
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,559
richness of it partly was the leftover of a certain pain the memory of pain

243
00:47:19,559 --> 00:47:28,800
from over 60 years ago that speaks to a principle that that uh uh uh sometimes

244
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:35,160
our our griefs are previous griefs and even more so if the griefs are unresolved or un somehow have been

245
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:41,880
pushed down or ignored um they get reawakened with new griefs and so the

246
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:48,040
new griefs can be much more acute because of the how it can be with um

247
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:55,200
with um you know that uh the legacy of griefs that we've had so to accompany

248
00:47:55,200 --> 00:48:01,440
grief is to accompan any pain and and for people who mindfulness practice we

249
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:06,640
begin discovering that there's a difference between pain and suffering

250
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:13,079
and this makes a world of difference and this is really what the heart of Buddhist practice is about is uh to if

251
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:20,319
we can see that difference then we can maybe learn to let go of the suffering and then learn

252
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:27,760
to with nobility with with uh compassion uh accompany the pain that's

253
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:34,480
part of human life the suffering is when we uh contract around the pain when we

254
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:40,440
close the heart around the pain when we cover over the pain when we resist the

255
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:45,839
pain when we are afraid of the pain all these other ways that we contract and

256
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:52,240
get wrapped up and in it is the suffering but uh the pain doesn't you

257
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:57,599
know and that's what we're liberating in in Buddhist practice all that kind of

258
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:04,079
complicated reactivity to the pain and it's uh but just to live with a pain and

259
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:11,400
make space for it be open to it be a refuge for the pain help the pain feel

260
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:18,280
safe safe in us and to learn that art to learn that ability to accompany our pain

261
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:24,440
so it begins by you know recognizing what the pain is naming it so that we

262
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:30,880
can see what what's been going on and what's been happening and and so for

263
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:37,440
this pandemic and marking this anniversary there's been um big big uh

264
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:42,880
griefs uh big things to grieve and small things to Grieves and all these teeny

265
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:49,119
incidental things that some people say would shouldn't count you know I should be not up to handling that and dealing

266
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:55,799
with that but the accumulation of all these small little things and that have been challenging and losses over this

267
00:49:55,799 --> 00:50:02,520
year they add up to a lot and one of the lessons of grief is never discount any

268
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:07,920
grief never feel that because other people's grief is so much bigger mine

269
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:14,440
shouldn't count every grief counts every grief is something to accompany to know

270
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:21,160
and to liberate because if we don't do that then slowly incrementally We Begin

271
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:27,799
closing down or pushing under and and the Vitality the fullness of being here

272
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:34,000
uh you know is going to be diminished so if you're willing um maybe

273
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,160
if you could write some of you would be willing to write in the chat maybe one or two or three words or whatever you

274
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:47,559
want um um of what you have grieved this last year that has to do with this

275
00:50:47,559 --> 00:50:53,880
pandemic and uh it' be nice to have some names Associated not um not necessarily

276
00:50:53,880 --> 00:51:00,760
to people but n you know to these different kinds of griefs named

277
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,079
here and um so what have what have you griefed

278
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,839

279
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:27,200

299
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:46,040
friendships so thank you all for writing all those things it's a big deal so

300
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:51,480
these are the things to accompany these are things to name and to be with and

301
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:57,000
and sometimes it's helpful to have help support and accompaniment that's what

302
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:05,440
sometimes having friends you can talk to about the griefs we have and not to fix not to solve but just to help to have an

303
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:11,200
to be a have a companionship in the grief and some griefs are so difficult

304
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,799
to be our own companion to that uh having someone else who can support us

305
00:54:16,799 --> 00:54:21,839
in that process there are like grief counselors for example and they're

306
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:27,319
useful in many ways but one way is that um they know how to be Companions and

307
00:54:27,319 --> 00:54:33,359
accompany and be present for and so it's easier for us to then to be our own

308
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:40,000
companions for our grief because we have someone who really knows how to do it and can do it with care and compassion

309
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:45,599
and acceptance and um and then learning how

310
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:51,799
to be willing learning how to be comfortable if that's the right word

311
00:54:51,799 --> 00:54:57,000
with feeling pain learning how to be open to feeling pain

312
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:02,960
uh learning the wisdom of being with pain the more we love something that

313
00:55:02,960 --> 00:55:09,839
we've lost more we love something that we lost um that love doesn't go away and

314
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:16,240
that something is precious if we what is is to really really kind of listen

315
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:21,599
deeply get to know deeply what's going on here and that's a second step of this

316
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:27,240
three-step process knowing grief really getting to know what it is is this grief

317
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:32,480
what is this pain being willing to really tend to it because there's a

318
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:38,160
tendency sometimes when we're really some situation we're in a lot of pain um

319
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,640
and hurt and feel of betrayal to get angry and push things

320
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:49,599
away and and be hostile or something and U which is natural enough it's a way of

321
00:55:49,599 --> 00:55:55,640
avoiding sometimes the pain um but to uh but to really get to

322
00:55:55,640 --> 00:56:01,160
know the pain because the degree to which we love something to that degree

323
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:09,960
our Capac our beautiful capacity for love our beautiful capacity for something good is is there buried in the

324
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:15,920
pain is found together with the pain pain isn't all necessarily all

325
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:21,880
bad um and so to really get to know grief and no pain to know that part of

326
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:27,280
the grief that kind of that suffering as opposed to pain to be able to make that

327
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:34,400
distinction between the contractions we have and the resistance the shoulds and the shouldn't I shouldn't be feeling grief I

328
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:42,039
should be over it by now uh I'm supposed to go through grief perfectly I'm supposed to resolve my grief I'm

329
00:56:42,039 --> 00:56:48,280
supposed to heal my grief I don't know if we're supposed to heal grief or some people heal grief but I don't know if

330
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:53,760
we're supposed to or required always or we're supposed to resolve grief some of

331
00:56:53,760 --> 00:57:00,039
us never healed in a sense that the pain pain never goes away but we can make

332
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:06,280
more space for it it's part of our deep Humanity to feel the pain of living life

333
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:13,240
Freedom real Freedom can coexist with pain Freedom does not coexist with

334
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:20,640
suffering suffering is the loss of freedom and so to make to just keep

335
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:27,000
opening the heart and allow it to be broken allow it to have space for the

336
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:32,160
pain that we feel um is part of it and sometimes that

337
00:57:32,160 --> 00:57:38,200
grief can be so strong that any words about it like the words I'm doing today

338
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:43,799
uh can feel just uh impossible and too difficult to listen to and doesn't make

339
00:57:43,799 --> 00:57:49,520
any sense occasionally grief has to go we have to reach rock rock bottom for

340
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:54,599
something to finally give out or it just seems like so impossible and so to

341
00:57:54,599 --> 00:58:00,160
really company really know know how impossible it is and stay there with it

342
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:05,720
stay there with it is part of least what this mindfulness practice

343
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:12,160
teaches the um to be with pain to be with it

344
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:17,200
all and I just I'm just remembering some of the things that I was thinking about we

345
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:26,480
grieve um I've grieved um in my my life I've grieved um anticipated futures the

346
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:34,079
future the now that won't happen because my friend died we grieve uh what happened in the

347
00:58:34,079 --> 00:58:39,119
past we grieve what didn't happen in the past what should have happened in the

348
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:44,480
past so all these you know it's layers and layers of grief that we can

349
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:51,720
feel so this knowing grief in vasna practice has a lot to do with the direct

350
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:57,280
experience in the moment which is to feel it in your body how is what is the

351
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:06,280
manifestation of grief here and now in the body what parts of the body are touched and moved and ache with grief

352
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:14,319
and we can find identify how it is physically here and now then that becomes a place the very location where

353
00:59:14,319 --> 00:59:19,520
we begin opening up to it where we open the heart we open the mind we open

354
00:59:19,520 --> 00:59:25,119
attention and make make see how big the awareness could be so we can hold that

355
00:59:25,119 --> 00:59:31,319
place and be with it if it's not located sometimes in the body it just seems like it's just

356
00:59:31,319 --> 00:59:38,440
overwhelming but sometimes when we locate in the body it has a kind of locus it has a kind of location to be

357
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:47,640
close with or intimate with or to touch or to connect to so um maybe here in the chat again

358
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:54,160
would some of you be willing to write um where how and where in the body do you

359
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:59,798
experience grief some of of locations and places for

360
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:26,160
that our wonderful bodies that carry so much I have difficulty swallowing

361
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:32,599

370
01:01:27,359 --> 01:01:37,039
headache from Angry thoughts brain core of my being center of my

371
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:47,000
body water flowing out yeah lots of

372
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:52,680
Tears headache lower

373
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:57,760
back in The Voice

374
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:06,000
yeah so so many ways it manifests in the body darkness in the head in the entire

375
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:13,359
being so these are the places that we bring our compassion and Care these are the places we hold these are places

376
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:20,640
where you want to bring a sense of safety to in the pit of my stomach we to mindfulness is to bring a

377
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:27,559
sense of safety to these places in the body that ache and hurt and are contracted and tight

378
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:36,079
and there's a way in which to trust that to trust feeling it and sensing it and being with it it can be very very hard

379
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:41,240
one of the things that makes grief particularly difficult is when there

380
01:02:41,240 --> 01:02:48,599
when we feel helpless or hopeless with their grief and um and uh the sense of

381
01:02:48,599 --> 01:02:54,079
helplessness is a can for some people especially if it's chronic is really

382
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:59,920
debilitating and the ability to accompany and to know and to feel and

383
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:07,599
connect and and to make space for and to hold in the body is a way that over

384
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:13,200
starts overcoming this feeling of helplessness we can help ourselves there

385
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:19,119
is hope for ourselves through this practice of mindfulness we have something we can

386
01:03:19,119 --> 01:03:25,400
do we have we can't we might be helpless in terms of uh for for those who are

387
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:31,319
dead are gone or losses we have for them to come back but it doesn't leave us as

388
01:03:31,319 --> 01:03:38,960
a helpless person we can engage with agency with sense of purpose and uh it's

389
01:03:38,960 --> 01:03:47,119
a profound thing very profound to learn the ability to hold our pain and not to

390
01:03:47,119 --> 01:03:52,799
add layers of suffering on top of it there's no shame in adding suffering on

391
01:03:52,799 --> 01:04:00,079
top of our pain because sometimes what we need to accompany what we need to open to is a

392
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:06,640
clear seeing knowing and experiencing of those layers of reactivity we have and

393
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:15,160
without that we don't have a hope of really experiencing what Charlie Brown called I think he called we good

394
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:22,039
grief good grief is the grief that is simple is unentangled we don't have all

395
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:29,200
these layers of shoulds and shouldn't on top of it it should be different we should be over it by now or I don't

396
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:35,160
deserve to be grieving because other people's have grief so much more all these things we

397
01:04:35,160 --> 01:04:42,359
do and then finally there's liberating grief and um and this is kind of what

398
01:04:42,359 --> 01:04:48,440
I'm saying all along is liberating the grief not from getting rid of the grief

399
01:04:48,440 --> 01:04:55,160
not from not no longer having grief but liberating it from how the grief all the

400
01:04:55,160 --> 01:05:01,400
suffering on top of the grief all the reactivity all the judgments all the uh

401
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:07,240
angers all the pushing away the resistance all the ways in which we

402
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:12,319
divide ourselves by shutting out part of who we are because it's too painful to

403
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:17,680
be with uh to liberate is to become whole

404
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:23,160
liberate is no part left out all of who we are is allowed to be there not

405
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:29,599
because we are justifi in or celebrating it or condoning it

406
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:37,599
necessarily but so that we can open up and um and have it all be part of the

407
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:44,240
whole the whole is always greater than the parts and grief is one of the parts

408
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:49,760
they can feel like it's the whole thing when it's really intense but it's always

409
01:05:49,760 --> 01:05:56,039
part a piece of a part of the whole and to make room for it and to hold hold it

410
01:05:56,039 --> 01:06:01,920
and be with it it might be that the liberated person

411
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:07,200
might cry um because the pure Simplicity of

412
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:13,000
the pain brings along tears tears are not a sign of being unliberated they

413
01:06:13,000 --> 01:06:18,359
might be sign of actually we're beginning to liberate ourselves that's

414
01:06:18,359 --> 01:06:25,359
where the Liberation happens I love the idea I love the the the ways in which it's possible to cry

415
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:31,599
and meditation because there's something about the meditation posture where we

416
01:06:31,599 --> 01:06:39,079
it's a posture in which we never collapse we never sink we never give up

417
01:06:39,079 --> 01:06:46,480
we never succumb to it but we stay simple relaxed up if you're upright

418
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:52,200
upright and let the tears flow so there's not the self-pity or the giving

419
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:57,240
up or something and there's freedom and just crying there's Freedom there's

420
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:04,440
Liberation found in that sometimes so um liberating our grief

421
01:07:04,440 --> 01:07:11,440
without needing it to go away so that we can go through our life continuing to

422
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:17,359
experience the griefs that will come there's no there's no final freedom from

423
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:23,599
grief and sadness but to go through life and be free in the midst of it is to

424
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:30,240
allow ourselves to feel it the vital ality the fullness of life with the grief and with the joys and with the

425
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:37,839
love and with all that's here um and this is not resolving grief

426
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:46,039
in terms of it going away it's not finally it's over it's uh it's the grief has its own

427
01:07:46,039 --> 01:07:53,839
life and so liberating our grief is to uh be generous to our grief so the

428
01:07:53,839 --> 01:07:59,240
grief can have its freedom the grief can do what it needs to do and

429
01:07:59,240 --> 01:08:06,200
to learn to trust the heart knows what to do the heart knows what to do with grief if we've liberated it if we if we

430
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:11,799
know it accompany it and we get out of its way and we've Li liberated from

431
01:08:11,799 --> 01:08:17,679
ourselves our hearts our grief knows what to do and sometimes we have to be

432
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:24,920
patient it takes time so liberating our grief so some of you maybe have had some

433
01:08:24,920 --> 01:08:32,000
experience of grief liberated in the way I've descri I've talked about here and how

434
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:38,679
does it feel how do you know that Lea has grief has been liberated how do you

435
01:08:38,679 --> 01:08:43,798
know uh how how's that experienced in you how's experiencing your body what's

436
01:08:43,799 --> 01:08:50,560
it like to have grief maybe even still present but really feel it's been

437
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:56,080
liberated so um let's see

438
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:04,400
here there can be a purity to the feeling of grief and strong emotion maybe that's part of The Liberation

439
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:07,838
yes and

440
01:09:15,679 --> 01:09:20,920
um part of uh what it feels like for me is a

441
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:27,159
willingness The Liberation of grief comes along with a willingness a willing willingness to grieve a willingness to

442
01:09:27,159 --> 01:09:29,359
have

443
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:41,000
pain breaking away and lifting of weight I feel like I'm cared and safe

444
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:47,480
when I let it go I felt more here and connected to others compassion sense and

445
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:53,120
grief emerging sense of Peace feeling Joy along with the sorrow getting in

446
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:59,600
touch with the raw emotion and being with it forgiveness there's truth in the Deep

447
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:06,159
sorrow and grief lifted weight of grief more love and accompanying grief

448
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:12,360
relaxation and gratitude I feel lighter it feels cleansing forgiveness more

449
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:20,199
peace and openness acceptance of experience at peace with it putting down a large Rock

450
01:10:20,199 --> 01:10:26,400
grief from childhood became compassion for my parents heart opens and I cry

451
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:33,719
more with the connection grief is a necessary part of moving on from the loss feeling the joy

452

right next to it great thank you for all this very

453
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:45,480
much feeling the love behind an inside of grief and feeling grateful for such

01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:51,120
love Fe feel like I'm moving again

455
01:10:51,120 --> 01:10:58,199

liberating grief uh three different ways of being with grief at different times different

459
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:25,000
ones ones of them are appropriate and um it's a profound part of our human

460
01:11:25,000 --> 01:11:30,040
life and it's been important part I know important is the right word a very

461
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:37,280
significant part of this last year and um and as we begin the second year of

462
01:11:37,280 --> 01:11:44,320
covid with whatever changes might be coming that um that uh to acknowledge

463
01:11:44,320 --> 01:11:49,679
little bit what happened this last year and to have spend time really

464
01:11:49,679 --> 01:11:56,480
accompanying knowing and liberating this grief hopefully will let us go into this new world New

465
01:11:56,480 --> 01:12:05,040
Year U more capable more willing more wise and how to continue to meet the

466
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:10,159
griefs that will come one way or the other will still have griefs where even

467
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:17,480
when the pandemic's over will have griefs this is part of human life and there's no Liberation without being

468
01:12:17,480 --> 01:12:22,960
liberated in relationship to our grief as well we are grieving beings just as

469
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:28,400
much as we're are loving beings compassionate beings forgiving beings

470
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:35,120
we're also beings that can experience pain so

471
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:43,520
um thank you very much for this and um I'm aware that grief is a huge well

472
01:12:43,520 --> 01:12:48,800
abyss of pain sometimes very difficult and to bringing it up today and evoking

473
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:56,760
it this way might be very hard for some of you and I'd encourage you to spend some time um today caring for yourself

474
01:12:56,760 --> 01:13:04,040
if that's the case maybe talk to friends go for walks uh if you have no one to talk to

475
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:09,199
journal about it write about it so it's so you you give it some

476
01:13:09,199 --> 01:13:15,719
expression and but do take care of yourself and and um and uh if this talk

477
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:22,600
is particularly difficult um maybe in a few days listen to it again there might be some something moving and bubbling

478
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:28,239
inside of you from it um but I wish you well and I offer you

479
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:35,880
this talk with a lot of desire and care and compassion for your welfare and happiness and and for

480
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:41,920
all of us as we go forward together in this new new next year that uh may all

481
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:49,639
of us uh support each other in this process thank you all very much
