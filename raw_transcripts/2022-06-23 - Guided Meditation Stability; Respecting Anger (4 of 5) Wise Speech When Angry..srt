00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:10,278
hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,000
there's a classic image or metaphor that's used for meditation

3
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,480
and that is to sit like a mountain and um it may be a little bit easier to feel

4
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,280
that when you're sitting cross-legged when you have this triangular shape but

5
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:47,120
i bring it up now today because um learning to be firmly grounded

6
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,719
in the place that you're standing sitting for your being kind of be there solid like a mountain

7
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,120
it implies that you're not leaning forward you're not pulling back you're not contracting

8
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,798
you're just there in a very stable

9
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,479
way that the winds of the mount the mountain winds the stormy

10
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,680
winds doesn't move the mountain the mountain just stays

11
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:24,560
so to learn this the ability to have this kind of stability is really helpful

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:32,000
when we are in the world of anger whether in the world of other people's anger or our own anger

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,640
to not to give in to any of it not to be caught by it not be unduly influenced

14
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:45,040
by it and one of the and and to have developed a capacity to be stable

15
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:53,119
in meditation can translate into finding that stability in times of

16
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,600
great difficulty in times it may be when there is anger directed at us or that we directed some

17
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:08,119
other place and so with that in mind maybe in this meditation

18
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,160
we can take some care to have to feel like a mountain

19
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,080
whether you're meditating in a chair or sitting cross-legged or maybe some of you are

20
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:27,360
standing or if you are lying down

21
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,840
maybe there's some way of feeling stability strength

22
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,720
unwaveringness in the face of whatever is happening and to

23
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:47,040
have the body your physical body support you in this groundedness

24
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,640
so to begin

25
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:59,760
giving some care to your posture maybe adjusting things

26
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,319
so that there is more stability if you're sitting in a chair make sure there's a there's a feeling of

27
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,239
firmness underneath the soles of your feet that uh if you're sitting with the feet

28
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:17,519
on the floor like they're there firmly some of that stability comes from the

29
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,760
feet if you're sitting sitting uh

30
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:29,760
cross-legged on the floor that

31
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,159
it feels balanced to you that the your the way your lower part of

32
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,280
your body is against the floor and your cushion

33
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,200
is there's a firm support feel the firm support or whatever

34
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,879
underlies your body's weight

35
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:04,159
and take time to feel the support feel the way your weight

36
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:09,760
comes down and rests against your chair your cushion the

37
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:13,640
floor your bed

38
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:26,880
and to really feel that grounding

39
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:32,160
you might sway back and forth a little bit

40
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,240
forward and back and to really feel the contact

41
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,840
of your body against what holds up the body's weight

42
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:58,080
and then as you exhale to exhale into that contact point

43
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,440
like you're releasing yourself into the that support

44
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:23,560
and then to feel your torso arising out

45
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,600
of that support and it works a little better if you're sitting upright that

46
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,599
imagine you're sitting here like a mountain with a wide firm base

47
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,280
if you're sitting using a backrest if it's possible to

48
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,680
sit up a little straighter maybe even not using the backrest

49
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,479
even for a little while

50
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:13,039
and with and taking a few long deep breaths into

51
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:20,039
your rib cage deep in stretching opening on inhale

52
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:30,000
almost like you're becoming more full or substantial or

53
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,840
strong as you breathe in a little more deeply than usual

54
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,400
and exhaling and settling into the stability

55
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,520
of this body of yours

56
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,360
and uplifting movement as you breathe in

57
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:31,840
and a rooted feeling as you exhale let go and become rooted in this body

58
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:42,840
letting your breathing return to normal

59
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:57,280
and whatever allow yourself to feel whatever global stability

60
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,800
there is in your body global steadiness

61
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,599
and as the torso breathes

62
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:22,639
perhaps you can feel that steady stability

63
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:30,639
the breathing arise out of that stability return to it

64
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,360
be part of it

65
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,560
entrust yourself to your body

66
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:07,040
trust the stability the steadiness the weight of your body

67
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,600
as it's rooted like a mountain here

68
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,519
in the thinking mind thoughts are like clouds or winds at the top of the

69
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:28,519
mountain

70
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,600
releasing any tension or holding associated thinking

71
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:54,080
letting those thoughts begin to

72
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,080
evaporate

73
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,839
the energetic wind of thinking begins to

74
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:19,920
quiet down and calm the mind trusts resting in the stability

75
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:23,160
of the body

76
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,560
mindful of breathing as if breathing is

77
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,880
intimately connected to the stability of the body here and

78
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:01,839
now

79
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,039
maybe gently saying to yourself the word

80
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:13,400
stability stable

81
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,640
as if that word is being said out of the stability of the body

82
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,840
becoming grounded in the stability of the body

83
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
stable

84
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,440
with the reference of being stable or

85
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:51,720
maybe you can notice the movements away from that stability

86
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:08,760
and then noticing them return to the stability

87
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:53,080
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

88
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:00,720
consider how being stable

89
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:12,320
can be a support for being present for others

90
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:16,639
maybe when others are not stable

91
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,919
maybe as a way of

92
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:35,159
letting our friendly friendship or friendliness be more evident and present

93
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:52,960
perhaps from a base of stability

94
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:59,200
wishing well on others has a very different

95
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,320
feeling than doing it without stability

96
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:15,520
trusting the stability of being trusting the stability of the bones

97
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:21,600
your weight the contact against the ground

98
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:31,840
the stability of gravity as you sit here

99
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,039
and opening your heart wide

100
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,799
to offer your good will your well-wishing your compassion and care

101
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,799
out into the world

102
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,399
you as a champion for the welfare and happiness

103
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,960
of others may others

104
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:14,320
be happy may others

105
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,120
be safe

106
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,760
may others be peaceful

107
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:33,720
may others be free

108
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:48,559
and may we contribute to that without losing

109
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:55,840
our balance our stability and our wisdom

110
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:07,459
[Music]

111
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,039
hmm

112
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,679
so here we are at the fourth talk on anger

113
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:37,360
and today i want to talk a bit about speaking when we are angry

114
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,559
it's one thing to be able to be by oneself and to meditate and and

115
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:47,760
process the anger that way it's another thing to

116
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:54,320
manage our anger wisely when we're in relationship to other people and you need to talk and work and

117
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,880
do things with others and certainly i hope that

118
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:07,039
the whole mindfulness approach with emotions with uh with anger

119
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,960
uh and this kind of deeper looking at it uh is supportive for

120
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:19,240
how we engage that in the world when we are anger angry

121
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:25,360
so the mindfulness approach to anger is an alternative

122
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:30,880
to expressing the anger acting it out venting it

123
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:37,760
catharsis venting anger is usually not very helpful

124
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,840
it's helpful for people who have very deep repressed anger and never get a chance to have it come to the surface

125
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,320
then maybe going to a safe location like in the forest and you know express the anger to a tree or

126
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,960
something where there's no one or alone in your room and just to kind of finally get it up to the surface so

127
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:05,519
you can address it but generally venting and anger and cathartic expression of anger

128
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:14,159
more often than not tends to strengthen the anger give more make more of it and make it grow

129
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:20,320
and that's why venting anger to other people that you might feel

130
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:26,720
is usually counterproductive because it tends to put fuel in itself

131
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:34,159
the classic buddhist um teaching around anger is that anger is a fire that burns

132
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:40,240
the person who has it and um so with venting you know

133
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:46,640
the the external externality of the venting sometimes doesn't allow the venter to

134
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:53,360
feel uh the cost the burning but in fact it's tremendously costly for the person who's

135
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,640
venting anger it's not really a relief release of pressure

136
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:05,440
and then so then one end you know expressing the anger or venting the anger

137
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,880
is usually not suggested repressing the anger is also not uh

138
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,120
healthy this can create tremendous amount of problems and usually it's counterproductive and sooner or later

139
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:25,200
there may be an explosion or or the anger the resentment kind of sees out in unseen ways

140
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,200
so the alternative i'd like to suggest for today between expressing anger

141
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,398
and repressing it is managing the anger

142
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:43,039
so knowing that we're angry and finding the tools how to be with the

143
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:49,440
anger that we we have so that it doesn't need to be expressed

144
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,679
and it doesn't need to be repressed and what we can do is we can learn to

145
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,480
interact with other people [Music] having the anger somehow helpfully

146
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,079
managed so one of the things one way to manage the anger

147
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:13,440
is uh not to automatically give into it but have an alternative

148
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,440
place a way of being with anger than giving into it and one of those ways

149
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:26,398
is to be rooted grounded stable in ourselves to have cultivated a

150
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:32,960
habit a strong skill set in being connected to the physical body

151
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:39,520
to be able to be grounded in the physical body to take a stable posture

152
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:44,560
in the physical body to learn how to manage the agitation of

153
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:49,599
the body the restlessness of the body

154
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:57,599
the pressures emotional pressures that arise in the body to be able to hold them in the body

155
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:04,400
and this is phenomenally useful that we are learning through mindfulness practice to expand

156
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:11,760
our capacity to experience difficult emotions if the capacity is small then the

157
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:17,280
difficult emotions spill over or explode or become detrimental

158
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,280
but we're learning steadily in this practice to expand our capacity to hold more and more difficult emotions

159
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:30,079
including anger and one of the ways to hold it to be with it is to really

160
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:38,079
drop into the body feel the body feel the stability of the body and let the anger be felt as part of the body

161
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,359
as opposed to we becoming the anger identifying with the anger and

162
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,880
which is a very difficult state to be in if anything we identify with the body

163
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:56,240
and the anger is a subset of it and then uh as we manage this um the

164
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:01,440
anger if we have a little bit of ability to

165
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,320
investigate to look inside to understand the characteristics of the anger

166
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,079
is it something that's really unique to a current incident

167
00:36:14,079 --> 00:36:19,200
or is there a long history of resentment of complaining of indignation of

168
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:25,440
of stress connected to how we're feeling now this is just a continuation of a long pattern in fact there might even be

169
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,280
a kind of a continuous chronic feeling of the irritation that weak

170
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:38,320
annoyance that's there regardless if we're with others or not and it's just that that annoys a chronic

171
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:44,720
annoyance irritation resentment has it sometimes now it's getting kind of

172
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:51,119
a big wave is being formed of it though the little wave is always moving across the ocean

173
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,280
and um and maybe it's going across a shoal and now it's being raised up and really big

174
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:03,440
if it's chronic we might relate to it very differently than if it's just in the incident in the

175
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,359
moment because incidence in the moment is where maybe there's real danger

176
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:15,119
and so if anger is a symptom of a danger of

177
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:22,320
some so there's a problem going on that then if you recognize what the problem is

178
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,320
then maybe there's less need to be angry then we can maybe find ways to address

179
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:34,880
the problem and this is where mindful speech is phenomenally useful

180
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,560
to learn how to speak mindfully and one of the ways to speak mindfully

181
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,160
is again to be rooted in the body to have the stability of body as we speak

182
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,920
so that we can track what we're saying we might even be able to track what we're about to say

183
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:59,359
it's because we're managing all this not to repress anything but so the best parts of ourselves come out it's really

184
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,839
managing ourselves so we can stay free not managing ourselves so we bottle ourselves up

185
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:12,960
it might feel like you were free or if we just vent our anger and just speak spew out what we're feeling but that's

186
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:19,359
not really freedom that's really a loss of freedom even though there's a release and kind of a

187
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:26,079
ease in which things are spilling out of us the managing is to to stay close to that

188
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:32,880
place where there's a deeper wisdom that's free deeper connectivity deeper choice is possible

189
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,079
and so to learn to speak connected to the bodies being aware of

190
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,839
what's happening here the other is if again if there is

191
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,040
an opportunity to to pay a little bit of attention and this becomes second nature the more we

192
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:57,119
are mindful of speech in ourselves is to is to be careful why you're speaking

193
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,680
what's the motivation what are you accomplishing with a speech some speech it's only a dagger as we're

194
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:08,880
throwing at other people to hurt them some speech is to

195
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,800
try to solve the problem some speech is to try to give a message to someone that what they're doing is

196
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:21,599
not acceptable but it's very different been letting them know in strong terms you

197
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:27,680
can't do this versus some kind of statement that says you're you know a terrible person using

198
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:32,800
some horrible language to say that you know kind of attacking them and throwing you

199
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:39,280
know swear words at them perhaps um so what's the purpose of the language is

200
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:46,480
it to hurt the person is it to problem solve is to be able to let the person know what we're feeling

201
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:52,240
and then the content of what we say is important and one thing that's very helpful

202
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:59,280
is at times is to learn the art of i statements

203
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,720
i was once many years ago i was a ta in college

204
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,000
for a for the chair of the department and

205
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:16,720
he was treating me in some kind of way that was not appropriate maybe as a servant and something and

206
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,160
asking me to do all kinds of things and putting pressure on me and demands that were unreasonable

207
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:28,480
and i got furious at him but i had enough sense no this is not a

208
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,560
person to yell at or be angry at and so uh but i didn't want to repress

209
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:40,640
it i felt this needs to be addressed so i went to him and i stood there and i was kind of shaking because i was so

210
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:47,119
angry and and i made i statements i said things like

211
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:53,680
what i'm experiencing now given what you said and what you're asking me to do is i feel really hurt i

212
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:59,599
feel really upset and it was obvious that i was i wasn't saying anything about him and

213
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:06,240
what he did i was just saying the impact it had on me and that was all i needed to do he

214
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:12,000
backed out he understood the impact he understood what he had done and then the whole thing became a lot

215
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:20,800
better and the and so to sometimes sharing the impact

216
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:26,400
sometimes it's powerful to tell people when you did x i i know i feel afraid

217
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,240
now some people kind of when they realize what the impact they had like that they switch and change

218
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,160
as opposed to yelling at them and then they yell back and then the whole thing escalates

219
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:46,640
and the idea is to learn how to speak in ways where the speaking de-escalates our own anger

220
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,480
whether it diffuses it and they're wonderful i like maybe slightly pronounced differently but the two

221
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:57,520
meanings of diffuse is to kind of

222
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:03,200
settle out spread out so it's weaker thinner less concentrated and to take

223
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:10,318
the fuse out of a bomb to diffuse we're defusing our anger

224
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,160
we're tracking ourselves so we know we get the feedback that we're actually maybe speaking in a way that's

225
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:22,400
increasing the level of the anger rather than decreasing it i've been angry at someone once

226
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,240
some years ago and and i asked to meet with a person privately so we did

227
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,240
and we talked for a while and then i said after after a while i could feel myself getting even more upset

228
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:42,560
and so i asked if we could have a time out can we just sit here quietly for a few minutes um and the person was a practitioner so

229
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:48,960
that was apparently easy enough to agree to and then and then when the

230
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:54,720
you know after a few minutes of breathing and being present then i was ready to continue the conversation

231
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,680
i was not in a good place to have the conversation until i had had a couple of minutes of silence

232
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:08,079
so to track ourselves to manage ourselves to uh to be able to

233
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:15,040
manage the conversation and find the balance and find how to speak and what to speak

234
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,480
how not to attack people when we speak which is so easy to do when we're angry

235
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,000
but to speak in ways that try to get the job done that needs to be done that's appropriate

236
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:32,160
to be careful that we're not spilling over things have nothing to do with them

237
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:37,359
chronic resentments chronic hurt that we're carrying with us

238
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:43,119
can bring a lot of pressure along that way we're not really taking

239
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:51,200
care of the situation at hand as we're somehow giving expression to age-old resentment

240
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:58,400
that we're carrying that we're frustrated with and is coming out so in these few minutes i have those are

241
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:05,040
the the ideas that i'm offering so here the primary one i want to leave

242
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,480
you with is two ideas one is manage your anger

243
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:17,200
and manage it with discovering some stability within always look for the stability if you can

244
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,480
and the other is uh start being exploring and being wise about how you

245
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:27,680
speak because sometimes we have to speak when we're angry

246
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:34,480
and maybe today if you have an occasion to be angry or irritated or annoyed

247
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:41,119
or you want to complain don't complain don't express annoyance don't

248
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:46,880
send barbs to people rather consider what you can say

249
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:53,200
that's maybe an i statement that may supportive in the situation that's appropriate for the situation take care

250
00:44:53,200 --> 00:45:00,079
of something that takes care of you and the other person if the person hasn't done the dishes one

251
00:45:00,079 --> 00:45:07,599
more time don't kind of yell at them just kind of say wow

252
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:14,720
here we are again the dishes aren't being done what's happening or it's very discouraging i feel so

253
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:20,000
discouraged to see this thing full of dishes again and leave it at that see

254
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:25,440
what happens something mainly the point being find ways to speak

255
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:33,760
when you're angry develop the skill and the wisdom to be able to do that so that your speech is healthy and wise

256
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:39,280
in circumstances when you're angry so thank you

257
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:46,040
and we'll have one more talk on anger tomorrow i think
