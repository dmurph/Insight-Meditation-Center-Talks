1
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,440
so warm greetings everyone

2
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:21,439
and we're continuing this process of

3
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:28,960
this exploration of samadhi and often in buddhism in

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,200
english buddhist buddhisms often enough the deepening levels of samadhi are

5
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,800
sometimes called absorptions to be absorbed

6
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,920
and in some ways it's an apt uh description of them the

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:56,559
if we liken it to the idea of uh being absorbed in a good book or absorbed and listening to music or

8
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:03,920
absorbed in some hot craft that we're doing that absorbed in a movie that uh

9
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:10,159
to absorb just to be fully uh attentive to it where kind of all our

10
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,880
senses are either focused on what we're doing or the senses kind of have receded

11
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,320
from receded from getting much attention from us

12
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,360
so if you're absorbed in a book you might not be listening so much to what's going around you someone might even talk

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,560
to you and you don't hear them because you're really absorbed

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,920
and but no in meditation it's not a it's an absorb that kind of absorption

15
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,200
is one of great interest or usually there's a kind of sense of

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,759
goodness or wholesomeness and people usually part of the joy of being absorbed in a book or something is the

17
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,439
absorption itself and so same thing with samadhi it's a

18
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,240
very nice state of absorption it's not a turning off of the world but rather it's letting the

19
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:09,360
world around us fall away as we enter into a very wholesome

20
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,560
healthy state a healthy kind of and all the you know steps of

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,840
anapanasati these steps of deepening meditation are steps that are opening up and

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,480
evoking healthier and healthier states of being inside and of course it's not always going to

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,560
be that way and it's a process to get there but to know that we're looking for the inner health

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:40,000
we're looking to recognize where nourishment is what's wholesome is here and so we do that in the very beginning

25
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,440
trying to can we approach meditation in a healthy

26
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:52,959
wholesome way without greed or contraction or conceit or pouncing on things or

27
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,920
strong aversion trying to escape and push things away can we have a spirit of generosity

28
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,680
of kindness a warmth of good will and ease as we start engaging our

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,280
attentional capacities our ability to bring attention and then we begin

30
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:19,360
finding where as we pay attention how to evoke and spread and develop

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,599
good feelings in the body partly because we're starting to relax this process of relaxation is such a

32
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,920
healthy thing to do and and so as a meditation deepens at

33
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,680
some point the inner health the inner goodness the nourishment the wholesomeness

34
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,760
feels so great that it becomes easier and easier to be absorbed in that to feel connected to it to be

35
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:51,360
really there and so to be absorbed and i also delight in

36
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,640
the idea that that of using the metaphor of a sponge

37
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:01,680
a sponge absorbs water and the same way

38
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,720
there's a we absorb the sensations we absorb this experience of breathing

39
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:15,680
we allow it to just kind of like the whole body is the sponge and um and we just kind of like are

40
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,440
there to receive and we take in the whole experience of the present moment

41
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:28,400
in a receptive way in a open way and and the sponges i don't think force the

42
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,440
world to force the itself to absorb water just that's what it is

43
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:39,360
uh sponges do they just absorb so this absorption that absorbs the

44
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,040
absorption that really let's allows there to be a kind of a intimacy

45
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,400
and a receptivity in a to our experience to our breathing to be

46
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:59,360
absorbed in the breathing so assuming a meditation posture

47
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,320
and perhaps sitting in such a way meditating such a posture where the chest is a little bit

48
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,600
more open open to be receptive

49
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,320
and sometimes when the chest is a little more open it's a little bit more useful than

50
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:26,240
or capable to relax the belly so softness throughout the front of our

51
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,320
body soft front and sometimes it said that meditation

52
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,680
we have a soft front and a strong back

53
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:47,039
and so to feel this especially if you're sitting upright to feel a little bit of strength

54
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,600
in the back stability

55
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,160
maybe adjusting the vertebrae a little bit so the spine is a little bit more aligned

56
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:11,039
centered instead of strength maybe some of you

57
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:19,039
prefer the word stability stability strength of the back and the

58
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,039
softness and openness in the front

59
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:35,840
and to gently close your eyes and to take a few long slow deep breaths

60
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:46,800
kind of a ritual procedure for adjusting your state of mind your

61
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,520
state of body your attitude

62
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,599
into one that can begin to be absorbed in this practice of meditation

63
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,440
that is put aside temporarily its concerns of the past and the future or other

64
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:13,039
places other times it is prepared preparing itself

65
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,840
to settle in here and now

66
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:30,000
and then letting your breathing return to normal

67
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:38,880
to continue this process of softening the front of our body by as you exhale softening the face

68
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,919
face is where we present to the world so much but in meditation we don't need to

69
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:59,840
activate the face we can let it rest

70
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,919
on the exhale softening the shoulders

71
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,400
releasing to the pull of gravity the weight of the shoulders

72
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,840
adjusting your arms so that they can be loose and relaxed

73
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,839
softening in the chest

74
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:55,839
and relaxing the belly

75
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:02,160
and wherever you feel your breathing the predominant place the common place

76
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:10,000
for experiencing the body breathing imagine that location

77
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,560
is a sponge for the sensations

78
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:23,440
of breathing so it's not so much that you're in the control tower

79
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:30,399
thinking looking down at breathing it's more like you are that

80
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:37,920
sponge in the body especially the inhale absorbing

81
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,600
the sensations of the inhale

82
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:53,920
and if those sensations are like water then in the exhale spreading

83
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:05,839
the goodness of that water throughout the body

84
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:17,600
absorbing the inhale and releasing it all on the exhale

85
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:33,839
throughout the body

86
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,959
and can you adjust your mind a little bit

87
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:51,760
so your mind is more like doing tai chi mental tai chi of receiving and flowing

88
00:10:52,240 --> 00:11:01,839
moving along with the breathing

89
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:14,640
maybe as if the mind becomes more and more like water flowing

90
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,639
with and over and through the breathing

91
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:43,839
or as if the mind also gets absorbed into the body the body sponge

92
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:57,839
and abiding in the body breathing

93
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:08,839
abiding in intimacy will you turn yourself over to your

94
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:16,399
breathing entrusting yourself to your breathing

95
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:24,959
absorbed in the goodness of breathing

96
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:31,360
and whenever you exhale and you need to remember to let go of whatever takes you

97
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:37,680
away from your breathing let the breathing be the center of it

98
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,040
all the foundation of everything

99
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:53,839
the beginning of it all the end of it all just breathing

100
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:56,399
being absorbed in breathing not as a rejection of anything else

101
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:02,560
but in a way let everything else recede to the background

102
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,600
where your interest your involvement

103
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:18,558
your life energy

104
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:24,319
is intimately involved connected to

105
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,840
breathing

106
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:32,960
perhaps it's easier to be absorbed in the breathing if you make a small half smile with your

107
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,799
lips just turn up the corners of your lips just a little bit

108
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:50,720
maybe shifts the mood just enough then it's easier to flow with the

109
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
breathing

110
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:46,320
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

111
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:54,960
to bring forth whatever

112
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:04,159
goodwill tenderness love that might live in your heart

113
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:13,919
that lives within you in whatever way that that caring loving

114
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:20,640
part of you can come forth as we sit here

115
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,840
and breathe with that

116
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:40,080
let that be absorbed into the bodies the sponge as you breathe in

117
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:45,840
and may that spread through your body as you exhale

118
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,200
like water being absorbed and then dispersed

119
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:09,840
the water of love and kindness compassion good will

120
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:17,840
and without any responsibility to act on your love your goodwill

121
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:25,039
to simply sit here open to it

122
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:36,559
feel it and see if you can sit

123
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:45,440
quietly for a few moments more gazing kindly with kind eyes

124
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:52,720
on the people of your life those you know well those you barely

125
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,880
know

126
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:09,039
strangers and perhaps and thinking about

127
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:15,679
maybe some of the people you will encounter today without needing to do anything with them

128
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:23,039
at all this while you're sitting here see can you gaze upon them kindly

129
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:33,840
can you hold them in the warmth of your heart

130
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:42,720
and taking a few moments to do this expresses our a wish

131
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,799
that our meditation practice supports us

132
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:57,120
in bringing helpful healthy attitudes to this world

133
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,880
around us that meditation is not just for ourselves

134
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,240
but it's also for how we see and relate to others

135
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:15,840
and maybe we unders discover more and more how that's the case

136
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:21,760
may it be that we meditate for the welfare and happiness of all

137
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:26,399
beings ourself included

138
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:31,120
may all beings be happy

139
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:36,880
may all beings be safe

140
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:45,278
may all beings be peaceful

141
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:57,840
may all beings everywhere be free

142
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:20,159
so related to the topic of absorption that what we talked about what i talked

143
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:26,960
about in the guided meditation just now a a concept that the buddha refers to

144
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:32,960
often in terms of meditation practice and this path of liberation

145
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:39,600
is the idea of often translated into english is

146
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,799
seclusion and the word for seclusion viveka

147
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:51,120
v-i-v-e-k-a more literally means to separate

148
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,519
something apart becomes separate but in the context seclusion is probably

149
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:04,159
one of the better english words no english words really work well but the probably better english word if

150
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,760
we associate seclusion with being sheltered being protected

151
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:15,440
kind of cozy and nice and secluded in the best possible kind of

152
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,200
associations of that word cozy and warm and contented

153
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:29,200
deep feeling of satisfaction just being here secluded or somehow maybe after a

154
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:36,158
you know a long walk and big invigorating nice walk in the cold

155
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,720
maybe even stormy weather and coming inside and wrapping in a nice blanket and having a

156
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:48,240
warm drink and just being all cozy and alone and feel secluded from all the

157
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:56,800
difficulties of life around us maybe something like that so the word seclusion and

158
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:03,200
it's used in the buddhist teachings for a variety of different forms of seclusion and

159
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:10,079
the the first kind of gives us begins giving us a sense of what it's what's to come and it means

160
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:17,760
it's used to defer to uh going on retreat they don't have the word retreat in in

161
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,960
ancient language but they say uh going to be secluded um to be secluded is to go someplace

162
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:30,640
where you're separate from the some people might say that it's a process of escaping the world and

163
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:37,680
and the real world we have to face the real world but the what's more real

164
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:42,960
in terms of our mind and hearts is becoming integrated not being fragmented and

165
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,640
being pulled in all kinds of directions and where thoughts and feelings and everything and so the process of

166
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:56,079
meditation going in physically becoming secluded from many of the aspects of the world so we can find this

167
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,720
inner health inner wholesomeness and integration process so we can bring back that back into the

168
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:08,560
world and it isn't pushing the world the world away or abandoning it any more

169
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:15,599
than going alone and being secluded in your bathroom to take a shower is pushing away the world and rejecting

170
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:23,920
the world and take a shower and become clean and we become you know more it's more we're more of a

171
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:31,440
pleasant person to be with in the world if we're clean and and taken care of that way and uh

172
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:37,359
so uh so this is meditative seclusion going off on retreat and in the old days it was going into

173
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:43,760
the forest perhaps in some place where the people could be alone some people it might be to be in your own room by

174
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:50,240
yourself in the early morning and maybe you get up before everyone else and you feel have this wonderful benefit of seclusion

175
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:58,400
just nothing else to think about and be involved in just here practicing and um and then it's easier

176
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:05,119
to get absorbed it's even easier to an integration that wholeness and just the satisfaction the contentment of being this way

177
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,480
of real and then settling in and being and then we become more and more secluded

178
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:16,720
and and meditative seclusion happens when um we stop

179
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,240
being so concerned with the past and the future and the thoughts don't take us spinning

180
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:28,079
out in other places and other times and and we're secluded from those um uh

181
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:34,839
external thoughts thoughts that kind of spin us away and if we are thinking it's thoughts that keep us here and connected and

182
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:40,480
involved as we get more absorbed in meditation more connected and involved in it

183
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:47,280
and you know really sink into it and then um there's sensory

184
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:52,880
seclusion that happens that uh sometimes we don't really involved in

185
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:59,760
hearing so much or smelling or seeing or even even some of the sensing of the

186
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:05,440
body recedes and disappears sometimes people the body becomes very transparent or

187
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,359
light or seems to have no edges to the body or even the whole body seems to disappear

188
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:17,920
because we're we're not we're not really giving attention to um the senses you know the six the

189
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:25,760
five senses of of uh hearing seeing touching um smelling tasting

190
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,599
and um and so those all we seed we still have the capacity to hear and

191
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,880
taste and do all these things but they recede from where our attention is we're

192
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:43,599
absorbed in what we're involved in and just like we would perhaps if you're reading a really good book

193
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,359
and you don't hear people talking anymore you don't notice the sounds outside the house because you're so absorbed in the

194
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:57,359
in the book there's a sensory seclusion and that sensory seclusion because there's absorption going on it's

195
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:03,920
uh it you know it feels really good it's like we're being pulled in we're being absorbed we're being

196
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,520
delighted we're being enjoying we're really the attention really is getting centered in here

197
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,440
um because it's starting to get concentrated and very present as it does so and the mind becomes

198
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:22,079
quieter and stiller one of the functions of this is for us to become more sensitive to clinging

199
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:30,160
to grasping to how the mind gets attached to how the mind contracts and and uh and the more still

200
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,320
more absorbed more peaceful we can become the more sensitive we become to the slightest movements of

201
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:43,200
contraction of clinging of resistance that goes on in the mind in the heart and so then we

202
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,520
have the opportunity then to let go of that or bring our attention to that and have it let go of itself

203
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,119
and and and then over time there becomes a seclusion from the

204
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,480
things we cling to one of the important steps for this process of seclusion

205
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,079
is to be secluded from to be separated from not involved in any more with the five

206
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:14,480
hindrances of sensual desire ill will sloth intorper restlessness and regrets and doubt

207
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:20,079
because we're so absorbed so connected so involved with what we're doing with meditation like really

208
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,520
kind of dipping deep into the into the world the ocean of

209
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:30,880
breathing that um that we're not you know we're not get pulled into those

210
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,240
it can be part of this contentment and satisfaction of meditation is not to be involved anymore with the

211
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:43,039
hindrances so we're secluded from them we're separated from them as the ancient language

212
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,560
and and that's temporary so in deep meditation that that can

213
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:55,920
those fall away but then they come back when we come out of meditation their mind is no longer concentrated

214
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:01,520
and maybe they come back a little bit weaker than they were before but sooner or later they'll come back

215
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:08,240
and then the ultimate seclusion is their separation is when we become more permanently separated from some of

216
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,280
our clinging and attachment and that more permanent separation from attachment

217
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,400
is um is you know called liberation

218
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,359
and so um um so this somali practice is meant to

219
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:31,520
support that process of liberation um and so it's not just getting absorbed

220
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:36,960
and feeling the healthiness the goodness the wholesomeness the satisfaction the deep contentment of

221
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:43,119
just being absorbed in the breathing flowing with the breath but it's preparing the mind

222
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:52,160
so the mind is softer more workable more able to let go more

223
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:58,160
more malleable in a sense so that the ways

224
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:03,920
it's contracted has room to breathe it's a room to let go and open up

225
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,760
and we start feeling some of the seclusions some of these seclusions which partake

226
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:16,880
of or or have qualities of liberation in them for example being temporarily liberated

227
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,000
from the hindrances and so that brings us to the 12th step

228
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,440
of these 16 steps of breathing so the 11th one is breathing in

229
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:36,400
one concentrates the mind one unifies the mind one steadies the mind breathing out one

230
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,800
unifies the mind steadies the mind composes the mind

231
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:50,079
concentrates the mind whatever that word is translated as uh the samadhi word and then

232
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:56,079
the twelfth step is one liberates the mind

233
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:03,599
breathing in one liberates the mind breathing out when liberates the mind and and now we're starting to get into

234
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:11,040
uh the territory of the real purpose of buddhist meditation this area of liberation and we'll pick

235
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:17,760
up that uh continue with that tomorrow and in the meantime you might look for

236
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,560
how you can lovingly delightfully be absorbed in what you do during the day

237
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:31,359
wash dishes be absorbed and just do that in a way just turn yourself over fully to the enjoyment of that without

238
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,640
letting the mind take you away and maybe there's a lot of activities throughout the day that you can do if

239
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,760
you eat alone for example absorbed and just the eating and

240
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:48,079
learning to kind of appreciate or develop that capacity to give ourselves over fully to what

241
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:55,280
we're doing when we're doing it so that there's qualities of absorption like a good you know involved in playing music in a

242
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,800
nice way they supports us to learn how to do that

243
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:09,680
meditation so you might want to play around with that during the day today next 24 hours

244
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:16,560
so thank you very much and and i look forward to our time tomorrow

245
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,680
thank you
