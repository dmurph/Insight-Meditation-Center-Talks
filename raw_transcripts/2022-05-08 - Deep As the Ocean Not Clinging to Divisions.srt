1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:05,680
so good morning and welcome

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:11,760
those of you here to imc thank you for coming and uh

3
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:19,840
thank you for coming and wearing your masks now that i think uh the two places close closest

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,000
to us two counties now i have that one of the fastest surging of covid in maybe in the country

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,679
even san francisco and santa cruz i'm going to santa cruz today i think santa cruz has the highest at least in

6
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,200
california so um i'm going down there for the next two

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:44,239
weeks to teach a retreat and the retreat topic is on my mind we

8
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,640
usually are our our

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,640
retreats uh have themes that we make up just before the retreat starts to kind

10
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,360
of tie the teachings the practice together and uh

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,240
and so i kind of want to do it maybe for me it's my sake a trial run it's kind of what's my mind and so i'm gonna talk a

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,640
little bit about this and tell you in a few minutes what the actual theme is

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,080
but first i would like to tell a story from my life

14
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:31,280
when i was a zen student and that'll be illustrative of what i'm going to say more of

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,960
the so i lived at a green gulch zen center in marin county for

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,240
a while and as a new student there um

17
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,520
so i would go in many times a day into the meditation hall it was a big very big

18
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:54,720
it used to be a very big barn that they converted high ceiling and big rectangular building

19
00:01:54,720 --> 00:02:02,560
and the way it was laid out you'd kind of go in from kind of from the back back door

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,560
and and you would go into the room and down some steps

21
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,640
and you come at the back of the altar and then you'd either go left and right and go

22
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,200
to sit in the main part of the room and and so there was an aisle then behind

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,879
the altar and if you were on the left side of the room and you wanted to go to the right side of the room you would

24
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:33,360
always walk behind the altar the rule was you never walked across the middle of the room in front

25
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,640
of the altar i think the idea that the buddha was in the altar and it was disrespectful to walk in front of the

26
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,640
buddha and so you would always walk all the way around and if you were in the deepest end of the

27
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,640
meditation hall and you wanted to get to the other you know just two to three feet the other side of that

28
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,080
magical invisible line you have to walk all the way around to get there

29
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:03,360
and as i was there uh sometimes uh there were reasons variety of reasons to

30
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,480
doing things whatever we did there in the room that i would get close to that

31
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,680
that line midline right down in the middle of the buddha's body

32
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,440
you know and i could feel my body would feel

33
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:26,959
i was approaching like a magnetic field or this force field as i approach that line

34
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,720
and my body with these little micro muscles in my body would be pulling me away or be activated so that inner

35
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:41,280
it wasn't conscious all this but it was kind of subconscious that was doing this and and so this feelings i had my body's

36
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:47,599
micro muscles and excite excited energy that would come or something as i approached that line

37
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,920
it kind of contributed to sense that there's a force field here and so i would you know the closer i got

38
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,040
that field more of this force field and then i would pull back

39
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,319
and uh so that went on for a long time but i didn't think about it too much

40
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:11,519
just what was and uh and then one day i was i knew i think it

41
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,799
was cleaning and back behind the altar was cleaning

42
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,479
and there were some tourists who came there's people who just wandered off off the street and we're just kind of

43
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,759
walking around to see what a zen center was like and they wandered into the meditation hall and

44
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,840
and they just wandered in and walked around and walked right through that line

45
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:39,600
and nothing happened no lightning struck they didn't get electrocuted and nothing

46
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,440
happened and at that moment i realized that that line was just a figment in my

47
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:51,759
imagination i mean i was told not to cross the middle line but uh the sense of a force field the

48
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:57,440
sense of this you know how my whole relationship to this line was just didn't exist

49
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,440
you know it was i mean the line didn't exist and and my relationship was something imaginary

50
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:12,160
to this it just all was made up by the mind and i'd lived what was made up in my mind as a thing

51
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,000
didn't really exist and but it had an impact on me and i behaved accordingly

52
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,680
so that was kind of fascinating to see you know how the mind can project

53
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,080
onto reality things that are not there and live as if it's there

54
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:37,039
and to some degree we do that with people we project power sometimes or qualities

55
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:43,600
onto people that may may not be there sometimes we

56
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,919
up the amplitude maybe of some of these qualities in people and make them bigger than they are and

57
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,120
and it's not uncommon to for people to go spend time with a spiritual teacher

58
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:00,639
to you know especially if a teacher has if they're really you know elevated

59
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:06,639
importance in people's minds and then just being in the presence of the teachers like wow i'm in this

60
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:13,600
wonderful field this force field it was this wonderful field of the teacher and there might be some some few things

61
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:20,960
coming from the teacher but it's elevated because of the same phenomena the mind is projecting and and imagining

62
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,840
and living as if this is real rather than unders not appreciating how much the mind is contributing to it

63
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:35,080
and assigning it to the teacher for example it's all kinds of things

64
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,960
so uh so this idea that the mind will contribute

65
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,199
to through its imagination to project onto reality things that are not there

66
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:55,759
or not there in the way that we're living them is a very important principle to understand buddhist the buddha's

67
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:00,560
teachings in relationship to ourselves

68
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:07,280
because we do it to ourselves in different ways and now that's that kind of the theme of

69
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:13,520
this retreat we're going to do with the buddha talked about five different ways

70
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,479
which we create this these things

71
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,560
these we divide ourselves into five different ways and each of those divisions by dividing

72
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:33,039
us we're dividing the wholeness of who we are and then we get attached to those

73
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:40,000
divisions and we put sometimes you put a lot of value or importance into these divisions

74
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:46,400
some people put more important than one of the divisions or some of the divisions more than other people do

75
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,440
but that projection this idea of this is where it's at this is important this is

76
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,879
where the force field is this is where i am this is my sense of who i am

77
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,160
and sometimes the sense of i am i exist

78
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,400
sometimes is another force field or another

79
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:16,160
something that's kind of the mind has projected onto reality this case the reality of this being here

80
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,319
and we live in that projection in all kinds of complicated ways and

81
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:30,000
we like it we don't like it we we don't you know we pull away from it we hold on to it we cling

82
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,240
and so beginning to appreciate how the mind does that is part of the function of mindfulness

83
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:42,640
practice the simplest way to in the buddhist teachings to understand this is that he

84
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:48,640
talked about this as being five areas where people cling

85
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:55,440
they get attached and these things are the word for this in pali the ancient

86
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,279
language is kanda k-h-a-n-d-a which

87
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:07,040
i think unfortunately the most common english translation is aggregates

88
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:13,600
so if you aggregates like you know make cement with aggregates and stuff

89
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:21,360
and um so you know i mean that doesn't sound very appealing you have five aggregates and you get attached to them

90
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,320
you know that for some of you probably as soon as you hear that your mind goes a little bit numb what is what are they talking about here

91
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,240
um the word kanda also means branches of a tree

92
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,760
so these are five branches it also means the trunk has both

93
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,800
meanings the trunk of a tree and the branches of a tree so

94
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:50,880
which which is really the tree is it the trunk is it the branch that goes off to the

95
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:56,080
right or the branch that goes off to the left which is the really the tree

96
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,680
and and or is it leaves at the end of the branches

97
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:07,760
no no really what's the tree is what you can't see it's the roots underneath that's really the tree

98
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:15,440
what's really the tree if we have five different opinions here but which is the really the tree

99
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:21,360
you could have a war this is the tree no no not the tree

100
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:27,680
and then why decide that any one thing is the tree why be attached to this has

101
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:33,839
to be the tree why not let the tree just be a tree

102
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:42,800
so we have these branches or we make these branches within the wholeness of who we are

103
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,720
and we can live in relationship to those and we can get attached

104
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,519
so the first one the buddha talks about is our appearance

105
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,760
the word is a rupa rupa in pali which often is translated as

106
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:09,920
the body or but the word more literally means

107
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:16,240
appearance it's what the one of the meanings is what the eye sees like so if i look down

108
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:21,920
at this bell the bell is the root bar because it's the sight object the object of sight

109
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:29,040
whatever the the what what but the fascinating thing about the word appearance

110
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:34,160
is that this appears to be a bell

111
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,200
is it really a bell well it's functionally it's a bell

112
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:44,480
but you know it could also be a begging bowl you know a

113
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:50,240
buddhist monastery could go around like this in the streets and people would recognize oh that's a begging bull

114
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,680
it could be a spittoon some buddhist teachers in

115
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,720
asia had these things about this size right next to them and it was kind of you know fascinating

116
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:09,600
to hear the middle of a dharma talk kind of clear their throat their loudest possible way and go

117
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,720
you know and spit into this spittoon

118
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,880
i don't know if could i get away with that here

119
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:28,480
and so this this is an appearance and so the our our appearance that we

120
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:36,000
have our physical appearance for example is a big part of it how our body appears to us

121
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:43,519
and this very important to understand how our body appears to us about instead of how our body actually is

122
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:49,279
because how it appears to us has a lot to do with the choices the mind makes select

123
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:56,320
selects about what's important about ourselves what we're focusing on

124
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:02,720
for some people like when i was a teenager probably one of the most important

125
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:08,959
appearances that i had that i was attached to was my hair

126
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,920
i had very long hair i had to worry about split ends

127
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,600
and uh and this was like a big thing you know the length of my hair and this and that

128
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:27,839
and probably probably during the day if i if i was thinking about my appearance that was mostly thinking about my my

129
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:35,680
hair and uh that's changed over the years and uh

130
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:41,120
so the so some people get very attached to their

131
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,000
appearance and some people their life is based on their appearance because a lot of their

132
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:53,040
life energy goes into doing that so i i don't know if this is fair it is but you know for example

133
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:58,160
bodybuilders some people are professional bodybuilders and that has a lot to do

134
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,880
with appearance there might be other reasons to be a bodybuilder but there are people who are very focused on their

135
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,360
physical appearance some people are more focused on their beauty or lack of beauty

136
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,959
than they are about the words they speak it's been a lot of time preparing you know

137
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:24,079
going out so that we can be beautiful or nice and going to salons and having the hair made

138
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:29,279
up or this and that they have beauty contests and some people i think make it their full-time

139
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,880
thing for a while to go to beauty contests some of this thing about the appearance

140
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:42,240
is very painful because our society makes definitions of what's the right way to be and appearance wise

141
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:49,120
in all kinds of ways in physical appearance and skin color race

142
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:55,920
height size all kinds of things and so the preoccupation with appearance

143
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,240
is not just because people have an inner disposition that way but society reinforces it

144
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:08,399
with a lot of suffering but we're still it's just a we end up with this

145
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:14,240
you know societally society participating

146
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,839
in creating these force fields in the middle of the meditational force fields

147
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,040
in the middle of our lives that now have heightened importance and value

148
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,240
and all kinds of dysfunctional activity can exist around this kind of thing around

149
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,440
appearance some of this concern with appearance is

150
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,360
a mind's creation sometimes a collective creation of many people in a society

151
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:48,000
and then people get attached to it and then there's the second thing that

152
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,959
the buddha said that people select out of the whole and they choose to highlight

153
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:01,839
and that is what in english in buddhist english is called feelings but it's not the emotions it's the

154
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:10,480
whether things are pleasant or unpleasant and some people are very focused on pleasure very focused on pain

155
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,079
and what's not unpleasant and within reason it's a reasonable thing

156
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:22,320
for human beings to be concerned with but you know to sit in a chair and be

157
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,600
uncomfortable and adjust it that's that seems fine but to

158
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:33,519
but to it's possible to select this thing about comfort and pleasure

159
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,759
and make it a primary orientation around how we live our lives some people spend much of their day

160
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,880
pursuing pleasure of all kinds of different types

161
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,839
or much of their day activated around feeling pain in some way pain is an unfortunate part of life

162
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:58,720
but to what degree is it selected out by the mind given more importance than it actually

163
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:04,240
is because of all the associations of what pain means and what's going to happen to me and the imagination into

164
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:11,520
the future and so pleasure and pain become for some people they're orient pri even a primary

165
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,839
orientation in their life and that's what you know what and so that becomes their force field that

166
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:23,199
becomes their what they cling to and so

167
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,200
and then there's the in the and the third one has to do with our

168
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,559
perceptions of things our recognition of things or ideas of what is

169
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:40,000
and this is a very the simplest ideas of of things that the mind makes

170
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,200
and some people their opinions their stories their ideas of how things are

171
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:50,960
becomes uh what's most interesting for them most what they're focusing on

172
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:57,520
simple ideas of right and wrong simple ideas of of

173
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:04,240
beauty and ugliness simple ideas of of um

174
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,559
roles we have identities we have and so

175
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:16,480
having the right ideas being able to recognize what's happening in terms of the world around us and

176
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:22,880
organizing according to ideas we have is how some people feel safe some people find their way

177
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:29,520
and so some people are very focused on perceptions and ideas and concepts

178
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,520
because concepts is what kind of you need to have in place to

179
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:40,840
be safe or get around and so some people that are very attached to ideas to

180
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:47,919
concepts like a concept of roles concepts of identity the concepts of

181
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:53,120
you know what should be in society and how other people should be

182
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:00,080
the fourth fourth area the buddha talked about is the the mental the world

183
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,320
inner mental world that that does all this constructing that

184
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:13,760
does all this imagining that does all this prioritization so when i was in that meditation hall

185
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,280
there was the mind was imagining this line

186
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:28,080
the mind was imagining what would happen if i got zapped by walking close to it and so i was living a deliberate life

187
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:34,799
in relationship to something my mind had created and so the fourth area was this area of

188
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:41,600
kind of deliberate construction stories ideas intentions plans

189
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:49,120
memories and stuff that you know complicated inner world that we construct

190
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,600
so the inner constructions that we make spending stories is a nice way of seeing it all the inner stories

191
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,760
we make and live in and some people get attached to that they attach to their memories attached

192
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:07,840
to ideas of the future and these loom are really big

193
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:15,520
and for some people that's where they get kind of bogged down or there's kind of the the it gets things get narrowed

194
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:21,280
into that world and then the fifth one that we have talked about

195
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:27,520
uh this division of the whole is the consciousness

196
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,799
that is aware of it all all the rest of it that which knows

197
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:39,760
that this is happening that's what knows this is a this is hearing this is seeing this is

198
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:47,280
smelling this is tasting this is the tactile sensations this is the mind activity that i see

199
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:53,679
and for some people that's what they get attached to and people who do a lot of meditation

200
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:59,760
sometimes that get really attached to consciousness because that everything else falls away

201
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:06,320
everything else you begin to see is rising and passing coming and going quiets down

202
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,480
and it doesn't seem like something to be so attached to but for some people consciousness seems

203
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,520
to be the ultimate thing the final thing you know i'm not i'm not all these

204
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,280
things i'm not the world i'm not my body i'm not my thoughts i'm not my beliefs

205
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:29,840
but we'll select consciousness as a thing to be this is who i am and that begins

206
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:36,880
having the projection that has people orient around that as being important and it's not some people or

207
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:41,919
their very sense of being existing is invested into consciousness so

208
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:47,520
consciousness will continue after i die so it's okay i'm safe

209
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:54,000
and so i need to know who i am and i know that i'm consciousness and it's very comforting because consciousness

210
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:59,679
is not the world not the things in the world so it's a place of safety and can't be touched

211
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:07,039
something like that so i'm not saying that all ideas like that are wrong but the point i'm trying to make today

212
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:14,320
is the way in which the whole of who we are gets divided into these different realms

213
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,000
and that once once that division is made each of these five branches

214
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:26,640
can be a place of attachment of clinging and for the buddha

215
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,240
it's not that we were supposed to not make these branches

216
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,400
necessarily the buddha was interested in how we overmake them

217
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:47,600
have too much focus on them and then get attached to them and he's and um and so there was uh

218
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:54,799
and for the buddha said that the way the way people are identified for the you know the way people are

219
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:00,799
apprehended the way people are observed is based on

220
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:07,200
uh where their mind dwells and if it dwells

221
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:15,039
on any one of these five areas then people are reckoned or measured or understood

222
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:20,240
by that way so if

223
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:25,520
if you spend a lot of time with your physical appearance

224
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:31,919
then you're not you're kind of recognized you're measured by that because i've seen people where wow that person's

225
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:38,400
really put a lot of work and effort into it day after day workout you know that's you know this is that's the person who's

226
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:44,799
really puts a lot of care into their appearance so that understood that almost like that

227
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:51,919
becomes their identity and with each of the other four when there's a really attached to that

228
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:58,320
then people the buddha said people are reckoned or understood through that category so it's not just

229
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:03,360
that we understand ourselves that way but that's how other people end up understanding them

230
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:10,880
as well so then we come to this wonderful little teaching

231
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:16,480
in relationship to all this and now that i've prepared the ground

232
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,080
the buddha had a friend who was a king king

233
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:28,720
and one day the king wanted to hear some teachings from some really wise person

234
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:35,120
and the buddha wasn't around and some of the other monks weren't around and so he was asking her you know who should

235
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:42,880
i go listen to and one of his advisors said oh there's this very wise nun buddhist nun

236
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:48,559
named kemah venerable kema

237
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,880
and uh she is really wise you should go visit her and he said great i'll go visit kema

238
00:24:54,880 --> 00:25:02,400
so he did and he asked her a question which uh i think was a big preoccupation

239
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:09,039
for some other people in ancient india it's a preoccupation that maybe some of

240
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:16,640
people here in the modern west have as well is what happens when we die

241
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:23,360
do we get or do we somehow get reborn do we go to heaven is there any kind of content

242
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:28,640
continue continue continuation of us after we die or is

243
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:34,480
this life the only thing we have and we know and when we die you know

244
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:39,840
it's all over it's done what is going on here

245
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:46,400
and so people would come to the buddha and ask him questions like this and so the buddha came to came this king

246
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:54,640
came to kemah and she asked this common question you see in the suttas

247
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:02,240
um [Music] so he starts

248
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:08,480
does the buddha exist after death will the buddha exist after that

249
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:13,760
and i think to ask about the buddha because the buddha was kind of one of the most respected spiritual teachers of

250
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,159
his time not just because he had a lot of knowledge but he had

251
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:27,200
attained something very important attained the highest states of humanity that they knew of back in ancient india

252
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,919
and so what happens to the buddha maybe you know if if the buddha

253
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:39,840
exists after life that tells me something about what i can expect or something

254
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:48,080
so does the buddha exist after death and the nun she said

255
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:54,240
the buddha has not declared this the buddha has not claimed that he exists

256
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:59,760
after death then reverend lady

257
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,080
does the buddha not exist after death

258
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,840
great king the buddha has not declared this either

259
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:20,120
then reverent lady does the buddha both exist and not exist after death

260
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:27,600
great king the buddha has not declared this then remember lady does that the tagatha

261
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:33,520
neither exist nor not exist after death great king the blessed one has not

262
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:42,080
declared this and the king is a little bit exasperated like that's all the possibilities that are

263
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,360
so you know what how does this work what's going on here

264
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:54,640
and so she says to the king well i will ask you a question

265
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:01,760
about the same matter answer it as you see fit what do you think great king

266
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:08,960
do you have an accountant or a calculator or a mathematician who can count the grains of sand in the

267
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:16,480
river ganges thus there are so many grains of sand there's so many hundreds of grains of sand there

268
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,840
are so many hundreds of thousands of grains of sand and the king says no i don't have anyone

269
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:27,360
who can count all the grains of sand do you have an accountant or calculator

270
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:34,159
a mathematician who can count the water in the great ocean thus there are so many gallons of water there

271
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:39,520
are so many hundreds of thousands of gallons of water no

272
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:45,039
reverend lady for what reason because the great ocean is deep

273
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:52,720
immeasurable hard to fathom so too grey king

274
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,360
that form that appearance by which one describing the buddha might describe

275
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:06,640
him has been abandoned by the buddha cut off it cut off at the root

276
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,039
made like a palm stump obliterated so that there's no more subject to

277
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,320
future arising the tathagata great king is liberated from

278
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:24,480
reckoning in terms of appearance he is deep immeasurable heart a fathom

279
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,600
like the great ocean and then he does the same thing these other five branches

280
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:38,559
that the people people will measure or see the buddha by

281
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:45,120
appearance by the feelings by perceptions by these mental constructs constructions and

282
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:51,679
consciousness but that the buddha has cut off now if we understand that these are

283
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:57,360
really parts of who we are what do you mean and uh

284
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,960
uh you know cut off appearance cut off feelings cut off perceptions

285
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,559
construct i mean that's who we are isn't it so that just then you don't exist

286
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:16,880
i think i understand this is the buddha has let go of any clinging

287
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,919
in any constructing of these force fields of these lines in the

288
00:30:23,919 --> 00:30:29,679
meditation hall in relationship to ourselves the buddha is not

289
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:35,520
creating a sense of self idea through

290
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:40,720
what we will call appearances is not involved in the world of appearances in an ordinary way

291
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,720
not not involved in creating importance and creating a world around feelings

292
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:53,840
around perceptions around stories and mental constructions in even around consciousness

293
00:30:53,840 --> 00:31:00,080
there's some dramatic way in which that tendency of human beings have has been let go

294
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:06,720
put aside and in doing so what is the buddha

295
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:14,559
and and she's the nun says uh he is deep immeasurable hard to fathom

296
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:21,120
like the great ocean so maybe that's your who you are

297
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,200
hard to fathom like the deep ocean

298
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:33,600
like you know as we have climate change and drought here in california and

299
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:41,440
technology improves and they're learning to harvest electricity from the tides and the waves

300
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:47,760
at some point we might move underwater that's the only place we'll survive

301
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:55,360
and then what we'll do is we'll you know we have you know we divide the property here in bay area you know part

302
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,039
b people have you know live in properties and some people live on properties that are

303
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:07,279
500 square feet some bigger you know so imagine that everyone will divide up the ocean

304
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:12,799
uh into maybe one acre blocks

305
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:18,080
square one acre square and we'll all buy squares in the ocean

306
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:24,720
and we'll have our underwater home in our square and people in the future will say what's the ocean oh the ocean is this place

307
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:30,880
that's built by all these blocks of properties and all these have these lines in them

308
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,399
and those lines like people fight over the lines and they have to get surveyors to come and get the right line and how

309
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:42,880
could you have crossed my line and above me there's people below those people you know because i have these blocks right

310
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:46,320
we've divided up the ocean

311
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,399
is that what the ocean is blocks of property owned

312
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:59,600
but right now we have this beautiful nearby for us here the pacific

313
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:06,640
deep immeasurable i go to the ocean sometimes the edge of it and watch and i marvel that it's been there for a long

314
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:13,279
time humans come and go civilizations come and go and

315
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,399
and those waves been lapping up on the shore kind of the waves have been

316
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,919
crossing the ocean for a billion years billions of years and

317
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:34,080
the depth of it been there for a long time it's deep it's immeasurable

318
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,679
what a sad thing it'd be if we divide it up into these lines and blocks and think that that's real

319
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:48,000
and fight over it what if our lives

320
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:53,440
what if we allow our lives to be immeasurable undivided

321
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:02,159
not attached to these things for the buddha his freedom

322
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:10,158
was to no longer live in these branches like with one branch being at the tree

323
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:17,919
but maybe being just the whole tree or maybe not even the tree

324
00:34:17,919 --> 00:34:25,118
is the tree separate from the soil from the other trees

325
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:31,358
the birds that come to it the nests that grow in it is it separate from the clouds and the

326
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:36,079
rain that comes down and the temperature and the sun

327
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:43,919
is it necessary to divide the world before humans came along

328
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:47,319
was it divided

329
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,158
certainly functionally it makes sense to divide and i think it's human human

330
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,680
minds will divide to find their food and eat and find the toilet

331
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,280
because if you don't it's a mess but the uh

332
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:14,720
but uh so it has some usefulness but do we cling to it do we

333
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,560
add more that's needed is there a way of living in an undivided

334
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:27,440
world where we are undivided with it as well

335
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:34,000
immeasurable deep where we cannot be reckoned because to

336
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:40,078
reckon who we are is to make a

337
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,160
invisible constructed line down the middle of something

338
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:55,520
so is there another way of living a being so one of the functions of this

339
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,079
meditation practice is to help us put to rest at least temporarily

340
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:09,359
some of the divisions we live under some of the ideas and constructs and prioritizations and choices we make this

341
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,359
is important this is what it's about and to have an experience of

342
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:23,280
i want to say ourselves but even not even of ourselves just an experience of being alive

343
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:28,640
that doesn't have to be defined by anything it doesn't have to select anything

344
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,640
from the suchness the fullness the wholeness of whatever that whatever

345
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:41,200
it's here and what a big difference it is to know that that's possible

346
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:46,400
to know that this too is a is a refuge

347
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:52,320
it puts a little question mark behind the way we normally live our lives

348
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,800
so that we don't give too much importance to it it's important our life's important

349
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:05,839
we care for others through some of these divisions so it's but to not raise them not solidify them

350
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:12,400
not say it has to be this way but to be fluid and free and to pick up

351
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:20,880
them pick up some of the divisions some of the ideas pragmatically functionally when they're useful and be ready to drop them

352
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:28,000
and um when they're not useful to live a life

353
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,320
so this division these five divisions is the is one of the very important teachings

354
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:41,760
of the buddha because this is for the buddha this is the areas where people cling

355
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:46,559
and if we want to be free we let go of that clinging

356
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:52,880
and what and who are you when you've let go of clinging like that

357
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:58,160
that the buddha doesn't declare he's not going to tell you who you are

358
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:04,839
isn't that great just like he doesn't tell people who he is

359
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:12,560
and maybe if you allow me to tell you a little bit who you are maybe then you're whole

360
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,839
and a whole hole with what hole with a hole

361
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:25,920
what is the whole i don't know

362
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:31,880
but we find out by not making it into anything

363
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:37,920
so may you maybe reflect a little bit about this

364
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:43,839
teaching and and maybe there are ways that you also live with

365
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:49,200
imagine lines down the middle of your life that

366
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:56,799
have had some influence on you a force field on you or something that maybe

367
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:03,599
you know someone will snap the fingers and poof you realize wait a minute

368
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:10,000
that doesn't really exist and maybe you'll be you can be free

369
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:15,838
so thank you very much
