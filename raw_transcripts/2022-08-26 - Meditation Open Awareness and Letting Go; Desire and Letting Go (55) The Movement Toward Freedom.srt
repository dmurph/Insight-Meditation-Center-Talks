1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,660
good to see everyone why don't we go ahead and get started

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:12,480
together on the meditation welcome if you're just joining and

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,460
welcome also if you've been here for a few minutes it's nice to see you in the chat

4
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:26,519
but now settling in and if you're comfortable doing so you can

5
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:34,800
close your eyes just allow the body and the mind to

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:41,040
settle into each other bringing the Mind into the present

7
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,820
moment this location this time

8
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:55,340
softening the eyes and the eye sockets

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:04,018
maybe even feeling the body settle back slightly I know I have a way of Leaning forward a

10
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,180
little bit when I'm on the computer sometimes

11
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:18,140
so just settling back letting the body be upright and stable

12
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:29,780
and softening the muscles of the face the eyes the jaw

13
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:39,619
inviting some Eaves through the neck the shoulders

14
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:44,359
arms and hands

15
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,100
down into the Torso the chest area

16
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:03,740
heart area releasing the diaphragm

17
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,740
and letting the belly area be softer

18
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:21,720
often a fair amount of Habitual holding throughout the Torso and just inviting

19
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,680
some ease

20
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:36,000
down through the hip joints feeling the contact with whatever we're sitting on

21
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,480
letting the body release into that and be supportive

22
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,319
and softening the legs and the feet

23
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:05,700
and then again broadening the attention to be aware of the whole body in the

24
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:13,220
sitting posture or whatever posture you're in you could be lying down or even standing

25
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,840
feeling the body as it is

26
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:28,280
and being at ease with how the body is maybe it's tired or has some pain

27
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,340
that's okay just invite ease in the mind about how

28
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,120
the body is

29
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,379
and then also sensing how the mind is

30
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,180
is there uh dominant emotion right now

31
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,260
or mood

32
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,280
how's the energy level was the mind a little dull or tired

33
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:13,640
or is it a little agitated from a lot of thinking

34
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,459
foreign

35
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:36,900
noticing that as we do in this practice we are aware of

36
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:44,940
what's happening in body and mind so there's mindfulness a simple knowing of what's Happening as

37
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:52,080
it's happening and sensing in the mind

38
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,539
what mindfulness feels like right now

39
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:25,919
and in this meditation we will gradually

40
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,120
praying more and more into our awareness

41
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:39,780
there's always a lot happening at the scent stores but we only

42
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:45,060
pay attention to part of it so it will be

43
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:50,900
exploring the whole range of what we can know

44
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,020
so beginning simply with sound

45
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:03,060
can hear the sound of my voice

46
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:10,199
maybe there's birds or the sound of other people in the

47
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,440
house

48
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:18,800
sound of cars

49
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:29,180
just opening to the field of sound

50
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:36,840
a sound without needing to have opinions about each sound that we

51
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,080
hear

52
00:06:55,020 --> 00:07:00,539
one quality of sound is that we don't know what sound is going to

53
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:07,680
come next we don't have much control that can be useful

54
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,960
to just sit and be receptive

55
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,780
foreign

56
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:04,199
now also opening attention to the sensations of the breath

57
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:11,819
breathing in and out as the body becomes more

58
00:08:11,819 --> 00:08:17,520
still even a little bit often the breath is the largest movement

59
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,539
that we feel I'm just tuning into

60
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:29,360
a simple sensations of in and out breathing

61
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:37,620
and if you also hear sounds that's fine but it's it's also fine just to turn the

62
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,000
attention to the breath

63
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:19,320
we can notice how the breath is a whole series of Sensations

64
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,360
almost like a kaleidoscope

65
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:28,939
cascading through the body

66
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,839
slightly different each time the way snowflakes are different

67
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:49,940
so like sound there's kind of a varied landscape of the sensations of breathing

68
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:36,899
foreign and opening the awareness further

69
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:42,680
to include all the little Sensations throughout the body

70
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:52,560
we might first notice that the breath isn't just in the physical lungs

71
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,519
that may feel like the breath energy spreads throughout the body

72
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:06,920
all through the Torso and even into the arms and legs and head

73
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:17,760
or if that isn't quite evident we also have the touch sensations of the contact

74
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,480
points the seed against the cushion the legs or feet on the floor

75
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,320
perhaps the hands are touching each other or the legs

76
00:11:32,459 --> 00:11:39,000
there are a number of other physical Body Sensations

77
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,699
that we can include in our growing range of awareness

78
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:15,260
and as we tune in with a generally

79
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:22,339
receptive even curious awareness there can be a sense of ease

80
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:30,139
for just exploring the territory of Sensations

81
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,139
nothing needs to be changed

82
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:45,600
you know as we continue to open the awareness

83
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:53,480
we can bring in the field of emotions we're now moving into their mind

84
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:02,519
you can sense if there's a mood overall

85
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:08,339
sadness or appreciation or interest

86
00:14:08,339 --> 00:14:14,040
or there may not be a dominant mood may just be kind of neutral

87
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:22,639
and you can sew we can also have short-term emotions passing through

88
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:32,000
a tickle of amusement adhering something

89
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:42,800
or a little bit of annoyance at persistent pain

90
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:52,800
the emotions too or like a landscape varied

91
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:58,920
changing they're actually likened in the

92
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,880
teachings to wins

93
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,220
flowing through

94
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:18,839
and as with the other experiences we just include them as something else to

95
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:26,339
be noticed in mindfulness foreign

96
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:55,620
and further Opening Our awareness we can include the whole field of

97
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:03,500
thoughts and volitions very related to emotions

98
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:11,820
but still a broadening so we're allowing even thought to arise

99
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:18,740
and pass if it's there and just be noticed as thought

100
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:25,580
not so much the content of the thoughts but the process of thinking

101
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:33,440
if it's there maybe it isn't

102
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:41,179
one more thing to notice in the field of experience it's part of Being Human

103
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:08,720
can help to imagine the mind as a big broad space

104
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:14,340
or sky in which all these different experiences

105
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,500
can be seen The Sounds coming and going

106
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:25,980
various Body Sensations emotions thoughts

107
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:31,500
all of them can arise shift and change

108
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:37,559
and pass away in this broad space of the Mind

109
00:19:37,559 --> 00:19:44,640
and we don't have any preference for one thing over another whatever wants to come and whatever

110
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,720
wants to go

111
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:11,220
if we find ourselves wishing for something to come or wishing or something to go

112
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:19,679
than the wish is what we notice oh there's there's a volition or a wishing in the

113
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:23,360
mind one more thing to notice

114
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:38,460
and then one more thing that we can notice is the quality of knowing in the mind

115
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:43,679
there are all these things that we know experiences

116
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,140
and there is also the knowing

117
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:55,100
can we notice even the knowing part of the Mind

118
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:07,559
so there's all the things that come and go in the sky and there's the sky also

119
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:10,640
the sky itself

120
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:19,399
that is the whole Space of Human Experience

121
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:51,480
if it's not so easy to see the knowing it's possible to ask the question what

122
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:58,380
knows this we don't exactly get an answer but there

123
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:04,280
may be kind of a shift in experience how was this

124
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:09,980
and then we can rest with that shift

125
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:38,900
so let go of directing your practice it's all just happening

126
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:55,320
there's a saying in Zen the great way is not difficult for those who have no

127

thank you

132
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,240
a few minutes the meditation will be over

133
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,760
and the conditions will shift

134
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:17,000
and yet it will be the same set of experiences

135
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:23,279
sounds various other sensations of the body

136
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:30,899
including seeing various movements in the mind emotions

137
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:39,980
thoughts volitions to do things and the knowing of those things

138
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:49,278
because the mind has awareness just the proportion is going to change

139
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:55,820
and it's interesting to consider could we carry this sense of

140
00:27:55,820 --> 00:28:01,860
inclusiveness of wholeness into

141
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:08,960
the changed conditions of being more in the world

142
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:15,600
and what benefit might that offer if we came with a sense of open

143
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,960
receptiveness we'll still take actions volitions will

144
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:30,059
happen things may come about but somehow that's determined by the

145
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:33,320
needs of the moment

146
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,899
sometimes it's said that it's not that we're going to become free

147
00:28:48,899 --> 00:28:57,620
it's that the world is going to become free of us and so our experience goes on

148
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:03,299
but there's not so much interference or obstruction from

149
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:11,760
me needing for things to happen a certain way me needing my preferences to be taken

150
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:16,700
care of it's a whole different way of being

151
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,520
one that serves everyone ourself included but the whole situation that

152
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:32,179
we're in becomes what we serve

153

156
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:42,779
desire and letting go and I've been asked to spell the poly

157
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:49,700
words so here they are the one that I used for sense desire

158
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:56,039
comma is K long a so that's an a with a

159
00:30:56,039 --> 00:31:03,899
bar over it m a comma different from the word for this the

160
00:31:03,899 --> 00:31:12,659
poly word for the Sanskrit Karma which is k-a-m-m-a with two M's and no long a so K long a m

161
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:18,659
a and then the word for renunciation is Nick comma

162
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:25,620
n e k k h a m m a

163
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:33,059
so there you go you can see they look slightly different but they are somewhat related

164
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:40,220
Okay so we've seen that there are different kinds of Desire some rather coarse and generally

165
00:31:40,220 --> 00:31:45,779
unwholesome and some that are more refined and and that the associated

166
00:31:45,779 --> 00:31:51,659
happiness with getting various things is also coarser or more

167
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:57,840
refined so we know that material Pleasures are not as deep or as elevated

168
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:03,899
anyhow you Orient the scale as the well-being that comes from ethics

169
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:11,640
Goodwill and states of meditative calm but most importantly wholesome desires

170
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:18,179
are onward leading they help develop the path and so the Buddha encouraged us to

171
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:25,140
move along the path by asking us to notice how the mind can become more more refined through letting

172
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:30,779
go of for this coarser however we have to be careful not to get

173
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:36,539
the idea that this is a linear progression and Liberation is simply the

174
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:42,240
upper limit of loftiness or maybe even some Transcendent realm

175
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,360
that's far loftier than what we can imagine here on Earth

176
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:53,700
um this kind of view is easy to develop actually but it it isn't helpful in the

177
00:32:53,700 --> 00:33:00,539
end I tend to allow ideas of Superior and inferior and it allows there to be a

178
00:33:00,539 --> 00:33:08,340
certain ego identification with refinement So today we're going to talk about what

179
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:14,580
is the movement toward freedom it's natural at some point to Aspire to

180
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:21,779
spiritual Freedom you know what if we decide that we want to let go of all forms of suffering and we want to take

181
00:33:21,779 --> 00:33:30,299
the happiness of letting go all the way but then we encounter a seeming paradox

182
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:35,880
what if what if we want to stop wanting can we wish for Freedom From Desire does

183
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:42,019
that make sense so we'll get to that and we'll get to that in a moment

184
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:49,940
I just want to mention a couple of other quotes from the sutas because it's good to know up front that renunciation

185
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:55,019
prepares the mind for awakening it does actually say that in the teachings

186
00:33:55,019 --> 00:34:02,640
so for example here's one um desire and greed for the eye ear nose

187
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:09,540
tongue body or mind so all six senses is a Corruption of the mind when a

188
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:18,240
practitioner has given up this corruption in these six cases their mind inclines to renunciation a mind imbued

189
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,398
with renunciation is declared to be capable of directly knowing anything

190
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:30,780
that can be realized and then when a practitioner has four

191
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:35,940
things their practice is guaranteed and they have laid the groundwork for ending

192
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:42,540
the defilements which means Awakening what for thoughts of renunciation Good

193
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:48,540
Will and harmlessness and Right View when a practitioner has these four

194
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:55,260
things their practice is guaranteed and they have laid the groundwork for ending the defilements

195
00:34:55,260 --> 00:35:01,099
so we can feel assured that renunciation in those texts it was in a comma

196
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:06,540
poises the mind for deeper wisdom and realization

197
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,940
in fact the attitude of renunciation even persists after Awakening so um

198
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:18,060
here's another one when a monk is an arahond who has reached fulfillment which means that

199
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:23,160
they're fully awakened they are dedicated to renunciation it is because

200
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,339
of the ending of greed the ending of hatred and the ending of delusion that

201
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:35,280
they are dedicated to renunciation okay so we're convinced that what we're

202
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,280
talking about here really is integral to Freedom but if we want to take letting go all

203
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:49,020
the way we're going to have to look a little bit more carefully at what's actually going on with letting go

204
00:35:49,020 --> 00:35:54,619
so as we mature on the path we start to experience that there is a distinction

205
00:35:54,619 --> 00:36:00,599
between volitional letting go and some kind of letting go that's not

206
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,560
volitional so there are many times in the practice where we see some reactivity in the mind

207
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:13,079
and we consciously that is volitionally steer in some other direction in fact

208
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:19,760
just recently I was fatigued at the end of a long day and I felt my mind inclining toward

209
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:25,500
irritation with some sound that was going on outside and I brought up the

210
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:30,960
reminder that the sound is impermanent you know this irritating sound is not

211
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:37,980
going to last even though it was trying to irritate me while I was fatigued so that's choosing wisdom in order to

212
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:44,280
counter aversion and it was easy to let go of the irritation and kind of elevate the Mind

213
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:50,220
by remembering impermanence but I did feel like I was doing that and

214
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:58,200
so I can you know at times I can carry in my mind the idea that I'm reshaping my mind by making choices like this and

215
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:04,440
that these choices become available because I'm practicing mindfulness you know that's that's a common way to think

216
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:10,680
and it's true to a certain degree but there's also we can also begin to

217
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,960
experience that there's release that simply comes about when the conditions

218
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,900
are there and the mind is seen clearly it's fairly common for mindfulness

219
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:28,440
practitioners to suddenly realize that they're behaving differently without trying

220
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:35,220
so you know maybe for the last two decades you've been habitually tense

221
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:41,880
when talking to certain relative you knew that maybe you were tense even before that but you didn't know it but

222
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,420
you feel physically tense when you're talking to someone um and then one day you become aware

223
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:54,599
that you're talking with them and your body feels relaxed you know you didn't consciously practice

224
00:37:54,599 --> 00:38:00,000
with body awareness with this relative you didn't attend workshops on social

225
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,940
anxiety or cultivating Equanimity but when you examine your mind you realize

226
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:11,099
that some defensiveness is simply gone you don't feel any threat from this

227
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:19,140
relative as you used to they're just as they are and you can be with that how did that happen you know

228
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:27,000
don't you have to actively work on the issues that you want to let go of actually no not all of them

229
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:34,020
and we can only go so far on the path if we want to be the ones doing it

230
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:41,040
so as we let go of the unhelpful forms of Desire grasping and holding on and

231
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:49,560
even pursuing some of the normal sense pleasures of human life we can tap into a powerful movement of

232
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:54,960
release that is not done by us it is a movement toward and that was the general

233
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:02,460
term that I'm calling desire this week this tendency of the human mind to be able to move toward things we feel that

234
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:09,480
but we realize that we're not the ones doing it and so we begin to suspect and

235
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:14,820
to actually see that those beautiful qualities that we were wanting or

236
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:21,599
practicing toward there seemed to come about naturally in the wake of releasing the unwholesome

237
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:26,940
habits so I meta emerges when ill will is

238
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:33,300
released and maybe at first we can cultivate meta a little bit we can breathe some life

239
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:39,660
into it we can bolster it a little bit but if we look carefully we start to see this deeper

240
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:46,500
process at work where when we release ill will it's actually just that meta is there

241
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:54,240
so sometimes it feels like the Heart Is by itself dropping painful habits and

242
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:59,520
sometimes it feels like the heart is moving toward the Deep peace of not

243
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,760
grasping they're kind of like the front and back of the hand whether we're moving away from suffering or toward the

244
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,640
end of suffering but either way there's a growing sense that it's not a willful

245
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,520
creation that we're doing I once told Gil at the near the

246
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:24,900
beginning of my practice that I had had heard that desire was the cause of suffering but I still had the desire for

247
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:31,020
freedom this is actually a very common question among Dharma students and Gill

248
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:36,660
said what most Dharma teachers say in some version he said oh you can have

249
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:45,000
that desire Kim until it's the last one so it's fine to want the more elevated

250
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,579
aspects of life like ethics and compassion and wisdom but bit by bit we

251
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:56,760
have to drop even those lofty Desires in order to move move fully into those

252
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:03,000
States so take compassion for example I would say that we become fully

253
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:08,280
compassionate when we're no longer striving to let go of Cruelty when we're

254
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:14,220
no longer aiming to generate compassion and when we don't view ourselves as

255
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:22,680
being a compassionate person we can have some degree of compassion with all of those things but it becomes full when

256
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:30,540
compassion is just natural and unself-conscious so gradually along this path and it is

257
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:36,240
gradual we gradually concede our volitional desires to this more

258
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:42,240
non-relational movement of the Dharma and then maybe the last aspirate the

259
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,400
last thing to go is this aspiration of the heart for complete freedom

260
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:53,400
that we can sort of incline the mind in that direction but then it's no longer up to us

261
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:59,160
so I'm I want to read a quote from Aya Kemah who was a wonderful

262
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:07,079
um bikuni Western bikuni she was German and she was born yesterday on August 25th in

263
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:12,960
1923 so she would have been 99. this is from her

264
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,420
trying to achieve something in the spiritual world is just as foolish as

265
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:25,859
trying to achieve something in the material world there is nothing to achieve there's only letting go as we

266
00:42:25,859 --> 00:42:31,380
let go more and more of ego identification desires and support

267
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:36,200
systems Bliss will arise

268
00:42:38,520 --> 00:42:45,599
so it's interesting um you know what do we do practically with these teachings on renunciation I

269
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:50,819
want to kind of Bring It Back Down To What We can each work with

270
00:42:50,819 --> 00:42:55,859
I would say that please only let go of what makes sense

271
00:42:55,859 --> 00:43:01,920
for you to let go that will be fine the volitional renunciation of various

272
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,380
material things that we realize we don't need and various unwholesome mental

273
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:14,220
habits if we work on those that will gradually help build momentum toward

274
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:20,579
this non-volitional letting go and that is what carries the heart beyond even the wholesome even the

275
00:43:20,579 --> 00:43:28,020
Beautiful to what is free so in a sense the deepest happiness comes when we no longer want even

276
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:34,260
happiness but we don't have to worry about that and we just we just let go of the next

277
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:39,720
thing that feels like it's limiting us and the process will go on I have so

278
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:47,220
much faith in it so to kind of tie things up

279
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:53,099
desire which is this movement toward that we have naturally in the mind that

280
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:58,140
can help us walk the path only one part of this broad space of

281
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:04,980
Desire is harmful and then there are these more elevated desires that lead to

282
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:11,700
deeper forms of happiness and that makes them onward leading because the mind is motivated to keep moving toward refined

283
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:18,900
happiness but to continue deepening we'll have to let go of volition and ideas of

284
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,180
achievement like I have came and said so true Letting Go comes about without

285
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:29,579
our help in a sense eventually we get squeezed into releasing all of our

286
00:44:29,579 --> 00:44:35,640
desires so it's a process that makes sense I would say as you do it there's no need

287
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:41,880
to manufacture it or to push ahead or to try to let go of something that we don't

288
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:48,500
understand why we have to let go of it each Insight that we have and each little thing that we release

289
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:54,359
helps us go on to the next thing so it's actually kind of a path of trust of

290
00:44:54,359 --> 00:45:01,619
trusting that desire and letting go do form an onward leading process that will

291
00:45:01,619 --> 00:45:07,020
eventually take the mind all the way and every little bit that we're working

292
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:13,140
on whatever we're doing right now in that process is beautiful and is helping

293
00:45:13,140 --> 00:45:18,960
us to feel more free in this moment and is helping others around us as we grow

294
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:25,140
and develop in the Dharma so this is kind of one lens that we can

295
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:33,119
put onto the path of Awakening it's about desire and letting go and I hope the journey this week has has been good

296
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:39,980
and that you know may it continue for all of us so thank you very much
