1
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:05,840
what a delight to sit with other people

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,400
to feel the energy of the people in this room has been wonderful

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:22,240
so so gil was unable to make it this morning

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,080
and um that's kind of a lovely thing for me as i said earlier

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,239
i haven't been here in a couple of years and that's unusual

6
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:39,520
it's an unusual circumstance even even driving here this morning i thought

7
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,800
how familiar it all was how familiar and how

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:53,440
how much it has been absent the absence of what was once so familiar i have a

9
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,640
i have a an electric car and it it saves addresses and imc is saved and in

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,920
defaults every every time i get in the car it defaults to coming to imc

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,760
and so for two years i've been putting up with which what has become an irritation and this morning it was true

12
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,000
whoa um

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,479
and sitting up here is familiar although i haven't set cross-legged since i fell

14
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:32,000
the first of september so i'm experiencing unusual hip movement so

15
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:38,960
that's just how it is you know we're we we come into this day and this is how it is

16
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:46,640
and that's what i'd like to talk with you about this morning i want to talk about impermanence and the familiar

17
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:52,960
and how they intersect and when they don't and what this means for us in our

18
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,960
practice so

19
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:05,360
while the teaching of the dharma has not changed over the last two years the context the context for talking about

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,840
the dharma has changed a great deal

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,120
i've noticed a lot of changes in my own personal practice i do uh online groups practice

22
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:22,160
discussion groups which if you've never tried i really invite you to try they're quite

23
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,680
wonderful and each time i meet with a group it is

24
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:35,280
a realization that these people are showing up in this moment with these issues with these conditions

25
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,760
and that each time is unique each breath is unique

26
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:48,480
there is a patina of the familiar sitting in this hall you know that's a that's that's sort of

27
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:54,000
the coding that goes over surfaces the patina this this statue has a particular

28
00:02:54,000 --> 00:03:00,959
patina over the bronze that makes keeps it this color and the familiar life that we live

29
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:09,200
does the same thing we don't often think about how the familiar becomes a condition

30
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:14,400
for this moment we talk about it in different ways you know we cultivate

31
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,840
skillful practices so that it becomes a habit for us

32
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,920
but it turns out that largely we humans have kind of a plan for how the day is

33
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,799
going to go i'm not talking about the agenda plan i'm talking about what we expect to happen in the next moment or

34
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:40,319
the next hours or the next days or the next weeks we expect things to be a certain way

35
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:47,680
because we become accustomed to thinking about things that way we become accustomed this is this is how life

36
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,239
works and this is when it feels right

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:01,599
now sometimes that has to do with our ideals how we'd like things to be

38
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:08,480
but it's the basic assumptions that we have about how things are the assumptions we have about how things are

39
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:16,560
without noticing how they are that becomes the trap for us

40
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,400
we have a plan i call it an experience bias

41
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,320
my experience leads me to believe what i think about that experience leads me to

42
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,560
believe and so of course this is what it's like to sit in a hall

43
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:41,440
let me tell you how different this is never have i given a dharma talk in a mask

44
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,639
not only do i hear my voice and feel my hands now i'm feeling the breath inside this

45
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:53,919
mask and i it feels a little muffled and my voice sounds a little muffled and

46
00:04:53,919 --> 00:05:00,960
generally it's the same but it is not the same it is

47
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:05,759
according to the conditions of this moment

48
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:12,160
we have an idea about what should be happening and then you know life happens

49
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:20,720
and we have strategies right so this morning it's not as noticeable here but where i live up by 280 there's

50
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:26,320
it's extremely foggy very dense fog and there was a bicyclist that pulled in

51
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:32,639
front of me i was going up sand hill toward 280 and there's a place where the bicyclists have to cross the

52
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,479
line of traffic going to san francisco to get in the bike lane to continue out sand hill

53
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:43,600
and it was so so thick i just barely saw him and i saw

54
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,440
the fear in his eyes you know i blinked my lights to let him know i had seen him as he was crossing

55
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:56,319
that lane of traffic but i imagined how frightening that could be

56
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,680
and how fortunate it was that i was actually looking for a bicyclist because

57
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,960
i'm familiar with the area and therefore i saw him and that that moment of uncertainty

58
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,039
and the the my preparedness for a bicyclist made it more likely i would see him

59
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:22,560
but it wasn't a given and one of the things that's been on my mind particularly this morning was

60
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,440
from the talk that gil gave last week where he was talking about time and he made a statement

61
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:35,039
that has really stuck with me and he said hurrying is an attachment going fast is

62
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:40,479
not and that we can behave in a certain way

63
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:47,680
but when we are attached to some outcome of that behaving a certain way that's when we create suffering

64
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:55,280
when we're attached to what is normal that creates suffering this folks where we are sitting now

65
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,160
wherever you are sitting is normal

66
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,639
everything else is a fantasy it may not be what we want

67
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:14,000
what we hope for what we dream about my family right now is in london

68
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:21,199
to me that's terrifying what are they doing going to london they're all multiply vaccinated and you

69
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:27,360
know they haven't seen their in-laws the other side of the family for three years and they're old

70
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:34,479
and they want to see them i get it normal for me is worrying about my

71
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:40,960
family in the context of the pandemic that is normal

72
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:47,360
if i treat it as an imposition i'm denying this is how it is

73
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,400
this is how it is sometimes we embrace it you know the

74
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,120
unexpected the not according to plan i would put winning lottery winnings in this category you know how great how

75
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,400
lucky can you be this is wonderful sometimes we marvel

76
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:10,879
you know i get to be a grandmother without ever having children of my own because i married someone who had

77
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:16,479
children how great how lucky for me so i get the delight of that i embrace

78
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,720
that the unexpected can have

79
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:27,360
pleasant outcomes or unpleasant outcomes they just are the things that happen in

80
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,000
life the experiences we have are just those experiences and somehow we have this idea that we

81
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:40,640
should be able to control the nature of those experiences which is denying the fact that there are

82
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,839
very few conditions that are conditioning this moment that we actually have any influence on much

83
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,880
less control over

84
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:59,360
now we can we can name things like the pandemic or the weather or taxes

85
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:08,640
but the very air we breathe we don't have control over it

86
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,680
what we have some measure of influence on

87
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,360
are the ways that we approach this moment

88
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,639
the attitude with which i meet this moment

89
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:31,839
we tend to think of our experiences not in increments but as a continuing stream

90
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:37,760
you know my life happened it's these things happened and they led to those things and led to those things and led to those

91
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,680
things and led to this moment and we have this idea that life is this stream

92
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:52,080
and we don't really think of it as packets of experience and it's this continuing stream

93
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:58,640
bias that we have that leads us to think that the familiar is what is right

94
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,760
that the familiar is somehow something we can navigate but we're really creating the familiar

95
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,000
in our minds we're creating the familiar in our minds

96
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,519
there are two things that that i read a lot of besides dharma things and those are

97
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:22,800
neuroscience and the pandemic and as a former scientist i spend a lot of time

98
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,920
reading the scientific papers and neuroscience is doing amazing things

99
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:35,120
these days and our assumptions about how the brain works how the mind works

100
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:41,279
are mostly obsolete uh so so i was reading a book by lisa

101
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:48,000
barrett and i just took this line out of it it says

102
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,959
every thought memory emotion or perception that you construct in your life

103
00:10:54,959 --> 00:11:00,120
includes something about the state of your body

104
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:08,160
wow the book is about how in fact we don't think about our emotions and react to

105
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,519
our emotions but that the thinking is just justifying the emotions that are already there the emotions we actually construct

106
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:22,160
by information from our bodies and and sort of absorbing what that means

107
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,680
lands us right in the middle of our buddhist practice it implores us to be aware of what's

108
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:33,839
happening now because that's what's creating constructing our emotions

109
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:41,600
and that the habits of mind that we have are the ways in which we react to

110
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:48,240
what's happening but the brain is busy just gathering data

111
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:55,920
and sometimes makes decisions without the data the current data if it's it's based on what's happened in the past

112
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:02,079
these conditions are there and therefore this is what is required but it doesn't know about these

113
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:08,600
conditions we can be aware of these conditions

114
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:24,000
resistance to what we think of as normal resistance to now is not being normal

115
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,880
resistance to normal are all still resistance you know

116
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,000
if if i get in a slump because things just aren't as lively as they

117
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:44,959
used to be they aren't as oh i don't get to travel as much i don't get to i walked in the hall i saw

118
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:50,240
friends i wanted to hug i couldn't hug them what's that about

119
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:56,320
well that's the condition of now

120
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:06,880
why in order to feel affection in my heart do i need

121
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:14,000
a more familiar way of engaging people i can ignore

122
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:22,560
the rising of affection in my heart and dampen it by what i am missing

123
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:30,639
or i can just feel the delight and those choices have to do with how i

124
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:35,839
relate to what is familiar

125
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,680
i invite you to become well aware of what you constitute

126
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:50,399
how you influence and condition your life your body by what is familiar

127
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:57,360
which is not to say that familiar is bad it is a great joy to me that i can sit

128
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:04,160
this way on the on this dice with in meditation pose and i haven't

129
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:11,839
tried it for a couple of months and look at that it's not only possible it's very possible oh

130
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,920
i can be delighted at that or i can think about all those missed opportunities

131
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,360
which didn't exist

132
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,839
didn't exist when there are too many deviations from

133
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:36,160
what we think is familiar from what is familiar to us we begin to build up a set of

134
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:42,560
resistances resentments we feel a sense of betrayal

135
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,760
you know it's been it's very common to hear someone say well you know they promised us this would be

136
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,800
over by now well based on the information that was

137
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:59,839
available then that's what it looked like

138
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:08,000
okay that's not how it is how do i meet that

139
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:16,800
i can have the thought of betrayal of not fair

140
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:22,160
not fair it just feels not fair

141
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:27,360
oh what's that about i'm not feeling something not

142
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,120
oh i'm not getting what i expected fairness doesn't have anything to do

143
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,959
with it really if i if i notice that thought i don't banish the thought

144
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:46,320
i say what's where do i feel that not fairness what's what's not fair and i feel the wanting

145
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,199
the leaning towards something else i can feel that

146
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:00,079
is in being mindful of this notion

147
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:06,480
and saying what else is in this notion what else is here

148
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:15,959
that allows me to keep from putting something in a box i label familiar and say oh my god i'm so depressed

149
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:29,680
if we're truly in touch with impermanence with the arising and passing away of all

150
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:36,639
things we recognize that we have to disentangle from this

151
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:43,680
idea that everything is this continuous stream with a well-known past and a projected

152
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:48,880
future life appears to be a stream just as we

153
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:55,440
appear to be a continuous person even though even the cells of our body

154
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,480
are sloughed off every couple of months they're totally different

155
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:08,720
but you know the overall pattern the over all familiar part is well that hasn't changed has it it appears not to

156
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:14,558
change because we have this continuing stream

157
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:21,038
this continuing stream of what we think experience is and we link all our experiences together and we give them

158
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:23,438
meaning

159
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:33,440
what you notice when you contemplate this is it's all about how we think about

160
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:38,960
experience what we think about what's happening now

161
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,240
what we think about it's it's all of those thoughts

162
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:49,760
rearranging the experience into a pattern i'm taking all these clumps and i'm

163
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:55,519
making it look like this and it is the collage of my life

164
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,720
but if we can become disenchanted with our own story

165
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:09,760
we have the opportunity to just meet these experiences

166
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:17,039
these experiences of this moment fresh eyes

167
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:28,720
when we follow our breath we're not thinking about how the breath was yesterday we're really just following

168
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:35,120
our breath that practice of nowness of suchness

169
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:44,799
is not just for breathing it's about the experiences of our lives

170
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:53,120
if we can disentangle ourselves from the story of my life

171
00:18:54,320 --> 00:19:00,320
then it becomes possible to more closely see what is arising in this moment

172
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:08,160
what's arising in this moment as distinct from our experiences of the

173
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:14,880
familiar this happens in unexpected ways this attachment to the familiar you know

174
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:20,320
uh i've lived with my husband for over 30 years maybe 35 years i've stopped

175
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,320
counting and he has some habits that irritate me

176
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:31,679
as i do from his point of view this is not a one-way street but one of

177
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:37,039
the things he does is uh he he has a much higher tolerance for

178
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:42,880
clutter than i do that clutter pervades he has his own office space

179
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:49,120
which i do not enter because i will immediately start picking things up which of course he finds very

180
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,360
irritating but the shared spaces i bump into

181
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:02,080
often and while we have grown to accommodate each other over the years

182
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:08,960
i can see when the conditions are right when i am maybe in a hurry

183
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:16,159
that his clutter notice that's his clutter clutter left by him

184
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:21,679
not picked up by me becomes especially irritating and i notice that irritation and that

185
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:27,840
jitteriness and and then i remind myself that it isn't about him

186
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:33,760
it's not even about me it's about attachment to an outcome that

187
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:42,159
that clutter is getting in the way of but because it has become so familiar it becomes very easy to blame him

188
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:48,640
for my attachment to some outcome and sometimes i even notice that happening

189
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,760
right i'll go okay this is not about him not about him

190
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,200
this is you wanting something and that allows me

191
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:06,559
to be consistent with one of my intentions in life which is to be kind to my husband

192
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:13,679
and in the moment that i realize this is not about him i become aware of that intention also

193
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:20,320
and my heart softens that happens

194
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:26,480
it isn't about me saying i'm not going to behave that way it's about a series of realizations that

195
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:34,159
happens in the now okay irritability irritability

196
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:40,480
not him [Music] i can feel irritability in my in my body

197
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:47,280
he's not in my body this is in me this irritation irritation

198
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,559
irritation it's not that my knee hurts it's irritation

199
00:21:52,559 --> 00:22:00,640
because i'm rushing rushing oh i i have a plan i have something i want to do

200
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:07,360
realizing that in a moment it isn't that i'm a bad person it's that i see

201
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,880
attachment to some outcome and that pause

202
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,760
the pause created by that seeing allows me to recall my intention

203
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:25,120
of kindness and the heart softens

204
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:30,880
i don't order my heart to soften that would be a useless instruction

205
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,120
it happens in the course of seeing clearly

206
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:44,000
this is the real value of mindfulness and the acceptance of impermanence and

207
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:50,799
not allowing the pattern to become the defining characteristic of now

208
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:56,080
i'm influenced by the pattern i'm subject to the pattern

209
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,840
but if i see the pattern

210
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:08,960
other possibilities exist i'm remembering a time when

211
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:16,000
when i told my mother-in-law who is no longer with us that my next house our next house was

212
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,400
going to be more zen-like and she said and who will you be married to

213
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,640
she then apologized for not bringing him up correctly but

214
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:37,440
this is all a sense of patterns and how we think things should be how we think about our

215
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:44,320
experience becomes a condition of the experience so it becomes very important to notice

216
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,080
how we're thinking about what's happening to be aware of how the mind is imposing

217
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:57,200
some thought pattern on the experience and to get as closely as possible to the

218
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,320
rawness of that experience and not stop with the first word we come

219
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:06,240
up with to say oh this is what this is

220
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:17,080
what is closest to us try to get as close in that mindfulness as possible

221
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:23,440
what else is here what else is here

222
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,520
i'm restless i'm jittery well jitteriness is here if i don't

223
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,400
identify with the jitteriness with the restlessness i have an opportunity to see what else is present

224
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:45,080
i don't have to jump in the vat of restlessness

225
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:53,600
i can see discomfort maybe i don't have to name discomfort maybe i don't have to give it a familiar name

226
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:57,799
maybe i can just say unpleasant

227
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,360
now i could argue that the smell of a ripe tree cheese can be unpleasant and it can also

228
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,320
taste delicious

229
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:18,000
and any moment that we experience unpleasantness we can look at the unpleasantness and

230
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:23,279
the very act of seeing oh this is unpleasant allows us to

231
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:29,679
slip back and settle into a place of seeing that is a moment of ease and

232
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:35,039
equanimity maybe it's just the briefest of moments

233
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:42,480
but notice it it is the in the noticing the awareness

234
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:49,919
of what's happening that we become that we form memories and that we form other patterns

235
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:55,840
we give the brain other information that it adds to this store of information

236
00:25:55,840 --> 00:26:03,279
when it's making up its vision of what familiar is and we can become familiar with the

237
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:10,559
aha in the same way when we're meditating

238
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:15,679
and we notice that the mind has gone off into a story and we say oh

239
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:22,840
that's the very moment when we are here the very moment and we can say oh i'm

240
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,080
here and this becomes a practice for any moment

241
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,120
any moment when we are aware enough to say i am here

242
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,200
is a moment of being awake a moment of justice of just this

243
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:46,240
experience it's not that we arrive at this place by

244
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,600
some magical absorption of qualities or you know

245
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,000
some practice that makes us all of a sudden aware of every moment

246
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:07,720
it's just this moment this moment is the only moment that we can actually be responsible for

247
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:15,520
and i can allow myself to wander off into some place or i can notice my hand drifting off

248
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:22,960
into the air and in the noticing there is a form of awareness here

249
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:30,799
that is a registering when we talk about mindfulness

250
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:36,000
we remember that there is the object there is the knowing the object

251
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,120
and there is knowing we know that last step

252
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:46,640
that awareness step is crucial in coming close to

253
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:54,399
what is happening in this moment now i can say i'm sitting here but unless i'm actually feeling and noticing

254
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:00,720
my bottom on this cushion i'm not really aware of sitting i know

255
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,960
it but i don't know that i know it i don't know what's behind me

256
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:20,240
okay that's not going to work for me so gil gave me some advice last night and he said you should have the youtube

257
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,360
running so you can keep track of of chat you know what people are saying

258
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,650
well which is good but then i don't have a computer i have an ipad and it doesn't work the same way

259
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:38,080
[Laughter] i'm unsuccessful at doing that so for anybody who has a chat item that they

260
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:45,840
want me to notice i'm just not i'm not up on it so that's not going to happen

261
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:52,799
that's that's the that's the moment okay that's not going to happen i can bemoan that or i can just say

262
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:58,480
that's not going to happen it's just this

263
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,919
it's just this impermanence is the arising and passing

264
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,919
away of all things and when we think about impermanence we mostly think about the passing away

265
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:16,159
we think about the loss we think about what's missing we think about the deterioration you know my hip is giving

266
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:22,640
me trouble because frankly i'm old and i have arthritis and i fall and you know stuff happens and as time goes on i can

267
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:29,279
become overly aware of aging or i can just say well now those are things i do and those

268
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:35,520
are things i don't do last night my husband and i went looking

269
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:40,720
for something on a trail that he had lost and it was going to be a long trip

270
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,559
around to get to this place and the uh it was past dusk

271
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:52,320
so it was really kind of foolish for us to be looking anyway but we were good so there was a steep rise up to the path

272
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:57,600
right where we were so i scrambled up and then slid back down because i didn't

273
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:04,159
have scrambling shoes on and then i did it again and and we made it

274
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:10,240
um not gracefully not elegantly but we made it

275
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:17,840
okay that's how that went when i left the house i didn't plan to

276
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:23,080
do any scrambling up the side of a steep path

277
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:29,840
okay we did not find what we looked for but it felt pretty good just to do that

278
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:36,240
so if if we're focused on the only uh only successful outcome was that

279
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:43,440
we would have missed the full moon that we got to see on the path over the balance

280
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,000
and that's the thing about mindfulness it doesn't have to be what you choose to

281
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:59,519
be mindful of it's really the blessing of mindfulness is in the unexpected

282
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:05,360
it is in the arising part of a rising and falling

283
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:10,799
this is the primary thing that i have been exploring for myself over the

284
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:17,519
last few months that impermanence is not about loss and going away

285
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:24,640
more than it is about what is arising what is arising

286
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:31,600
if it doesn't arrive it doesn't you we don't lose it in the first place it doesn't go away in the first place

287
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,799
this emphasis on what is arising brings me more closely into the moment and more

288
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:44,278
close and more intimate with what my experience really is

289
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,559
so i've adopted an infam emphasis on arising

290
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:56,080
what is arising

291
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:04,720
and i don't rush to name it i notice something about it

292
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,919
and say so what else

293
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:19,039
uh i got dressed this morning and i was trying to decide what to wear and i you know it's i don't know what the note on

294
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:24,399
the the web says something about it might be cold because of the high airflow and

295
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:30,480
there's these new airflow things and you know my temperature management is not as good as it used to be and how can i get

296
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:36,159
warm and anyway i got dressed and as i was sitting down to breakfast with my husband i said you know these clothes

297
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:44,240
actually feel nice i just got to realize this feels the fabric feels nice

298
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,480
what a delight came out of nowhere

299
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,159
it isn't like we're constantly searching this this this this this i'm going to be aware of everything in my

300
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,000
life i'm going to be awake about everything in my life it's just being open to the possibility

301
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:05,240
of discovery

302
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:13,600
open to the possibility

303
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:22,640
mindful of the suchness of the moment reminding myself it's like this

304
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:28,320
how's this damned unpleasant well oh that's an attitude where's that

305
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,159
coming from attitude attitude attitude attitude breath

306
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:40,080
oh breath it's still unpleasant

307
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:46,240
but i have already a fresher approach to it just by taking the breath

308
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:53,519
it is in the cultivating of the not knowing it is the cultivating of not relying on

309
00:33:53,519 --> 00:34:01,880
the familiar not becoming attached to the familiar

310
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:12,560
when we sit in meditation and we're following our breath everybody has kind of a different strategy around following

311
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:18,560
their breath and what feels familiar and over the years that i've been

312
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,679
practicing my approach to following the breath periodically changes

313
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:28,720
because it no longer because it begins to feel like it's a rhythm and it's

314
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:34,320
too familiar and i'm not actually in the moment because it's just so familiar so

315
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,560
yeah the breath breath breath breath breath breath breath breath and so i choose something about the

316
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:47,280
breath that is current one of my favorites is to notice the

317
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:54,720
null spot between the in-breath and the out breath that null spot is not about the air at

318
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,920
all that null spot is when the muscles have changed the direction of the air flow

319
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:07,359
a breath you know a breath is sort of a construct

320
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:14,240
it's a concept that we have around breath what we're really following is the movement of air

321
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:20,000
as a result of the body's muscles opening and closing orifices

322
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,119
the air that we breathe in is absorbed into the body and some other

323
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:33,680
air is what's expelled and so this moment in between

324
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:40,800
where nothing is happening is kind of an interesting place to be aware of

325
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,160
it's not a thing it's just

326
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:53,280
a marker but it's a mental marker for me and it is just a

327
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,440
noticing of the stopping of the airflow and of course the airflow is still happening it's going into the blood it's

328
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:05,520
coming out of the blood we don't control that that the body just does that automatically

329
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:14,000
and even if we don't have the feeling of a bolus of air moving one direction or another there's still leaking

330
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,359
you know air in air out

331
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,200
you notice this very specifically excuse me hold on a second

332
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:37,599
you notice this very explicitly if you've ever been with someone who's dying

333
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:43,520
and we have this notion that somebody takes their last breath

334
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,800
sometimes that last breath is an in-breath

335
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:07,520
it's a stopping that helps me to follow the breath

336
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:11,119
i'm going to do another clear here

337
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,680
that allows me when i'm sitting in meditation to be aware of the

338
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:27,760
nowness of the air moving it's just air moving

339
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:34,560
and focusing on the movement of air is getting at that very thing that is

340
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:40,480
happening now is being intimate with my body

341
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:46,079
intimate with this moment that's the intimacy that we want to

342
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:51,599
cultivate with all of the experiences of our lives

343
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,119
that's what it means to be alive it isn't about

344
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,880
all of the constructs we have about how we would like to be or what we'd like to leave behind or what we think of our

345
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:08,079
children's our lovers or what we think about anything

346
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:14,880
it is noticing when i think about my lover that my heart lifts

347
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:19,839
it doesn't mean something different than that

348
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:27,680
so that my life becomes the home of being here

349
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:32,880
one of one of the the big intentions in my life has been to be openhearted

350
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,400
i spent a lot of time thinking about what that would look like what would be necessary

351
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,880
how do i cultivate that it begins with

352
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:52,079
be open it isn't about what i become

353
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,560
or how i get to some place be

354
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:06,160
open whoa that brings up all kinds of thinking about stuff

355
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:11,440
how open do i want to be with strangers how open do i want to be

356
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:18,000
with people in my in my immediate family what does it mean

357
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,320
how do i experience be open not what does it mean

358
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:30,720
how do i experience being unguarded

359
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:37,800
what is arising in this moment

360
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,200
what is arising

361
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:55,760
it doesn't have to be a world that is about how i need to be

362
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:03,119
it can be a world about how am i in this moment not who do i wish i was

363
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,560
not how do i become a better person but how where am i

364
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:13,119
at this moment of what is arising

365
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:21,280
and if it is unfamiliar how do i relate to the fact that it's unfamiliar

366
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,720
do i want to no do i say oh great unfamiliar i get so

367
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,800
excited i notice excitement

368
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:39,359
in the noticing we become less driven by the familiar

369
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:44,960
and more in the place of these conditions

370
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:53,040
and if i notice if i put my attention for example right now on my hip i can say oh you know there's pain there kind

371
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:58,560
of hurts and i can try to do something about the

372
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,560
pain i can go into the pain i can think about the pain i can i can manage the pain

373
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:10,560
or i can say yes the pain is here and

374
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:17,359
this is happening there are all these people in this room with me how amazing

375
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:23,359
i'm not throwing away the awareness of the pain i'm just shifting my attention from the sharp

376
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:31,680
edge around the corner and i'm aware of also this

377
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:39,680
also this and this it becomes a life of and

378
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,960
and not a life of either or

379
00:41:49,359 --> 00:41:54,640
so i invite you

380
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:02,760
to notice the influence of the familiar on what you think is right

381
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,960
to notice that if for you the familiar is boring and restricting and closing

382
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,880
down that you notice that and don't blame it on the familiar

383
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:24,160
don't be led around by the familiar become intimate with your mindfulness

384
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:28,880
notice the rawness of your experience

385
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:36,960
try not to shield yourself by putting something in a box that misleads you

386
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,760
allow yourself to notice this

387
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:52,480
whether it's pleasant or unpleasant it has the virtue of being closer to seeing clearly

388
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:59,000
and in seeing clearly we do not choose to suffer

389
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:08,079
it gives us room when we are feeling full of ill will and discomfort

390
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:15,119
to notice a softening that's possible by a deep

391
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:22,960
breath not as a prescription to fix ill will but to say and this is here

392
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:30,079
and with my awareness on this is also here my mind heart is less focused on the

393
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:38,560
ill-will unhappy unpleasant things of life and i am also aware of the possibility

394
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:46,640
for delight and ease and equanimity and these are what i wish for you

395
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:53,359
may you know the joy of intimacy with the moment

396
00:43:53,520 --> 00:44:00,480
of the arising part of impermanence so that joy can be

397
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,160
a part of your life in the most dire of circumstances

398
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:13,119
and you no longer rely on what you'd like to be true you become disentangled from what you

399
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:18,640
would like to be true to be open to the possibilities of

400
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,838
delight in this moment thank you very much

401
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:33,760
so uh i am open to questions if you would like

402
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:42,000
if anyone here has questions i'm not sure how our timing goes this morning martha can you give me a hint here

403
00:44:43,359 --> 00:44:51,838
okay does anybody have something they'd like to say i'm afraid i went on the whole period

404
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,280
yes we need a microphone

405
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:05,839
thank you so much thank you

406
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:21,680
yes i'm often find myself to be afflicted or victim of misconception

407
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:26,960
when i look at something or i notice something i seem to

408
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:33,680
expect that something to be what my mind creates and very often it's wrong

409
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:39,119
can you explain that perhaps okay so um i apologize but things are a

410
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:45,430
little muffled so i'm not sure i got it but so you're aware that the mind creates

411
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:51,440
[Music] a description of what has happened and

412
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:58,720
you want to know how that works but i like to know how do i not to be victim of that misconception that i

413
00:45:58,720 --> 00:46:06,400
create in my mind about something that's out there that i perhaps is not even remotely similar to what i create right

414
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:11,599
right right right so so how do we become of the aware of the

415
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:18,160
possibility of delusion or misconception or feeling getting trapped by

416
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,079
uh whatever the mental process is and that that's that's that happens that's

417
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:31,680
something that arises and what i've found useful is to say okay i get it and what else

418
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:38,319
and the the what else is here question often allows me to see things a little more clearly in a way that doesn't

419
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:45,119
condem the previous conclusion but allows me to see a kind of evolution

420
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:51,280
of that what the thinking is and usually that works best by

421
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:57,760
asking myself that conclusion i've come to how do i feel that in my body where do i

422
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:02,880
feel that and that very act of saying where do i feel bad i'll notice my shoulders are up

423
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:08,319
or my jaw is clenched or my belly is tight and that

424
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:14,160
noticing something in my physical body reminds me that there are many things

425
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,440
that have that effect of my belly clenching or my jaw clenching

426
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,800
and when i notice the jaw clenching it gives me the opportunity to recall

427
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:31,520
mindfulness sati also means recalling to recall oh that's not the only thing that causes

428
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:38,480
my jaw to clench it it's focusing on the body gets us out of the

429
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:43,760
head which is busy constructing these scenarios and impressions

430
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:48,960
and moves me into a place of possibility because once you focus on

431
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:55,280
the body the body changes and as soon as you say well my shoulders are cl are hunched immediately they'll

432
00:47:55,280 --> 00:48:00,800
go down it's an automatic response the body wants to go hold on and and that very

433
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:06,400
act has shifted something and so it's a process so much

434
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:12,640
that is not so much of condemning the mind but saying yeah that's true maybe

435
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:18,960
and what else and it's in that being open to what else that we become not so trapped

436
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:25,200
by the the decisions that the mind makes does that help

437
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:30,880
it's it's just a process of not condemning or criticizing but what else

438
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,480
thank you okay anybody else

439
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:43,880
back in the corner if folks do need to leave

440
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:57,520
uh thank you how do we think about things conditions that are true

441
00:48:57,520 --> 00:49:04,160
um that also involve um

442
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:10,880
loved ones who are suffering and how our loved ones who are in

443
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,880
trouble and you know how that suffering or or

444
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:23,040
troubledness affects others in the family

445
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:33,119
there are no families that are free of that issue we

446
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:40,559
including mine and sometimes it becomes very difficult

447
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:47,599
to not want to fix everything because the heart is moved by pain

448
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:54,720
both of the person who is troubled and the people that that person affects

449
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:00,880
and so what my practice i don't give it as a prescription

450
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:05,920
but my practice has been to realize that uh

451
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:13,520
an aspect of of equanimity practice which is despite what i may wish for you

452
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:20,480
things are as they are may i see things just as they are

453
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:27,839
may i meet the arising and passing of all things with equanimity and balance

454
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:35,680
and it reminds me that the most important thing is to not allow ill will to grow in my

455
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:42,800
heart because it is only when my heart mind is peaceful that i am able to skillfully

456
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:50,720
navigate that space and being present for someone that i wholeheartedly disapprove

457
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,960
of the behavior does not mean that i cannot be with them

458
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,400
with an open heart and i wonder what is the pain that they are

459
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:07,760
experiencing that is driving this being aware of my own pain in watching

460
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:15,119
it allows me to realize that this is coming not because the person is an evil person

461
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:22,240
but because the pain is very extreme in them and it allows me to be beside them not

462
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:29,119
in them or supporting them but to be beside them and look outward and

463
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:38,800
and that being present for them can have amazing results

464
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:46,559
not trying to convince them or change their behavior not condoning or welcoming the behavior

465
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:51,760
i don't accept the behavior on myself as a burden

466
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:56,960
but i feel it passing through i'm sorry i can't do any better than

467
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:03,119
that at the moment thank you all

468
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:07,960
may you all have a wonderful holiday season
