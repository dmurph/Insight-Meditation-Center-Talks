so hello hello everyone lovely to see you lovely to be with you dear sa these last days of um this year so so

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:16,198
given that towards the end of the year there's always this sense of um looking

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,840
forward looking back I wanted to invite us to to reflect um with meta with

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:31,000
kindness with Good Will with with um yeah sense of appreciation looking back

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:38,680
at this year for people for people who have been kind supportive they've had

6
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:47,280
some um some gift they've given us some gift and also maybe later as as I'm inviting us

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,600
in this guided meditation that I will lead in leave in a moment sometimes we can also look back at the year and and

8
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,719
realize that we have grown um through some challenges we've had with some

9
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:05,799
people so can we have meta and Goodwill and gratitude for them stretching us um

10
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,360
again that's that's not necessary you you don't have to go to that part of the practice but maybe starting where it's

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:17,119
easy starting where the practice is really easy and looking back um the

12
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,840
sense of appreciation and meta Goodwill Goodwill for for those who have uh yeah

if we're looking into two mirrors that are set in front of one another and

73
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:15,800
echoing and mirroring lots and lots of versions of ourselves spreading into

00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:55,399
embracing these versions of ourselves with open arms

80
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:12,240
you don't have to necessarily think of them or so that this doesn't become a

81
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:21,399
thinking meditation but as if we're opening our arms and greeting a whole bunch of say children all these

82
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:30,600
versions just spreading meta spreading goodwill spreading appreciation

83
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:38,959
without thinking about scenarios just opening our hearts Opening Our Hearts to all all of

84
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:42,440

91
00:16:10,759 --> 00:16:15,920
now if you would like to invite in your heart space into your heart space one or

92
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,199
two people perhaps in this past year who've been

93
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:26,880
supportive on your path

94
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:42,560
open the door see who wants to come and receive metan

95
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:51,800
appreciation maybe there's the image of your opening the door of your heart and they just come in and sit

96
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:57,639
silently and this room of your heart that's warmed up with good willll and

97
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:02,839
appreciation and they just receive just sit and

98
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:12,520
receive as you're sitting and offering Goodwill to yourself and others very

99
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
simple

100
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

101
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

102
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

103
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

104
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
e e

105
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:03,880
Maybe other versions younger versions of you also walk into your heart space and

106
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:10,080
sit in the room of your heart silently and receive Goodwill

107
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,880
care meta love

108
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:43,640
all who have entered sitting silently just receiving your

109
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:49,559
Goodwill appreciation care

110
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
love

111
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

112
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

113
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

114
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,440
e e

115
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:34,760
if it feels appropriate perhaps to let someone in

116
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:40,520
who supported you by stretching you a bit and showing the areas that you can

117
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:48,279
continue to grow in wisdom and compassion if it feels okay to let them

118
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:56,120
in if it's not destabilizing do so otherwise no need stay where you are

119
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:20,720
maybe they've showed you ways that patience can still grow in you it's

120
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:30,320
okay or feel free to just let it be those who are already present

121
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:37,760
present your heart's chamber sharing meta

122
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
Goodwill e

123
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,399
as we turn to bring this meditation to a close appreciating

124
00:26:52,399 --> 00:26:57,880
yourself or having showed up regardless of what happened or did not happen it's

125
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:03,880
okay trusting that you're planting seeds of Goodwill

126
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,080
kindness they'll flower in their own

127
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:18,799
time May the goodness of our practice together may be a cause and condition

128
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:26,080
for happiness or wisdom for compassion for freedom for all beings

129
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:32,799
everywhere may all beings be happy may all beings be free including

130
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:52,240
ourselves everyone thank you for your

131
00:27:52,240 --> 00:28:02,440
practice lovely to sit with you so the invitation today was um

132
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:09,960
first to stabilize in the body feeling the breath then then I invited you to

133
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:16,799
feel this Breath Right Here Right Now with sense of appreciation this lifegiving breath and then the

134
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:22,679
invitation from there was appreciation for all the breaths that have um led up

135
00:28:22,679 --> 00:28:27,799
to this moment all these breaths in this past year no matter what the state of

136
00:28:27,799 --> 00:28:34,799
mind was um and that way perhaps more appreciation came for yourself different

137
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,159
versions of yourself that were doing their best through this year

138
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:47,399
and cultivating Goodwill kindness appreciation for for ourselves through

139
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:54,000
this this other this different way this creative way of of seeing these versions of ourselves as if two mirrors were in

140
00:28:54,000 --> 00:29:02,000
front of one another we're seeing like way many many versions and then I invited you to imagine

141
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,760
perhaps that there was a chamber of of in in your heart and and people from

142
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:15,000
this past year walking in into this space that was filled with care and acceptance and and appreciation that

143
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:21,320
they were just walking silently and and being this field of meta and then at the

144
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:27,039
very end I asked you if it felt appropriate not destabilizing to invite someone who perhaps stretched you a bit

145
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:35,360
this past year challenge you to to see the other there still ways that I can grow in wisdom compassion

146
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,200
forgiveness um patience whatever it might be but not push it if it felt okay

147
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:49,640
you could invite them and that was the arc that was the entire Arc of our practice together and

148
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:56,519
um yeah and um I would love to uh after

149
00:29:56,519 --> 00:30:03,679
we come out of the that the small groups um would love to hear your remarks how

150
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:10,559
your practice went and and maybe I'll share with you um uh my own actually

151
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:18,799
tell you what I'm going to put the happy hour um uh guide

152
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:26,279
the the small groups um interaction guide the break breakout room guidance

153
00:30:26,279 --> 00:30:31,559
um maybe I'll go over that before I share my U my practice report so in a

154
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:38,760
moment as we'll head into the rooms uh again just a reminder for us to

155
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:45,279
um um practice meta in this in the small group spaces as well embracing

156
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:53,000
compassion for ourselves for each other staying on topic and the topic the invitation is how was this practice for

157
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,760
you were there spaces that it really opened up for you of the reflection

158
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:06,679
um where there places that um a perhaps A New Perspective came up

159
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:12,519
and um if you'd like to share again for the purpose of your own reflection going

160
00:31:12,519 --> 00:31:18,320
deeper in order um when you are held Witness by others our own insights can

161
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:25,880
can go deeper um and then please taking turns briefly we'll go in reverse alphabetical

162
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:35,039
order according to first name off offering one nugget or you can also say pass no problem you can say pass um and

163
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:42,840
um and yeah avoiding cross talk uh not giving each other advice uh maintaining a safe space and

164
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:49,039
going in order Etc not interrupting Etc practicing meta for yourselves and

165
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:56,799
for each other and when you go into small groups in the moment please turn on your cameras um for one another um it

166
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:02,120
it really um having the camera is off it does not support a sense of being you

167
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:07,880
know the trust in small groups so um so

168
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:13,960
so yes so back to the topic so the question is did something come up with

169
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:20,559
some was something about one of the invitations perhaps a perspective that shifted and opened up for you and if not

170
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:26,480
you can say pass or or um maybe you know the mind was distracted you fell asleep

171
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,799
it's okay no problem it's perfectly fine just being showing up with kindness for

172
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,159
yourself and for one another is really the the Crocs of this practice you can

173
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:45,120
say I fall fell asleep but it's okay it's all right I'm still showing up in small group so it's all about

174
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:52,320
cultivating Goodwill um for ourselves and one another so oh yes um I'll share

175
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:58,159
with you my practice reports so yeah for me it was actually quite interesting as I was leading and I was practicing iing

176
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:05,159
with you this sense of um you know in this uh the mirror as if I was seeing

177
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:11,440
lots of different versions of this being who is me this past year and and again not thinking about it but the sense of

178
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:18,159
the fullness of of so many circumstances and this appreciation of ah great wow

179
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:26,399
thank you thank you you've done your best thank you I care for you thank you I love you um and and again I was

180
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:32,960
following as I was giving you The Guidance with with people entering so many people I'm uh grateful for but I

181
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:38,559
stopped at some point because I didn't want my meditation to get too busy and at the end I did invite someone who's

182
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:45,200
who's gently stretched me a bit this year to realize oh there's more there's more room to grow of course there's

183
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:51,559
always more room to grow um in in patience so and so that's my practice

184
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:58,080
report and I was modeling for what you could be sharing if you wanted to but share like one nugget let somebody else

193
00:34:52,639 --> 00:35:01,000
Hi um this isn't necessarily on topic but is like I've really been working on

194
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,560
you know um meta and I'm you know I I have two sons

195
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,560
who sometimes really push back on how much love I want to give them and that

196
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,640
constipates my emotional um my

197
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:26,440
emotional um River because they they seem to damn it in their own way and I

198
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:34,520
feel like if they don't receive it it's hard for me to to to pulse it out and I

199
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:42,160
feel um that it for I just am thinking that for all of you who are sending out

200
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:48,839
meta I'm receiving it so that you don't get it it that sense of

201
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:56,079
constipation of of your good will I'm totally receiving it I just want you

202
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,400
guys to know that how much difference it makes for me and how much how undamned

203
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,920
and how how how free flowing my love is

204
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:16,160
for you just because I'm receiving your love for me and it's just totally a life

205
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:23,040
practice now so um thank you yeah thank you NOA thank you so much for sharing oh

206
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:28,760
so beautiful Your your gratitude for the community and this this allowing

207
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,119
allowing of the flow and um yeah it's it's when there is openness when there

208
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:40,240
is allowing the openness to ex to receiving there's there's more ease both

209
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:47,079
in the giving and the receiving so actually receiving meta is a gift to and with your sons I wanted to invite you to

210
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:54,760
consider something if I may here's an invitation and that is um what if you

211
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:02,079
you accepted and had metap for their resistance because giving meta is

212
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:08,640
unconditional it's right is is um is

213
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,319
unconditional it's yeah it's it's absolutely

214
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:19,560
unconditional it's it doesn't have to look a particular way and sometimes if

215
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:25,400
we if we insist on it looking a particular way and others are not ready

216
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:35,640
to receive that particular way right then there is resistance but if you say okay I love you no matter what

217
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:42,480
it's so so bringing more discernment is my invitation to also again this may not

218
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:49,079
be the case it might be totally off the wall but but um sometimes you know I you

219
00:37:49,079 --> 00:37:54,800
we want to love in our way and people no want to be loved in their way right so

220
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,040
it's it's can you love him in the way they want to be loved which is with

221
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,640
equinity with a lot of equinity uh with no strings attached

222
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:12,880
absolutely no strengths attached loving is my work of a lifetime

223
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:21,000
yeah yeah always learning yeah thank you especially being a parent of adult

224
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:28,400
children a high dose of equanimity is is needed in The Meta which is it's like

225
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:33,800
this okay spacious like a lot of spaciousness a lot of spaciousness in in

226
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:38,920
the meta yeah yeah thank you so much NOA thank you also thank you for receiving

it was so beautiful yeah thank you ah Barbara Barbara Barbara Barbara

228
00:38:49,280 --> 00:39:01,160

229
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:09,560
aspects of you during you know your year or during the

230
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:17,280

256
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:29,680
please hi I

257
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,240
um the thing that came up for me when I considered the growth from somebody who

258
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:42,640
challenged me this year was my daughter um she's

259
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:49,160
34 and we have a tendency both of us I think she got it from

260
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:56,240
me to talk over each other when we're talking and so we both sort of feel

261
00:42:56,240 --> 00:43:04,559
frustrated because we're not really listening well to each other because we have too much to say and so I made a

262
00:43:04,559 --> 00:43:12,760
decision about six months ago um to just be quiet and to listen to her and I even

263
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:18,680
put on her phone number on my on my contact list instead of her last name it

264
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:25,400
says her first name which is Miranda and then deep listening a nice when she

265
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:33,119
calls I get this Trump rand's calling deep listening nice and and it's not

266
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,640
perfect but it's better yeah that's nice

267
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:46,520
ni beautiful oh yay y That's oh how beautiful to have this

268
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:53,000
reminder and and you know deep listening is an act of Love is an act of meta it's

269
00:43:53,000 --> 00:44:01,640
an act of just receiving and according to various um theories and when we change

270
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:08,280
other people change right it's the there are these systems these Dynamics these family systems that we have so sometimes

271
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:13,800
we want to change the other person and we can change the other but if we change

272
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,160
oh guess what they're going to change and response to that it's like oh wow this person is listening so I don't have

273
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:26,880
to be as angry or as as whatever talk at them like they're actually listening I can relax it's just magic can Happ so I

274
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:36,160
just loveing Mar and I just love that you you added that to to the phone number and the name it's brilliant yeah

279

281
00:45:19,720 --> 00:45:24,960
came up for me so many of you know that I love teaching about mindfulness of mortality that you know this could be

282
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:30,920
the last time I talked with this person this could be the last time and there's people who are very dear in my life and

283
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:36,640
and and you know what if I added you know after their name this could be the last conversation right you know just

284
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,800
like oh really just loving them even more appreciating not not to the sense of point of anxiety but just the sense

285
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,040
of yeah I I really care for this person and any conversation could be a last

286
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:54,000
conversation so just making sure people I care about know that I love them so

287
