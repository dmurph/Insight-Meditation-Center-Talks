1
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:08,299
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,440
and one of the

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:19,980
great possibilities of doing mindfulness meditation

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,340
is do let everything become calm and quiet in the mind

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,300
as much as possible so almost it's an undoing

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:41,640
and there's a many uh processes in the mind which are operating all the time in

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:47,280
our needed for our daily life and maybe the operation of it is not something we

8
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,300
consciously think about but uh when we sit and meditate and start

9
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:00,600
undoing non-doing in some deep way that's even some of these deeper

10
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:06,180
structures or processes of the mind can go for it to rest for a while take a

11
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:12,780
vacation much needed and um and to give you an example of

12
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,600
some of the deeper things is where where there's a very strong kind

13
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:23,640
of processes operating all the time seemingly effortlessly

14
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:29,159
um for our spatial awareness our location and space

15
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,500
and um and have a sense of where we are in spaces and objects around us and the

16
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:40,380
distances and all kinds of things goes on which is a healthy and important part of

17
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:46,439
human life but it is a process that the Mind does it's a

18
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,799
engagement and and it's possible for that to be quiet

19
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,899
take a break have a rest anyone do that then

20
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:03,899
there's no engagement in location and creating you know getting a sense of the

21
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:10,979
space and the distance and the location of things and things still have location but it's

22
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:18,900
just the mind is not operating in that way there's deep instincts around self mind

23
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:25,620
Lady of mine is a I think it's uh almost built into the hardware of our mind in

24
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:32,220
some deep way and this idea of my hand and apparently there are people who have

25
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:38,160
brain damage who don't have look at their hand and don't see it as their hand and it causes some problems for

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,140
them and at the same time as important is that sensibility is

27
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:53,280
it's possible to put that to rest and to sit here without any orientation

28
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:02,660
any thought any idea any intuition even that this is mine This Is Me

29
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:08,900
so this this leads to

30
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,420
uh freeing up awareness attention or attentional

31
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,120
capacities to be aware and attentive

32
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,640
without focusing on the usual objects usual concerns usual ways in which

33
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:37,019
Things Are it's opportunity for attention and awareness to to become clearer

34
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:43,459
without complications Simplicity of attention

35
00:03:43,459 --> 00:03:49,019
Simplicity of awareness where in a sense there's no inside and

36
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:55,560
outside there's no should and shouldn't

37
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:02,120
there is no right and wrong

38
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,420
everything is allowed to be in some very thorough going

39
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:18,060
almost unconditional way for a few minutes as the mind gets quieter and calmer

40
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:25,620
and at some point in different people to different points there can be a feeling of or or a sense

41
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:33,240
say perception a knowing of awareness

42
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:39,060
that can feel very clear that feels

43
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:44,280
like it stands out by itself as if it's

44
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,880
has its own kind of presence

45
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:56,759
whereas usually we're concerned about what we're aware of now we've become more and more sensitive

46
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:03,720
to awareness itself how it feels to be aware

47
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:13,100
and because there's no location it might feel like awareness has no boundaries spacious very open wide

48
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,300
because we're not constructing orienting around self there can be a delightful

49
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:24,419
feeling that just being aware without any concern for Me Myself and mind and

50
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:30,780
all that that brings so this is not necessarily an easy thing

51
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:38,940
to experience but it does come as the mind gets very very quiet and still so I'll do this guided meditation

52
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,960
and maybe even even if your mind doesn't get still maybe if you kind of follow along enough

53
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:52,620
even with your imagination you get some feel or some sense some intuition of of

54
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:59,160
what the clear awareness might be like the seleucid awareness

55
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:06,259
so assuming um

56
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:15,979
they've got a meditation posture and to

57
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:21,539
appreciate that sitting here we are

58
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:26,180
relaxing and calming deeply

59
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:32,960
letting go of the concerns of the daily life

60
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:43,639
just letting go of all concerns taking a deep inhale

61
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:50,538
and on the exhale a ritual of

62
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:57,960
putting aside for now all your worldly concerns

63
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,660
they can be put up on the Shelf to be picked up later

64
00:07:04,979 --> 00:07:08,720
relaxing and letting go

65
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:21,120
maybe closing the eyes and on the exhale relaxing the body

66
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,620
softening in the body

67
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,340
and letting the breathing return to normal

68
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,180
and is as if breathing attention together

69
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:08,940
is a reassuring friend let your attention move around your body

70
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:18,380
to find where your tense where you're holding and on the exhale relax that part

71
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:25,259
relax into the reassurance that awareness and breathing maybe

72
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:28,039
provides

73
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:23,160
and with this reassurance of breathing and awareness

74
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,980
touch the places in the mine where your tense

75
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:35,279
and tight and concerned about things touch it with a breath touch it with

76
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,680
awareness to reassure it

77
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:47,839
it's okay for now it's okay to relax and put these things aside

78
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:57,420
and relax in in any tension or strain connected to

79
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:00,680
doing the meditation

80
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:09,140
with a reassuring Touch of awareness

81
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:16,100
your strain and tension dissolve and settle

82
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:23,480
it's enough just to be aware

83
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,720
and imagine that you're standing on a large

84
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:48,440
wide field maybe of beautiful

85
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:55,140
grass grassland grass gently

86
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:05,360
waving in the wind and the breeze clear skies maybe some clouds and birds

87
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:13,459
maybe it's so big this field it goes out through the Horizon you don't see the edge

88
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:18,620
but it's easy to see everything

89
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:27,779
settling back maybe sitting under an oak tree in the

90
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:30,140
shade

91
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,360
and just allow whatever comes to awareness

92
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,959
to be there in the clarity of attention of knowing

93
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:52,160
nothing is right nothing is wrong just something to know

94
00:12:52,380 --> 00:12:56,779
to be aware of in this vast field

95
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:05,360
no inside and no outside

96
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:15,420
just phenomenon that exists arises persists and passes

97
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,660
away

98
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:34,079
with their Assurance of attention of awareness

99
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,360
it may be breathing in the middle of it all

100
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:46,680
let that reassuring awareness be Broad and wide

101
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:53,600
360 degree awareness inside and outside

102
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:59,459
allowing experiences Sensations

103
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:07,320
to appear on their own nothing you have to do or reach for

104
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:13,320
look at carefully just know

105
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:20,720
what appears to awareness in whatever way that is

106
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:48,559
when the ears are open to sounds

107
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:59,039
There's No Boundaries and limits that the ears put on how far away the

108
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,940
sounds might be

109
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:16,340
when we see the eyes don't put a limit

110
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:25,520
just open to what comes without a boundary hard and fast

111
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:36,380
so with awareness awareness can have no boundaries

112
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:55,220
even no Center

113
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:09,480
such an awareness attention can feel clear

114
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:14,960
opened spacious

115
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:28,880
let everything rest abide in the spaciousness of the Mind

116
00:25:20,700 --> 00:25:29,100
to here without doing anything with the hearing what's heard

117
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:34,700
to see without doing anything with what's seen

118
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:41,640
to sense without doing anything with

119
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:49,500
the sensations to think thoughts

120
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,860
without doing anything further with our thoughts

121
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:02,720
leaving everything alone to be itself

122
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,580
without getting involved or being for or against

123
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:20,400
resting in the reassurance of

124
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:23,419
being aware

125
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:38,900
instead of doing and reacting

126
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:47,880
maybe you can Intuit or sense the possibility of clarity

127
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,980
clear knowing clear seeing

128
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:57,480
clear hearing sensing

129
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,299
a Clarity of awareness

130
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:21,500
and if there is such Clarity or intimations of it

131
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:29,840
as if it's waiting for you let go into the clarity

132
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:19,740
and then staying quiet and calm whatever Way You Are

133
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:27,419
listen to this dedication of Merit without participating

134
00:28:27,419 --> 00:28:35,000
without doing it yourself but as if it is a

135
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,100
medicine for this boundless world

136
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:48,360
for yourself and for others like a fresh Breeze

137
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:56,658
moving through May whatever benefit

138
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:01,640
that has come from this meditation practice today

139
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:10,559
serve as a foundation for bringing goodness and kindness and

140
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,679
care into this world

141
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:24,380
so that their spreads throughout the land

142
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:30,919
an influence of kindness and care goodness

143
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:37,399
that spreads from person to person being to being

144
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:49,620
so that we live together on this planet caring for each other

145
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:54,620
promoting each other's happiness and safety

146
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:59,179
Peace and Freedom

147
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:08,480
may all beings be happy may all beings be free

148
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:26,089
[Music]

149
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:49,380
thank you so we come to the last talk on this five

150
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:56,700
part series on consciousness and I've emphasized that I don't really

151
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:02,220
know what Consciousness is but I have a premise an assumption

152
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:08,220
that it's not a thing it's not an entity it's not its own Standalone thing that

153
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:17,059
can exist independent of anything else but it's a little bit more the like a

154
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:25,740
um like a hologram Maybe a hologram can seem very real or very

155
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:32,880
fascinating and and it can be a hologram of a real object but the Hologram

156
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:40,679
um image doesn't exist except as a hologram and so Consciousness is a little bit

157
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:46,980
like a hologram it's it's kind of the combination of all the all the different

158
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:53,539
forms of faculties of attention we have combining and working together

159
00:31:53,539 --> 00:31:59,700
or being gathered together by the mind's capacity to construct to the mind's

160
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:05,159
capacity to have an image or a sense or an idea of the whole

161
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:10,679
and and this is part of what the Mind does it's a constructing

162
00:32:10,679 --> 00:32:17,100
um apparatus it's reconstructing constructing our ideas of the world

163
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:24,120
ourselves all kinds of things the necessary part of being in this complicated world that

164
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:29,520
humans live in and we sometimes will reconstruct things

165
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:35,279
inaccurately we can see something then first glance we think it's a snake and

166
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:42,299
next glance we look at it and it's actually a stick on the ground and um so we the mind is reconstructing

167
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:48,360
things and so it's kind of like the Hologram that's all these pieces

168
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:55,740
but it's a beautiful thing Consciousness and it's very valuable it's wonderful to abide in it and have

169
00:32:55,740 --> 00:33:01,740
the clarity because when awareness or Consciousness feels very clear and

170
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:07,080
relaxed and not entangled and caught up with all the concerns that we have and

171
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,500
the objects of attention then the Consciousness can feel have a

172
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:18,779
sense of clarity of openness spaciousness peacefulness qualities of

173
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:24,059
freedom qualities of happiness

174
00:33:24,059 --> 00:33:30,980
it can be a kind of a rich world that seems to be in and of itself uh

175
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:36,360
independent of what is known and when the mind gets very calm and

176
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:41,820
quiet in meditation where we're not engaged with our thoughts engaged with

177
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:49,019
things of the world sometimes it becomes very clear that or a very clear sense that we're

178
00:33:49,019 --> 00:33:54,779
aware there's awareness but no object of awareness it's almost as if awareness stands out

179
00:33:54,779 --> 00:34:02,159
by itself Consciousness conscious but not conscious of anything in particular that hologram can be that clear and

180
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:07,500
pristine and um in my meditation practice on

181
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:15,358
Retreats when it came to such a such Clarity and pristineness of um I went to my teacher and said I don't

182
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:22,679
know if I could I'm supposed to be a Buddhist because Buddhism teaches that everything is in constant and changing

183
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:27,780
and impermanent and I see that for everything except for this thing

184
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:34,638
Consciousness that seems to be Everlasting and permanent and rather than debating with me or

185
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,839
explaining it was different my teacher just said keep practicing keep looking

186
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,960
look and so I kept practicing and with a lot of confidence and faith in this

187
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:53,460
practice until the point came that I saw that Consciousness also isn't constant

188
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:58,800
can disappear can vanish and then it's Vanishing didn't mean that

189
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:05,040
I died and uh but rather there was a marvelous

190
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:11,040
uh unprecedented kind of experience of freedom and it can seem very frightening and

191
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,920
unusual to have this kind of Consciousness disappear and to experience that freedom from that

192
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:22,640
but I think it's one of the reasons why in Buddhism we don't um

193
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:29,880
reify Consciousness as a thing at least in the early Buddhism School the kind of the basis where I'm teaching from

194
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,920
where Consciousness is not seen as a thing or reified or permanent or

195
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:40,940
Transcendent or so something that lasts after we die

196
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:46,800
the um it's It Whatever Consciousness is it

197
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:54,060
itself is part of the inconstant changing nature of this world we live in and the freedom we're looking for is not

198
00:35:54,060 --> 00:36:00,300
the freedom for an experience of anything including consciousness but something which is almost a

199
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:07,200
non-experience which is in between all experiences which is freedom the absence of clinging

200
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,980
and that is the most marvelous thing there is um and from Indies for me more marvelous

201
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:19,920
than this radical purity of awareness and consciousness

202
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,260
so as the Buddha teaches mindfulness practice he's teaching all these

203
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:32,640
different forms of attention that we can do he teaches um recognition the clear knowing clear

204
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:38,339
recognition of what's happening so important not to be overlooked not to be bypassed

205
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:44,119
he teaches sensing the kind of embodied feeling of experience

206
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:51,119
sensing of experience he teaches us sensitivity to the

207
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:58,579
pleasant and unpleasantness of experience he teaches observation as watching

208
00:36:58,579 --> 00:37:03,839
seeing abiding resting in a seeing of things

209
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:12,740
and and when these all these become stronger and stronger more developed more highlighted less agitated less

210
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:18,540
preoccupied with our concerns then at some point awareness begins

211
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:23,820
standing out in highlight so much so that we know that we're aware

212
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:30,480
you know if I'm driving in the freeway and things are difficult and I'm late and I'm trying to deal with traffic and

213
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,440
trying to get ahead of all the other people because I'm late I'm not really aware that I'm aware I'm aware of the

214
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:43,200
cars around me and in that sense my awareness is impoverished

215
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:49,859
but to be aware of awareness that is a wealth that is fantastic

216
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:56,040
so finally when I get off the freeway and I decide I'm going to kind of meditate for 10 minutes before I

217
00:37:56,040 --> 00:38:03,359
go to my meeting because I'm all frazzled then maybe everything quiets down enough at some point I know that I

218
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:09,960
know I know I'm present I know that I'm feeling I know that I'm seeing and and

219
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:17,040
so there's a kind of a higher order understanding knowledge perception

220
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,339
that we perceive that we're perceiving we know that we're perceiving and at some point the sense of awareness

221
00:38:23,339 --> 00:38:28,680
a simple spacious kind of sense of What receives

222
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:34,619
every all perceptions all phenomena what kind of the medium through which it goes

223
00:38:34,619 --> 00:38:40,740
and has no resistance to anything like the Hologram doesn't resist anything everything comes through that door of

224
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:48,060
the Hologram maybe to us and that sense of awareness

225
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:53,820
can be come strong so strong that it becomes more interesting or more the

226
00:38:53,820 --> 00:39:00,420
kind of the focus of attention it itself is a focus of attention instead of

227
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:07,200
the other things in the world and it's kind of a paradigm shift for some people because some people's mind

228
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:13,079
their whole life has been about concerned about things objects of attention and objects of thought and and

229
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:18,540
just always kind of navigating the world of objects and things and aboutness what

230
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:23,820
we're thinking about but the paradigm shift is what is to

231
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:30,780
take a break a vacation for the Mind from focusing always focusing on something

232
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:37,920
to resting in itself awareness resting and awareness awareness knowing awareness

233
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,520
and in early Buddhism we're not reifying celebrating this as being the ultimate

234
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:50,940
in the final answer to everything but rather it's a there's so much

235
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:59,720
letting go so much ease so much trust in that place that sometimes will find that

236
00:39:59,720 --> 00:40:06,180
that it's massaging or it's working even unconsciously it's massaging the places

237
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:12,480
of clinging and holding deep in our our psychology in our mind

238
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,619
and providing kind of the trust to prepare us for the time when the mind is ready the

239
00:40:19,619 --> 00:40:26,820
heart is ready to let go of the deepest attachments the deepest clinging that we

240
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:33,960
live by and um and so this experience of awareness of clear awareness

241
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,359
that the Buddha focused on is there as a as a platform to help the Steep letting

242
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:44,520
go and um and the word the Buddha used for

243
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:49,560
this clear awareness I like to translate it as a lucid awareness is

244
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:58,140
p-a-t-e-s-s-a-t-i and patissati is uh this uh

245
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:05,460
awareness that's so clear and and present that we know that we're aware there's a

246
00:41:05,460 --> 00:41:10,560
Clarity around it that you know that we as we sense

247
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,780
so the Buddha taught many forms of attention and that are leading to a

248
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:21,480
deeper and deeper concentration and simplicity of Mind Simplicity of attention

249
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:28,079
and it's a beautiful process to do this and there are other factors that come to

250
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:35,220
bear that are that influence this experience of simpler and simpler awareness or Consciousness are there

251
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:44,040
other faculties of the mind that affect the faculties of attention and we can maybe call those attitudes

252
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:50,220
the attitudes through which or by which we're aware and so I thought that maybe we can

253
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:58,140
continue this um the kind of series and maybe next week

254
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:04,800
and look at attitudes with a look at how attitudes might play a role in how we

255
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:11,060
um how we know the world how we know ourselves so

256
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:16,440
so thank you very much and um

257
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:22,440
and I hope that you have a nice weekend and maybe this weekend can be a time

258
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:30,300
when you a gift time to be curious about the nature of

259
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:36,540
awareness itself the nature of consciousness not to think figure out what it is

260
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:45,000
but to see what is it about the awareness what is it about consciousness that that's it is possible to rest in to

261
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:50,579
abide in and maybe you can find sit in a park or someplace looking at the sky or the

262
00:42:50,579 --> 00:42:57,300
clouds or something someplace safe and reassuring assured and and kind of

263
00:42:57,300 --> 00:43:05,060
explore what is this what would it be like to rest in awareness

264
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,300
thank you all
