1
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:28,399
so warm hello from Redwood City

2
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,160
and happy to be here

3
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:41,699
and as we begin

4
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:46,579
the theme of this week is compassion

5
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:55,759
and compassion is one of the great ideals the ideals that people try to live up to

6
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:01,980
but sometimes it's more useful to focus on not the ideal

7
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:07,860
but what gets in the way of the ideal and there's a number of reasons for this

8
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:15,060
one is that if we try to live the ideal well there's something blocking it

9
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:21,839
then mostly the ideal is the idea of the ideal it's kind of a little bit surfacy

10
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,160
or not really deeply rooted inside of us

11
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:33,240
and also because uh if we're if we're

12
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:39,839
operating and we don't really understand What's blocking an ideal but we're still acting it out

13
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:47,160
uh we're not we don't really understand ourselves very well and we can do all kinds of Mischief if

14
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:52,399
we don't understand what's going on inside of us and finally

15
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:59,579
while the ideal any idea might be ideal might be seen as being great

16
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:07,800
uh it might not it's not always the best response and so if we if we can remove what

17
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:13,320
blocks what gets in the way of the ideal inside of us then we might discover that without that

18
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:19,440
blockage there's actually something else some other wholesome movement that wants to come out something else that seems

19
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:26,300
appropriate and um so

20
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:33,959
uh one of the so so compassion has a lot to do with

21
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:39,300
how we are in the presence of suffering our own suffering and the suffering of

22
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:47,820
others and one of the things that blocks karuna is compassion that Buddhism focuses on

23
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:54,839
is if there's resistance to suffering resistance to experiencing

24
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:01,920
and feeling it or contraction or closing down in relationship to it

25
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:07,380
and so in mindfulness practice we want to be very aware of how we resist how we

26
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,959
close down contract um or get involved in attacking they're

27
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:20,160
pushing away our own suffering or any suffering that we are aware of

28
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:26,760
and uh and so what is it like to experience you're suffering however small it might

29
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,820
be without any resistance but also

30
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:38,180
without any solid place inside hard place inside

31
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:44,060
that receives it picks it picks it up

32
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,220
because what resists suffering is often can often be ways in which we hold on to

33
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:55,860
other ideals or ideas about who we are or how we should be or

34
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,200
or memories or past and suffering is you know is difficult

35
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:08,160
for sure but the mindfulness practice is a practice of learning to be wise and

36
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:13,620
and with suffering and learning over time it's very important to understand it's

37
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:18,839
over time so we can be caring and careful with our suffering

38
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:24,540
but over time to learn how to have no resistance to it and in that way

39
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:31,860
to to not be struggling with it not be defensive to it and not be the

40
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:40,860
victim of it but certainly we feel it but in a sense it's it's uh it it doesn't limit us it

41
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:47,339
doesn't diminish us it it's like we're a wide open field wide open space in which

42
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:55,399
suffering has space and room to be there as well but we're not troubled by it so much

43
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:02,459
so as we sit this sitting um from time to time you might find that

44
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:07,920
there is some suffering some dukkha some something which is stressful or

45
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:15,180
difficult for you that happens and we might you might spend some time exploring

46
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:22,980
the resistance you might have to it or the blockage or the contraction and what it might be like to open and

47
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:29,040
have no resistance and find some degree of spaciousness and freedom

48
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:35,100
with the presence of suffering so taking a

49
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:41,360
comfortable upright meditation posture

50
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:47,959
and upright being metaphorical depending sitting in the way that's right for you

51
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,980
but with your heart and mind upright present

52
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,720
gently close your eyes

53
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:15,720
and as you're sitting here now is there already some resistance

54
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:21,839
to something is there some blockage some holding back

55
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,440
a sense of bracing yourself or pulling back

56
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:38,420
and if there is that itself is the suffering

57
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:46,019
can you be aware of the resistance without resistance can you be aware of contraction or

58
00:16:46,019 --> 00:16:52,759
pulling back without pulling back from that

59
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:12,140
and then maybe quite gently taking a slow long deep in breath

60
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:17,720
gently slowly long exhale

61
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:34,040
breathing in deeply and then letting go with the exhale

62
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:45,799
breathing in slow and deep and full

63
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:54,000
is something which is gentling or Tender kind

64
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,320
moving through your body

65
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:12,559
slow long exhale as a kind exhale soft movement

66
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,059
carry movement within the Torso

67
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:25,940
and then letting your breathing return to normal

68
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:39,679
and as you exhale softening the muscles of the face

69
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,880
the muscles do not need to be held close to the skull

70
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:50,539
they can ease away

71
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:07,980
relaxing the shoulders the shoulders do not need to be pulled

72
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:12,240
up towards the ears

73
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:24,260
shoulders can relax down towards the ground

74
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:51,740
relaxing in the heart area

75
00:19:54,780 --> 00:19:57,919
in the chest

76
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,039
and maybe even the back rib cage can soften

77
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:21,500
and then relaxing the belly

78
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,220
and breathing naturally normally

79
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:11,059
for a little bit attend to the rhythm of your breathing

80
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:20,039
to the cycle of breathing in and breathing out in how it's experienced in the body

81
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:23,539
the physical Sensations

82
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:24,120
and as you're sitting here is there any form of

83
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:30,900
emotional discomfort any form of suffering or stress that you

84
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:37,440
might feel or any physical pain

85
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,440
discomfort

86
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:49,919
and if so how are you relating to it how are you

87
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:56,120
with it is there any resistance

88
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:07,399
or is there an openness even a willingness to let it be there

89
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:18,179
not so you can suffer better but so you don't make it worse

90
00:23:18,179 --> 00:23:22,399
with resistance and contraction

91
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:38,460
if you do feel anything that could be suffering

92
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:45,419
see if you can breathe through it

93
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:50,700
or if there's a resistance breathe through the resistance

94
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:58,980
don't struggle with the resistance don't resist resistance but hold it in Awareness breathe in

95
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:07,500
awareness with it as if becoming aware of it carefully

96
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:15,380
is the only thing you need to do know it intimately

97
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:28,080
and if your discomfort your dukkha is not too strong

98
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:33,120
experiment with opening up

99
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,380
to receive it

100
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:47,460
in the way that you would receive a refreshing Breeze of wind

101
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:52,158
on a warm day just to open

102
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:59,000
or the way that the air receives the wind

103
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:10,820
the way the dry ground receives a raindrop

104
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:19,760
the way your pillow receives your head

105
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,900
experimented with letting go of resistance and just being with it

106
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:41,658
as if your Duca has permission to be there and that you will receive it

107
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,840
and if that's not possible then be aware of the resistance

108
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:56,059
breathe with it feel it

109
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:35,659
as you exhale also let go of your thinking

110
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,039
the more you think the less it's possible to be receptive

111
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,799
and open to dukkah

112
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,220
foreign

113
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:10,260
and if you're able to not resist suffering

114
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:15,679
to really allow yourself to feel it freely and openly

115
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:23,899
perhaps it touches something wholesome within you

116
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:30,800
perhaps it can allow for something inside of you to expand

117
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:38,280
instead of contract something inside of you to open instead

118
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:45,118
of closing and allow something inside of you to

119
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,960
become more tender soft and sweet

120
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:58,700
instead of hard and challenged and maybe even bitter

121
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,400
the point is not to be without resistance for its own sake

122
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,400
but to be without resistance to suffering so the suffering can touch something

123
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:23,940
much more deep inside something wise and

124
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,780
caring

125
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:38,760
a place may be of tenderness or softness someplace that feels intimate

126
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,960
and valuable

127
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:01,578
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

128
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:10,079
to turn your heart towards this world around you

129
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:16,980
perhaps through the suffering both the small and the immense suffering

130
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:23,880
in our world and what would it what is it

131
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:30,300
um what is it like to open up to it without

132
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:33,680
any resistance

133
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:52,460
as if there's a deep place inside a place of wisdom of care of compassion

134
00:39:52,800 --> 00:40:00,720
that's worth feeling having it feel be present for

135
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:06,440
his suffering of the world without resistance

136
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:14,339
almost as if you're a one-room house with two doors one in the front and one

137
00:40:14,339 --> 00:40:22,680
in the back and the suffering the world of the world comes in clearly comes in

138
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:27,740
but it blows out the other end the other door back door

139
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:35,940
not to dismiss it but once you've received the message it

140
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:42,480
doesn't have to linger the wind might keep coming

141
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:46,579
but there's no blockage for it

142
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:56,119
and then to

143
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:06,079
end this sitting with actively thinking about having thoughts

144
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:12,859
of wishing hoping wanting

145
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:22,380
suffering of the world to decrease to be alleviated to come to an end

146
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:26,900
thinking happily how wonderful that would be

147
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,440
thinking about how wonderful the end of suffering would be

148
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:44,480
as if just know if others just knew that you had this wish

149
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:50,940
it would benefit them just knowing that there are good people

150
00:41:50,940 --> 00:41:57,780
who are care and concerned about suffering and the end of it is itself

151
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:01,339
medicine for this world

152
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:18,660
and then maybe you can also consider how you might act on compassion today

153
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:24,060
are there small acts of compassionate care that you can offer

154
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,160
to those local and those far away

155
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:39,740
compassion grows when we act on it

156
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:46,338
may all beings be free of suffering

157
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:54,020
may all beings be free of Oppression

158
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,160
may all beings be free of hostility

159
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:11,180
may all beings be free of danger

160
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:19,760
may all beings be safe

161
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:25,640
and may all beings

162
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:35,839
live in peace and freedom may all beings be free

163
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:13,039
here

164
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:20,579
so these days that beginning talks about compassion

165
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:28,079
I feel a little cautious or want to be careful here in talking about it because

166
00:44:28,079 --> 00:44:34,920
I don't want to assume that there's compassion is only one thing and that whatever way I talk about it

167
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:40,980
that's the true Compassion or the right compassion I think that maybe I think because

168
00:44:40,980 --> 00:44:47,520
compassion is such an integral part to many people's lives it is uh something that's very important

169
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,920
and sometimes lays at the center of you know what is that what's most valuable

170
00:44:52,920 --> 00:45:00,440
for them um I think each person will experience it very personally and in their own way

171
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:05,900
and um and so you know certainly want to be careful

172
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:12,720
and one way to do that is to appreciate that maybe compassion whatever it might

173
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:18,000
be for you or for anybody maybe it's not a singular thing

174
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,680
but rather it's a kind of a compound thing it's made up from different aspects of it and it's possible maybe to

175
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:32,300
to tease apart and look at some of the particularly important component parts

176
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:37,440
of compassion and maybe that helps us to look at it more carefully and or find

177
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:42,839
our own way with um with this important topic

178
00:45:42,839 --> 00:45:51,839
and so one of the elements of compassion I believe is that it involves a contact

179
00:45:51,839 --> 00:45:57,660
with suffering and it that can be the word suffering sometimes in English seems like it's a

180
00:45:57,660 --> 00:46:03,740
really big word word only big things counter suffering but in Buddhism

181
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:10,740
can also be very small forms of discomfort or stress

182
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:17,940
that we might feel and so compassion has something to do with being in the presence of of

183
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:25,020
suffering um and uh that's one of the component parts that's is that's for some people

184
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:31,200
that's an important part of it and I say sometimes because there might be an exception to this as you'll see as we go

185
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:37,619
along and so uh and so to uh be willing to

186
00:46:37,619 --> 00:46:43,440
know be wise about how we are in the presence of suffering our own and other people's suffering

187
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:50,880
and one of the component parts of I think's uh compassion at least the karuna that uh comes out of Buddhist

188
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:57,000
Meditation practice is uh having no resistance to suffering

189
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:02,700
it doesn't mean we don't have a strong protest to the suffering of the world or strong idea that this shouldn't be there

190
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:08,819
or things have to happen but in the heart in our inner life that there's no resistance to

191
00:47:08,819 --> 00:47:13,920
experiencing and feeling that suffering and this is what happens as a

192
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:21,660
consequence of meditation practice that we learn in meditation practice that the contraction of resistance the hardness

193
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:26,940
of it the close the closeness of it is itself a form of suffering

194
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:35,220
and that uh it's kind of unfortunate to do it and we want to be able to relax it and let go of it and um

195
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:42,859
and to be able to let go of the different ways that we cling and just to be present in an open way

196
00:47:42,859 --> 00:47:49,680
for the suffering it's one of the great gifts and this is one of the things that I learned in my first early years of

197
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:55,020
Buddhist practice when I had a lot of suffering um I the meditation practice was a lot

198
00:47:55,020 --> 00:48:02,660
about just sitting in the middle of it and just allowing it to be there but just being open to it and not being

199
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:09,920
reactive to it in any kind of way or caught in any kind of way just present okay it's kind of an unconditional

200
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:15,780
acceptance of the present moment with a suffering and that was transforming

201
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:22,260
transformational for me to uh it was hard but uh I was kind of like uh the

202
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:27,960
meditation practice was a tenderizer for hard meat and my heart just softened and softened

203
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:33,480
um by just this showing up and showing up to Suffer Without reacting to it or

204
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:39,420
closing down to it and it might seem counter intuitive to do this because it hurts that you know

205
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:44,760
it's kind of painful but it allows something to soften it open

206
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:51,119
and the idea of having the suffering we experience be something that touches us and rather

207
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:58,020
than Contracting us or closing us down or making us hard it actually expands something inside us

208
00:48:58,020 --> 00:49:04,140
something becomes more open or something kind of suffuses us so I often think of

209
00:49:04,140 --> 00:49:09,480
this as being tenderness myself tenderness softness of words that

210
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:17,160
I like for this kind of inner feeling and epitenderness has no boundaries it has no walls or sharp lines where the

211
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:23,240
tender is and to experience suffering and have this openness suffuse pervade

212
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:28,619
without boundaries this feeling of tenderness somewhere in the chest somewhere inside

213
00:49:28,619 --> 00:49:36,180
is a beautiful feeling a wonderful feeling even though the suffering kind of hurts at the same time

214
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:42,960
so to meet suffering without resistance this is uh if we meet it with resistance

215
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,720
then it's easy to be distressed to be upset dismayed frightened angry all

216
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:54,660
kinds of other things but to learn the capacity to receive it without resistance

217
00:49:54,660 --> 00:50:03,180
and again the reference point for this is meditation practice um where you're not expected to do act

218
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:10,020
on the suffering you're not expect it to go help someone um you're expected to just learn how to sit and be really present

219
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:16,440
and and in that kind of context to discover in that process this place of

220
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:22,560
Freedom inside this place of softness and tenderness that gets uh evoked in

221
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:27,720
the context of suffering it's a very strange idea for people who've never experienced it because

222
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:33,060
suffering is you know feels awful and why should I feel awful and bad

223
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:38,640
I've known people who've gotten angry when they said you suggested when I

224
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,880
suggested they should sit in mindfulness and open to their pain or open to their suffering and really feel it and know it

225
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:52,800
because their whole life was about getting away from it and fixing it and doing something so part of compassion is this Tender Is

226
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:58,260
this place that's touched inside that when there's no resistance kind of an

227
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:06,900
opening a tenderness and then the second part of compassion that I think of is uh caring for

228
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:13,140
whatever that suffering is even either for the suffering itself or caring for the person who's suffering or the being

229
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:18,680
that's suffering and the word care is a kind of a special word

230
00:51:18,680 --> 00:51:25,140
it doesn't necessarily mean that you were going to act to help them

231
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:30,420
alleviate their suffering that you're responsible for their suffering it means

232
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:37,680
that in some contexts it's enough just that we have the capacity as to just

233
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:42,839
care oh I care about your suffering it's important for me and that you're that

234
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:48,480
you're suffering it's important for me because I care about you I want to know that I let you know that I care I

235
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:54,859
sympathize I'm with you I'm I'm your companion I'm your ally I'm your support

236
00:51:54,859 --> 00:52:00,780
I'm here with you in your suffering and I've been the recipient of that from

237
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:07,319
people where I really felt that in some ways they cared for me in my suffering and um

238
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:14,520
and uh I didn't feel like they were asking anything or doing anything or expecting anything from me and it wasn't

239
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:19,619
like they're actively involved in trying to fix or take away my suffering but

240
00:52:19,619 --> 00:52:25,079
just knowing that they sympathize that there was this wonderful care and warmth

241
00:52:25,079 --> 00:52:31,920
and love and recognition and appreciation of me as I as I had my suffering it kind of helped things

242
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:37,440
relaxed and softened and feeling the human warmth and connection to someone else

243
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:43,079
so part of suffering is not is just simply the caring for someone that

244
00:52:43,079 --> 00:52:48,780
kindness the openness the sense of shared Humanity independent of wanting

245
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:55,559
to do something to alleviate it but another aspect of compassion is that

246
00:52:55,559 --> 00:53:01,140
motivation to do something about the suffering and this is where we have to be a little

247
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:07,020
bit careful because what kind of motivation and I like to

248
00:53:07,020 --> 00:53:14,819
think of this when we're in the context of suffering there's two Dharma motivations that can arise out of it

249
00:53:14,819 --> 00:53:20,099
one is in fact wishing and wanting to help the person

250
00:53:20,099 --> 00:53:25,559
so they don't suffer anymore hoping for them not to suffer and and in offering

251
00:53:25,559 --> 00:53:31,680
something offering help and support and um being a compassionate so a

252
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:37,319
compassionate action the other action responds to suffering

253
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:42,900
is when it doesn't make sense for us to act on the suffering to help them out or

254
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:50,339
to do something to change it or give a helping hand um the experience of suffering in the

255
00:53:50,339 --> 00:53:56,760
world and our own suffering can motivate us to practice more diligently to be

256
00:53:56,760 --> 00:54:03,839
inspired to practice and really get to the bottom of our own suffering really find a deep peace find a deep place of

257
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:08,940
non-resistance and and wisdom and deeper compassion

258
00:54:08,940 --> 00:54:15,900
to go on the path to practice and this is a very important part for me because there's lots of suffering in the

259
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:22,140
world that breaks my heart but I'm not going to do anything about that particular kind of suffering not

260
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:28,380
directly just I only limited what I can do but so I put my energy into another

261
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:33,480
Direction One Way is I devote myself more to my practice

262
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:39,119
and now that I'm a teacher I also devote myself more to teaching because I'm not

263
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:46,079
necessarily helping somewhere else in the world but I'll just put more inspired effort into making a difference

264
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:51,900
where I can make a difference and so to have the contact with

265
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:57,780
suffering give birth to motivation of different kinds I think sometimes it's

266
00:54:57,780 --> 00:55:04,980
very respectful for our own hearts there's something about acting and being motivated by something that moves us a

267
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:11,160
lot that is actually uh keeps freeing the heart or developing the heart not

268
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:16,319
acting sometimes is a kind of a causing

269
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:22,440
more suffering causing more harm to ourselves but um and the more the bigger they're

270
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:28,680
suffering is that we experience like in the world the more important it is for us to respond and to act and to do

271
00:55:28,680 --> 00:55:34,380
something but remember it doesn't have to be we respond directly to that thing it might

272
00:55:34,380 --> 00:55:42,059
be we do something different so for example 911 had a big impact on me and when it

273
00:55:42,059 --> 00:55:48,059
happened I felt I have to be I have to change I have to be a different person by that to be changed by this experience

274
00:55:48,059 --> 00:55:55,920
how do I want to be changed by it and so I decided to start a to train people to

275
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:01,200
become Buddhist chaplains so I acted in the world I felt like I had to do

276
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:07,079
something different and so I had to create this program that still exists has been going on now for about getting

277
00:56:07,079 --> 00:56:13,440
close to 18 years or so um I am trading in Buddhist chaplaincy

278
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:19,980
so the idea is um what can we do and not be burdened by the idea we have

279
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:26,099
to do something that's uh you know directly related to suffering if it doesn't make sense for

280
00:56:26,099 --> 00:56:31,559
us to be involved so the non the tenderness that comes from non-resistance

281
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:39,000
the simple care and caringness that doesn't really involve doing anything but it's a deep care

282
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:45,119
and the third is being motivated to do something and being wise about what direction we

283
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:51,540
go through there but again the reference point is deep meditation practice

284
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:58,380
and to have these component parts come forward they come out of us without any

285
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:04,800
obligation and we can feel in meditation that any sense of obligation is a resistance

286
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:12,180
there's a heaviness there's a burden there's a closing down is not really healthy to do it out of the of a sense

287
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:18,900
of Duty I'm obligated to be compassionate um you can't be obligated to be

288
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:25,559
compassionate because it's then by its very nature it's something that's deeper than any obligation you get manufacture

289
00:57:25,559 --> 00:57:32,640
it and enact it out it's something deeper and so this uh to

290
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:38,940
not feel obligated to be compassionate but to be motivated to be compassionate

291
00:57:38,940 --> 00:57:43,980
to be motivated to develop our compassion to because something deep

292
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:50,640
inside us wants us to be I want a different person wants us to be someone who can respond to the world in

293
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:57,960
effective and useful ways um so no obligation to be confession and

294
00:57:57,960 --> 00:58:04,619
I think for some people this is a maybe difficult lesson and a very important one to learn

295
00:58:04,619 --> 00:58:12,359
um I feel at least because then the compassion can be clear stronger and

296
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:18,540
come from a deep rooted place inside that hopefully makes it more effective

297
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:24,660
and more meaningful for the people who we encounter and for ourselves

298
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:30,960
so you might have different component parts of compassion but because there's so many different

299
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:37,500
kinds of compassion different people experience it different ways maybe just a principle that it's your

300
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:43,680
compassion is made up of different parts it can help you to look more deeply what goes on with you when you have

301
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:49,619
compassion and that's something I think sometimes very helpful to write about or talk to

302
00:58:49,619 --> 00:58:58,140
friends about to kind of really start teasing apart what goes on for you and you feel feel or act with compassion

303
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:03,078
so thank you very much and um
