so hello and welcome everyone good to see you

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,519
good to be with you especially nice to see you as last time um

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:23,600
for those of you who are present on monday um internet was down where i live and

4
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:30,640
and and neil kindly opened the room and facilitated and i called in i was on the phone so it was kind of fun

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,480
not to see you but uh but to lead and practice together nevertheless that was

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,360
that was fun and interesting

7
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,960
ah so so today is particularly nice to see you

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,079
and it was nice to just be with you and actually that was quite fun too i was uh

9
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,960
i'll share with you that i was uh because i had to keep my phone plugged in and also keep it close to the outside

10
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,360
so that the few bars i have with the reception anyway so it was was interesting set up for me but also in a

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:16,720
minute that i was able to lie down on my back and and guide you whatever while i was lying um down which was

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,000
uh which is a nice way to practice especially metta is you're not going to fall asleep there's just a sense of

13
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:28,159
nourishing to the lie down practice i don't get to do that when i'm sitting

14
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,240
here in my chair and then guiding but so that was a gift in disguise so i do

15
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:40,880
welcome you to try the lying posture especially if you're not sleepy can can

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:48,870
open things up for you perhaps so so so for today's practice um

17
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:55,600
[Music] you like to lead us in just this simple session of meta i

18
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,640
always say it's a simple session of meta but you know there are always surprises

19
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,320
maybe maybe having talked about the lying posture again if you're not going to

20
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,840
fall asleep maybe i will invite you today to explore

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,280
the lying posture um yeah why not

22
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,319
why not let's let's do that and if you're sleepy then and

23
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:31,360
you can continue to sit or even stand but maybe i will i'll invite you to explore that and at any point

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,160
during the guided meditation if you're feeling sleepy it's okay to open your eyes

25
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,599
yeah maybe that's what i'll talk about today okay so so

26
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,519
lying down posture that's it so lying down posture so um

27
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,160
the buddha taught four postures from meditation

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,400
sitting standing lying down and walking

29
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,400
and it so happens that in the west for our western minds especially we

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,519
privilege to pre we privilege the sitting posture as

31
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:19,519
as that's how we're gonna get enlightened that's where it's at whereas actually

32
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:25,280
all the postures they're wonderful posture there's an awakening is possible in each

33
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,720
and every one of them and um and personally i've done

34
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,080
a lot of my practice a lot of my quote-unquote serious practice you know

35
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,920
three months of silent meditation retreat uh most of it lying down on my back i've

36
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,120
had a lot of back issues a lot of physical issues pain etc so

37
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,200
and yet what i discovered was that actually um the lying down posture

38
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:01,120
was a gift it's so much easier to relax and release the body

39
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,360
the tightness the holding that that

40
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,840
rises in the body and and when the mind the body is relaxed

41
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:18,479
released the mind can relax and release

42
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,919
so especially if you haven't lied down before and if you've thought about it as a lesser

43
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:31,040
um posture i really encourage you to try it

44
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:37,840
out give it a chance um as i said i've done a lot of my practice

45
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,840
especially the jhana practice the concentrations and states of some samadhi

46
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,360
uh that way so i still do so maybe in maybe the title of today's meta

47
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,919
practices in praise of the lying posture is in praise of the lying posture

48
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,680
it can also be very um comforting and very soothing and very

49
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,960
appropriate for meta practice because sometimes when we're practicing meta

50
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:14,800
and compassion practice karuna practice

51
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:20,960
hurt me there's a body that's hurting so imagine if you have back pain and

52
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,919
you're sitting and you're trying to have you know trying to do compassion practice meant to practice for your for

53
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:35,520
yourself well hello the first the first thing to do is to actually

54
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:42,240
physically have compassion for yourself and the way to have compassion is to lie down to

55
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,360
take care of the body to to not be let it be in such a state of of pain

56
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:54,479
so so a couple of things i want to say about the lying

57
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,880
posture one is that um [Music] both in praise of it that the the body

58
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:06,000
can be more relaxed at ease and the mind can be at ease

59
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,000
there could be a lot of care and in fact you can there is a beauty in it because we can

60
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:18,960
think that oh um sleepiness can arise or maybe because it's so similar to lying

61
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,080
in bed that i can fall asleep but at the same time maybe cultivating the sense of kindness towards oneself

62
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:31,520
it can become more accessible when you're lying in bed at night going to sleep

63
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:37,840
actually it becomes your default and and it's interesting i'll share with you that for me it's become the default

64
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:44,479
whenever i lie in bed at night the the words that go through our mind my mind are safe

65
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:50,160
happy healthy ease they just get evoked it just comes like oh yeah this is this

66
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:56,560
tape or rather now it is i should say this mp3 that just keeps playing in the background

67
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:02,960
so so that can actually be a gift that it becomes more readily available

68
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:09,199
this meta when you're lying down in bed and maybe the times that you're sick instead of

69
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,840
kicking yourself oh you're sick there all these things you need to get done and you're not getting them down it's like oh

70
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,560
sweetheart may you be well maybe happy so it could be accessible in

71
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:26,479
those times maybe also say something about um

72
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:32,160
if you notice and i'll give much more guidance of course as we're going through it but

73
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,680
but some people um [Music] decide to lie on their side for some

74
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:46,400
people that maybe it's not the way they sleep so it's not they don't fall asleep but as readily

75
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:54,080
but also uh another thing you can do is to have your arm if you're lying down say if i'm however long

76
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,360
you can have your arm at your elbow bent at 90 degree angle so that if you fall

77
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:05,840
asleep you will fall down and and wake you up or you can be all the way straight up and if you fall asleep

78
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:12,960
you will fall down and wake you up so those are a couple of things that people can do with the lying down meditation to

79
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:21,840
support themselves so so with all of that i think i've said plenty to set the stage so let's

80
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:28,879
let's get ready so if you want to try to lying down meditation you're welcome to try it now you can

81
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:34,959
turn off your camera if you want or let it be on doesn't matter it's all good

82
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,000
um and i invite you to give it a try

83
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,389
so [Music]

84
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:55,319
lying down lying down lying down

85
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,800
letting this whole body rest on the earth

86
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:18,200
feeling the entire underside of your body connected to tears

87
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,959
release thing your feet yourself feel the contact point of the

88
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,680
feet and the ear

89
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,000
releasing the legs

90
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,760
your bottom [Music] your back

91
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,440
and neck and shoulders your head

92
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:15,680
your hands could be resting on your belly or on your side or one of them could be straight up

93
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,480
or bent at the elbow

94
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:39,299
if this posture isn't familiar to you [Music]

95
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,399
bring awareness bring awareness to all the cells

96
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:49,519
even if it's familiar regardless

97
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:58,360
bring awareness to all the muscles

98
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,639
releasing the muscles

99
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:25,079
release release release

100
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:57,839
now let the breath let the breath move through received in the abdomen

101
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:04,480
expanding contracting and releasing the body more

102
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:16,240
slowing down posture as a sign of care as a sign of meta

103
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:22,519
the sign of care for this body that is yours

104
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:30,720
there is restlessness the lying down posture can be grounding

105
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:38,199
can ground a whole body connected to deer

106
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,399
if there is pain fatigue present

107
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,600
can be restorative this lying down posture

108
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,480
meditation is a practice of the mind

109
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:02,720
let the mind be alert let the mind be alert

110
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,399
the mind can be upright the body can be

111
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:13,399
horizontal

112
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:54,560
maybe putting a hand in your heart center you're lying down or sitting

113
00:14:55,120 --> 00:15:00,880
and feeling sense of care for this body

114
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,959
this body that works so hard

115
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:16,240
this body that is you and not you it's yours and yet it doesn't so much

116
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:19,360
belong to you

117
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:27,839
it's kind of a mystery or relationship to this body

118
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:35,199
that we take to be me and mine as if it were a beloved other in this

119
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:40,480
body wishing it well

120
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:48,079
wishing this body well especially in this expression of

121
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,920
lying down posture sitting posture

122
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:18,160
may this body be safe fully knowing that

123
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:24,320
complete safety clinging to the idea of safety is not

124
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:29,759
possible but yet we wish it as a gift

125
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,000
for ourselves

126
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,600
may i be happy

127
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:47,160
may i be healthy

128
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,600
may i have ease

129
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:15,640
may i be safe

130
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:28,679
may i be happy

131
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:40,080
may i be healthy may my life flow with ease

132
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,320
just offering these wishes simple expressions of our goodwill towards

133
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:53,039
ourselves our friendliness towards ourselves

134
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:56,759
simple meta

135
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:09,919
may i be safe from inner and outer arm

136
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,280
may i be happy and have joy in my heart

137
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,320
and may my life flow with ease

138
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,160
you're saying the phrases for yourself doesn't quite connect

139
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:28,880
see if you can perhaps shift perspective and say may this being who is me

140
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,120
this being who is me be safe

141
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:40,799
or maybe wishing it from the perspective who from the perspective of someone who loves you

142
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:48,120
cares for you or who has loved you maybe a grandparent

143
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,960
or a compassionate being

144
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:06,679
or kanye or any other archetype

145
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:13,840
may this being may this being who's me

146
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,400
be safe

147
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:29,360
just receiving just receiving safe

148
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,960
happy

149
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:44,280
healthy these

150
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:24,080
in order to better connect with these wishes for yourself if you like you can see yourself maybe you have four

151
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:30,159
different tabloids the tableaus may be one with safety

152
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,840
seeing yourself in a safe environment

153
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:39,640
may i be safer

154
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,000
may i be happy seeing yourself happy with joy

155
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,720
laughing doing what you loved

156
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,799

may i be healthy seeing yourself healthy

158
00:23:11,679 --> 00:23:18,559

and trusting there is kindness cultivated goodness nourished

177
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:24,880
and together we share we give our goodness our song

220
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:40,560
listening to dharma talk while doing yoga helpful to stretch the body and stretch the mind at the same time taking

221
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:45,839
care of the body and taking care of mine that's sweet

222
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,440
so if there aren't any more reflections then maybe we'll save time for

223
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:56,800
reflections at the end so i invite all of us invite us to

224
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:02,640
to practice in small groups and

225
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,720
in small groups of roughly size three just offering one nugget about your your

226
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:14,640
own practice what was this like for you just lying down or choosing not to lie down

227
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:21,040
and um each person will offer one nugget and then the other person another nugget and

228
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:28,079
then another nugget just speaking from your own experience not acting as a facilitator

229
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:35,599
and if your turn comes and you want to say pass that's perfectly fine you can just hold silent space with meta with

230
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:42,160
kindness for yourself for others um nothing needs to be said it's all

231

239
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:43,040
i easily fall asleep yay so that that worked for someone i'm glad to hear that

240
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,520
so so many things that came up for you today

241
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,920
okay catherine

242
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:14,480
um i did kind of drop into sleepiness but what i

243
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:19,839
what i felt in that state was that i was in a hypnagogic state where i was

244
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:27,440
really processing like stuff that's been going on and it and i rem it it reflected back to me the need

245
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:34,800
that i have to to take a moment like that during the day so that i can do a little bit of that

246
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:41,760
processing it's really really helpful for me and i sleep way better at night when i do that um

247
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:46,960
so it felt like a really helpful and i have been wound up today

248
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:52,800
i was like oh yeah like because in our culture it's not like cool to just be like i want to go take a

249
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:57,920
nap in the middle of a weekday but it should be cool because it's the coolest

250
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:05,040
thing and i'm bringing it actually is yeah yeah i'm so glad you said this katherine

251
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:10,720
that's lovely that as you're mindful aware aware and that's another

252
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:16,960
thing i want to bring bring in so so glad you brought this in so with down meditation

253
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,280
it's also okay if sleepiness comes in becomes a different kind of training so we get to

254
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:31,280
actually work with sleepiness as you said with the hypnagogics because we're aware or where okay where or where

255
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,400
and then we can decide okay hypnagogic state then you can go multiple places

256
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:41,520
one place is just as you said oh yes stay with the hypnagogic state okay

257
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:48,319
yeah we up that's what's happening i'm about to fall asleep and sometimes actually it's wise to decide to fall

258
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:54,400
asleep and not to fight it because a lot of times we we you know we're meditating

259
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,720
all of us have had this experience like you're fighting you're fighting you're neither sleeping you're near your norm

260
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,800
are you meditating it's just a mess it's like you're right it's just like it's a fight it's like a whole 30 minutes of

261
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,119
conflict so if you actually if you're aware and mindful and and let yourself fall asleep

262
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:19,280
for a minute for a few seconds for a minute like yes and then you can actually be mindful the

263
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:26,800
moment the second you wake up mindfulness can be present and it can be so refreshing that 30 second one minute

264
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:34,800
nap is more refreshing than like hours and i say here yes yes you're you're nodding so you know

265
00:46:34,880 --> 00:46:40,880
it's and there's a different relationship to sleepiness to rest hypno it's like awareness awareness awareness

266
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:47,359
awareness it's just it's lovely instead of it being an enemy so thank you so much for bringing that in and then also

267
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:54,800
sometimes if it seems like okay um hypnotically no today i'm going to open my eyes i'm going to stand up move and

268
00:46:54,800 --> 00:47:02,160
this is where i need to go to then one can make a decision at that point but then you have choice right it's

269
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:08,480
so it's beautiful thanks so much for bringing that in catherine so delighted that's great
