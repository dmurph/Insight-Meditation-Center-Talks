54
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:52,320

55
00:11:52,320 --> 00:12:00,320
just leading you gradually into it and i feel like my heart is um

56
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:06,480

in service of goodness

167
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,839
in service

168
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:46,160
our awakening others bringing goodness forth

169
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:54,559
as much as possible in the world this impermanent vehicle

170
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:05,280
is fruit of the earth our body offered

171
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,880
our actions our kindness

172
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:22,319
expressed through thoughts words

173
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:27,320
physical actions

174
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:44,640
you might imagine yourself if you like seeing yourself doing what you love

175
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:49,839
maybe it's work maybe it's caring for others

176
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:55,599
maybe it's your passion maybe it's arts

177
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:03,119
maybe it's meditation [Music] body offering

178
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:15,640
itself wholeheartedly

179
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:29,839
to the life force

180
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:51,200
it's not for ours it's not for us to keep or take with us it's impermanent

181
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:59,680
this body has a function to cherish to appreciate

182
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,359
and to be generous

183
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,440

184
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,720

217
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:31,280
with you was did you highlight a particular part which or or at one point you said um

218
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:38,720
to offer a body for you know kindness to others or

219

yes yes yes that yeah yeah thanks for

220
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:49,760
highlighting that yeah um it's true it's

221
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:57,440
this is our vehicle right this is how we speak and act and pick up a phone and

222
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:03,920
call up a friend who's having challenges and take care of ourselves feed ourselves

223

all of it yeah thanks don richard

224
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:19,520
hi hi uh i i just sort of feel like like my

225
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:26,880
body's there all the time i don't have to work to make it appear you know i mean i don't have to like focus or

226
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:32,319
i instead i just sort of just fall into it you know i mean partly because i often

227
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:38,079
um meditate on my back so i have this sense of just falling and

228
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:44,319
and relaxing into it as opposed to all of the you know look

229
00:47:44,319 --> 00:47:50,720
this look at this part of the body and look at that part of the body and you know that kind of thing

230
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:56,000
[Music] yeah so would you like me to comment on

231
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:01,440
that is that what the question is about or is it just a just a statement

232
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:07,599
yeah so but i would like to comment on that of course because what you're saying is like well that's what i do but

233
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:13,520
it's so so uh yes richard many of us have

234
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:19,359
a tendency of what is easy for us we've done that and we keep doing that

235
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:24,400
but that's that could be limiting that could be limiting so this

236
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:29,680
meditation was an invitation um and if you are showing up this

237
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:35,680
morning actually it's 7 am it's an invitation to to not just do the usual have blinders

238
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:40,960
on okay this is what i always do this is the path i always could be a lovely path not to say it's

239
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:47,040
not a wonderful path it might have lots of flowers but it's the same path what if you go down

240
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:53,680
different paths wow different things could open up um maybe there's a different path to

241
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:59,440
awakening that's actually your body has access to that you have never even imagined just because this is easy and

242
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,559
you always do this and of course so so consider that

243
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:11,599
no thank you you're welcome thank you for bringing that up barbara

244
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:19,440
hi hi came up for me today was a

245
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,640
an opportunity well to appreciate a little pain

246
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:30,800
i had a routine dental appointment this morning and uh so

247
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:37,839
you know routine teeth cleaning and i said you know since i'm here i gotta say

248
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:43,839
that i have sort of a ache in the side of my face and it's been there for weeks

249
00:49:43,839 --> 00:49:51,599
could you take a look at it and they look down and they go oh yeah your bite is off let's just polish it here and and

250
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:59,760
do that there and and so i'm like oh thank you so much it was such a gift

251
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:05,200
that i had just this little uh

252
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:12,400
aching that that was informing me nice nice i like that

253
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:19,680
thanks for watching yeah yeah i appreciate it it's interesting so this appreciation for the pain as a signal

254
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:26,480
but it's as as a way to oh yeah this is what's going on let's let's you know let's

255
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,520
bring attention here and and also in a way i like to tie it into what i was

256
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:37,280
bringing today in the practice today which is really shifting opening up to this

257
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:42,960
possibility of completely shifting the perception about

258
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:48,160
unpleasant sensation or even pain as being bad i mean not not just finding

259
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:53,839
value in it in what you're saying but i'm taking it one level beyond that i mean as i was

260
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:58,960
sharing with you and letting you win as you're sitting here i have pain in my

261
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:05,440
body and yet there can be gratitude there can be celebration like yes

262
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:12,720
this i have a body that senses that has it has pain it's it's it's

263
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:18,800
um how do i say that it's it's just a celebration for everything

264
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:25,920
in life not it's i mean there's this saying um um

265
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:31,760
the great way is easy for those who have no preferences so it's the great way

266
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:37,839
it's like can there be a moment maybe not always but there's no preference yet this is

267
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:45,040
wow sensation unpleasant sensation wow this is amazing feel the sensations here how amazing to

268
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:50,240
be human and how these sensations true so i appreciate what you said and i'm using

269
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:57,040

lovely so dear ones um

271
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:10,240
let's turn towards practicing in small groups and let's consider small

272
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:15,359
groups actually as an opportunity to express kindness

273
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:22,800
this is you've been expressing appreciation gratitude this wow this sense of wonder as i've been inviting

274
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:29,680
you to experience for yourself or this body now what if you express the sense of wonder

275
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:35,920
with two other human beings who are conscious and can speak and

276
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,119
act out of kindness remember your body is a vehicle for kindness can you show

277
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:46,319
up in the room as a vehicle for kindness this is practice

278
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:53,359
practice for being out in the world with your family loved ones strangers people you

279
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:59,440
have difficulty with people who get on your nerves can you be a vehicle for kindness

280
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:05,040
share kindness in these small groups so the invitation is for you to say just

281
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:10,960
one nugget whatever you want to share and if that that silence you want to share silence

282
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:17,200
and hold kindness that's fine the next person will say one nugget the next person will say one nugget and we come

283
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:23,680
back to you let's go in reverse alphabetical order and just

284
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:29,040
say something offering kindness not managing the group not

285
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:35,280
um serving as a facilitator just showing up with your own kindness

286
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:42,079
here this is what i have my body as a vehicle and let's see what what might arise in

287
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:48,240
this space opportunity to share kindness

288
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:54,079
with each other and maybe the prompt i'll add one more thing the prompt is

289
00:53:54,079 --> 00:54:02,079
how do you take joy how do you take joy in your body being a vehicle in the world for

290
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:05,839
kindness for service

291
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:14,720

sarah hi nikki

299
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:05,599
so i had a cool image come up during the meditation and when i shared it in group

300
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:11,599
um people seemed to to really like it as well but this image of

301
01:04:11,599 --> 01:04:18,799
um unwrapping some unwrapping gifts of sensations like having a sensation come

302
01:04:18,799 --> 01:04:24,960
up and like opening it as if it were like this beautifully wrapped present to be able

303
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:30,799
to fully embrace it and really acknowledge it

304
01:04:30,799 --> 01:04:37,359
more completely a lot of times i'll push things away or kind of half-ass feel them and

305
01:04:37,359 --> 01:04:44,880
this was a good image really supportive to like feel more fully

306
01:04:45,599 --> 01:04:50,880
oh that's so beautiful thanks for sharing that sarah that is lovely this

307
01:04:50,880 --> 01:04:56,319
gift that you're unwrapping this this this same sense of

308
01:04:56,319 --> 01:05:03,119
delight and appreciation and gladness oh this sensation is a gift that is so cool

309
01:05:03,119 --> 01:05:08,240
so i'm gonna ask you wait i think you already muted um where did you go raise

310
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:16,319
your hand again so i can ask you to add me oh there you are uh so was this for any sensation or particular sensations

311
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:23,599
like pleasant unpleasant was a particular quality to it so i i was using it a lot of times with

312
01:05:23,599 --> 01:05:29,200
um emotions disguised as sensations that came up

313
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:34,480
through like my torso and um no it's for it's for anything a

314
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:40,720
lot of times yeah if some emotion comes up or some feeling and i don't want to feel it i'm

315
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:47,119
like eh but in this meditation it just presented itself as like okay you can

316
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:54,000
fully unwrap this you can like let it out let it really take up space

317
01:05:54,000 --> 01:06:00,480
beautiful i am i am so attached this is such a beautiful image to to not just

318
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:06,799
