1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,240
so I'll start again with a welcome to everyone and on this Thanksgiving Day in

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:15,480
the United States and i' for myself I'd like to emphasize the uh giving part of

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,039
Thanksgiving that it's an act of generosity and

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:29,080
uh two wonderful things gratitude offering thanks giving generosity come

5
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:35,280
together in Thanksgiving and meditation that we're

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,960
about to do is one way of understanding it is to set create the conditions within

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,280
us so that we can be much more attentive

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,239
receptive to appreciating others

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:03,400
appreciating the world and uh because without

10
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:10,479
appreciation there's not really any deep forms of gratitude or

11
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:19,040
Thanksgiving and I'll talk more about it during a Dharma talk this act of deep appreciation and how important it is for

12
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,640
Thanksgiving but for the meditation I'd like to emphasize that meditation creates the

13
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,079
conditions for appreciation

14
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,960
we relax we step out of the preoccupations of our

15
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:41,799
mind the bias and the orientations we have to how we see people how we look at

16
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:47,079
them and how we're caught up in our own concerns how we see the world through

17
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:54,360
the filters of our emotions and moods and to somehow settle deeper below

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,280
that to a quieter place where the eyes become clear

19
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:06,000
where there's less filter and dust over the eyes of thoughts

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:12,360
and memories associations biases hurts

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,959
desires to quiet enough to settle enough to relax enough to see in a fresh

22
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:25,120
way and one means for doing this one

23
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:31,280
support is to find a contentment Within

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:40,319
that for minutes of meditation to feel content a deep contentment not about all

25
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:45,680
things for sure but for now to be

26
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:52,280
content to sit here to meditate content to be

27
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,879
breathing to be alive to be content

28
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:04,920
with the benefits that we have that allow us to sit down and quiet to

29
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:12,080
meditate and do this spiritual practice it's a remarkable thing it's a

30
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,239
remarkable uh honor and gift that we receive that we can do this many people

31
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,840
don't have the ability to take time off to sit and quiet and

32
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,760
meditate and for today to have a sense that we do this

33
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:36,080
practice and we find a place of deep rest deep

34
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:45,040
contentment so that we can enter the world with a giving heart enter the

35
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,000
world with eyes that can appreciate deeply so for

36
00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:00,079
now assume a posture a posture that for you

37
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:05,319
you can be content that this is your meditation

38
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:14,760
posture that you can be comfortable in that you can

39
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,720
be awake

40
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,440
in and to gently close your

41
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:35,919
eyes and to Gentle a gentling of your

42
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:44,120
insights maybe with every exhale a

43
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:51,240
calming gentling of whatever is

44
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:55,240
agitated tense

45
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:15,919

up letting your breathing become

62
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:06,599

for e

156
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:20,399
so hello and welcome to this fourth talk on

157
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:27,279
uh gratitude and coincidentally it's also

158
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:37,080
the gratitude today in the United States Thanksgiving and so I love the idea that

159
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:43,279
the word is Thanksgiving with the word giving in it and it touches into this

160
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:49,039
profound aspect of Buddha spirituality that involves

161
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:55,120
generosity and uh to give and one of the most profound things

162
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:01,240
we can give others is is our appreciation of

163
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,600
them and generosity gratitude I mean begins with

164
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:15,760
appreciation and I want to underscore this I've said it this week already but there are three steps three aspects of

165
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:23,600
generosity that makes it robust and full one is taking time to appreciate really

166
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,840
recognizing acknowledging what it is that's we benefited what received what

167
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:35,840
the goodnesses we've seen really take time to appreciate don't be in a hurry don't overlook

168
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:41,200
stop maybe the bumper sticker can say I stop for

169
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:48,200
appreciation and then take in that any of the goodness of that the thankfulness

170
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,639
of that as H receive it deeply inside of you so that it opens you in some way or

171
00:32:54,639 --> 00:33:00,960
touches you in a deep way or moves you so that the emotionality the tenderness

172
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:08,760
the warmth of It kind of you allow it space to be in you take it in and receive it almost like take it in relax

173
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,360
with it don't don't take it in intense like now you have to do something and reply

174
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:22,279
and you have to immediately apologize or you have to immediately say thank you quickly but take time to really related

175
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:27,840
to register because it's one of the me

176
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:34,880
means to open the heart it's one of the means to feel a more heartfelt connection to others is to allow

177
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:42,200
ourselves to feel the thankfulness that we have to feel the generosity someone else has

178
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:47,760
offered and then and then there's more embodiment there's more fullness to this

179
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:53,480
Thanksgiving we can give then we want to express it in some way as I talked about

180
00:33:53,480 --> 00:34:04,080
yesterday but today I want to offer something a little different that um uh the giving of

181
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:12,398
thanks uh can be done indirectly by how well and deeply we

182
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:20,720
appreciate others even people who are difficult for us is there a silver lining is there

183
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:28,280
something you can see that's wonderful in the person the goodness of inner beauty and integrity uh

184
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:36,560
authenticity a what can you appreciate in others and that this is a gift many

185
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:43,760
people in our world are not appreciated enough many people in our world some people don't have never really

186
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:49,200

187
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:57,799

192
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:30,079
person who looked like they were kind of being sad you don't have to necessarily tell them but really take time to

193
00:35:30,079 --> 00:35:37,079
appreciate what you see um make it an art make it a practice to look for the

194

directly for people if it seems too personal or too awkward in the situation

200
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:24,680
but even that you can look and see people with appreciative eyes what is

201
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:31,720
good in people and part of that also then brings out what is good it reinforces it but it

202
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:37,280
also might open your heart maybe it resonates with the same goodness in you

203
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:45,200
for you to recognize it in someone else means something in you knows that and maybe that inspires you it

204
