1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:09,179
so good morning good day everyone I was appreciating so much the chats

2
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:16,980
that um I was almost forgetting to start speaking

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:22,560
so thank you all for being here and I appreciate very much that

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:30,359
we have this Wide International Community that comes together to practice to meditate to engage in

5
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:35,640
these teachings and I feel very fortunate to be able to offer these teachings

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,460
still to such a receptive audience

7
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:49,280
so thank you so there is a

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:56,100
kind of current of teaching in Buddhism that uh one of the meetings

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,379
of karma when we do something that has a karmic consequences

10
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:08,460
is that it leaves traces and that when we are doing something

11
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:15,479
without any karmic residue there's no traces that this possible to do things that

12
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,180
somehow leave no traces leave no residue

13
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:27,240
therefore leaving us fresh leaving us kind of new or able to meet the next

14
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,799
moment without bringing with us the baggage and the

15
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:42,259
influence of the past so when we sit to meditate

16
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:49,560
we can start recognizing that there are traces left so for example if the mind wanders often

17
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,040
thought and then you bring your mind back but you're not really successful able to do

18
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:03,720
that the the pull of the thinking is strong that pull is the traces of momentum that

19
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:08,880
was set in place that somehow there was a force operating in the

20
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,500
in the way we're thinking the way we're maybe attached that

21
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:21,840
remains even once we've kind of let go of the thoughts or we let go of them for a moment but

22
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,900
very quickly were pulled back into that world and that the force that keeps pulling us

23
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,239
into it into our preoccupations our thoughts the past the future

24
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:41,700
our fantasies the force of that is um part of this residue that's left

25
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:47,940
over from a momentum that's set in place of what we've been doing in the past and

26
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,980
what we've been thinking in the past and what we've been feeding so if we're feeding in the past just

27
00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:00,000
living our daily life where unrestrained

28
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:08,160
in our preoccupations you know only thinking about what we want they're only thinking about how we've been wronged

29
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:13,920
then um there's uh there's sometimes because of the involvement the identification

30
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:20,099
the attachment the resistance the strength of that involvement with that

31
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:26,300
preoccupation it leaves a residue and that residue

32
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:33,180
has a function of like ready to reappear in some way or

33
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:40,379
other becomes a habit almost so one of the functions of meditation

34
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:48,239
is to try to be in the present moment the best we can be with the breath is to notice how much residue there is

35
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:54,840
the traces that are left over where we're you know automatically pulled away or preoccupied and caught

36
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,180
and things some of that residue we feel and the tension in our body

37
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,060
all tension is a residue of our some way in which we've been preoccupied

38
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,700
and that's a marvelous thing to have that the body relax enough that the residue

39
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:20,760
at least a surface residue begins to dissipate certain emotions are left over they're

40
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:27,000
they're not just you know fresh and new but there's residue that sometimes

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:35,100
reappears sometimes years later the residue the traces has been left behind unresolved and then there comes

42
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:41,520
there comes a residue there's the traces again there's no need to feel bad about it or

43
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:49,440
feel bad about yourself that there are traces of karmic traces like this but it is invaluable to see it

44
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,979
to know that's what's happening and it can be a lot easier if we just see it that way oh that's what's

45
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:02,100
happening these are traces these are this is the residue this is the residue still

46
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:09,600
having momentum it's maybe it's easily easier to disidentify with it not be so tricked by

47
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:18,600
it to think that it's so important to do it might be easier just to recognize it in a simple way oh residue traces

48
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:24,240
and then dig it again and that Clarity of residue traces might

49
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,400
make it easier just then to come back into the present moment so

50
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:40,699
so assuming a meditation posture

51
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,820
and I put a lot of value on a on the posture we assume in meditation

52
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:53,940
and intentional posture that establishes us here in a clear

53
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:01,919
definitive way here in this place and this time partly because on one hand it's easier

54
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,478
to then release the residue and

55
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:15,419
and also because it's easier to see it if we have a posture that's

56
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:23,060
karmically neutral where

57
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:28,460
the habits of attitudes dispositions don't

58
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,500
dictate the posture we have

59
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:42,259
and and so this you know upright posture that of the Buddha statue

60
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:48,800
represents a posture free

61
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:57,500
of Karma free of the momentum of the past dispositions and attitudes

62
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,680
taking it long steep inhale

63
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,639
releasing a long exhale

64
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:23,240
breathing in breathing out

65
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:39,440
letting their breathing return to normal

66
00:07:47,699 --> 00:07:53,180
and the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out from the body

67
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,198
maybe it can be like a waves washing up and down against the shore

68
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,240
if there's been a disturbance on the beach

69
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:26,660
the waves just come and they go and they smooth out the sand bringing it back to

70
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:33,500
the way it's been maybe for millennium flat

71
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:47,820
or we have a coarse piece of wood and we gently repeat over and over again

72
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:54,800
the sanding of it back and forth slowly something gets smoother

73
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:02,339
so that gentle staying with the rhythm of breathing in and breathing

74
00:09:02,339 --> 00:09:08,959
out we might feel the karmic traces in our body and mind

75
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:18,259
but staying with the Rhythm like a waves washing across everything

76
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:25,500
slowly letting the karmic traces and tensions

77
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,820
be smooth out

78
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:38,240
without being tricked into thinking

79
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:43,040
reacting to anything

80
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:47,720
staying with the rhythm of breathing

81
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:58,279
waves smoothing out the beach

82
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:29,299
what residue or traces are found in you now

83
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:48,919
and instead of being involved in them or thinking about them

84
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:58,520
let breathing be the massage or the waves

85
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:07,580
that softens the strength of the residue

86
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:34,580
and then coming to the end of the sitting taking a few long deep breaths

87
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:45,419
relaxing as you exhale maybe relaxing some of the residue of

88
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:49,019
tension traces

89
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,559
and considering for a few moments how there can be love

90
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,799
or care or kindness without any residue

91
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:12,799
without leaving any traces behind in our hearts or Minds

92
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:22,700
simple straightforward clean love

93
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:28,760
and to gaze upon the world

94
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,600
with such a care

95
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:42,899
wishing well for everyone without any attachment

96
00:31:42,899 --> 00:31:47,419
any fear any hesitation

97
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:53,240
may all beings be happy

98
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:59,120
may all beings be safe

99
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:06,960
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

100
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,919
be free

101
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:25,749
[Music]

102
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:32,720
thank you

103
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,720
foreign

104
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:39,600
so continuing the topic of how mindfulness

105
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:46,380
of the body can support us in challenges the third exercise the Buddha gives in

106
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:52,380
his famous teachings on mindfulness third teachings about the body

107
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:57,320
is to be mindful to be aware to know

108
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:03,179
the activities we're doing with the body as we're doing them

109
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:09,960
so as we're moving certainly as we're walking as

110
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:17,780
we're talking as we are putting on our clothes as we're going to the bathroom as we're

111
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:26,280
showering or bathing each of these everyday activities is a meditation center in itself is a

112
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:32,158
monastery in itself is a sacred Dimension sacred place

113
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:40,740
for practice of mindfulness and to see it as a you know as a as a

114
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:48,179
meditation center as a sacred location as is to put a lot of value on the

115
00:34:48,179 --> 00:34:54,000
presence the attention the care that we give in being in being with each

116
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,260
everyday activity that we do eating the Buddha mentions drinking

117
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:06,540
stretching out your hand to grab something to open a door turn your doorknob

118
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:14,940
to close the door to put on your shoes to be cooking in the kitchen or cleaning

119
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:22,079
there's you know innumerable ones of these everyday daily activities and the third exercise in developing

120
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,240
mindfulness is to bring mindfulness attention into these activities as we do

121
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:32,540
them and this has a lot of benefits in kind of the ordinary

122
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:37,619
way of thinking about mindfulness it's a way of being mindful in the present

123
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:44,579
moment and it's a way of building up the muscle of mindfulness muscle of attention to the present so that we can

124
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:51,420
begin abiding living in the present more and more and thereby receiving the benefits

125
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:59,520
from doing so and but also doing this reveals

126
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:05,420
what's going on otherwise that if we stop and pay attention

127
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:11,820
to that stop but if we do our activities while we're attending to them and really present for them

128
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:17,280
there's you might notice how the mind has other ideas it's drifting off and

129
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:25,079
thinking about tomorrow or yesterday or a fantasy of some kind and the emotional lives can follow the

130
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:33,260
thoughts or the emotions can be very much about something that's not present here and now and are being

131
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:39,540
reinforced by the thoughts the stories about this other time or their place

132
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:44,880
and so there are traces this residue left over from other things where

133
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:52,260
there's preoccupation concerns attachments resistances fears that are operating that have a kind of sometimes

134
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:57,300
a life of their own momentum of Their Own and it isn't necessarily wrong to have

135
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:03,900
that but it's really helpful to see it and when we're present

136
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:09,119
for our daily activities standing over the stove you know stirring a pot of

137
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:14,820
soup to really be there for that stirring we notice well I'm not really there

138
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:22,980
I'm still thinking about the traffic ticket I got and how it's unfair and this and that and and so there's so

139
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:28,940
something happened to us early in the day that's sticky and we're kind of stuck with it or glued to it or

140
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:35,700
preoccupied with it and so seeing that as we are stirring the soup we say oh

141
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:41,400
look at that now I can see the power this has over me if we just go about our life it just

142
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:48,420
unconsciously let us know the Mind think about its preoccupations and thoughts it might seem like business as usual and we

143
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:55,020
might not even notice that it's uh how much the mind is caught how much the mind is preoccupied and the influence

144
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:01,619
that preoccupation has in our body our emotions our hearts but if you're stirring the soup and you

145
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:07,940
see that you're thinking about the traffic ticket then um wow that's really strong

146
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:13,500
oh is this really the right thing to be thinking about or do I need to attend to

147
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:20,220
this in some way do I need to settle something deeper maybe I should turn the stove off and go sit down for five

148
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:26,460
minutes and just really let the the leftover um

149
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:31,800
the agitation of the traffic ticket to wash through me and kind of drain out by

150
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,800
just sitting breathing with it that's what's needed otherwise the residue of that tension agitation is going to be

151
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:44,579
driving my thoughts so the simple way of maybe saying this is that as we bring our attention to the

152
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:50,400
present moment and try to be with what's happening as we're doing it we start noticing how

153
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,280
much we're not there and that reveals something really important about ourselves important information

154
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:03,599
and then what you do next is up to you but at least you know something that you didn't know before

155
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:11,160
in terms of uh some of the challenges we have in our life the some challenges we get stuck in the

156
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:18,200
stronger the challenge sometimes there's a stuckness and some people freeze go numb some people

157
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:25,579
hunker down and some people collapse and some people do the opposite and get agitated and are really

158
00:39:25,579 --> 00:39:33,140
spinning out to go about our daily activities the simple brushing our teeth

159
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:38,700
washing our face to really be there in a simple relaxed

160
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:46,800
way is uh the middle way between collapsing or being numb or frozen or

161
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:53,160
being agitated it's using the movements the activities of the body to channel

162
00:39:53,160 --> 00:40:00,180
the energy to give space for the energy to get movement to get fluidity to lubricate our system without it being

163
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:07,440
too much or too little um going about the daily activities as a

164
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:14,540
way of loosening up as a way of settling as a way of grounding as a way of not being

165
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:22,740
glued to our challenges we have our concerns for them is very freeing very helpful it

166
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:31,980
lubricates it massages it kind of can be grounding so that we can be more wise about how we

167
00:40:31,980 --> 00:40:37,740
consider our challenges how we address them but if the and so the more engaged we

168
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:44,820
are with our more caught up we are in the challenges the more it really has grabbed us sometimes the more useful it is to do

169
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:50,339
something some activity that kind of

170
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:56,700
frees us a little bit loosens up us a little bit or settles us a little bit sometimes like it could be going for a

171
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:03,180
walk and uh and and the walk is what allows the energy of the emotional energy of

172
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:11,220
the challenge to start becoming a little more fluid and not so stuck or if we're collapsing into it or going

173
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:18,540
numb it can kind of wake us up a little bit if we go the opposite direction and get too agitated the walk can actually

174
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:23,640
be settling the walking around these daily activities I like to think of them

175
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:30,839
as the middle way that brings things into balance so you might try that that next time you

176
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:37,800
have some kind of real challenge that's hard for you to be with maybe not the most challenging but

177
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:44,400
something that you know moderately challenging that's difficult don't just sit and do nothing don't just

178
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:52,560
fret but and don't don't go kind of numb and do things on automatic pilot uh enter

179
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:57,599
into the activity of what you're doing in the moment with mindfulness and presence

180
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,660
maybe even an embodied presence so you're really there almost like imagine that you're

181
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:10,740
a dancer or an actor who is embodying the part of the whole being

182
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:18,480
stirring the soup brushing the teeth and and see if that creates a little bit

183
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,900
more space and lubrication for the challenges we have more more

184
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:30,720
balanced by the time we finish that maybe we're a little bit more centered a little bit more able to think more

185
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,820
clearly it's not that easy they're just brushing your teeth is called all it's going to

186
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:42,720
take but we have lots of different everyday activities through daily life

187
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:49,380
and to be mindful really mindful of them we have lots of little opportunities to

188
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:54,960
reset to ground and to discover what is really going on what are their residue

189
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,940
what's left over what's the strength of that residue what's the strength of the our kind of the way we're glued

190
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:07,980
or to the preoccupation the challenge we have and to not necessarily the

191
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:15,420
challenge doesn't go away but one of the things practice can do is it can maybe dissolve the glue that keeps us glued to

192
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:21,920
it or the stickiness that can be washed away so that

193
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:28,260
unstuck we can you know address the challenge or be with it or figure out what's best to

194
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:36,000
do so we have many opportunities throughout the day daily life practice into the to

195
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:41,040
be mindful of the activities of the daily life and maybe it's useful to think of it as

196
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,280
the ordinary regular repeated activities that you do

197
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:55,680
as as your Meditation Center your Monastery your sacred grove sacred spot not the

198
00:43:55,680 --> 00:44:00,780
place but the activity is where it is so significant

199
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:06,960
and if you take you know a dozen two dozen of the regular activities you do through the day

200
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:14,640
and really make it a place to lubricate to massage to ground to be present to

201
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:20,220
discover more clearly how there's so much residue so much ways

202
00:44:20,220 --> 00:44:25,319
in which they're spinning out um I think it could be invaluable

203
00:44:25,319 --> 00:44:33,180
for helping us work with a challenge which have happened every day of life to not do that for some of us that might

204
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:38,760
mean that we're actually feeding the preoccupation repeating the cutness the

205
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:46,020
the emotional reactivity to the challenge if we you know that's so easy to give

206
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:54,540
into it or live in that all the time but to have some kind of way to cut through the reactivity cut through the

207
00:44:54,540 --> 00:45:00,480
the stuckness that we have around challenges is invaluable

208
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:07,579
in our ability to address them more wisely and if you have no challenges

209
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:14,760
then it's a delight to give ourselves over fully to the physical activity of

210
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:20,060
these daily activities that we do to really enter into it and embodied

211
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:25,380
absorbed way just this just washing the dishes just stirring the soup just

212
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:35,160
brushing the teeth and and maybe that just is a source of rejuvenation

213
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:42,420
May the activities of your daily life become a sacred dimension of your life

214
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,960
thank you
