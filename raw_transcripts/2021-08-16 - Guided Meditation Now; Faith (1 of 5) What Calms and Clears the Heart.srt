[Music]

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:18,240
so good morning everyone and

3
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:26,160
welcome to our sitting and and i'm happy that to be morning

4
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:32,398
everyone i'm happy to be back and happy to hear the

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,440
appreciation of the other teachers who taught here while i was away so that was nice

6
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,840
matthew and andrea so um

7
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:56,079
in the sitting today i want to emphasize a three-letter word

8
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:02,800
and that is the word now and if you want to

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,920
add a letter so it's a little more sophisticated you can add the k in front

10
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,799
so that it's no now then now that's to be known

11
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,920
and the task in meditation mindfulness meditation

12
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:29,040
is to have develop to have greater confidence

13
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,799
in now that in confidence in the present and

14
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,520
the past or in fantasy and commentary abstract thinking

15
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,159
to have confidence that being present presence presencing

16
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,920
now is valuable it doesn't it's not a dismissal or

17
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,960
rejection of past and future but if we're going to be involved in the

18
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:08,438
past and the future to know that we're doing so now

19
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,959
to always know what is happening and unfolding now

20
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,560
as the foundation for our life and their life just kind of unfolds so

21
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:27,680
much more beautifully and remarkably and wisely

22
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:34,480
when we are centered here and now with what's unfolding

23
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:42,480
what is the flowing what is arising what is passing what is occurring now

24
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,319
so in this sitting today you might if you would like

25
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:55,360
to use the word now as a little not exactly a mantra but as a

26
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,080
as a guide as a support as a reminder and just periodically say now

27
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,680
you might even say it at some point in the cycle of breathing

28
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:14,239
beginning of the inhales beginning of the exhales the end of the exhale just anywhere it

29
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,720
feels comfortable very relaxed and easy but this regular reminder

30
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:28,239
to be awake to be present for now the experience of now

31
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:33,360
with the idea that we're developing either we're developing

32
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:39,760
greater confidence in our ability to be present now or

33
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,400
we're learning that we actually have more confidence

34
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:53,040
in other things or the mind has more confidence in distraction or the hindrances or

35
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,239
conversations in one's head or thinking about the past or planning

36
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:03,439
the future and then is it really

37
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:09,439
to your best interest in meditation to have confidence in these other things

38
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:17,600
and can you lovingly shift your attention shift your confidence your trust

39
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,080
to now to being with what is now presencing

40
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,840
what is now so

41
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,080
assuming a posture for meditation that's appropriate for you

42
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:44,000
with a guideline that that posture that helps you both to relax and to remain alert so you don't drift

43
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,720
off in sleep or sleepiness

44
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,280
and if it's nice for you you can gently close your eyes

45
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,320
if you keep your eyes open because it feels better you might want to

46
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:11,840
have your eyes cast downwards towards the floor and about 45 degrees

47
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,800
and whether the eyes are open or closed to see if you can relax

48
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:26,240
the eyes as if the eyeballs can rest

49
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:34,000
in the sockets as if the eyes are no longer

50
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,080
searching scanning the external world looking outward

51
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,400
but rather [Music] resting backwards settling down

52
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:56,000
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

53
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,240
filling the rib cage as you inhale

54
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,520
relaxing as you exhale

55
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,680
allowing a settling in your body as you exhale

56
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,479
and then

57
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:46,680
letting your breathing breathe normally

58
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:58,000
and relax your body on the exhale

59
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,840
maybe the whole body can release relax

60
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,720
as you exhale setting and settling into the place where you're meditating

61
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:41,680
as you exhale relaxing the face sometimes relaxing the face

62
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:50,960
it can be a relaxing of our thinking a tense face is almost like

63
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:56,840
squeezing the thoughts energizing

64
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:03,360
thinking and relaxing around the face the jaw the forehead

65
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:09,400
also maybe allows a calming of the thinking mind

66
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,759
and the same with the shoulders

67
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:25,319
and exhale softening the shoulders

68
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,919
letting the thinking mind become calm

69
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:50,480
and softening the belly releasing the belly into now

70
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,480
here

71
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,720
and perhaps there's some way you can relax the thinking mind

72
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:15,800
or any physical tension associated with the thinking mind

73
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,399
if we think if we're thinking a lot there's a kind of disassociation that

74
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:35,519
happens with a body a separation from that which is able to

75
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,760
settle in the settle in the heart

76
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:59,920
and then if it's comfortable for you settle into the experience of the body

77
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,920
breathing

78
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:27,920
and wherever you feel you're breathing in your body the sensations of the body breathing

79
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:35,880
at the edges of them can you relax more can you soften

80
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:46,639
and as you sit here if it's nice for you

81
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:52,240
you can periodically say the word now [Music]

82
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:59,680
maybe with an inner voice that is calm and confident

83
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:08,079
so that you bring your confidence into the practice of being present to

84
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,079
now

85
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:28,000
maybe nothing needs to be different than what it is

86
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,279
except knowing more fully that whatever is happening

87
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:42,399
is happening now thinking is happening now

88
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:50,920
feeling is happening now sensations are happening now

89
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,639
now

90
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:22,800
and the reason to be present for now is that each unique moment each now

91
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,839
is only here for brief moments

92
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,920
you

93
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:53,919
you

94
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:36,240
remembering to be here and now especially the now

95
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:44,000
is there recognizing being with what is occurring

96
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,000
now

97
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,919
you

98
00:21:57,840 --> 00:21:59,919
you

99
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,919
you

100
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,919
you

101
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:50,480
and as we come to the end of this sitting to consider that

102
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:53,840
now the present moment

103
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,760
is the location for love

104
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:09,520
for care for kindness goodwill

105
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:15,440
all these wonderful qualities of generous qualities of care and

106
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,440
friendship

107
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:29,440
they are motivations feelings attitudes

108
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:38,080
that when felt and known are occurring in the present moment

109
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:45,679
and as we come to the end of the sitting perhaps you can

110
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:52,240
bring your attention to the place within that you associate

111
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,880
with goodwill compassion

112
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,520
kindness

113
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:11,120
and center yourself there as you exhale relax into that location

114
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:17,520
even if you don't feel it right now the place

115
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:24,000
that seems to be activated energized

116
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:30,600
when there is love and kindness good will

117
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:43,000
breathe through that place breathe with it

118
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:52,880
and knowing you're doing so from the present moment

119
00:28:53,440 --> 00:29:01,520
reflect on what encounters with others you might have

120
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,240
on this day

121
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:12,279
or if it's evening for you to tomorrow

122
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:19,039
and consider look upon the people that you might

123
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:27,158
encounter and known and unknown strangers and friends

124
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:34,000
people you'll communicate with through technology

125
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:40,559
people you might talk to on the phone or meet with

126
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,720
and gaze upon them kindly

127
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:55,440
gaze upon them with calm sense of

128
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:01,120
love or good will friendliness

129
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:12,960
and consider how in a way that has integrity for you seems appropriate

130
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:17,840
for you how you might

131
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,159
live this day with greater care and kindness

132
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,760
for the people you'll encounter

133
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:37,520
consider ways you can offer more care

134
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,679
or do things that improves the lives of others

135
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:53,600
even without them knowing that you're doing it maybe simple ways

136
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:02,159
of supporting others and may it be that this meditation

137
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:10,080
practice we do and practice of the mindfulness we develop may it be as a support

138
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,080
for us to live in this world to make this world a better place for

139
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:24,080
others even in the smallest details can we

140
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:30,960
contribute to the welfare and happiness well-being

141
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:36,080
of others may all beings

142
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:42,960
be happy may all beings be safe

143
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:48,240
may all beings be peaceful

144
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:58,039
and may all beings be free free of oppression hostility

145
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:05,440
free of suffering and despair and stress

146
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,679
may all

147
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:21,320
beings discover what it's like to have a heart that is at peace

148
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,919
you

149
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:36,159
so good day to our monday

150
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:42,320
on this first day of the week and so the theme that i would like to talk

151
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:46,639
about is um

152
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:53,120
faith and um and i think the motivation to

153
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:59,120
talk about faith is that uh i've been feeling lately quite inspired

154
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:08,320
by it and heartened by this faith quality of buddhist practice

155
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:16,638
and so it's mostly to be able to talk a little bit share a little bit something that's in my heart

156
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:22,960
and um and there are different qualities of

157
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:30,158
faith so in different times in different ways this the pali words sada

158
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:37,118
which often translated into english as faith has this has different qualities

159
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:43,919
and so therefore often translated then differently and uh in context and so sometimes it's

160
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:49,040
trust sometimes it's confidence

161
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:55,598
sometimes it's devotion or love and

162
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,599
so whatever it is this uh and the english word the associations we have in english for

163
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:07,839
faith if those don't work for you other words might work or you might put

164
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:14,400
those aside and just realize the provisional nature of the english translation of sada

165
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,520
as faith but i like the word faith myself because it's um

166
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,160
uh to me and it might not be for others uh faith is not so much about uh tenet

167
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:33,280
of belief you know what we believe and we have to believe a belief that we don't have any verification for

168
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,520
but rather faith is to have some kind of trust or confidence

169
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:45,040
in what can be called the dharma but not the dharma that's out there that you

170
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:50,880
read about but the dharma that's found in the heart and so one of the

171
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:56,320
definitions of this faith in buddhism that i like is that

172
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,160
it is um the attitude uh the quality

173
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:07,359
that calms the heart and sometimes it said it's what clarify

174
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:13,359
clears the heart or clarifies the heart that clears uh and the word clear

175
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:19,040
and then the analogy for this in the ancient world is uh

176
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,160
uh if um the water like a pond it's all muddy it's

177
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,160
like some some animal has run through it it's all muddy then there's apparently an ancient india

178
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:37,359
a magical stone that if you put it in the in the in the pond in the water

179
00:36:37,359 --> 00:36:45,359
it clears all the mud away and so faith clears away mud the mud

180
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:51,359
of our destructions preoccupations the things we swirl around in

181
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:57,280
and the ancient texts say specifically that there's something about the power of faith

182
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,480
this kind of deep trust that calms the heart that clears it

183
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:07,520
of the hindrances clears it further grasping at

184
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,839
desires and aversions uh being pulled into the world of

185
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:20,720
restlessness resistance uh tiredness not tiredness but kind of a

186
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,920
slothfulness and doubt so the way that we reach out and hold on

187
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:33,520
to these things or get caught in them and there's something about the deep trust of that the dharma can provide

188
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,480
that settles those things because the hindrances are an expression of mistrust

189
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:47,280
they are expressions of not having faith in where the heart can settle where the

190
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,680
heart can be at home in itself when there's uh when we put faith in sensual desire

191
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,680
we put faith in something that keeps us a little bit dissociated from ourselves a little bit reaching out beyond

192
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:06,640
ourselves and wanting something same thing with ill will but faith and ill will is not a good place to have

193
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,960
faith in or trust in but most people won't say they have faith or trust and ill will but

194
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:18,880
functionally that's what kind of is happening unconsciously that oh this is how i become safe this is how i get what

195
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:26,079
i want this is how i protect myself is by or how i create myself as a person is by

196
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:33,440
expressing my hostility my anger my criticism complaints and so there's confidence in

197
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,680
that world of complaints and criticism and all that and and so what we're doing in the dharma

198
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,359
practice is to find some place to be at ease and at rest in our own hearts and

199
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,800
our own being that is not dissociating it's not reaching

200
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:56,240
out and relating to the outer world in a way that desire and ill will does and

201
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:01,280
even doubt though sometimes that uh it's really a

202
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,440
settling it's what settles the heart that clarifies the heart

203
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,880
and um and one of the classic purposes of faith

204
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,280
in the dharma is not faith for its own sake but rather a fake

205
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,680
faith that provides the resolve dedication the intention the

206
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:31,119
motivation to practice to live a different way

207
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:37,119
so it isn't passive faith to just sit back and kind of be taken care of by

208
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:43,200
you know in some passive magical way by what we have faith in but rather it's a faith certain kind of

209
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,320
action a certain kind of walking they're walking the the

210
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:54,079
the moment moment steps of dharma practice of showing up and being mindful being present

211
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:59,280
but as faith gets awakened the the practice the action of practice

212
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:04,640
the engagement and practice uh can be uh have the same soothing or

213
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:10,960
settling or clearing quality as faith does because faith is

214
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,319
comes along with it or is part of the practice we do and when we practice without faith

215
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,599
without this warm-heartedness or this love or this

216
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:25,839
care or this um

217
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:32,640
trust then the mindfulness sometimes itself can become a little bit

218
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,480
dissociated and disembodied even as as if it's a technique that we're doing but

219
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,319
when it comes out of faith comes out of the deeper trust then it's not dissociated it can be more

220
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:51,119
embodied or more presenting or more inspiring even inspiring for ourselves

221
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,640
so uh so the um

222
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,720
um you know so faith so so in these days i'll talk about these

223
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:08,160
different heart qualities qualities of heart that come into play

224
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,359
in different ways around this word faith this concept of faith and

225
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,359
so i thought of tuesday tomorrow talk more about trust

226
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:25,280
and then wednesday about the quality of love in relationship to faith

227
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:31,119
and and then on thursday confidence

228
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,760
in relationship to faith but you know the question is what do we have confidence in and there's many things buddha dharma

229
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,119
sangha and things but on thursday i want to talk about faith and non-clinging

230
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,240
and this wonderful kind of holding together like left and

231
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,359
right hand holding each other of non-clinging and the warmth and the

232
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:58,960
goodness of faith and then on friday talk about

233
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:04,000
kind of about in a sense faith as devotion that has expresses itself in

234
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,160
service expresses itself in acting for the benefit of others

235
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,760
and and that that that act of service is can be can be

236
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,200
an expression of dharma devotion that's where the devotion kind of of the

237
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:28,480
practice can really maybe take a a get an expression in itself

238
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:33,359
and um so

239
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:39,839
um and my hope is in talking about faith

240
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:45,119
that um we really you know i hope i can talk about it in such a way

241
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:51,200
that you can begin recognizing it in yourself because i don't you know that's that's

242
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:57,359
really where the faith lives is in ourselves in our hearts and our in our inner life

243
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:03,839
and we all have the faculty of faith so

244
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,760
so in in buddhism you wouldn't say that you have faith in certain teachings or something

245
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,040
because that's a little bit more like intellectual exercise

246
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:21,680
faith in buddhism is considered to be a faculty like confidence is more like a faculty

247
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:28,640
and and equanimity is a capacity of faculty

248
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,760
loving kindness is a capacity we have a faculty we have we have an ability to

249
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,200
have kindness and goodwill and generosity and and

250
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:45,520
so it's a uh in that sense uh this uh faith is a faculty

251
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:52,839
is a an ability is a capacity that we can develop and grow

252
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:58,480
in and in that sense it's something that already lives in each of us though it

253
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:04,720
might be dormant or it might be resting or maybe the seeds of this dharma faith

254
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,480
is a way sitting waiting to be watered but it's it's there in everyone and so

255
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:18,160
we want to kind of i'm hoping these talks will be a little bit more of a of a have some resonance inside of you

256
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,520
of something that you can recognize so faith

257
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:28,480
trust confidence love

258
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:37,440
inspiration motivation devotion service all those kind of are in the sphere

259
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:44,960
of what i'm calling faith or sada so thank you and um very happy to be

260
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:51,838
back here and look forward to this coming week thank you
