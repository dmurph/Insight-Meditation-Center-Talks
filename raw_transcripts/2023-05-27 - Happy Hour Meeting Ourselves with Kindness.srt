15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:40,680
Sangha I like to say it's low in traffic and high in heart so

16
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:48,960
so the other changes as we transition to the formal part after we say hello is I change the

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,560
settings so accidental unmuting won't be possible I also change the chat settings

18
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:04,259
um so that chats will only come to host who's me but I ask you to keep the um

19
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:09,599
that channel quiet the chat Channel quiet I will open it afterwards it can

20
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:16,920
be quite distracting when I'm teaching um to receive a chat but I will open it afterwards and the last of the

21
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,800
preliminaries is I turn on the recording for Audio Dharma the audio recording

different time zones and this feeling that we are practicing together even

30
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:20,280

31
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:25,379
really are supporting one another and this community um

34
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:43,620
practice together so so for today's practice

35
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:50,280
[Music] um what I'd like to do is to um not

36
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:57,900
introduce a theme ahead of time but actually introduce the theme ever so

37
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,500
gently drop it into the meditation it'll be light there won't be too many

38
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:11,040
um there won't be too much but that that's that's the way we're going to do it

39
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:18,419
today so so let's uh let's settle in let's settle in and if you're sitting in a chair see

40
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:22,639
what your body needs to sit comfortably

41
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,280
and if you need to shift or move to lie down that's perfectly fine or stand up

42
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,080
I'm gonna assume that you're sitting

43
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:43,040
so sitting listening with sense of ease in the body

44
00:04:51,380 --> 00:05:01,100
relaxing inviting the body to relax when the body relaxes the mind can relax

45
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,800
so first we invite the body to relax often

46
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,020
let go of the weight of your torso unto

47
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:28,580
the chair or the cushion

48
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,440
let it support you let go of the weight of your legs your

49
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,520
feet onto the Earth

50
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:52,039
let go of the weight of your arms your hands onto your lap

51
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:02,900

52
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:21,440
let awareness be kind be gentle and spacious

53
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:29,400

00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:17,059
up with all beings may all beings everywhere have ease friendliness

166
00:31:17,059 --> 00:31:24,539
happiness may all beings everywhere be free including

167
00:31:24,539 --> 00:31:31,179
myself [Music]

168
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:47,600
thank you all thank you for your practice

169
00:31:52,919 --> 00:32:00,539
so our practice today was

170
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:10,620
revolved around kindness for ourselves meeting ourselves

171
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:18,659
will be started actually we started with with relaxing softening the body

172
00:32:18,659 --> 00:32:25,620
with meeting the breath with kindness meeting this moment with kindness like a

173
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:33,960
friend and when you receive the breath as a gift then the mind starts to shift starts to

174
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:39,360
shift and this moment starts to shift into a gift

175
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:44,640
and then we shifted to to meeting

176
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:49,860
ourselves as a friend stepping out of ourselves seeing ourselves with friendly

177
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:55,460
eyes um with goodness with friendliness

178
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:02,279
stepping back and then towards the end we brought in a dear friend we shared

179
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:08,640
our Goodwill our meta with them then at the very end we expanded to all beings

180
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,220
everywhere and whatever happened or did not happen

181
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:19,559
as long as we met it with kindness with Good Will with friendliness whether

182
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:25,860
there was distraction present or pain present difficulty present

183
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:33,659
it's okay we're planting seeds of kindness we're not trying to do this right that's

184
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:40,019
not the idea here we're planting seeds of kindness so whatever is arising as

185
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:46,140
long as you meet it with kindness and let's say for the 30 minutes you didn't mean anything with kindness but in this

186
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,720
moment you meet yourself with kindness just now it's okay sweetheart you showed

187
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:57,480
up it's okay darling you you're doing your best you did your best ah just one

188
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:03,480
moment of kindness acceptance for yourself for challenges maybe there's

189
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:12,780
pain in the body pain in the heart this moment of kindness is infinitely more abundant

190
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,960
than zero moments of kindness so

191
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:25,800
so at this time I'd like to invite us

192
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:32,460
to uh to show up with friendliness to show up with friendliness

193
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:37,800
with kindness for ourselves and for one another so

194
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:45,240
it's happy hour we have small groups and in the small groups roughly the size of

195
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:53,520
three the invitation is be present with yourself be present with your body and

196
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,540
in the space of kindness It's really where the rubber meets the road we can be signed you know we're doing silent

197
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:05,940
meditation our eyes are closed but now we get to be kind in public but it's

198
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:11,040
like a Sandbox it's a Sandbox it's not the world where we're working

199
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,260
Etc but it's a sandbox with people who've just practiced meditator around

200
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:22,800
kindness so it's it's a gentle reintegration into being kind to ourselves kind with

201
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:29,339
others and the prompt is you and you can share or not share you can just offer

202
00:35:29,339 --> 00:35:34,560
silence just show up with silence and if you do choose to share know that

203
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:40,980
you're sharing for your own sake you're speaking just to be held witness the other people in the room are just there

204
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:46,500
to hold you witness and support you in in being kind to yourself and you can

205
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:52,560
say tonight's practice I was sleepy I was distracted but I Met

206
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:58,380
Myself with kindness maybe that's your report or maybe something else happened

207
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,540
um whatever you say there's no right or wrong [Music]

208
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,820
if judgment arises be kind to the Judgment so just be kind be kind really

209
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:15,240
that those are the seeds we're planting which is quite Counter Culture and when

210
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:21,420
we're kind to ourselves we can actually take more responsibility

211
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:26,520
both for our actions be kinder to others etc etc so

212
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,619
so I'm going to create the breakout rooms and again the invitation is to

213
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:37,760
stay in your body be kind I suggest the order to be um

214
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:42,820
alphabetical order according to first name tonight and

215
00:36:42,820 --> 00:36:49,680
[Music] um and again you offer just a nugget and then make space for the next person to

216
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:55,500
offer a nugget the next person then it'll come back to you so you'll go around a few times and when other people

217
00:36:55,500 --> 00:37:00,780
speak maybe something you remember something or you get inspired to say

218
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:06,180
something and no asking questions from one another no not directing you just

219
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:11,640
show up and share something if you like from your experience

220
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:17,579
um so creating a safe Brave space for one

221
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:23,160
another to interact in a container of kindness okay all right I'm going to

222
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:28,859
open the rooms take care of yourselves take care of each other be kind be kind

223

okay the rooms are closed everybody is back welcome back everyone and

230
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:47,359
um we have uh some time now for any Reflections or any questions questions

231
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:55,020
complaints reports it's all welcome and you can either raise your Zoom hand

232
00:46:55,020 --> 00:47:02,339
if you haven't spoken in the group for a while or if you're new if you like to you're welcome to we can also type in

233
00:47:02,339 --> 00:47:09,480

234
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:17,280
reflection privately and if you want to type it to everyone then it's public I'll read it publicly so what did you

235
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:22,680
discover what what was it like either the groups or the practice

236
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:24,800
um

237
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:39,359
and I did some Smiles did see some smiles when you came back from the group so

238
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:42,799
I wonder how that was

239
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:49,619
bill says not able to focus this time

240
00:47:49,619 --> 00:47:56,040
um frustrated and found the frustration feeding on itself it's is was it

241
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:02,760
possible Bill to just have a moment of of kindness to this self this being who

242
00:48:02,760 --> 00:48:08,460
is frustrated yes says Bill yay so that's a moment of kindness that can

243
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:15,500
support the the um you know the perpetuating the feeding of itself it can actually pause

244
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:21,079
and and end that cycle break that cycle

245
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:29,359
Jerry said it was great to have permission to just feel the kindness of being here ah thank you Jerry yeah yay

246
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:36,660
Terrence please thank you so very much Nikki

247
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:43,079
um I was very soothed as typical by just being in group and being in the field of

248
00:48:43,079 --> 00:48:48,240
your voice and allowing myself to you know just uh

249
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:55,560
almost I could say float with it see um soothed by it by your voice

250
00:48:55,560 --> 00:49:03,920
and then came through this thing of meet yourself and oh my God it just like boom

251
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:11,280
it really got my attention and pulled me into a different space you know which

252
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:17,180
woke me up in a sense um

253
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:26,819
yeah it Harkens back to other meditative Retreat experiences I've had when meeting myself

254
00:49:26,819 --> 00:49:34,140
with kindness and you know how and seeing how I wasn't caring for myself very well

255
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:40,920
really and it's kind of heartbreaking but so important to see

256
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:46,619
thank you so very much for that oh thank you so much Terence for sharing

257
00:49:46,619 --> 00:49:52,680
that oh thank you so much and I'm bullied and delighted that that the

258
00:49:52,680 --> 00:50:00,119
practice today for you it did support oh meet yourself meet yourself with kindness and yes there is sadness there

259
00:50:00,119 --> 00:50:07,140
of the times we have not made ourselves with kindness and and yet there is this moment of Awakening oh yes

260
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:15,060
it is possible I can awaken to to meet myself with kindness instead of perpetuating this this pattern so thank

261
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:22,020
you thanks for sharing that turds oh thank you so much one reflection it's just wonderful to

262
00:50:22,020 --> 00:50:29,220
talk and communicate with like-minded folks wonderful Community thank you Deb says so wonderful to have the

263
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:35,040
opportunity to Simply Smile and feel the tenderness here ah thank you and that's

264
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:42,480
hearted by someone else Jim says the kindness towards myself is easier in silence once I start talking fight and

265
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:48,420
flight Sensations Vie for my attention uh thank you for sharing that Jim it

266
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:53,579
takes a lot of courage to to actually bring that into and say that out loud

267
00:50:53,579 --> 00:51:01,319
write that out loud in the community because that is um that is the case when we it's very

268
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:07,740
very common so that's why we keep practicing in silence and then in these

269
00:51:07,740 --> 00:51:13,140
um small sandboxes of you know two or three other people we try to meet

270
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:20,099
ourselves with kindness and and notice that oh yeah flight from flight flight freeze is showing up and

271
00:51:20,099 --> 00:51:27,119
can we be kind to that pattern can we be kind to that and the more we do it so so my recommendation is Jim

272
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:33,540
um don't let that be a reason for you and others who have the similar observation to say oh I'm just not going

273
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:39,480
to show up to the small groups because it's just too hard to be kind to myself but actually keep showing up keep

274
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:46,020
showing up and keep observing the fight flight and freeze and keep being kind to it it's okay sweetie you're doing your

275
00:51:46,020 --> 00:51:52,319
best it's okay this is hard it's okay and then that is really the training ground

276
00:51:52,319 --> 00:52:00,059
um the the um you know it's the scaffold it's the training wheels for us meeting ourselves

277
00:52:00,059 --> 00:52:07,740
in kind with kindness in social situations in the world which are professional or this or that and a

278
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:12,839
higher high station we can still be kind to ourselves so thank you so much for bringing that

279
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:19,640
up so important so important so

280
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:26,240
so I don't see any other hands or any other Reflections so

281
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:33,240
Let's uh bring this practice to a closure together thank you all thank you

282
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:40,500
all for showing up for planting seeds of kindness towards yourself towards

283
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:46,319
um the world because really when we fill our own cup with kindness when we do

284
00:52:46,319 --> 00:52:51,960
that when our cup is full then we can fill other people's cups and we don't go

285
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:59,819
around the world saying love me love me love me in a subconscious way so so it's so important to to fill our own cups

286
00:52:59,819 --> 00:53:05,040
with care uh meeting ourselves as parents and meeting ourselves meeting us

287
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:12,119
ourselves with care because hey who else would if we don't so so thank you all for your practice

288
00:53:12,119 --> 00:53:19,079
may you be well may you be happy may you meet yourselves with kindness

289
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:25,440
and they ring the bell here we go [Music]

290
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:31,760
