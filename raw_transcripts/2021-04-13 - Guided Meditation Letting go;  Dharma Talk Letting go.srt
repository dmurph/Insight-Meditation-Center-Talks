1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,040
good evening welcome welcome and even if it's not

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,599
evening when you're listening to this sometime in the future or

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:21,520
maybe you're on a different place on the planet where it's no longer evening a warm welcome

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,840
so we'll start with a little bit of a guided meditation

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,280
and just settling in

6
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:46,800
feeling what it feels like at this moment

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:13,840
feeling the pressure of the chair or cushion against the body

8
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:27,840
feeling with the hands or resting on

9
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,680
and feeling connected grounded we are here

10
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:55,840
at this moment

11
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,798
paying a little attention to the posture

12
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:13,120
a posture that has both some uprightness if not literally then

13
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,879
figuratively has a brightness with some dignity

14
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,040
but also some ease

15
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:37,840
also some relaxation

16
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,560
sometimes it can be helpful to just notice the chin sometimes we

17
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:56,000
raise them up a little bit or we find ourselves going down but to have it to be level with the shoulder

18
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:01,280
and to just tuck it just a tiny tiny bit

19
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,040
to open up a little space in the back of the neck

20
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,120
the placement of the chin and therefore the head

21
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:27,680
can really have a big impact on our

22
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,840
posture

23
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,519
perhaps taking a few full breaths

24
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:06,000
and just connecting to the sensations of

25
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:15,840
breathing

26
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,320
feeling the breath in the chest

27
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:43,520
and the abdomen or in the nose

28
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:50,240
and just allowing the attention to rest there on the

29
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:57,840
sensations of breathing

30
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:33,440
and what is it like to tune into the out breath to feel the out

31
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,840
breath from the beginning to the end

32
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,840
and what about the in-breath

33
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,919
all the phases of the in-breath

34
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:40,319
without straining more just opening up to

35
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:49,840
these experiences

36
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:45,840
and we can notice the transitions between the in-breaths and out-breaths

37
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:36,959
and it might be that at the end of the exhale

38
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,440
there's a little bit of a letting go a little bit of

39
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,959
a moment just a moment very subtle

40
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,519
moment of ease letting go of the exhale

41
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:09,839
and then the inhale naturally begins

42
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:36,880
it can be helpful to tune into that very slight

43
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:42,959
sense of letting go that's just naturally there at the end

44
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:51,839
of the exhale

45
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:36,079
there might be some other moments of letting go

46
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,360
letting go of thoughts

47
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:47,839
allowing the mind to come back to the sensations of breathing

48
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,320
there can be a time when the thought train

49
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:42,480
just runs out of steam and there's just a subtle moment there

50
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:57,839
a little bit of letting go and returning to mindfulness

51
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,680
it might be

52
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:23,279
but the mind this caught up in desire wanting

53
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:28,480
something fantasies of something you're going to

54
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:34,560
purchase or

55
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:48,000
sexual fantasies or thinking about what food you want to eat

56
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,320
you can be really supportive as best you can

57
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:59,680
on occasion to just hang out

58
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:03,839
with these desires

59
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:16,000
maintaining balance maintaining mindfulness as best you can

60
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:21,680
maybe making the note desire

61
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:31,839
maybe feeling the desire in the body

62
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:38,560
allowing it to be there

63
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:45,839
in a relaxed easy manner

64
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:51,839
for just noticing

65
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:59,760
this desire and sooner or later

66
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,959
it will subside

67
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:14,880
it's impermanent like everything else

68
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:33,199
and then as best we can to watch when the desire ends

69
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:42,320
not always easy and importantly to notice

70
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,440
what does it feel like after it has ended

71
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:54,480
when there's a certain letting go of that desire

72
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,839
feeling the absence of that desire the increased freedom of the mind not

73
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:09,839
being bound up in that

74
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,120
it's not our habit to notice the absence

75
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:34,639
but it can be really helpful oh yes it feels like this now

76
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:40,000
now that that desire has subsided

77
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:51,839
and feel the ease the freedom this spaciousness it might be subtle

78
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:49,280
there are lots of ways in which there's some letting go

79
00:20:49,280 --> 00:21:02,720
that naturally happens with our meditation practice

80
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:10,640
i can support our practice to recognize

81
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:17,840
how does it feel after there's a letting go

82
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:31,840
before the next clinging

83
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:38,080
there are so many things we can let go of

84
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:52,320
this path of practice is not about acquiring getting more and more and more

85
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,279
it's really about letting go letting go

86
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:06,640
and discovering the freedom the peace the ease the openness spaciousness that

87
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:17,840
becomes available when letting go happens

88
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:28,840
and this spaciousness and openness can support our practice support our

89
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:34,880
lives and also helps to make room

90
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:44,799
so that we can see others really see them and meet them how they are

91
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:50,320
support them in a way that's appropriate for us

92
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:58,640
and in this way our practice is a support not only for us

93
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,039
but for those around us

94
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:12,000
so may our practice together be for the benefit of all beings

95
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:27,840
everywhere without exception

96
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,998
[Music]

97
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:20,158
good evening and welcome welcome welcome a really warm welcome

98
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:27,120
i'm happy to be practicing with you all even though we're not all together in

99
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:32,240
the same room just to know that there's other people

100
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:40,080
practicing i don't know it's heartfelt or meaningful in some kind of way

101
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:48,000
so tonight i'd like to talk about the notion the practice the teachings of

102
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,880
letting go and in some way we could say that all

103
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:02,320
the teachings and all the practices come down to this idea of letting go

104
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:10,320
in fact we might understand that nibbana is a really radical type of letting go

105
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:19,200
a very thorough letting go letting go just completely letting go so

106
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:26,640
thoroughly that there's not even anyone to let go of anything

107
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:34,640
just this complete letting go

108
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:42,480
and it's quite something that maybe to think that it could be summarized and so simply and yet

109
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:50,399
how many sutas are there how many dharma talks have there been how many times have we meditated

110
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,799
so somehow this um letting go is not so easy or

111
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:04,080
maybe it's simple the idea is simple but maybe not so easy

112
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:12,399
and part of it is to have the confidence and to have the trust that this is the

113
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:18,559
direction to go it's not to be grabbing on for more and more things or

114
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:24,320
not to be clinging tighter but to be softening and loosening

115
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:31,840
whatever it is we find ourselves holding to whether that's ideas or

116
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:38,240
people experiences wishes

117
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:48,080
and so this confidence this trust on why to let go or how to let go or

118
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,600
even to ask one question does one even do the letting go or does letting go

119
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,840
just arise just happen

120
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:05,679
and it can take years of practice to unlearn a lifetime of clinging and

121
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,120
acquiring of course it does when

122
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:18,320
certainly our society certainly promotes acquisition so kind of a renunciation or letting go

123
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:24,080
is the opposite movement of what we've probably been doing for most

124
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,919
of our lives and what other people around us are doing

125
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:37,039
and it takes years of practice to appreciate that more freedom and ease

126
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,559
arise with this letting go on the guided meditation i did before

127
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:48,080
this dharma talk i pointed to some they might be very subtle but some letting go

128
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,440
that just naturally happens with meditation practice

129
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:58,640
letting go of thought trains that happen and then we come back to the breath and

130
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:04,960
just to notice that slight moment maybe it's a split second

131
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:10,560
when that letting go happens and there's a little bit more ease and freedom

132
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:20,240
the letting go that happens at the end of the exhale just a natural physiological letting go

133
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,800
or we can hang out with a strong emotion and if we can stay steady and with a

134
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,240
certain degree of mindfulness we can notice that even that too there's a certain letting go

135
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:35,839
it subsides

136
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:46,240
and certainly not only in our meditation practice but we can notice letting go in our daily life

137
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:55,679
and we might even say that learning to let go skillfully is part of having a happy life

138
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:03,440
but we regularly let go of plans that go with preferences maybe let go of opinions when we get new

139
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,440
information when it just doesn't make sense anymore to be holding on

140
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,400
to the picnic outside when it starts to rain

141
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:21,359
it doesn't make sense to have one particular view when you get more information you

142
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:27,760
realize oh i didn't realize that i guess what i was thinking isn't quite right

143
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:31,839
i'm gonna adjust my thinking now

144
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:40,640
and if maybe i'll say also thinking about daily life that there

145
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:46,160
might be competing priorities that cause us to let go of you know we

146
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:52,800
want to do this but then when we realize it conflicts or gets in the way of

147
00:35:52,800 --> 00:36:00,720
something that's more important to us and of course we just naturally let go of what is less

148
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,480
important through us and the same way letting go is part of

149
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:12,160
buddhist practice part of our spiritual practice this letting go of this

150
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,200
it's kind of this underlying compulsion that we have to want to hold on to

151
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,359
things and to go get things

152
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:30,400
but it's not only the things the objects or the views or ideas that we might have

153
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,800
but it's the clinging to them of course we need to hold on to things

154
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:45,680
literally to carry them but of course we have views opinions ideas

155
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,599
of course we have preferences but the practice here is not to cling to

156
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,040
them not to be strangling them and not to be holding on to them

157
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:04,079
so tightly that that the clinging is painful which again might be really

158
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:12,800
subtle but kind of like inhibits our life shrinks our life makes things smaller

159
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:22,400
and letting go of this idea that if i just have this one more

160
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,839
object this one more experience if i just leave this thing hard enough then that

161
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:36,079
will be a source of lasting happiness sometimes we're clinging to this ideas this has to make me happy

162
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,359
so can we let go of that type of clinging

163
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,800
as well as letting go of a strong sense of self so

164
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:54,560
not only like these outdated or no longer accurate ideas that we

165
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:01,839
might have about ourselves certainly we can let go of those and that often happens naturally

166
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:09,760
but also the idea that there's a a me at the center of it all me

167
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,000
right here i'm here and everything else is over there

168
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:22,240
me and you something like this

169
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:29,760
can there be a letting go of that strong sense of me in the center often this doesn't make sense to people

170
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,720
until they have some experience of it but we can point to it if we point to those ideas of flow

171
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,000
you've heard about this where when we're doing something enjoyable

172
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:49,200
and we kind of just get lost in what we're doing and there's the sense of me isn't really

173
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:54,640
prevalent there this could be with gardening finding ourselves with the plants singing

174
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:01,119
dancing sports our favorite hobbies often there are they are

175
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,720
our favorite hobbies because we can see the sense of self often

176
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:14,160
is often while we're crocheting or whatever it might be

177
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,440
i appreciate very much um what i've seen gil do about this idea of letting go of

178
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:26,960
clinging or just letting go in general and he often uh does this demonstration

179
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:32,560
with this striker and it talks about this can be a letting

180
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:38,320
go which then we're really holding on very tightly to this and there can be a letting go that's

181
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,720
like this so that we no longer have it let's just let go and the striker is no

182
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:50,720
longer there and that might be appropriate if what we're holding on to

183
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,000
is unwholesome and unhelpful

184
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,000
but often if we're really holding on to something we can't just simply let go especially if it's

185
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:07,760
unhelpful we might know it's unhelpful but we can't stop the clinging

186
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:14,400
so something that i appreciate very much that gill has shown is to let go this way

187
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,720
just to soften the clinging the striker is still here in my hand

188
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:27,359
i've just unclenched my fist around it so is there a way in which we can have

189
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:33,200
this movement of opening maybe we can just open a little bit maybe we open

190
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:40,240
a lot so this idea of clinging and letting go

191
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:45,599
letting go of clinging so it's not so much the actual objects because

192
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:51,040
or objects or views because some of them are really worth having in our life and are

193
00:40:51,040 --> 00:40:58,240
appropriate to have so you might say okay well

194
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:04,560
sure klingon seems like it should be a good idea but how does one do this

195
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:11,839
how does one let go either by unclenching the fist this way but still holding the object or

196
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:18,400
letting go in a way which the object completely goes away

197
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:26,160
well one way is to notice the feeling

198
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:33,520
the experience or maybe even imagine what will be gained with the letting go

199
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:40,319
that is let go into something that feels more open more

200
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:47,599
spacious a little more ease something that's more satisfying and

201
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:54,160
pleasant and for those of you who are familiar with concentration practices

202
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,000
to get deeper and deeper with concentration in fact to even get concentrated at the beginning

203
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,119
is all about letting go whether we think about that explicitly or not

204
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:12,640
but uh concentration is described as like a shedding first of the hindrances

205
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:19,839
and then of different factors that arise the kind of like let go let go

206
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:27,040
so just to recognize that when you find yourself that there's a certain amount of settledness

207
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:35,040
you might just do a little bit of reflection oh yeah this feels a little more spacious or open

208
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,480
than the unsettled mind that was perhaps a few moments before or at the beginning

209
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,720
of the meditation session so to recognize that this movement of

210
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:53,119
letting go is associated with settledness ease pleasantness

211
00:42:53,119 --> 00:43:00,640
i'm using this word openness spaciousness but it's usually um a pleasant a comfortable

212
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:03,039
feeling

213
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:13,839
and here's a poem from rosemary trummer so kind of about this about this idea of

214
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:21,520
letting go and letting go into and rosemary trauma she wrote this in

215
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:28,640
on december 9th 2020 still in the midst of the pandemic

216
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:37,440
and the title is a little pep talk i love this a little pep talk

217
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:43,440
and this poem goes like this the swirling ash doesn't try to become

218
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:48,880
log again the flying leaves don't attempt to

219
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:55,599
return to the tree the girl can't untwist her genome back

220
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:02,160
into separate strands the flower in the bed the flower in the

221
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:09,680
bread can't return to the sack can't undo the kneading of hands

222
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:16,800
in all things lives a memory of letting go and the chance to transform into what it

223
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:23,200
can't know what do you say to that heart good self

224
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:26,800
what do you say to that

225
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,560
so rosemary trauma and in my mind she's uh giving herself a little pep talk

226
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:40,000
reminding herself yeah you know good things happen nice cozy

227
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:45,599
fires bread the leaves just fall from the tree it's

228
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:51,520
natural senescence is a natural thing that happens it's you know part of the lifespan of trees

229
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:56,079
maybe it's pleasant to walk around in crunchy leaves

230
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:03,200
but just this recognition that letting go is natural and it's part of what happens

231
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,240
but it helps create the conditions for something else to arise and maybe we already know

232
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:16,480
what this something else is that arises something pleasant and open

233
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:26,000
so that's one way to support letting go is to let go into

234
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:32,240
maybe it's letting go of some of the hindrances letting go of insisting that our meditation go a particular way

235
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,440
and instead being able to just acknowledge and

236
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,520
appreciate how it is going

237
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:49,359
then the second way the buddha talks about a lot

238
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:56,720
is this idea of noticing the gratification the drawbacks and the escape

239
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,960
the gratification drawbacks and escape and the buddha talks about this in lots

240
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:08,480
of different contexts and i appreciate very much that it starts with gratification

241
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:15,920
so what is meant here is to start with acknowledging that our experience in the

242
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:22,160
world provides some degree of gratification and enjoyment there are pleasant

243
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:29,760
experiences to be had and to notice them

244
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,119
and and maybe to also to notice the pleasure or the happiness that

245
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:41,359
arises when our desires are fulfilled when we get to that thing that we

246
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:49,040
believe we want when we get it at that moment there can be a certain ah i don't know

247
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:55,440
maybe certain like i got it i achieved it whether that's just the satisfaction

248
00:46:55,440 --> 00:47:00,960
comes out of the ending of the desire or the beginning of having that's

249
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:07,680
another dharma talk but just to notice that we there is a

250
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:14,880
there can be a pleasant sensation that's associated with achieving acquiring getting something

251
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:23,599
and holding on and whether that's just an experience or an object or an idea

252
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:30,000
but then when we look more closely and often this is what meditation practice can help us do

253
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:37,359
it can help um fine-tune the mind so we can look more closely when we look

254
00:47:37,359 --> 00:47:43,119
more closely we notice that there is a little bit of a dark underbelly

255
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:48,318
of these pleasant experiences

256
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:57,440
i remember one time being on vacation and it's a wonderful place just really

257
00:47:57,440 --> 00:48:03,599
enjoying it and my traveling partner kept on talking about oh next i want to

258
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,720
go here and next i want to have that and oh my gosh i can't believe we have to leave on this

259
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:17,440
date and so they were like kind of tuned in to like this fear that it's going to end

260
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:22,800
and what are we going to do next and i don't want it to end and maybe this other place will be

261
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,920
just as okay

262
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:34,319
so there's often this dark underbelly the unpleasant experiences there's this

263
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:39,520
little niggling oh i hope this doesn't end how can i

264
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:45,599
keep this can i turn up the volume on this just a little bit

265
00:48:45,599 --> 00:48:51,119
i want more so often even with these pleasant

266
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:58,000
experiences there's a little bit of agitation associated with them

267
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:05,599
and this is what the buddha's talking about the drawbacks there's often some agitation because

268
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:10,880
we know that things are impermanent we know that it's not going to last forever

269
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:17,839
and we wish it were we wish it would last forever

270
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:25,920
and not only are things impermanent but they are they have this liability for

271
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:31,920
suffering this kind of the agitation of not wanting it to end and i have to find the next thing that's

272
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,520
going to be just as pleasant or how can i make sure that this doesn't go away

273
00:49:37,520 --> 00:49:44,079
and this might be subtle but that doesn't mean that it's insignificant

274
00:49:44,079 --> 00:49:49,839
this little bit of unease that happens when we're associated with

275
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:56,839
things and so that that the buddha often emphasized the drawbacks

276
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:02,640
in many experiences and he talked a lot about the drawbacks in

277
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:10,079
sensual pleasures not because that they're sinful

278
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:17,280
or something like that but just because he noticed that as humans we so much are just

279
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:25,280
can spend our lives chasing one sensual pleasure after another and not really paying attention

280
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:31,520
trying to deny that there are any drawbacks even though there's a part of us that knows that there

281
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:40,319
are so trying to have this sense that um

282
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:46,079
trying to ignore maybe that part of our experience so that the buddha was pointing there is

283
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:51,440
suffering and an encouragement not to indulge in

284
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:59,440
sensual pleasures and so when we see this in some

285
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:07,359
deep radical way when we see that ideas

286
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:16,000
people objects experiences can't be sources of lasting happiness

287
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:22,960
they just can't they're changing they're inconstant they end they

288
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:29,599
create the conditions in which we have this agitation where we're trying to want more or chase after them in some

289
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:37,280
kind of way but when there's a real a real deep understanding oh this

290
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:44,240
this can't be a source of lasting happiness perhaps there's a part i wish it were

291
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:49,839
but this deep understanding that it can't then letting go

292
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:56,000
naturally happens it just doesn't make sense anymore to be

293
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,160
holding on so there's a way in which some deep

294
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:08,880
insights maybe more than just an intellectual understanding but more an experiential

295
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:14,960
understanding maybe like deep inside to see that the agitation the suffering

296
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:20,640
that's associated with clinging to recognize that things are inconstant and

297
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:27,359
they end then letting go naturally happens

298
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:36,720
and that is the escape but the buddha talked about the gratification drawbacks and escape

299
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:44,880
that's the the release from the drawbacks the ending of them

300
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:53,920
when we see that our craving for pleasure in some way kind of like binds us to what is inherently

301
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:59,520
flawed maybe not perfect it won't be perfectly satisfying

302
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:08,079
then we just stop maybe i shouldn't say we just stop i should say maybe just clinging stops

303
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:17,599
so the buddha talked about this in his own practice

304
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:24,240
and maybe in some ways this gratification drawbacks sometimes also translated as

305
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:31,760
danger and escape these three elements in some ways we might say this is a

306
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:37,440
foundation onto the whole buddhist practice and the buddha describes in his own

307
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:43,200
practice this is a quote from asuta he says mendicants

308
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:50,079
talking to his followers before my awakening when i was still unawakened but intent

309
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:55,680
on awakening i thought what is the gratification in the world

310
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:00,960
what is the drawback and what is the escape

311
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:06,800
then it occurred to me the pleasure and happiness that arise from the world

312
00:54:06,800 --> 00:54:13,760
this is the gratification that the world is impermanent suffering and perishable

313
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:19,440
that is its drawback and removing and giving up desire and greed

314
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:27,200
for the world this is its escape and as long as i didn't truly understand

315
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:33,680
the world's gratification drawback and escape in this way for what they are i didn't

316
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:40,480
announce my supreme perfect awakening but when i did truly understand the

317
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:47,920
world's gratification drawback and escape in this way i announced my supreme perfect awakening

318
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:53,920
in this world so his realization was a part of his

319
00:54:53,920 --> 00:55:02,319
awakening that kind of allowed this uh radical letting go that's nibana this really radical

320
00:55:02,319 --> 00:55:07,838
complete completely thorough letting go that is nibana

321
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:14,880
so this grad noticing the gratification drawback and escape is another way that can support the letting

322
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:21,200
go and it might be that with some

323
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:29,160
more obvious or [Music] less dearly held

324
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:35,839
experiences objects people things we can let go we can say you know

325
00:55:35,839 --> 00:55:40,880
what this just doesn't make any sense anymore i'm going to let go and it might be that with some of the

326
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:46,160
more subtle ones it's with insight into impermanence

327
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:52,400
suffering not self that letting go naturally happens

328
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:01,440
so maybe in some way we can also as a support for letting go

329
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:08,079
or we can consider it as a giving up and up as in like we give

330
00:56:08,079 --> 00:56:15,839
up and we put up onto the altar i kind of like this idea like we make an

331
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:23,839
offering like as an act of generosity to let go might be to give up

332
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:30,079
as to recognize that i'm going to offer this

333
00:56:30,079 --> 00:56:35,760
to something bigger something other than me

334
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:41,119
makes it more kind of a sacred act if you will in a type of movement of

335
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:48,480
the heart and to be sure this letting go and

336
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:53,920
giving up should be done in the service of what is wholesome and

337
00:56:53,920 --> 00:57:00,000
virtuous you know or and in service of beneficial states of mind

338
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,960
there's absolutely no obligation to do this it's just part of the path of finding

339
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:13,200
more and more ease and more and more freedom in our lives

340
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:21,040
so to let go if we feel like we're kicking and screaming and kind of you know um

341
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:26,319
really protesting wanting to letting go maybe maybe it's not quite right to let go of

342
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:32,960
that maybe there's something more to understand about why we're letting go and

343
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:41,838
what is it that we believe is the support that we're getting from whatever it is we might be holding on to

344
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:50,480
so that letting go is the service of creating a inner wealth this

345
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:57,599
inner treasure if you will of this spaciousness and ease

346
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:05,520
and so that we're able to let go of the unwholesome and make the which helps makes room and

347
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:11,359
brings in the wholesome so in this way we might understand that

348
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:17,280
letting go is an integral part of the practice and there's a number of movements

349
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:24,240
that we can do to support letting go and maybe some of those are intentional

350
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:32,400
and some of them are creating the conditions in which insights can arise and then letting go just arises

351
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:40,240
but whatever degree of letting go we do and whatever manner we do it

352
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:47,119
can it be for the benefit of ourselves and for those around us if we're no

353
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:54,160
longer clinging so tightly to things can there make space

354
00:58:54,160 --> 00:59:00,319
for other people make space for our ability to be able to

355
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:08,720
hear them and see them and to be available for them and to be available for ourselves

356
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:14,160
so that letting go may be for the benefit of

357
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:26,079
ourselves others and all beings everywhere thank you
