1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:09,880
so uh so welcome folks um yeah good to uh good to be with

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,760
you so uh we'll do that that uh thing we do

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,080
together so uh finding uh finding your posture

4
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:52,239
and so natural to predict that the next moment will be a great deal like the

5
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:09,640
last to expect me the next moment

6
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:39,400
some level our highest priority is not being startled by a niche

7
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,840
that can uh deaden our experience

8
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:08,360
of our life

9
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,280
relaxing whatever can be relaxed

10
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,440
we're just practicing being alive just

11
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:31,080
available to uh experience moment by moment

12
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:26,199
just being uh kind of internally caressed by your breathing

13
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:43,720
sort of sweeping soothing movement

14
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,240
your breathing unifying your Buddy

15
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,400
to the imperfections of this moment of our

16
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:30,280
lives we We don't have to say yes to those imperfections forever

17
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:42,039
but for right now we can there's always something

18
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:50,638
wrong is something we might tweak or adjust or fix or dial

19
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:59,120
in just stop being baited by Mara

20
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,759
moment by moment

21
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,519
each uh breath just

22
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:37,240
uh becoming secluded

23
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:09,440
if there's a thread of interest

24
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:18,160
curiosity kind of passion to know something

25
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:26,399
anything just follow that uh thread of

26
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:33,399
interest we can't manufacture interest when it's not there but when it is

27
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:39,079
there it's maybe the most

28
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:45,079
trustworthy intention for practice

29
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,079
we're practicing

30
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:22,240
noticing new phenomena or familiar phenomena in just slightly

31
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,520
new ways

32
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,679
the poetry and aliveness of not knowing or not quite

33
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:48,679
knowing

34
00:20:55,679 --> 00:21:01,279
we expect to find ourselves in the next

35
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:15,480
moment we're invited to put down these kinds of expectations

36
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:55,799
what does it mean to uh cease

37
00:21:55,799 --> 00:22:03,320
reiterating the self as we

38
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:11,600
breathe feel to our body sense the my

39
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:22,760
head the mind comes uh infused with

40
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:27,159
uh Buddha Dharma

41
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:53,000
we uh forget ourselves to

42
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:57,320
remember the path

43
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,609
[Music]

44
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:26,440
okay so um some years ago maybe

45
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:31,880
it's 201 18 I think

46
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:37,760
um Gil and and some others um were uh

47
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:45,520
kind of in the spir uh system were asked to write some brief reflections on um on

48
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:50,600
CIA ethical conduct and

49
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:55,919
um and I I wrote you know they just asked for a couple paragraphs so wrote

50
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,919
something and one of the SA members was was um asking about those those words

51
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:09,440
and so I thought to uh go back and uh revisit them so I'll just um read what I

52
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:14,760
wrote and uh and then say say a few

53
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:22,399
words so um I said um make make of yourself a

54
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:29,440
refuge for all beings the Buddha enjoins us to cultivate this radical heart a

55
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,240
cultivation expressing not only sila but samadei and pa

56
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:42,679
too to be safe for others entails a path of self-discovery humility

57
00:30:42,679 --> 00:30:49,200
sensitivity and willingness to be softened by one's suffering goodness ripens through a

58
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:55,440
process of letting go and letting go involves a measure of grief we grieve

59
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:02,279
the harm done to us and the harm done by us we grieve the human condition the

60
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:07,360
indivisibility of life and suffering this process is

61
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:12,520
autobiographical idiosyncratic and

62
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:20,480
universal to be mindful of goodness brings love to be mindful of pain also

63
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,559
brings love that asymmetry is the

64
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:31,000
miracle the more attuned we are to our heart and its instant karmic

65
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:38,799
reverberations the clearer our ethical life will be the more unified the mind becomes the

66
00:31:38,799 --> 00:31:46,080
deeper the love will be boundless nothing but warmth the effortless care that is the

67
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:53,519
face of emptiness we learn unwaveringly hatred is never the last

68
00:31:53,519 --> 00:32:01,159
word to see more is to love more sila expresses the entire

69
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:08,799
path and then we begin again the story we tell about love is

70
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:14,919
never final new questions complexities and debts

71
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:21,320
arise might I owe more than I suppose the ego complicates

72
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:27,600
everything i want to think of myself as a really good person and I don't really

73
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:33,440
want to change my behavior ethical development stagnates

74
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:40,960
when we rationalize our preferences it's conceivable that goodness entails much more than even we

75
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:46,320
good people are accustomed to giving just because the

76
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:54,840
saint is extremely rare doesn't mean that anything less strictly speaking is

77
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:02,000
justifiable can imagine in the notistant future a major reconfiguration of our

78
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,080
ethical obligations to non-human animals to the egregious suffering of the most

79
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:16,200
vulnerable around the globe and to future generations this is a time for radical

80
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:24,000
hearts i don't usually feel up to the task but I am steadfast in keeping a

81
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,080
relationship with my own sense of moral

82
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:35,840
incoherence from that relationship I hope that I evolve and contribute more

83
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:41,559
of what I owe to the welfare of others the path

84
00:33:41,559 --> 00:33:49,600
unfolds then at some point it's time to die that final gesture of letting go

85
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,760
which is both deeply poignant and also not such a big

86
00:33:54,760 --> 00:34:03,158
deal your life was made complete by what you gave away

87
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:22,118
so you might was asked to write something about sila but uh

88
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:30,440
might enter uh the doorway of wisdom find your way to sila and

89
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:36,800
samadei uh likewise there there are those people who committed to love and

90
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:42,000
service to sila who uh maybe without knowing their

91
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:49,000
existence just quietly find their way into more and more wisdom and

92
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:58,000
stillness and this is part of why dharma talks not you know they they

93
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:05,920
just don't tend to stay on one theme you know if you like sampled 5 seconds of a

94
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,079
thousand dharma seed talks it would be hard to know what the topic was you know

95
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,720
in each one because it just weaves together you cannot talk about love

96
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:29,280
without talking about wisdom and so to to be a refuge to cease doing

97
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,560
so much harm uh that that that entails a a a

98
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:41,640
measure of clarity and attunement of sensitivity and humility of

99
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:51,920
tracking the ways our being uh ripples out into others

100
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:58,280
and there must be a kind of you know I' I've been kind

101
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,800
of circumambulating this theme for a long time you know but uh being wrong

102
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:12,680
that book uh Katherine Schultz wrote many years ago um but graceful

103
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:18,000
gracefulness gracefulness about having been wrong is

104
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,800
just indispensable in our moral evolution and our our evolution as

105
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:32,079
practitioners and the this process this process by which

106
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:42,280
we we grow this process by which we recognize uh some measure of uh

107
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:48,079
um that uh we were wrong in some way

108
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:53,680
that process um uh often feels like uh

109
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:00,920
like something like grieving and uh the growing pains of dharma feel like

110
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:11,680
grieving but um we need not be uh so afraid of pain when

111
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:18,359
we've acquired the taste for purification

112
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,119
and it's amazing to feel we actually get a sense of it happening inside us almost

113
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:32,880
alchemically i don't know how to say it exactly but unpleasant vena un you know the

114
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:41,800
intensity the imperfection of life becoming the brahma vharas becoming some species of

115
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:50,720
love and it strikes me that um something like solid liquid

116
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:57,359
gas pain grief

117
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:06,960
love it's one dharma talk for 100 people the dharma said to be universal right

118
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:14,920
but almost a kind of infinite number of constellations of upaya skillful

119
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:20,760
means and what is wisdom for one is delusion for

120
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:27,599
another and the way that delusion often manifests is not doing the opposite of what the Buddha says but delusion

121
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:36,200
expresses itself when we reach for the wrong teaching when we try maybe

122
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:42,839
to fit our practice into someone else's mind into some

123
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:51,160
ideal so much of practice is uh a kind of sensitive improvisational

124
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:57,720
uh way of being and so you're you're not

125
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:03,560
assimilating to some Buddhist culture you're

126
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:09,320
finding your belonging within the dharma

127
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:17,200
idiosyncratic and yet feels exactly like

128
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:25,880
home this love can um stabilize can linger with us is never far never

129
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:34,800
far animates our daily rhythms and I don't know you know I'm a

130
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:43,920
I'm not a my sleep is not lucid you know I'm a dumb sleeper

131
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,680
kind of I know some people are dream yoga and various things and lucid

132
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:54,720
dreaming yeah beautiful right that's not my experience i don't know if I could

133
00:39:54,720 --> 00:40:01,838
train myself but but if you woke up in a dream a lucid

134
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:08,680
dream it would be I presume very easy to love to love

135
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:16,240
almost recklessly the sense of being conscious of being in a dream and to

136
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:24,480
feel as I imagine I would that love is utterly

137
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:33,079
costfree and what happens if we wake up in our life and it becomes

138
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:42,400
more dreamlike what uh shape would your love

139
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:54,040
take the story we tell about love is never final story we tell about love

140
00:40:54,040 --> 00:41:01,160
evolves and we're suggestible where

141
00:41:01,160 --> 00:41:07,440
um the you know when in bachelor's rendition it's like it's hard to hear

142
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:15,760
the dharma when you love your place and you know loving one's place I would

143
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:23,119
say is part of it is is being a person of our time of course we're all people

144
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:28,880
of our time but we're incredibly suggestible morally speaking even When

145
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:36,040
we call ourselves radical we take on many of the dominant values

146
00:41:36,040 --> 00:41:43,760
culture and so part of our practice is developing kind of deep moral

147
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:50,480
imagination this line from um theologian Hesshel

148
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:56,960
that uh quotes sometimes uh the prophet the prophet is human yet they employ

149
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:03,040
notes one octave too high for our ears they experience moments that defy

150
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:10,160
our understanding they are neither a singing saint nor a moralizing poet but an

151
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:17,839
assaulter of the mind often their words begin to burn where

152
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:21,480
conscience ends

153
00:42:23,560 --> 00:42:28,599
uh the philosopher Parfett said um we're

154
00:42:28,599 --> 00:42:35,000
separated you know in in a kind of philosophical inquiry into

155
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,680
identity came to the the sense of um that we're separated from our future

156
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,720
selves by time separated by fellow humans by

157
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:55,040
space and why does the separation across time matter so much more separation

158
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:02,640
across space that sounds harsh maybe but um the

159
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:09,319
phrase that came to me is that the ego makes liars of us

160
00:43:09,319 --> 00:43:17,760
all just liars that's not to inject a measure of self

161
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,280
you know the dharma selfconquering the ego or something like that i know it's

162
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:31,359
strong language but the truth just seems absolutely meaningless to the

163
00:43:32,119 --> 00:43:39,160
ego and in a sense it's only when we wake up to

164
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:49,040
uh uh love we only wake up to love when the homelessness of ego is realized

165
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,359
grieved released

166
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:59,520
and this um seems to me

167
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:07,000
uh for me it's the only way that my life feel uh might feel complete the

168
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:15,040
end you know it's like otherwise even a thousand years would feel like I'm being

169
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:20,480
robbed of something so what what would be complete

170
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:30,400
for your heart what would be a complete life the sense of this this life was enough this life was

171
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:40,160
enough and uh so we practice completing our life we

172
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:48,680
practice dying before we die offer this for your u

173
