arriving wholeheartedly

14
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,000
in this body inhabiting this body

15
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:09,840
allowing inviting this body to sit tall

16
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:18,640
with a sense of integrity like a mountain

17
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,160
upright

18
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:44,160
a new well rooted like a well-rooted tree connected to the earth

19
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:52,560
through our sid bones our bottom our legs our feet

20
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:00,680
well rooted connected to the earth

21
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,200
all the while the top of this

22
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,959
tree tall reaches up to the sky

23
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,959
and let the branches the leaves the limbs

24
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,840
ah be relaxed

25
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:05,239
offering itself offering themselves to gravity

26
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,520
letting our awareness trace

27
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,360
trace the body the outline of the body

28
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:33,560
as a horror drawing three-dimensional drawing

29
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,960
brushing [Music] our entire body worse than the

30
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,039
edges with our awareness

31
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,759
this whole body sitting

32
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,680
and then letting it be filled out

33
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:25,280
letting the breath be like watercolors

34
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:31,440
filling out the whole body

35
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,840
not effortfully but let it just happen on its own all we

36
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,199
do [Music] there's very little doing here if any

37
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:51,680
it's just to turn our awareness turn our awareness

38
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:58,560
our attention to a particular perception

39
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,560
a way of seeing

40
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,160
in this body right now

41
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,160
and as the breath

42
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,919
is received by the body

43
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:33,400
entire body the whole body breathing bellowing

44
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:55,839
turning awareness to the entire body bellowing the breath entering

45
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:06,040
leaving letting the body be relaxed

46
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:15,440
let the body be an organ of perception

47
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:22,000
so that we're not noticing the body from the top of our head from the control

48
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,480
tower

49
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,080
but as if our mind

50
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:44,000
is in the body in the perceptions the sensations of the body

51
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:48,760
itself

52
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:58,279
you're noticing your breath in your belly right now say

53
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:14,160
the belly is sensing itself the mind is in the abdomen [Music]

54
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,639
as if your abdomen has eyes ears

55
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:40,880
trusting trusting that the body knows

56
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,040
how to sense how to breathe how to perceive

57
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:54,000
relaxing [Music] relaxing it's not

58
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:02,880
hard trust your body your body knows

59
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,240
how to sense

60
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:30,320
the body as an organ of perception

61
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,519
perceiving receiving the breath

62
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,480
from within

63
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,959
the body knows senses simply

64
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,000
sensing the sensations

65
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:09,600
whatever wherever is most prominent use the abdomen for this example

66
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,199
sensation sensed on their own

67
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,480
in the sense to only the sense

68
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:45,839
and the felt only the felt no distance

69
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,000
no separation it's just a sensation

70
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,839
no need for commentary

71
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:42,160
from the inside of the abdomen of the sensations

72
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,680
themselves being sensed

73
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:06,399
pressure tightness

74
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,720
movement

75
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,600
vibration

76
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,440
maybe even warmth and coolness

77
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,880
everything we need to weaken is presented to us

78
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,960
in the body in this long fathom body

79
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,840
we just need to pay attention in a particular way

80
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,960
so today let the body

81
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:48,640
have its own mind the locus

82
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:57,039
of perception of sensation in the sensation itself

83
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:08,799
the knowing in the known itself not from afar not from a distance

84
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,600
so as a sensation presents itself in the body

85
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,360
whether the breath or something else

86
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,919
let the mind relax into that sensation

87
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:43,080
be drenched in that sensation from the inside

88
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:55,520
and hang in there it will become clear on its own

89
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,640
if the thought arises i can't do this what does it mean and

90
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:11,360
you believe that and you go with it it will take a long time to click or it might

91
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:18,880
never hang in there trust trust that the body knows

92
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:24,280
how to sense and perceive

93
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,320
without the need for analysis and commentary

94
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:49,679
this particular way of perceiving is not quite clicking yet

95
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:54,720
i invite you to imagine [Music] that you

96
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:01,200
whoever you are or if there is a you you are in the abdomen

97
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,080
in the sensations

98
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:47,159
and stay stay

99
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,840
with perceiving in this way

100
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,640
whole body perceiving sensations

101
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,320
from the inside

102
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,840
just points of sensation

103
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,200
no need for you

104
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:57,559
just points of sensation

105
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,520
the self can drop out

106
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,960
just points of sensation

107
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:50,000
and as we bring this sit to a close

108
00:29:52,840 --> 00:30:01,919
together holding ourselves with kindness or whatever arose or did not rise

109
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,320
we've showed up we've done our best

110
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,120
whether distraction arose or sleepiness or

111
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:18,399
whatever else it's okay

112
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:26,080
we've done our best even if there was one moment of

113
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:31,740
awareness clarity mindfulness that's infinitely more than zero

114
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,880
[Music] moments

115
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:45,600
so appreciating that we are planting seeds of cultivation

116
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:50,880
towards clarity awareness

117
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:56,640
knowing awakening kindness

118
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:05,840
goodness and offering this goodness ours and collectively

119
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:12,960
wholeheartedly trusting there is goodness here co-created

120
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:20,880
offering generously to all beings everywhere it's not for us to keep

121
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:26,960
not nothing is for us to keep in this impermanent life

122
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:32,960
nothing so sharing our goodness our heart

123
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,080
our actions wholesome actions

124
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:44,080
for the benefit of all beings everywhere including ourselves may all beings

125
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:47,080
everywhere

126
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:55,919
know their own goodness may all beings

127
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:01,240
be happy may all beings be free

128
00:33:52,320 --> 00:34:00,880
so greetings greetings dear sangha dear international sangha all around the world

129
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,799
so we are continuing to explore the mind's body this week

130
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:17,919
and [Music] for today's guided meditation

131
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:26,398
for today's exploration just a few words and what what we did

132
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:31,520
and what the basis for these invitations were

133
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:41,200
so we tend to pay attention in a regular way in in

134
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:46,398
what we're used to in the world going around as a human being

135
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:53,358
and many of us most of all of us kind of consider that our mind or

136
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:59,200
our mind whatever our mind is and of course philosophers and scientists

137
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,240
so many treaties on on the mind unconsciousness we still don't

138
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,680
know what it is and where it is and all that so but we have this pers

139
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:15,440
this perception that our mind is somewhere in our head

140
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:21,520
and we perceive somewhere in our head behind our eyes there's the self here

141
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,960
that perceives the world

142
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,640
and and when we are noticing say the body

143
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:39,359
sensations in the body the breath pain it's always this dualistic relationship

144
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:44,640
there is the self there is this me there is

145
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:50,000
this awareness consciousness whatever it is it's up here it's up here and oh yeah

146
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,760
there is there is the abdomen there is my foot there's pain in the foot itch

147
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:02,800
there there's this dualistic relationship um

148
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,320
subject object

149
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:14,160
and [Music] and particular relationship arises when we

150
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:21,280
pay attention in this usual habitual way particular perceptions arise

151
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:28,720
that are not exactly conducive to to waking up to awakening

152
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,920
so the invitation today

153
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,200
was to really

154
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,440
consider paying attention in a different way not from the control

155
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:54,079
tower you might have heard that before but maybe in the brief pith instruction and then other instructions after that

156
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:01,920
but really really land in the body as if the body is an organ

157
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:07,599
of perception itself it's perceiving in and of itself and i

158
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:12,960
was giving invitations to imagine the you or whoever you are

159
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:20,640
there's perception in your abdomen you're perceiving the sensations or in your whole body or wherever

160
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,240
the sensations are arising and and you need to stay with this because

161
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:31,760
for most people with this instruction um you might think that oh what from the

162
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,400
inside i'm sense i'm in my abdomen i'm sensing the sensations from the inside

163
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:46,000
of themselves not from the control tower like how does that even work i don't know how to do this ah

164
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,160
so so that is very normal that can arise and yet if you give into that way of

165
00:37:52,160 --> 00:38:00,079
thinking it will never click it will never this perception can never shift this new way can never open up

166
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,160
so what needs to happen if it didn't click for you or even if it did click you need to

167
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,280
stay if it comes up oh i don't know how to do this like wow this is unfamiliar i always paid attention from the top like

168
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,320
what does it even mean what the heck is she meaning to to sense the sensations

169
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:25,520
from within themselves so stay stay stay you need to stay and it

170
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,800
will shift it will make sense on its own so jake don't give in to the thoughts of i

171
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:37,440
don't know what this means because of course it's a new way i'm inviting you to try something completely different

172
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:46,880
it's like riding a bicycle if you've never sent right ridden a bicycle before you need to stay with it stay with it

173
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,800
and then what can arise what can arise is

174
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,320
a sense of perception perceiving the sensations in

175
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:04,960
the body in and of itself there is no commentary

176
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:12,240
there it's just the sensations being sensed in dissents only the sensed

177
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,320
only the sense so these sensations being sensed in and of themselves without a

178
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,520
point of reference so these points of sensation

179
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:28,560
all over the body all over quote-unquote the body

180
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:35,280
and then it becomes just points of sensations being sensed in space

181
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:42,720
and the body will drop out to just be points of sensations and the self

182
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,160
drops out as well this is one way to have insight

183
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:55,599
into not self into anata there's so many different ways this is one way to see that and i was

184
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:03,119
guiding you this morning and albeit it's a daily meditation it's only 30 minutes but yet

185
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:12,480
some of your minds might be ready to have an insight here to see it for a split second or maybe take this practice

186
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:20,240
into the future and sit with it maybe it will plant seeds for insights to open up

187
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,880
and this teaching um the buddha gave a beautiful pith

188
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,839
teaching to um [Music] to bahia so i like to read actually let

189
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:41,760
me tell you the story of bahia so so bahia the wanderer

190
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:48,319
and the time of the buddha he was a dedicated practitioner

191
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:54,240
and um he was practicing very hard but not

192
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,319
he was not a buddhist in some other tradition and he thought he was awakened and the story goes that

193
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:07,119
um [Music] he's told that actually you're not awakened yet go find the buddha he can

194
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:13,280
really give you the true teachings and take you to the end so he um

195
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:20,240
comes and shares and finds the buddha and arrives when the buddha

196
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:25,440
is about to go for arms around

197
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,520
to get his daily meal and he says the buddha have come all this way please please give me a

198
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:38,160
teaching and the buddha says no this is not a good time

199
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:43,839
um i'm going for alms come back later she says well

200
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:51,119
please please second time please please give me a teaching and the buddha says i'm going for alms

201
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,680
and he says the third time and then buddhist stories whenever you ask they put up her third time he will give an

202
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:02,720
answer so please you know life is uncertain who knows what what

203
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:10,160
might happen please please give me a teaching and the buddha knowing the context he's hungry he's going for alms around

204
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:16,880
he gives him the most pith teaching and the most awakening pith teaching way to awaken

205
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:23,920
and it's a beautiful teaching to keep practicing there's so many levels so many depths so many layers of

206
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:30,880
depth and if you feel like oh you understand it trust that there is more to this teaching so i'm going to read the punch

207
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:36,240
line for you and before i read the punch line so when bahia hears this he becomes

208
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:44,240
fully awakened and buddha goes for his alms round and bahia later that afternoon gets gets

209
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:49,520
killed by a cow and and

210
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:55,520
but he's fully awakened so so here we go

211
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,560
bahia in the scene is merely what is seen

212
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:06,319
and the cognized is merely what is cognized

213
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:12,400
etc actually uh it's summarized well here it is

214
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,279
in the scene

215
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:24,400
oh here in the scene will be merely what is seen in the herd will be merely what

216
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,000
is heard in the sense will be merely what is sensed

217
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:35,839
in the cognized will be merely what is cognized in this way you should train

218
00:43:35,839 --> 00:43:42,640
yourself so we were focusing in the sensed merely what is sensed that might be the

219
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:49,359
easiest way to to first way to understand this teaching in the sense to merely the

220
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,400
sensed and then the buddha continues when you practice in this way in the sense to

221
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:58,078
only the sense etc

222
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:07,440
then bahia you will not be with that when bahia you are not with that

223
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:15,680
then bahia you will not be in that when bahia you are not in that

224
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:21,760
then bahia you will be neither here nor there

225
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:28,800
nor in between the two just this is the end of suffering

226
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,160
just this is the end of suffering so this is in the bahiya suta if you want

227
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:40,560
to go and read it later yourself so shift in the perception the mind's

228
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,800
body inviting ourselves for us to see things differently

229
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,800
leading to just this is the end of suffering

230
00:44:53,839 --> 00:45:01,200
in the sense in the sense merely the sense merely the sense so

231
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:08,000
so staying with it and sensed could be the sensation is in the knowing itself it's not

232
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,040
separate and it will the perception will shift in amazing

233
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:19,200
ways we're all capable of it give it time give it time

234
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:24,400
so speaking of time we are out of time so

235
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:29,440
thank you all for your practice for joining

236
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:35,599
