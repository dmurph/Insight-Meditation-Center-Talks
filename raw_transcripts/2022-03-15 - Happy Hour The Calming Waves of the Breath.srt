7
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,120

8
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,719
practice um i want to continue

9
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,320
what we've been paying attention to last week in different ways addressing

10
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,360
addressing sent the need for stability the need for

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:12,479
peace the need for groundedness so that there is stability

12
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,240
internally to hold to meet the challenges of the world we did

13
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,960
equanimity practice last week we also did calming the energy body

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,439
with the breath many of you seem to like that it's a sense of bringing home we did joy

15
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:37,439
practice on friday again as a way to support us in challenging times

16
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,479
um all of these practices and compassion and practice of course um

17
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,320
both equanimity and joy practice can be support can be support for a compassion practice

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,680
so what i'd like to invite us to engage in tonight is

19
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:59,520
is more of a slightly differently this attending to

20
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:04,880
the energy body in terms of establishing calm

21
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:11,360
establishing centeredness establishing [Music]

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,000
groundedness which can both hold joy

23
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,840
and sorrow it can hold both but it there needs to be a stability

24
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,040
there needs to be a sense of equipoise equanimity uh

25
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,319
to hold whatever there is instead of toppling over especially when the news in the world is so challenging

26
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:44,000
and difficult and heartbreaking so that is all the framing that i think

27
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,000
is necessary for tonight and let's just settle in and practice

28
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:55,360
together so

29
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,480
so let us arrive let us arrive

30
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:07,760
together as a sangha as a community

31
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:14,159
and individually in this body

32
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,160
in this moment in time [Music]

33
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:31,040
turning the gaze inward attending to whatever is arising in this moment here

34
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:38,080
in this body as if you are taking stock greeting

35
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:46,040
yourself sensing sensing internally

36
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:57,200
what's happening in different parts of the

37
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,599
body can check in popcorn style

38
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,239
just no getting to know oh yeah maybe the head is a little tight

39
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,639
shoulders hands might be cool or warm

40
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,600
maybe the feet are tense maybe the sit bones are relaxed or whatever

41
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,600
whatever is happening in your body take time

42
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,919
take time

43
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,080
and knowing what's happening in the body doesn't mean that we judge or

44
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,840
we push away we just know oh this is what's happening

45
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,520

46
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:38,120

47
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,840

kathryn i see your hand [Music] yeah just

183
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,720
today is a very difficult day for me to settle or find

184
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,640
ease but i've been doing this practice now long enough to

185
00:41:54,640 --> 00:42:02,240
to take refuge in the knowledge that that changes and to just keep practicing and and have

186
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:07,760
much less reactivity to the difficulty of settling in this

187
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:13,040
particular session and so i i feel really grateful for that

188
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:18,640
that i can come as i am and accept myself as i am

189
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:25,599
thank you for that gift that gift of reflection catherine indeed

190
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:34,319
indeed knowing that it's impermanent it comes and goes causes and conditions arise and

191
00:42:34,319 --> 00:42:41,359
sometimes it's easier to settle quote-unquote sometimes it isn't and yet to hold all of that

192
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,119
with kindness and acceptance just as you said and beautiful to have that to have

193
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:54,079
cultivated that acceptance and care no matter what that is meta yeah it's

194
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,000
not reward oriented only if you settle then i will love you no i love you either way

195
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:07,040
sweetheart it's okay yeah thanks for bringing that into the space catherine

196
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:16,800
okay couple more reflections wonderful way to go off into the evening

197
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:23,680
calm and centered very grateful nikki you're welcome megan says the wave imagery made me

198
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:29,119
think of the disney movie moana she is called to enter the ocean and

199
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:35,040
embarks on a hero's journey it's not easy there are waves and storms

200
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:42,720
but she follows the call oh i love that reflection yes heroes journey through our breath

201
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,640
yeah i love that thanks for that reflection megan love the imagery

202
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:54,000
jerry says you mentioned that we need to reach out to all in war zones but we are

203
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,839
not in this world with the potential wars of

204
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:06,960
i'm not quite understanding the question jerry i think what i meant to say is this

205
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,000
radiating out uh the radiating out of care

206
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,319
to everyone and offering the calm so i'm not quite sure where the question is i didn't quite get it

207
00:44:18,319 --> 00:44:25,119
may the lapping waves shore up our body and one last reflection thank you nikki

208
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:31,119
i feel strong enough to hold both joy and sorrow yet light

209
00:44:31,119 --> 00:44:38,079
like a snowflake yet light like snowflake almost free

210
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:43,680
from gravity yeah yeah

211
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:52,000
jerry is clarifying are we all not in a potential war zone oh of course we are everything can oh yeah of course

212
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,440
everything can change in any minute not to make us anxious but life is just what

213
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:04,800
it is it's life is anything can happen at any moment you can be hit by a truck it could be war

214
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,480
could be anything so and yet and yet can we stay calm can we

215
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:17,280
stay centered in the middle of the the waves the waves of the ocean

216
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:23,040
support is supported by the internal waves of calm

217
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:29,520
so i'd like to invite us to turn into sitting together maybe just in silence

218
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:35,839
maybe we just hold space silent space for one another or

219
00:45:35,839 --> 00:45:42,640
maybe share um [Music] and one last reflection this is from julie

220
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:49,680
on youtube thank you for a beautiful soothing meditation a great reminder to come back to the heart space at all

221
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:55,599
times yes yeah yeah

222
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:00,880
so thank you all danke

223
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:12,240
so i'll create the breakout rooms and again take care of yourselves take care of each other just maybe

224
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:17,440
there's just need to hold space for one another um

225
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:23,119
maybe not much needs to be said or maybe something needs to be said it's all

226
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:29,200
it's all good so i'm going to open the rooms

227
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:35,680
in a moment and uh yeah take care here we go

228
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:42,800
okay welcome back everyone the rooms are closed everybody's back and we just have

229
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:48,640
a couple minutes if any last minute reflections especially from being

230
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:53,920
together in the groups if you like to share

231
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,720
the floor is yours

232
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:11,800
going once going twice

233
00:47:13,680 --> 00:47:20,319
okay seems like there is a feeling of closure hope you enjoyed um

234
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:25,839
yeah yeah sounds good i i see a um

235
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:32,720
request to have some guidance about how to behave in the group i think that is important

236
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:40,800
they often do say to please take care of yourself and take care of others and speak from your own experience not

237
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:46,720
speak about other people's experience please please do not do that

238
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:53,119
and the person who privately messaged me i would appreciate if you stay later and tell me if their issues are rising

239
00:47:53,119 --> 00:48:00,559
because i really would like to make sure this is a safe place for everyone and that people don't drop out

240
00:48:00,559 --> 00:48:08,000
because they don't feel safe with someone you know talking about their experience etc or anything else that's happening so

241
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:14,240
please do stay and help me help support the community

242
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:23,599
and deborah says i told my group that during the meditation i found myself stay stay staying instead of go go going

243
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:30,480
ah yeah it's is it a question or is it a a

244
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:38,480
statement i wasn't quite sure deborah i think it's a statement

245
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:46,960
but maybe i will just leave it leave it as that and i don't see your hand either or

246
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,400
so maybe oh statement yes okay sounds good debra we'll let that sit we'll let

247
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:57,599
that stand as it is so let's um bring our evening to a close

248
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:02,750
thank you so much everyone thank you for your practice for your dedication

249
00:49:02,750 --> 00:49:08,559
[Music] cultivation both for your own sake and the sake of all beings everywhere may

250
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:13,720
all beings be free including ourselves

251
