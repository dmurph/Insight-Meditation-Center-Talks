1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:11,040
so warm greetings

2
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:18,640
and the theme for this week is the sense

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,320
stores the sense direct immediate simple sense experience

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,359
yesterday i talked about seeing today a hearing

5
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,559
and and

6
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,600
if we use the word listen listening that tends to be more of an

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,320
active idea something we intentionally do hearing it doesn't have to be that way

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,760
just now i heard the train whistle but i wasn't listening for it i wasn't

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,000
thinking about it until it whistled and uh

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,840
so it's possible for um some people find it

11
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:14,560
very nice to do mindfulness of hearing because um he uh of a lot of this

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,799
not controlling not adjusting not fixing anything sometimes with a focus on the

13
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:27,040
breathing there can be a lot of ideas about i'm the agent i have to breathe just the right way and how am i supposed to

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:33,280
breathe and what am i supposed to pay attention to whereas when mindfulness is of less of

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,799
hearing then it's there's a kind of letting go of trying to

16
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,119
control it trying to fix the sounds trying to have the right sounds

17
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:51,439
there's a receptivity an idea just to receive the sounds

18
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:58,719
and and then some people learn a kind of a non-uh

19
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:05,840
manipulative non-entangled knowing non-entangled mindfulness

20
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,920
by learning to listen well to hear well not listen here

21
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:20,000
so i'll suggest today that we start with hearing meditation hearing mindfulness

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,360
becoming sensitive to that door and as we become more sensitive to it

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:31,360
it's possible to notice how we get entangled in it how we get reactive to it or

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:36,400
involved in it or we grab onto the branches of sound so

25
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,360
i don't know if you hear the who is whistle now but one way of getting involved would be

26
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:49,760
starting to not wander off in thought and thinking about but we should really move imc to a quieter place so that when

27
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:55,040
we broadcast in the morning it can be quiet or it could be i could think wow that's

28
00:02:55,040 --> 00:03:02,560
fantastic here i was going to do hearing meditation and and we already have wonderful

29
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,680
train whistles going and let's move imc closer to the train station to drink

30
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,280
wrecks so that i'm entangled with it i'm caught in it

31
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:20,800
and just allow the sounds to come and go and come and go as they wish

32
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,560
so we'll do it for a little while and then we'll i'll direct the same kind of attention to breathing if you'd like or

33
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:32,799
you can continue with sounds if that's nice for you and um

34
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:39,920
so so

35
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,120
making yourself comfortable nice

36
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:53,439
easy posture so you don't have to put a lot of

37
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,680
attention into your posture maintaining it so this is a little different than how

38
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:08,080
we usually are doing this meditation maybe sit in the easy relaxed posture

39
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,000
and gently closing your eyes

40
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:25,120
it will do the usual kind of relaxing to begin in a way that will support hearing

41
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:33,360
so gently taking a few deeper breaths comfortably deeper

42
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:44,639
fuller breaths and then as you exhale a comfortable fuller exhale

43
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:57,400
and exhale that you begin to relax the whole body

44
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,080
and then to let your breathing return to normal

45
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:19,520
and on the inhale feel these different parts of the body that i'll direct you to

46
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:28,638
and then as you exhale relax that part of the body

47
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,600
so begin by relaxing the belly

48
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,159
feeling the belly and relaxing it

49
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:52,320
maybe as you relax the belly there's a settling of the weight of your lower torso

50
00:05:52,320 --> 00:06:00,240
into your [Music] into what supports your body

51
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,759
chair cushion bed

52
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:18,120
and feel the chest exhaling relaxing the chest

53
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:36,840
and relaxing the shoulders softening in the shoulders

54
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,198
and feeling the muscles of your face and relaxing them as you exhale

55
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:22,080
softening around the eyes

56
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,800
and then relaxing the thinking muscle

57
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,039
the energy the tension might might be associated with thinking

58
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:46,960
let that soften and relax

59
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:04,240
if there is any sense of pressure contraction tightness associated with thinking

60
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:09,919
or associated with the brain area feel it

61
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,520
on the inhale and soften it on the exhale

62
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:36,000
and then open your awareness to sounds

63
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:41,000
sound of my voice

64
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:58,160
where you are is very silent maybe this the sound of silence

65
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:13,600
if there's a ringing in your ears just to relax and

66
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:20,839
on the exhale soften on the inhale

67
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,240
allow hearing open and spaciously

68
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:48,160
if you find yourself trying to listen

69
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,480
relax the trying

70
00:09:54,080 --> 00:10:03,320
instead of trying allow your ears to hear and if nothing comes no worry

71
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:21,160
sooner or later there'll be a sound and some of the sounds will be unexpected

72
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,399
and when they're unexpected

73
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:47,680
they come without any effort on our part

74
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:53,640
in the way unexpected sounds appear effortlessly

75
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,640
so

76
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:12,320
maybe each time you exhale letting go of your thoughts

77
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:18,120
letting go of efforting to hear

78
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,320
allowing hearing

79
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:38,320
perhaps hearing can arise in that place in the mind

80
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:43,639
where there is some silence some stillness

81
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:16,199
and then either continuing with hearing

82
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:22,720
letting that be your anchor to the present moment

83
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,199
content that each sound you hear

84
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:35,839
is an experience here and now or if you prefer

85
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:43,440
gently allow the experience of breathing to come into awareness

86
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,839
much like hearing sounds feel

87
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:56,800
the body breathing maybe relaxing

88
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:04,720
trying to do so or the effort to do so in favor of allowing yourself to feel

89
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:08,439
the experience of breathing

90
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:24,880
relaxing whatever effort you're making to think

91
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,200
relaxing the thinking energy

92
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:36,840
relaxing the trying in favor of being open and

93
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:43,280
receptive allowing hearing allowing breathing

94
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:48,679
to appear in awareness

95
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,120
so

96
00:27:00,799 --> 00:27:10,480
and as we come to the end of the sitting bring to mind or imagine intuit

97
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:16,400
what it's like to most fully hear

98
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,120
without entanglement here without reactivity

99
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:30,880
most fully just allows the sound to come and go to be present

100
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:36,720
forever along its presence and to go when it goes

101
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,679
what would it be like for the mind to be so spacious relaxed

102
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,179
there'd be no searching [Music]

103
00:27:52,880 --> 00:28:00,399
no analyzing no reacting no fixing

104
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:04,799
the sound would allow to just be there

105
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:14,960
and perhaps when there's no entanglement with what we hear

106
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,000
it allowed to sign for it to be registered

107
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:27,278
deep within a place within where there is

108
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:36,399
greater understanding greater love or kindness

109
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:42,840
care a greater peace with how things

110
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,080
are peace that is more enduring than the vagaries and

111
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,440
changes of the world

112
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:06,399
there is a buddhist bodhisattva kind of a

113
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:13,320
sacred being called kuan yin kannon

114
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:24,840
and it said that the name can mean the one who

115
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:31,360
hears the sounds of the world and now look at

116
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:38,679
is the embodiment of compassion

117
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,880
hearing the suffering of the world

118
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,720
to learn to hear well

119
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:57,039
allows us to be custodians and caretakers of the

120
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:04,360
suffering of the world without being entangled

121
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:18,240
to be entangled is just to add to more suffering in the world

122
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,080
to be unentangled

123
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:31,919
places places us in a better position to alleviate suffering in this suffering

124
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,919
world

125
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,278
may this practice that we do

126
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,440
be for the welfare and happiness of this world

127
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,240
may we living in the way that we're meant to live live

128
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:01,039
in a way that supports the welfare and happiness of others

129
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:06,399
may all beings be happy

130
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,760
may all beings be safe

131
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:16,880
may all beings be peaceful

132
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,200
may all beings be free

133
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:27,710
[Music]

134
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,839
[Music]

135
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,080
so the teachings of the discourse on the

136
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,640
establishing of awareness

137
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,679
is uh has come now to the exercise on mindfulness of the sense

138
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,240
senses and sense doors and sense experience

139
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:27,039
and in the explicit teachings that i've heard over the these years on this particular

140
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:35,039
satibatana discourse my sense is the particular exercise that

141
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:42,320
maybe the two exercises maybe that are least emphasized is the last one of the first of the mindfulness

142
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:49,919
of the body which is the corpse meditations and this one the six senses

143
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,960
and it's a little bit of a pity that it's not emphasized more because um the sense experience

144
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:02,080
being really grounded in our sense experience of hearing seeing

145
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:08,800
touching smelling tasting and the clear clear seeing or knowing of what

146
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,878
happens in the mind is um really at the heart of

147
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:21,760
classic bipasuna practice and we're learning to stay present

148
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:29,520
in the simplicity of our sense experience because that's always in the present moment

149
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:35,040
and as we do so as we come closer and closer to be able to do that it's a process

150
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,839
we do you know progressively um closer and closer to just the simplicity of sense experience

151
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:48,158
at the same time it is more and more letting go of our entanglement the way we're caught and reactive and spending

152
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:54,720
our time thinking there's less and less attachment as we're able to stay more and more just to

153
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:00,960
the with the ongoing flow of the current of um the river of sense experience as

154
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,640
it occurs and

155
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:12,960
the little teaching from the buddha that's repeated a lot in

156
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:18,320
in this insight world teachers is the instructions

157
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:23,599
in the scene just the scene see the scene what's seen

158
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:30,400
just a scene in the herd just a herd and they cognize just the cognized

159
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:37,599
in the sense in the sense experience just a sense experience this is just just the scene just to hear heard that

160
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:44,800
simplicity it can be quite liberating quite delightful to have put down our preoccupations and

161
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,280
reactivity so today the topic is um

162
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,599
hearing and uh this is a maybe because much of these teachings

163
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:04,000
were done were composed before the the written word became popular

164
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,839
the the name of direct disciples of the buddha

165
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:16,720
is sabaka and savaka can be translated as the ones who hear the ones who heard the

166
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,800
teachings of the buddha directly but i like to think it as a deeper meaning the ones who hear deeply that

167
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:28,319
are attentive as if they're hearing to everything

168
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:34,640
the the christian order of monks called the benedictines apparently

169
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:39,760
their kind of code of conduct their rule book discipline

170
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:47,040
begins with the word ascolta in latin meaning hear listen here

171
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,440
listen so to listen there's a lot to be learned from

172
00:36:53,440 --> 00:37:00,320
listening and hearing hearing in particular if we can hear

173
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:06,839
receptively openly and i like this idea of the 360 degree

174
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:14,000
panorama of sounds and to settle back and and allow the sounds to appear from

175
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:20,800
whatever in that prem that big circle that they occur and sometimes i have the sense that my

176
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,320
awareness is sometimes as big and as expensive as

177
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:32,320
the distance this from where the sound originates and that's happens when my mind gets

178
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:37,599
very relaxed and open and there's very little sense of boundaries to the mind or

179
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:43,520
or location for things in the mind and so the sense of location

180
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:50,000
uh it's just since it tends to become expansive and open and and it's a delightful feeling to feel

181
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,280
the mind so receptive and relaxed and open that it just takes in sounds in a very

182
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,400
spacious way um

183
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:07,680
well short of that um as we become aware of hearing

184
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:14,079
we can become aware of how we get entangled in what we hear the knots that could be gets formed

185
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:19,520
there's a sound there's the ear that hears the eardrums maybe

186
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,800
and then there's the knot the in that the fetter that gets formed

187
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:29,920
between those two and this can happen when someone's speaking to us

188
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:38,400
someone's saying something and we stop listening because we're we grabbed onto a branch of what uh

189
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,560
you know what how we feel hurt or how we have some new fantasy a new idea and we

190
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:50,800
go off thinking about something that's triggered by them but we're no longer really listening

191
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,839
and so so we've formed a knot around our thoughts

192
00:38:55,839 --> 00:39:01,760
or maybe we don't like what we hear and so there's uh tension somewhere in the body

193
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:08,320
maybe we we like what we hear and we want more of it and so there's a kind of starts plotting

194
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:13,440
planning how to get more and let it continue

195
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:19,119
there's um all kinds of judgments that can arise there's all kinds of preferences there

196
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,240
are bias there can be ideas of self

197
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:30,320
that this sounds is impinging on me i'm a victim of all these sounds

198
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,599
i'm the one who hears it there's an uh kind of a

199
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,960
analogy that's used that if you hold your hand flat

200
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:48,720
and um and then you something comes and strikes it then you know if it's no the stronger

201
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,359
the strike the more it's going to hurt your hand but if you keep your hand open and relaxed so that

202
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:00,640
things can just go right through then you're less likely to be hurt

203
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,560
just let it go through or even better is you lower the hand and then the

204
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,280
sounds just go right through and they don't touch they don't hit anything and the equivalent of the hand in the

205
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:20,720
mind is sometimes is a very strong sense of self strong sense of me my experience i'm the

206
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,400
victim of it it's happening to me why are they doing it to me and

207
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:32,319
and and to be able to lower that that concern that

208
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:38,079
tension that preoccupation of myself me myself and mine is one of the great fruits of this

209
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,560
mindfulness practice and then as this selfing self relaxes then the sounds go

210
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,240
right through or we start seeing where where the sound what the

211
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:56,079
sounds strike where the knot exists and we can it becomes a

212
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:01,599
a mindfulness spell for us to notice that not to notice our reactivity our

213
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:06,760
reaction our entanglement with it

214
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,440
so um if you hear anything your ears are hearing

215
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:19,040
you are in the present moment sounds are one of those phenomena

216
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:25,520
that only exists in the current the flow of the present moment

217
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:32,400
and and so to be aware of sounds and listening

218
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:39,440
and you know to be open to it and receive it is to stay present here and now

219
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:44,960
and it can be a way that we begin to recognize

220
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:50,960
the the forces of the mind that take us out of the present moment the branches we

221
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,640
hold on to and it's not so much that we have to then analyze what we're holding on to

222
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:04,079
as it is to let go to come back to this receptive awareness of listening

223
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:09,920
and to learn to do this around sounds some people find this is

224
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:18,240
the the laboratory in which it's easiest to learn relaxed receptive unentangled awareness

225
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:26,000
mindfulness and then learning it in hearing and then to apply it to um other things as well

226
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:32,640
so for this next 24 hours i'd encourage you to give a particular attention to

227
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:40,400
hearing and maybe find sometimes through the day that you can sit someplace in a park or

228
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:45,839
an open window or someplace um in a very just kind of

229
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:53,920
allow yourself to hear sounds um kind of like you may be laying your back on the grass and look at the clouds

230
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:59,760
you know float by above and it's very relaxed just way

231
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:05,440
so kind of settle back and just take some time just hear sounds

232
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:12,960
if you like listening to music you could try to choose some music that is uh pleasant relaxing to listen to that may

233
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,720
be just a delight to listen to if um

234
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,800
in this way maybe even just listening with your eyes closed sometimes with the eyes closed

235
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:30,319
there's less entanglement and more ability to just receive what's happening

236
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:37,838
and um and in the course of the day you might also practice

237
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:45,200
this listening someone speak how simple can you hear how how fully

238
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:51,119
can you be present in a hearing way so you can hear and listen to what they say

239
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:56,960
without the entanglement so that as you listen to them you hear something you hear from a

240
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:03,760
deeper place in your heart in your in your body and your mind that you hear the other person you allow

241
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:09,440
those words to come and because there's no entanglement it doesn't hit anything

242
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:16,480
on the way in maybe it can resonate some deeper connectivity some deeper place that

243
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,599
may be a place of love and compassion care

244
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:27,440
peace may hearing

245
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:35,000
be a doorway for freedom thank you
