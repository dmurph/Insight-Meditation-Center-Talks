1
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:10,980
good evening seems to me that the volume can be just

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:18,680
a tiny bit higher I'm like having to strain my voice just a little bit there we go thank you

3
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,420
nice to be here with you all to practice together

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:35,219
so I feel like I just want to keep on

5
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:43,020
sitting so some of you know that um when you go

6
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:49,020
on Retreat especially on the long Retreats Retreats that are like a month or longer

7
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:55,680
but also in the shorter retreats that it's not uncommon for there to be

8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,920
like a bowl or something that uh participants can write down a question

9
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,020
and put in the bowl and then the teachers kind of go through and

10
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,500
you know organize the questions and we'll answer some of them some of them they don't answer because they feel like

11
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,939
oh that's not quite related to what we're talking about here but they'll answer them just in the hole in general

12
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,780
so everybody can hear the question hear the answer

13
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:34,619
it was kind of interesting is that sometimes people participants are writing questions these really you know

14
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,560
complicated philosophical questions

15
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:46,820
okay maybe this is what they're thinking about maybe this is what their Retreat is about

16
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:53,820
but as teachers we tend to not want to answer them well some teachers do they want to

17
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:01,200
because the point is to practice not to think our way to

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:07,920
some greater unders greater I don't I wanted to say greater understanding but

19
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,260
it's not that when we're on Retreat the emphasis is not on

20
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:20,340
education smart on just being with our direct experience

21
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:26,459
with what's actually happening whether our mind is like all over the

22
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:32,700
place or whether we're starting to feel settled or whether we're just going to really dislike that person that sits

23
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:38,580
next to us because they're doing whatever it is that they're doing you know whatever our experience is the

24
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:47,220
practice is to be with it and in the sum in the same way sometimes

25
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:55,680
uh many of you know that uh Gill and I we teach us who to study class and sometimes uh people are saying oh wait

26
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,660
so if this is true then wouldn't it feel like that and I I don't want it to feel

27
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,000
like that for example some of these insights like

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:17,400
to impermanence the sutas are filled with this and then like a really deep Insight not

29
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:24,659
just a thought but like a experiential knowing that things change

30
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:31,019
I mean we all know this on an intellectual level but there's a way in which we can know it in a deeper

31
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:37,800
experiential way and then some people might say well if this is true that everything is

32
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:42,900
inconstant in permanence then impermanent then wouldn't it seem like

33
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:49,379
things are chaotic or uncomfortable or something

34
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:55,980
like this or same with the if there's no self then how does that work wouldn't

35
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:02,299
that that seems scary and I don't want to have a not have itself

36
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,799
so there's two different ideas are that one of these two examples that I'm

37
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,980
giving are pointing to how sometimes we might think that practice is just about

38
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:21,600
gaining the right knowledge understanding things correctly where in fact really it's being pointed

39
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,979
to our experience what's actually happening but sometimes it's not so clear the

40
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:35,820
difference certainly before when I before I started meditation practice if you had said to

41
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,520
me well it's not what you're thinking about but it's what you're experiencing that would have thought yeah okay

42
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:48,120
whatever but it's not until you have a meditation practice I think that you start to

43
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:55,919
really understand the difference between direct experience

44
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:03,479
and thinking about something in fact I would say such a big part of

45
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,780
practice is making this distinction even though it may not be apparent or obvious

46
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:17,040
I would say this can be transformative if we can consistently reliably make this

47
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:24,240
difference is what are my ideas about something versus what is

48
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,340
it feel like is it a pressure is it a stubbing is it a tightness is an

49
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,460
openness is it uh tingly is it

50
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:40,380
seems like it's flowing or does it feel like it's stuck that's like I'm using really different

51
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:47,120
language to describe kind of experience right than some intellectual understanding

52
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:53,400
and so maybe I'll also add here that often when

53
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:01,440
we are upset or troubled it's we're not necessarily upset or

54
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,759
troubled about the experience about it being tingly and spacious or constricted and maybe there's a stabbing Sensation

55
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:15,840
that taller but uncomfortable but tolerable really when we're uncomfortable it's our

56
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,380
thoughts that are about the experience oh because I'm having that stabbing

57
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:28,800
experience in my knee it means that I won't be able to sit in

58
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:36,120
a on the floor anymore in a cross-legged position I'll just sit in the chair and that's kind of a bummer people

59
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:41,819
will wonder what happened to me I used to sit on the floor and I have to sit in the chair and I'll have to explain and I

60
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,380
don't know why we make all these stories

61
00:06:47,819 --> 00:06:53,759
so often the the um the idea about something kind of like

62
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,280
it's like a label that we can like slap onto our experience and then the label

63
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:05,819
doesn't change it's just a label it's a word pain our experience might be all over the

64
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:11,759
place changing and being moving and morphing and going away and coming back

65
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:18,840
but we're having a relationship with the label not with what's actually happening

66
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:25,099
this is where a lot of our difficulties and our life stem from

67
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:33,840
of course we do this I want to say we are socialized educated to think

68
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:40,919
about you know when to Value ever thoughts and we have plenty of experience of the

69
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:46,680
way that we think about things helps us to solve problems helps us to plan helps

70
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,819
us to communicate so that we can put the plans into place so we can see where there's this real

71
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:59,340
value in thinking it's a radical shift to come to this

72
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:07,759
practice and to say even though I've been rewarded you know either when my uh

73
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,039
career or my education for what I'm thinking to say well actually it's a little bit

74
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:19,440
different here and I'd like to point out a little bit

75
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:25,860
how that Buddha points to this to this importance of actually just tuning into the experience

76
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,560
as best you can right as best you can I am not saying that thoughts are not

77
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:37,620
important I'm not saying that thoughts don't have a value and I'm not saying that you should never have thoughts when

78
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,800
you're meditating I'll get to kind of like the real thoughts have but before I get there I

79
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,279
want to talk about the value of just the direct experience so in one of these suit does the Buddha

80
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,680
he categorized some of the others not he categorized all spiritual leaders in his

81
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,080
time somebody had a question about spiritual leaders and he said well

82
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:06,120
there's different types and he said well there are some that are

83
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,839
relying on their sacred texts the oral transmitters at that time right so that were

84
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:19,440
um that brahmins who had the dominant religion at the time of the Buddha they

85
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:26,640
memorized all those texts and there was that was the role of the priest to do a lot of this memorization

86
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:32,940
so there were those who had just memorized who knew the text then there were those that had just a

87
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:40,380
lot of faith that they believed in maybe they don't know the text but they have this feeling of just faith maybe a

88
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:49,320
little bit of devotion it might be the words of a particular teacher it might be a God but there was a just a belief a

89
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:57,180
faith there was a third type that we're using reasoning and logic and maybe would be

90
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,519
more like a philosophy or maybe even a lot of us certainly me too I do a lot of

91
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:10,380
you know well wait if this means that and that should mean that and so let's uh one so one two that's a

92
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:17,339
third and then the fourth are those who rely on their experience

93
00:10:17,339 --> 00:10:24,420
so teachers that are relying on these four different ways that the Buddha talked about less than and then he put

94
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:30,360
himself in one of these categories and he says

95
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:36,240
there are some mendicants you know some men against practitioners

96
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,279
or teachers I would say there are some mendicants who having directly known the

97
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,440
Dharma for themselves having reached Perfection and

98
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:53,399
consummation of direct knowledge Here and Now teach the fundamentals of this spiritual

99
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:58,440
life I am one of those mendicants

100
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:03,980
so he's highlighting that his teachings come from his experience

101
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,079
and not only does he highlight like the importance maybe of having direct

102
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:16,079
experience because that's how he had it but he goes on others to criticize other

103
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:23,339
people who seem to have like this Blind Faith and another suta there's a a group of a

104
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:30,060
whole bunch of brahman's come to meet the Buddha it says long

105
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:36,959
suit that kind of like sits well why they even came to meet him but they come to meet him in their evident discussion

106
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,839
and there's this young Brahman uh who keeps on interrupting interrupting the

107
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:48,500
conversation and the Buddha says you know these are

108
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:56,220
you're interesting me but you're also interrupting your senior Elders in your community so you're being rude

109
00:11:56,220 --> 00:12:03,779
and the senior Elder say don't say that to him he's actually quite smart and competent even though he's very young

110
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:08,880
so then the Buddha turns to him and says something along the lines well do you

111
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,540
have a question and this young Robin says well we know

112
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:21,120
the truth because we believe in our scriptures

113
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:29,120
and that have been passed down for generations and they are true and everything else is not true

114
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:36,360
well has anybody actually seen what these are in these scriptures does anybody

115
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:43,800
actually directly know what are in these scriptures on this from this young Brahman says no

116
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:49,620
and the Buddha says okay that's fine well do you know anybody that knows

117
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:55,500
somebody that knows these teachings have this direct experience

118
00:12:55,500 --> 00:13:01,079
no the Brahman replies and then the Buddha said well isn't this

119
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:08,579
kind of like blind people leading other blind people who haven't seen for themselves telling

120
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:14,240
other people what its practice is about what the spiritual life is about

121
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:19,920
some harsh words but again the Buddha is pointing to that

122
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:27,260
the are the importance of seeing and knowing for ourselves

123
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:37,040
and he doesn't put forth some physical metaphysical views right he's not saying that um

124
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:43,920
let me back up and I'll say that he's not uh he has this idea that people who have

125
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:50,120
views and are just putting it forth as okay this is the truth

126
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:57,139
he says well there's a different ways in which people do this

127
00:13:57,139 --> 00:14:04,500
they have the these ideas about what happens after death

128
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:09,720
what is the nature of the universe is it infinite

129
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:17,279
or not and says it's impossible to know these answers so these are can just be views

130
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:22,560
and then I'd like this expression he says that um these views are for those

131
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,860
who do not know and see so if you don't have direct experience in other things then you tend to be more in your head

132
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:34,260
and be thinking about these things that really don't have answers

133
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:40,079
and he's highlighting that this does not bring you to Greater Freedom this doesn't bring you to Greater ease trying

134
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:47,699
to figure out the answer to some of these things so he says these speculative views are a

135
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:55,079
Thicket of use a Wilderness of views a contortion of use a vesselation of use a

136
00:14:55,079 --> 00:15:01,380
Fetter of views I don't know exactly what all these words mean like a contortion of views

137
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:06,720
but it sounds like wow this is complicated right and it's not that some

138
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,940
has spacious and easeful and he continues by saying well these

139
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,339
views are beset by suffering vexation Despair and by fever

140
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:23,240
if you're trying to find the answers for some of these things that don't have answers

141
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:29,579
it's troubling to want something that can't have but

142
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:35,100
also to feel like your happiness depends on this or your future happiness depends

143
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:42,320
on this and the Buddha goes on and he said so having these views does not lead to disenchantment

144
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:50,279
dispassion cessation peace direct knowledge and Awakening

145
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:55,339
so it's not the way towards Awakening

146
00:15:56,339 --> 00:16:02,540
so what is what is part of the way

147
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:09,180
I appreciate very much that the it occurs to me as I'm talking here I'm

148
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:15,060
giving like all these ideas and I'm talking and I'm saying well don't be concerned about ideas but here's a lot

149
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:21,899
of them so there's a little irony here and kind of what I'm saying here

150
00:16:21,899 --> 00:16:30,060
but I'm trying to like pull from the suit does some like quotes or what the Buddha is saying to support this idea

151
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:35,639
of it's really about our direct experience as opposed to our thoughts

152
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:40,860
our views our beliefs and making that distinction such an integral part of

153
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:46,079
practice so here's something else that the Buddha

154
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:51,660
says he describes the Dharma that is the teachings or we might even understand

155
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:56,180
the dharmas the way things are

156
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:03,180
saying that the drama is directly visible immediate

157
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:10,980
inviting one to come and see applicable and to be personally experienced

158
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:17,339
the Dharma is directly visible so something that

159
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:22,400
you can come in contact with you can see

160
00:17:22,620 --> 00:17:27,620
it's not some complicated philosophical idea

161
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:34,760
and I would even say you don't have to go on super long Retreats and meditate forever

162
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:46,399
it's directly visible and immediate not something that you have to like figure out later

163
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,559
and the Dharma can just be knowing what the experience is right now

164
00:17:52,559 --> 00:18:01,399
as opposed to our ideas about it so being able to like tease apart their experience from our reaction to it

165
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:08,660
it's also saying that the Dharma is inviting one to come and see

166
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:18,059
he's not inviting one to go and see go you know another time another place

167
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:25,260
you'll figure it out it's actually pointing to no no no whatever the experience is right now

168
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:31,559
whatever it is Pleasant unpleasant neutral

169
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:38,960
we can get in contact with it and see the Dharma the way things are

170
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:45,120
and we can start to see like oh these things are changing

171
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:53,720
of course they are our experiences are really changing and the quieter the mind gets the more that we can see the change

172
00:18:54,059 --> 00:19:00,720
or we can see oh yeah actually this experience is not a source of lasting happiness

173
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:07,380
might be a little bit of pleasurable but not a source of lasting happiness so seeing the Dharma just in our

174
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:12,900
experience whatever the experience is and then the last thing here is saying

175
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:20,039
it's to be personally experienced by the wise so not to philosophize about

176
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:25,160
but to experience and I appreciate that he's saying by the wise so here wisdom

177
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:30,780
is getting defined by somebody who's having direct experience who's tuning

178
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,600
into what's ever happening right now

179
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:48,240
so I just said that you don't have to sit long Retreats necessarily sitting

180
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:53,820
meditating regularly certainly helpful sometimes I talk about long Retreats I

181
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:59,880
like to do long retreat practice but I don't want to give the impression that that's the only way to go forward or

182
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:06,960
something like that because that's a trap to think like well okay as soon as I go on a long retreat

183
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:14,220
which we'll have to wait until my life situation changes then I'll be able to have some real insights you don't have

184
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:21,120
to wait Buddha he's saying you know he's inviting us to come and see ehipasico

185
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:28,320
come and see but he's also saying well it's not the easiest to see if it were

186
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:35,340
then everybody would see the drama and become enlightened and we'd all live happily ever after something like that

187
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:42,299
he's saying the Dharma is profound hard to see

188
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:48,240
peaceful and Sublime unattainable by mere reasoning

189
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:53,580
subtle and to be experienced by the wise

190
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:59,660
so this is part of why we meditate is because it's subtle

191
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:05,640
hard to see because we're so often thinking that what we

192
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:13,340
want is like out there it's like outside of our experience either with our thinking or just getting

193
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:21,299
focused on the next moment what's going to happen next or lost in fantasy or memory or

194
00:21:21,299 --> 00:21:28,200
something like this but

195
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,620
I like this that he's saying that it's peaceful and Sublime

196
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:42,240
so tuning in and being with what's actually happening without

197
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:49,740
adding these big commentaries on top just allowing whatever the experience is

198
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:56,400
to be there that act of allowing creates some of

199
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:04,279
this peacefulness and the sublime is the the not wanting things to be different

200
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:16,679
so part of the reason why that Buddha is pointing to direct experiences because

201
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,960
Awakening Liberation enlightenment

202
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,679
greater peace greater freedom is associated with direct experience

203
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:34,320
rather than just thoughts or views or beliefs or ideas

204
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:39,620
and one of the ways is having insight

205
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:48,179
I want to make a distinction between insights and thoughts and beliefs and Views so insights might be something

206
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:54,480
that happens with our mental capacity but

207
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:03,120
for me that one way that I understand the insights differently is that we all know that people die we

208
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:09,120
all know that pets die we like you ask anybody they won't know this

209
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,659
it's not until somebody you love dies that you really understand it right

210
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:23,059
there's like a different understanding that comes from the experience

211
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:30,000
that's what's kind of pointing towards Insight Is this different type of knowing

212
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:35,280
that goes beyond just maybe intellectual understanding it's like knowing in your

213
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,880
bones or blood or something like this

214
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:46,980
and then I'll add one other thing about Insight in the context in which we talk about it here

215
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:54,840
and insight is this knowing experiential knowing that also reduces

216
00:23:54,840 --> 00:24:00,179
suffering so there's

217
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:07,080
this recognition of something that with that recognition that really

218
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:12,900
deep knowing there's a letting go of something

219
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:19,799
and there's some greater ease and peace it might not even be immediately clear

220
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:26,059
what is let go of at that time but this is part of what Insight is

221
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:34,020
and the Buddha he described before he was awakened how this had an impact on

222
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:41,400
him uh said that

223
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:49,140
he attained liberation by understanding like having insight

224
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:54,360
into the rising and passing away of experiences seeing how experiences are

225
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,140
going coming and going and rising and passing away

226
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:07,260
but not only that there's this little expression saying their gratification their danger they

227
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:13,559
escape so gratification is sometimes our experiences that our desires are

228
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:19,200
fulfilled and we feel like okay I don't I'm not Desiring anymore I don't have that sense

229
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:25,320
of lack I that's I feel certain ease here it's true we have pleasant

230
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:30,860
experiences and our desires get fulfilled of course they do

231
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:37,500
so to recognize that that's kind of like the gratification to recognize of course they do

232
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:44,900
they create the conditions for pleasure and joy love all kinds of beautiful things

233
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:51,900
and it's a little bit of the dangers that it's sooner or later this

234
00:25:51,900 --> 00:26:00,919
gratification is going to end what is Pleasant may just become neutral

235
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,159
feeling eating your favorite ice cream at the fast at the beginning is great and then

236
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:14,400
it just becomes you know you're a little bit The Habit like okay I better finish what's in the bowl it's not so great

237
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:21,860
anymore and then if you had to eat it even more it starts to become uncomfortable right unpleasant

238
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:29,039
so this dangerous sooner or later this gratification part the pleasure part starts to end

239
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:35,279
and then to the extent that we were attached to that pleasure like oh okay I

240
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:42,360
finally got my desires fulfilled now I can be happy I'll be happy as long as this stays

241
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:47,580
the tighter we're holding on the more difficulties we're going to

242
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:56,820
have when those things change when they go away of course sometimes we hold on and we are our sense of self gets uh

243
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:02,640
involved about it or the I'm the one who has this

244
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:08,658
and nobody else has it and I have this or something like this

245
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:17,179
but things change they rise and they pass away

246
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:23,760
so then the escape from them is to step out of this attachment and

247
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,980
craving to allow the experiences to come and go

248
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:34,620
and not be adding like these thoughts or ideas or views or beliefs that would get

249
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:40,679
put on top of them or labels that we're putting on top and we're no longer with our experience by

250
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:47,880
being with the label can we just step out of this habit of trying to get it touched or holding on

251
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:53,720
in some kind of way sometimes it's subtle really subtle

252
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:01,260
there's two ways we can do this one is with a sometimes with a meditation practice as the mind quiets

253
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:08,100
then some of the letting go just naturally happens to get into some of these absorptive

254
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:15,240
states there's a lot of Letting Go and it's a not a lot of agitation from the

255
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:22,080
experiences the other way is Awakening

256
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:29,899
is the Escape right there's Awakening there isn't craving there isn't agitation

257
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,980
so meditation

258
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:46,320
as has been saying supports this a way to get in touch with our direct experience and to also see how some of

259
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:53,600
the thoughts we might have or the ideas that we have

260
00:28:54,299 --> 00:29:02,039
they aren't the way forward because thoughts beget thoughts which beget thoughts which we get thoughts and we go

261
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:10,980
right into these thought streams we start to get really disconnected from what's actually happening

262
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:18,960
I'm not saying that we don't need to plan I am not saying that we don't need to solve problems

263
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:26,279
I am saying that there's a way in which sometimes we're adding on to our direct experience we're holding on this whole

264
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:31,740
narrative it means this about me or it means this about something else or the

265
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:36,620
universe or something like this that's extra

266
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,840
we don't need it it gets in the way

267
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:51,000
so maybe I've been talking about the upside of you know we're working with direct

268
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,039
experience and I just want to mention a little bit more specifically some of the downside

269
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:01,200
of just relying on thoughts and philosophy and ideas and beliefs and

270
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:07,799
Notions that we have so first of all again I want to kind of

271
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:14,340
acknowledge thoughts are important I'm not saying we shouldn't have thoughts in fact I would say they're very powerful

272
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:20,399
and can be beautiful right humans have written love poems

273
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:27,600
have cured diseases we've eliminated pain in a lot of

274
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:35,220
situations that otherwise would have been pain my Tylenol exists now right that is the work of somebody's thoughts

275
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:41,520
and planning let me fix explored outer space ocean depth I mean all kinds of great stuff

276
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:50,039
that has come from thoughts and planning but many of the views opinions beliefs

277
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:57,919
stories thoughts that we have are the basis of our suffering

278
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:06,600
I should be mindful all the time having a thought like that is can be a

279
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:13,320
basis of suffering because chances are you're not mindful 100 of the time

280
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:21,360
or yeah my practice won't really take off and until I'm able to sit still for

281
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:28,200
an hour and I can't sit still for an hour so I don't know maybe there's no hope for me or something like this oh

282
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,799
so many thoughts that we have they're just aren't helpful in fact I would say that they're part of

283
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:40,200
our suffering but I would also say

284
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:47,220
that holding views having these ideas about what practice is or about this

285
00:31:47,220 --> 00:31:54,299
idea that we have to figure things out part of the downside of them is that it

286
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:59,299
can lead to some complacency in our meditation practice

287
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:06,080
if we're thinking that it's just about solving problems or ruminating

288
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:12,360
or figuring things out then we will spend our time on the cushion

289
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,700
figuring things out but if we have this idea no actually

290
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:22,919
direct experience is important then we'll tune into what is the experience

291
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:29,640
of breathing what is the experience of sitting in this posture what is the

292
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:33,200
experience of hearing those sounds

293
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:41,520
and maybe I'll just say this one last thing too also this um if we have this idea that

294
00:32:41,520 --> 00:32:48,360
we just only want to have views we're like really holding on to some of our ideas

295
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:55,440
this might be an indicator of something bigger that's happening in our life that is a certain amount of

296
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:00,899
arrogance I could maybe use that word that we think like okay I already know what I

297
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:05,940
need to know or I don't need to really tune into what's happening I'm smart

298
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:11,399
enough I can figure it out or maybe it's a certain amount of clues-mindedness like

299
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:16,500
I don't really want to learn anything new I just want to be quiet and I hope

300
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:23,100
that I feel some relaxation I don't want to open up any new

301
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:30,179
experiences or new ideas or maybe clinging to views is a part of

302
00:33:30,179 --> 00:33:36,120
wishful thinking too we might have this idea sometimes it's

303
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:41,700
like if we think something enough then it will be so if we convince ourselves

304
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:48,860
it'll be so of course that doesn't work so well

305
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:57,779
so this idea of thoughts thinking views beliefs

306
00:33:57,779 --> 00:34:03,260
versus just tuning into

307
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:09,720
experiencing whatever there is to tune into and

308
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:16,138
experience and I recognize that for some people

309
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:21,560
their experiences really difficult and overwhelming

310
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:28,378
so there's ways in which we can work with that that's like tune into your experience and then come back out open

311
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:34,520
your eyes for example so that we don't fall into overwhelm

312
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:42,260
but it's not you won't be able to work with it by avoiding it and just thinking about it

313
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:48,679
if we could all think ourselves to create our life we would have done it already

314
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:58,159
and maybe I'll end with that and to open it up to some questions

315
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:06,260
somebody have a comment or a question that they'd like to say

316
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:26,220
um when you talk about like Insight could you elaborate a little bit on the difference between Insight versus like

317
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:32,400
wisdom or if they're the same or just if there's any difference between them yeah

318
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:38,460
thank you that's a good question I would say different teachers at different times would say different

319
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:44,339
things this teacher at different times would say different things so

320
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:50,040
um I would say I would say all Insight is wisdom but

321
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:55,200
not all wisdom is inside so some wisdom is just recognizing

322
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,240
um that oh yeah I'm lost in thoughts so there that may not be like an Insight

323
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,359
but that's just recognizing oh yeah most in thoughts and I remember that when I'm usually doing this it doesn't have a

324
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:11,520
good outcome or something like this you know is that helpful yeah yeah that

325
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:18,839
helps anybody else have a comment or a

326
00:36:18,839 --> 00:36:20,960
question

327
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:34,200
I was also thinking that um part of why I I mentioned earlier the

328
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:40,740
kind of the irony and I'm giving all these ideas to say oh it's not all about ideas and I was thinking that also

329
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:46,440
for me in my life I so much thought I could think my way

330
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:53,520
through in my early 20s well I have a question here I just was having a hard time and I

331
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,880
just would go to the library and like okay there's got to be a book here that has the answer

332
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:05,339
and I have a lot of books but uh

333
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:10,160
turns out not to be the answers that I thought they would be

334
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:16,380
uh I really am um

335
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:23,760
excited about this idea of teachers being or you know Wise people

336
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,240
being a result of direct experience so

337
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,940
and I know you're saying it's not necessarily experience out there

338
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:42,660
but aren't we then just cultivating experience

339
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:49,560
and how does that relate to being still I don't know it's a hard question

340
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:56,760
to ask but just that makes me want to just go and experience everything and I think that's a little bit too

341
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:01,859
wild and crazy um so why do you think it's wild and

342
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:07,099
crazy uh because I don't I think

343
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:18,240
there's there's a seeking and a distraction that happens with that

344
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:24,119
um perhaps not enough reflection and

345
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:31,280
insight and the balance between those two things but

346
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:36,540
yeah so searching after stimulation right it just gets exhausting and

347
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:42,000
doesn't necessarily lead to some greater understanding so when I was

348
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:47,040
um thinking about experience I was using words like

349
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:54,000
warm or cold or tingly or stabbing or spacious or closed

350
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:59,520
or tight or um

351
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:05,520
relaxed I don't know those kinds of words so I

352
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,820
I'm when I'm pointing towards or this idea of direct experience I'm really talking about like

353
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:19,260
really kind of like basic experiences and we can turn whatever it is whether

354
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:24,480
it's after going out and experiencing everything we can just be with them and

355
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,900
then we would just notice oh this uh energetic or more

356
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:38,579
bubbly or I don't know what it would be to follow that so it I wouldn't say

357
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:44,460
it has to be only certain types of experiences but

358
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:50,579
if we're really with our experience we will notice the downside of

359
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:56,400
certain experiences like oh this always comes with some tightness and

360
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:03,000
tiredness when I am in having these certain types of experiences or

361
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:09,599
something like that is this helpful yeah I think I think

362
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:17,700
really it sounds like getting really in tune with kind of that somatic experience yes something yeah yes thank

363
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:23,640
you not uh the thrill right feeling right thank you that's

364
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:29,220
right because we do use this word experiences like travel brochures are filled with this

365
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:36,839
word or something like that or you know experienced like Jimi Hendrix you know like what does that mean that's right

366
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,760
that's right thank you thank you

367
00:40:56,040 --> 00:41:01,859
and Diane I think I see a parallel between what you said tonight about

368
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:07,859
distinguishing between reasoning things out and

369
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:14,760
understanding the benefits of direct experience and it's something that

370
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:21,420
both you and Gil taught recently namely that when you look at

371
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:27,980
the Four Noble Truths you see the parallel

372
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:34,980
when you look at the Four Noble Truths instead of thinking

373
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:43,140
about the second Noble Truth is suffering is caused

374
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:50,820
by craving instead just experience

375
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:56,640
just just at A fine grain level be aware of notice

376
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:01,980
craving and notice suffering

377
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:07,859
and when he have a lot of awareness of your moment

378
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:13,200
by moment experience and how things change you know the the Insight really sinks in

379
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:18,420
better something like that so maybe you want to

380
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,820
say it repeat you know restate it a little bit better I

381
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:29,940
said it very nicely we can understand the four noble truths is to recognize oh there's suffering

382
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:36,119
this word suffering we could say stress or dissatisfaction one way we can understand the four noble

383
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:42,359
truths to say and there's the arising and the cessation so just to see the experience oh it's arising and it's

384
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:47,579
going away and there's a path that leads to the cessation to the ending of the

385
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:53,940
suffering and that's in contrast to thinking about oh they're suffering

386
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:59,400
what's causing it oh it's caused by this but then what's caused by that and that's more of a

387
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,920
might be a cognitive activity as opposed to just experiencing the raising and

388
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:10,940
passing away and and Bill I did get the idea for this Dharma talk based on uh

389
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:18,960
the class that you were in on Thursday [Laughter] yep so you get I don't know that was

390
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,119
nice that you uh caught the connection there yeah I I want to add that

391
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:29,400
the reasoning part has been tremendously helpful to me

392
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:37,260
uh oh yeah craving causes suffering and then I when I can see oh

393
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:44,220
how I'm leaning into shall we say a a social situation morning at the

394
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:50,099
turnout will leaning causes suffering maybe both directions

395
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:57,180
so pull back so that the reasoning part has been helpful but

396
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:03,119
but I see what you're saying yeah yeah reasoning right we need it it's important and it's helpful it's an

397
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,220
integral part of our lives and I would say practice too but sometimes we get

398
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:14,520
disconnected from the experience or think that okay I just have to learn more I just have to understand better

399
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:21,000
and then I'll become awakened or somehow something like this but yeah thank you

400
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:27,660
thank you Phil okay so we're at the top of the hour

401
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:33,240
the vector wish you all a wonderful rest of the evening and if you'd like you're

402
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:40,400
welcome to come up here and talk to me but otherwise be safe and thank you
