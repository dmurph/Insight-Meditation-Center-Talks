1
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,519
so welcome to our meditation

2
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:31,039
and uh

3
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:39,280
so one of the key components of mindfulness meditation

4
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,320
is our ability to clearly recognize to clearly recognize what is happening

5
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,960
in the present moment and to recognize it in its simplicity

6
00:00:53,120 --> 00:01:00,239
so in the way and partly that means to recognize it as a present moment

7
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,119
phenomena and maybe without a past or a future

8
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:12,640
of course it has that maybe but but the simplicity of just this

9
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,840
experience without the thoughts the ideas the associations we have

10
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,520
with past and future imaginations we have

11
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:30,240
a simple recognition that is independent of our preferences of course we have

12
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:37,840
preferences but we also have the capacity to know independent of them

13
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,960
to know clearly independent of our desires and our aversions

14
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:52,240
our plans our hopes even independent of our usual

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:02:00,159
sense of self that we operate under or we we construct or we associate with our

16
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,079
agency and our doing and that's maybe the most difficult part of clear knowing is to

17
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:14,480
just to allow the most natural simple inner capacity to know

18
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:21,840
to occur to be to arise and without a lot of ideas of baggage

19
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:29,120
around i'm the one who's doing it or i have to do it well or or i'm not doing it well enough just a

20
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,239
simple knowing and so this week we're looking at

21
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,280
compulsive desire compelling desire with the desire and what that we get

22
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:46,480
caught in and that can happen with this in in the ordinariness of thinking

23
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,040
that we start thinking about something and it doesn't take much to realize that some thoughts some trains

24
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,120
of thoughts there's desires that is propelling them

25
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,560
some of them have aversions some of them have other things but this week we're looking at desire and

26
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,840
there's probably much more often desire propelling thoughts than most people acknowledge sometimes

27
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,280
there's strong feelings in the body even emotions that have underneath them

28
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,120
some desire that's part of it maybe in the corners of it underneath it

29
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,799
maybe in the center of it somehow a desire is part of it and if those desires are compelling or

30
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:38,720
compulsive or we get caught in those desires and then there's no freedom and the

31
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,239
medicine is to clearly recognize clearly no

32
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:51,440
so if you know that you're caught in desire

33
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,080
the medicine is in that knowing it might not be there automatically but

34
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,720
rather than looking for a solution in the desires and the compulsive desires it's

35
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,480
in the knowing that there's a kind of solution kind of freedom to be found

36
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:17,359
and so this kind of stepping back and clearly knowing oh this is desire

37
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,440
this is being caught in desire and and there's a in that stepping back

38
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,440
there's freedom it's like you were you know

39
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:35,759
caught in the quicksand on the edge of a kind of lake or something and all you

40
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,360
have to do is take one little step just maybe a few inches away and stand

41
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,320
on dry ground and you can look back then on the lake on the quicksand realize oh i'm no longer in it

42
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:56,720
so to step back or to open up clear recognition oh this is compulsive

43
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:03,759
desire this is being caught in desire and then to look for where that freedom

44
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,560
is where that spaciousness is where the openness is where the not caughtness is

45
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:17,759
and there is a specialness that's where something sacred is happening that's where the

46
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:24,639
sacred ground is in that clear knowing that is free of so many things that usually

47
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:32,160
gets attached to how we relate to things and if you're able to find that clear recognition of

48
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:40,160
desire then uh welcome

49
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,840
into that clear knowing into that space that sacred ground welcome into it your breathing

50
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:52,880
as an alternative to being caught up in your desires

51
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:59,039
um the breathing is kind of very closely related to this kind of

52
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:05,360
sacred ground this ancestral territory that we can live in that we lose

53
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,360
when we get involved in compulsive desire so don't worry about having compulsive

54
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:18,840
desire being caught in it it's the stepping stone for clear recognition it's the means it's the

55
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,479
support for clear recognition find that freedoms you know to fight it

56
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:30,000
or push it away or feel bad about having it say okay hi my friend

57
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,039
you are the stepping stone for this clear recognition this little little

58
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:42,000
moment of simplicity of freedom um and it helps to do to do this if you

59
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,600
take every each moment for itself some people say that you know every day

60
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:55,759
is a good day it's a saying every moment can be a good moment if

61
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,599
there's a clear recognition the simplicity of the moment

62
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,560
so assuming a meditation posture

63
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:15,360
and closing your eyes and before doing anything else

64
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:22,800
can there be a clear recognition of here and now how you are

65
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:34,080
clear recognition of how you are and then experiment with make subtle adjustments

66
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:40,960
so that you're not caught up in how you are or reactive to how you are

67
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,720
for or against how you are just

68
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:52,160
knowing this is how it is

69
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:04,960
maybe it's through an opening up wide wider than how you are in a sense than

70
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:13,360
knowing it maybe it's stepping back in the mind

71
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:22,160
so you can gaze upon how you are with some freedom or independence

72
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:33,120
maybe it's knowing how you are from a quiet place within

73
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:41,839
a calm place

74
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:13,519
and then welcoming in your breathing welcome breathing into your knowing into

75
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,480
your awareness

76
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,480
especially the inhale receive the inhale

77
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,839
and as you exhale allow for the exhale

78
00:09:47,200 --> 00:10:05,839
and as you exhale for a few exhales allow your body to relax to soften

79
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:19,839
adjusting your arms maybe if that allows your arms to be more at ease

80
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:32,560
and as you exhale to relax in the mind

81
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,519
to calm or soften the thinking mind

82
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,200
rather than letting go of your thoughts let your thinking slow down

83
00:10:49,200 --> 00:11:01,839
no hurry lots of time

84
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:08,399
or perhaps as you exhale to let go of your thoughts as well

85
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,839
and so that the clear knowing of the exhale

86
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:28,800
is worthless

87
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:36,880
the clear experiencing of the inhale is wordless

88
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:43,839
or mostly wordless

89
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:54,160
and then as you meditate here

90
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:03,120
if you notice that you get caught up in desire even subtle desires

91
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:13,760
try not to make it a problem instead see it as a stepping stone

92
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,519
for the sacred ground of clear knowing

93
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,839
the clear awareness of the desire

94
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:32,959
that is not caught in the desire you might be caught

95
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:53,839
desire might be caught in itself but the clear knowing is not

96
00:24:56,159 --> 00:25:01,840
what right now can you clearly recognize

97
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:10,158
that you're enabling or going along with without knowing

98
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:17,679
stepping back opening up wider to clearly recognize what hasn't been

99
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:20,480
recognized

100
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,840
in the simplicity of knowing

101
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:42,400
and then allowing the breathing to return to the

102
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:57,840
fullness of that knowing

103
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:23,520
and then as we come to the end of the sitting imagine that you're sitting in an easy

104
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:32,000
chair maybe in a very open room with open door

105
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:38,399
maybe outdoors in an outdoor lounge chair

106
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,840
and people come to visit and you stay relaxed settle back

107
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:51,760
in your chair welcoming them receiving them

108
00:27:51,760 --> 00:28:00,960
without needing to get up without needing to do much just allowing them into the space

109
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:05,039
allowing them to take a chair as well

110
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:12,960
welcoming them so in the same way as we come to the end

111
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:19,520
of the sitting can you be relaxed open

112
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:27,039
nothing you have to do but to be welcoming but open your awareness now

113
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,159
your mind to the people that you'll encounter today

114
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:36,880
whether strangers on the street or in stores

115
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:45,840
or their people that you'll see on somehow on the computer

116
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,759
in the news the people you might think about today

117
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:02,640
and welcome them into your easy relaxed space

118
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:11,440
welcome and then i'm into a space where you offer safety

119
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:19,360
you offer warmth and kindness

120
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:27,840
a peacefulness you offer them a chair where they can sit also

121
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,600
welcome they mean welcoming into a space in your heart

122
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,880
where they also can be addressed and not demand anything of you or require

123
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,840
anything of you

124
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:52,840
and in this imaginary exercise of receiving people into your sacred

125
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:58,399
ground wish them well

126
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:04,080
or feel how the welcome itself is a well wishing

127
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,360
and may it be on this day that

128
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:20,080
coming out of our meditation and through the day that in our hearts in our minds

129
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:23,840
and maybe in our actions

130
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:31,679
that we there's a welcoming of people a well-wishing of people

131
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:37,840
looking upon people with kind and compassionate eyes

132
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:47,840
may those people we meet today be happy

133
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:54,480
safe peaceful and free

134
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,200
and may we contribute to that possibility

135
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:07,840
that at least in our presence they're safe we offer peace

136
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:14,000
and they're free from us from our desires and our compulsions and

137
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:33,840
our aversions may all beings be happy

138
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:47,919
you

139
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
uh

140
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:40,398
so we continue these morning talks on

141
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:46,640
on greed and uh it's maybe a little bit interesting that

142
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:54,399
i think sometimes uh in the west there's this thing called the seven deadly sins i believe and

143
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:59,519
and greed is one of them and in buddhism i don't think we really look upon

144
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:05,519
anything as being a sin but rather we look upon it as being damaging being

145
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,640
harmful and some things are more some things are harmful and some things

146
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,159
are not and things that are harming we want to stop doing

147
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:22,080
and um so the very different attitude about uh you know that there isn't that kind

148
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:29,760
of condemnation that might be there with the idea of sin but rather there's a kind of compassion

149
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:34,799
care and understanding that there is an

150
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:41,360
alternative to harming and so when we're caught in desire

151
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,799
uh which what that's kind of defined as greed

152
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,120
and what it means is that even beneficial desires desires for something good and healthy

153
00:33:53,120 --> 00:34:02,000
if we're caught in that desire that cotness is harmful that cottness is not healthy

154
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,919
and that's an important distinction because some people might have a kind of greed or being caught up

155
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:15,760
in some very very strongly and needing to wanting to have something happen and and it's the kind of thing maybe

156
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,800
should happen they should have it but is it necessary to be caught in it do does it improve

157
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:28,560
the situation are we more likely to get it if we're caught in it or if we're caught up in it or tight or

158
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:34,240
constricted around the desire uh are we somehow harming ourselves both

159
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:41,839
in the moment but also in creating a disposition a habit of of constriction of tightness of

160
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,040
forcefulness in the desires that we have and one of the wonderful things to

161
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,878
discover is how to have healthy desires and have a quality of freedom have a

162
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,400
quality of ease or peacefulness or simplicity with them and discover

163
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:06,240
maybe we take maybe we can act on these desires so much better and more effectively when we have this

164
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:11,520
peacefulness with them lack of compulsion and also if we have the lack of

165
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,240
compulsion then we have the opportunity to discover the freedom and the benefits of sacred

166
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,440
ground of this openness this ease this peace that

167
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,119
oddly enough can give us often time a sense that we don't

168
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:36,079
need to fulfill our desires or all our desires even if it's a healthy desire we know

169
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,200
something better and then not to sacrifice it that better thing

170
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:48,560
so one of the things that can be better is this clear recognition and not a forceful recognition not a

171
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:53,920
complicated recognition of things not something that's excessively verbal

172
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,000
like we're pounding our thoughts out like you know desire desire in some strong way

173
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:05,680
but this kind of uh soft open quiet almost natural bubbling up of

174
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,280
knowing of clear recognition of what's and um and uh

175
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,119
and in that clear recognition in that knowing there's the treasure knowing we have

176
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:25,119
compulsive desire um is not in and of itself the treasure but within it is found a treasure so

177
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:32,079
to turn the attention away from the desire the object of the desire and

178
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:38,160
recognize something like turn the attention around 360 degrees

179
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,359
to be aware of the what are the quality the characteristics of this

180
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:51,440
clear knowing clear recognition and is there some way of clearly knowing where it feels really

181
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:57,280
good it feels like this is my home my ancestral land this is the place of

182
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,320
of ease and not to dismiss the world

183
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:08,800
not to reject it in any kind of way but to find this place from which to live in the world to know

184
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,480
the world it takes a while to learn this and some people it's perplexing maybe what i'm

185
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,400
saying that there's a treasure in the knowing so it takes a while to kind of

186
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,320
experiment look around experiment with different ways of knowing or being aware

187
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:31,599
until the awareness feels is really nice to be aware and be present and

188
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:38,640
awake so this idea of the core in the central

189
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:47,920
kind of way of practicing insight meditation the idea is to turn away

190
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:53,119
the attention turn the attention away from the object of desire

191
00:37:53,119 --> 00:38:00,480
to what it's like to be desiring so so when we have this kind of clear

192
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:08,000
clear enough knowing and mindfulness then we can use that to feel the experience of desiring

193
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,839
and sometimes only by doing that we begin to disengage ourselves from the compulsion

194
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:20,560
and so one of the things to feel in the desiring the feeling of desiring

195
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:26,560
is what it feels like in the body to be desiring what it feels like in the body to be

196
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:32,320
greedy or compulsive and sometimes there's a leaning forward or a

197
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:38,079
jumping up or a kind of a tension that's uplifting like i really want this

198
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:43,359
there's a tightening sometimes around it and to really feel the physical

199
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:48,960
qualities maybe the jaw gets set relax or the eyes get set on the object we want this for

200
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,480
sure there's a constriction or tightness in the mind sometimes in the belly there's

201
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,920
like a strong urge to have and to want sometimes it's almost like when there's

202
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,440
a strong desire it's almost like we've been possessed like everything just wants

203
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:10,480
um uh there are some certain times when i get really famished like hungry

204
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:17,359
that uh it seems almost like there's this like whole embodied physiological kind of you know

205
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:23,280
primal kind of desire like i better get food and and it can be very compelling and

206
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:30,640
it's fascinating to practice with that it's just so interesting to discover you know these powerful forces within us

207
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:37,200
and to sit in them and discover freedom in them or discover this clear recognition can

208
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:43,280
always be there to provide us a home of freedom that allows us

209
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:49,440
more clarity to think wisely about what we're doing to not act compulsively in ways that are

210
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,960
harmful to ourselves or others so to feel the physio physiology of

211
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:02,160
compulsive desire and one of the interesting ways of doing this is to distinguish between a desire that

212
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:08,400
has no compulsion and a desire that does and what does that compulsion feel like what's that

213
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:14,240
extra thing and to over time become a connoisseur of these

214
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:21,520
the physiological qualities characteristics of compulsion now it isn't so we can be compulsive

215
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:28,400
better but rather the more familiar we are with the physical manifestations of desire expressions of

216
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,760
this compulsive desire the easier it is to become free the easier is to discover this clear

217
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:39,838
awareness that knows it rather than having that compulsive desire

218
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:46,079
infuse us with its authority because sometimes desires come with a

219
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:51,839
lot of authority and that if like this has to happen now and this is important and

220
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:57,280
you know and there might be authority based on fear if i don't get it there might be authority based on

221
00:40:57,280 --> 00:41:02,800
um on and you know then everything will be okay

222
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,000
and i'll be successful and it might be the authority of pleasure like i really need to have some

223
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:15,280
pleasure in order to feel somehow fulfilled or satisfied so what's that authority that comes with

224
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:24,160
compulsion so to feel the physiology of it the physicalness of it then then

225
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:30,160
the it's easier to kind of disengage from the sense of authority that can come with desire

226
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:37,520
the way it's commanding us as we uh drop into the body and feel

227
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:43,599
the physicality of desire then we also may become aware of the emotionality of

228
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:48,960
desire what emotions come into play when we have desire is it fear

229
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,960
is it a virgin actually sometimes desires we want something to get away from something else

230
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:02,079
is it is it anticipation is it are we living in

231
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:07,760
fantasies and we um you know so there's a kind of promise of

232
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:14,560
eternal happiness or something is there a delight in the desire we have

233
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,079
and somehow we're caught in the delight of it that happiness that hap the promise of that

234
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:25,200
happiness it might provide so what's the emotions what's the emotional tone

235
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,480
and feeling of what's happening with it is a desire mostly an attempt to get away

236
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:38,480
from something uncomfortable or is a desire mostly an attempt to get to something that we think is wonderful and to notice that

237
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:45,920
clearly what's motivating it emotionally feeling wise motivational wise

238
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:51,599
is again another step towards disentangling ourselves from it to another step

239
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,040
towards having this clear recognition of what's happening and what's going on

240
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:04,160
and in that clear recognition finding the freedom finding the ease and then it's also possible that as we

241
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,280
kind of settle in and relax and open to the desire is to

242
00:43:09,280 --> 00:43:15,280
also become aware a little bit of the thought train what are the beliefs that are operating

243
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:22,400
there can be beliefs that this is how i'll you know be safe this is how i'll get be happy in my

244
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:29,119
life if i have this pleasure or if this desire is fulfilled it might be that then people will like

245
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,160
me if i or this is how people you know there's all kinds of beliefs that come

246
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:40,160
into play and we don't have to go analyzing that deeply but as we settle down and

247
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,160
quieted meditation especially um then we start it's kind of like um we

248
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:54,480
start like like we're looking out of a window and a stream of different

249
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:01,599
inner events begin to become clearer and clearer it first might be that we shouldn't play we're caught in desire

250
00:44:01,599 --> 00:44:07,760
and then it starts seeing oh the physicality of it and then what comes through the window

251
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:14,960
of awareness is we start seeing the emotionality that's connected to it or the motivational quality of it

252
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:22,000
and then also we might start seeing if when we get quieter and quieter the stream of thoughts related to it and

253
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,000
we might see that we're actually caught in a belief we're caught in a dream

254
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,760
of hope of expectation of fantasy and we can feel the way we lean into and

255
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,599
hold on to that fantasy or that dream or that that where you're living in

256
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:47,599
and that's in part of the part of the desire as well and um and each step along the way

257
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:54,400
of all this the physical just the desire itself the how it feels in the body how it

258
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:01,200
feels emotionally how what's going on in the mind to practice simple clear awareness some of us it

259
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:07,280
means making very simple mental notes tightness

260
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:16,400
anticipation fantasy to help us have that clear recognition

261
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:24,079
and then when the desire is no longer compulsive we can come back to the breathing or

262
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:30,960
if the clear recognition has become strong enough the compulsion might be there still

263
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,200
but we're not really involved in it anymore and then it can be useful sometimes to

264
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:42,720
simply welcome back in the healthy experience of breathing and

265
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:49,440
let breathing the healthiness of breathing fill the awareness so there's in a sense there's no room

266
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:54,560
for the compulsion anymore the compulsion is not being fed by our involvement with it

267
00:45:54,560 --> 00:46:02,000
and it has a chance to just settle down so for this next day you might try when

268
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:07,280
you find even the most subtle compulsive desire like you really need to have something

269
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:14,160
now and you find um you know maybe even if it's a situation's appropriate just close your

270
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:20,480
eyes sit down and really explore and track inside what is going on

271
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:26,079
if you turn the attention 180 degrees around from the object of desire to what's

272
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,520
happening within you as it as you're desiring

273
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:40,319
so thank you and look forward to continuing this series tomorrow
