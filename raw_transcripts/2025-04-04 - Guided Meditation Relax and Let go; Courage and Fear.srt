1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,359
so uh so welcome folks Nice to

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:13,160
uh see your uh see your names Yeah a lot of

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,439
uh a lot of uh old dharma

4
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,840
connections for the years

5
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,680
Um okay Not sure what uh see what how we

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,800
meditate but we're going to

7
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:51,239
meditate Um yeah So

8
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,160
finding finding your way into uh your posture

9
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:37,560
And taking a few deeper breaths Much deeper

10
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:47,000
like uh nectar settling to uh the bottom of a glass of juice Let's take that on said

11
00:03:52,560 --> 00:04:01,280
A million ways to suffer but only one way to

12
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,560
be free

13
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,280
So we marshall our

14
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:35,960
uh courage to stop trying to solve our life

15
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:11,720
And in that gesture of u renouncing the impulse to solve our

16
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:20,039
life it's the uh implicit understanding of our death

17
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,120
That won't get solved either

18
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,479
And the poignency of

19
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:04,680
that helps us be free now

20
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,240
helps us surrender

21
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,000
Just paying attention to whatever is restful in

22
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:34,960
you The settleness of your

23
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:44,280
body The silence You might listen to the

24
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,400
blankness behind your closed

25
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:11,120
eyes the soothing that is uh Buddha Dharma Sana

26
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:35,000
Go We attune to what's restful Rest

27
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,880
We uh relax and let go so that we can

28
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:32,480
receive our breathing more

29
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:43,800
fully Noticing the beginning and the ending of the inhalation

30
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:54,560
followed very quickly by the beginning of the exhalation and the end of the

31
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:06,639
exhalation And sometimes people find it useful to place the attention elsewhere maybe

32
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:12,440
the hands or feet the bottom of the exhale

33
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:21,959
And so there are five distinct points the cycle of breath

34
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,079
We put down our redemptive

35
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:50,320
hopes and

36
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:12,040
worry Clinging cannot do what your heart wants most

37
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:18,919
We can't exactly will our way to letting go will our

38
00:21:18,919 --> 00:21:23,559
way to surrender

39
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:36,480
We uh relax and soften widen

40
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:11,000
Amen Develop uh conditions that uh

41
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,280
make letting go feel more

42
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:32,080
natural

43
00:22:37,880 --> 00:22:43,400
develop the the confidence that we don't

44
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:49,559
need to keep tabs on our

45
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:54,200
life at all times

46
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:06,120
At some point the doingness of attention wants to bow down to the

47
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:10,440
effortlessness of awareness

48
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,919
that we've entrained enough

49
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:37,360
stability somehow under awareness But

50
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:44,520
awareness is not manufactured in the

51
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:47,840
house of

52
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:58,279
self And so we take our cues from

53
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:05,480
that which is patently not me

54
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,719
[Music]

55
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:49,039
Okay good to uh sit with you

56
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:56,600
Um so it was uh I think humor grieving awe

57
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:04,960
surrender today uh courage I've been in a lot of videos

58
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:13,039
over the course of my dharma life mindfulness before this uh you know

59
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:21,520
doing stuff with IMC before co you know in videos um with

60
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,080
mindful schools for some years with uh Megan Cowan Chris

61
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:33,440
McKenna and um and those made their way to a lot of

62
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:39,279
people and um and so sometimes people have seen me

63
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,720
in videos a lot but never in person And one of the most common things people say

64
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:50,559
when they see me in person is I thought you were

65
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:57,080
shorter I find very endearing I thought you were

66
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:03,200
shorter I'm not saying courage is this correlated with height or something but

67
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:11,440
I do kind of hear it as like I thought you were maybe even less courageous and

68
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:18,480
uh talking about courage today Teachers speak about courageous

69
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:26,240
effort but not often about courage And I don't consider myself temperamentally

70
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,559
speaking a courageous person Uh I've not taught about it I

71
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:39,799
don't feel like I know quite enough about it

72
00:31:39,799 --> 00:31:46,880
uh um temperamentally kind of risk averse

73
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:52,360
and uh harm avoidant meaning I've been very

74
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:59,240
careful with my body and mind and careful with the bodies and minds of

75
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:06,279
others Um but I'm trying to

76
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:12,360
um take stock of the ways that fear manifest in my

77
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,320
life and the opportunities for uh for courage

78
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:25,760
So dharma talks they're always partially addressed to uh the

79
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:33,240
speaker and there's a kind of disorientation in courage a sense that

80
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:39,519
you must do something and know yourself in a different way

81
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:46,919
sense that you cannot know exactly how your heart will be at the threshold of a

82
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,159
courageous gesture that you may discover something

83
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:59,159
new about yourself It's intimidating What kind of pain or

84
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:08,278
disorientation might this bring if I take this step off this ledge

85
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:17,679
now all along the way there's um a fair amount of courage needed in the path you

86
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:23,039
know just to start the path m sometimes it's just desperation that might be it

87
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:29,159
but often mixed in with that is something like courage

88
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:36,519
aspiration you know entails some measure of courage because we don't know what we're trading in what we're

89
00:33:36,519 --> 00:33:43,840
heading Um the path is about uh remembering what

90
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:52,399
we've always loved but it's also about learning to love new things And to love something new entails

91
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:59,799
a measure of letting go of something old and that takes some faith some

92
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:07,679
courage Um Ayakma um she said on the spiritual path we do

93
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:12,919
have to try something new In fact the spiritual path takes quite a lot of

94
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:18,720
courage because it means chucking the old without knowing what the new one is

95
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:26,720
really like If we don't have that courage we can't go on such a

96
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:35,878
path because um fear is such a pervasive

97
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:42,480
experience Uh courage is needed at various points along the

98
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,960
spiritual path

99
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:56,480
Um yeah I have a lot of respect for fear how pervasive it is And generally

100
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:03,400
we say on this path that ignorance is the wellspring of suffering But fear strikes me as even more

101
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:08,440
primal more closely linked with clinging

102
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:16,480
more potential to and it's not to demonize fear you know it's you know I

103
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,200
think probably wise to be afraid of extremely dangerous

104
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:28,880
things but um but the kind of pervasiveness of fear

105
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:34,400
in the mind can distort cognition and feeling in

106
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:39,599
profound ways and threat sensitivity and fear

107
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:46,280
It's so deeply woven into our brain I I often cite the uh brain scientist um K

108
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:52,880
Thai She says something like fear has an authoritarian command over the rest of

109
00:35:52,880 --> 00:36:01,839
the brain you know And so um when the dharma teacher

110
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:08,359
says you know uh casually uh just let

111
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:17,240
go some part of us you know really is really skeptical about

112
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:25,839
that you know really skeptical because clinging is what feels like maintains

113
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:32,480
our safety Thinking is what feels safe Thinking might be painful but not

114
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,119
thinking that's a lot worse Worrying worrying for all the pain

115
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:45,760
involved in it feels like the best option we have given a

116
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,200
niche and fear

117
00:36:52,200 --> 00:37:00,240
um disrupts the process of letting go We need courage What's on the other side of

118
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:07,640
this surrender of this softening of this letting go we need courage to

119
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:13,880
see and just we we study fear and worry

120
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:20,000
anxiety those are all a little bit different but um we study this at the

121
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,920
kind of micro level How does fear constellate in the mind

122
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:34,200
how does it make experience more dense how does it necessitate

123
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:41,520
clinging how does it disrupt attention fear disrupts samadei The gathering and

124
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:51,040
unification of our attention doesn't feel safe to take our eyes off threat even for a

125
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,760
moment So we marshall

126
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,880
courage takes courage to open you know to the truth of duka you know that there

127
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:11,040
is suffering truth of change that we talk about it so casually

128
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,720
but it's really not for the faint of heart Yeah you know this when something

129
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:24,000
big shifts when the ground becomes groundless when the line as Michelle

130
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,160
McDonald says between everything being okay everything not being okay the

131
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:34,240
thinness of that line is

132
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:41,119
realized Takes courage to open to this takes courage to open to ourselves Uh

133
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:49,520
you know man Kant um described like the sincere intention to be honest towards

134
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:57,560
oneself That's the heart of spiritual practice and self-discovery is a kind of

135
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:03,440
courageous act you know

136
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:09,200
and if we sit retreat um there are times

137
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:17,160
deep in retreat deep into the silence when our brain feels um highly

138
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:22,680
plastic you know no friction in

139
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:31,560
it And that makes um bliss and love and peace much more

140
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:39,160
accessible but it also opens the door to states of terror

141
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:45,839
too And sometimes it's kind of a nameless dread You know there's no

142
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:53,079
object of the fear Sometimes the fear is fear of um bodily dissolution

143
00:39:53,079 --> 00:39:58,400
or annihilation or uh you know total

144
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:07,520
loss of control and uh it's really hard not to

145
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:16,359
be in problemsolving mode when the terror runs deep you know

146
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:23,240
And sometimes it's right to just problem solve our way out of it It's

147
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:32,640
fine But sometimes we just wait the uh the IMC teacher May uh

148
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,720
Elliot um said uh when you get lost in the woods you know like the impulse is

149
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:47,440
to go looking for help to go you know find someone So you know but um she said

150
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:53,960
uh the advice actually is to stay still let the help find

151
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:59,920
you And um yeah the way she said that touched me

152
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:06,760
you know to let the hope find you And

153
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:13,920
uh so in in cataloging kind of the fear

154
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:22,880
and courage on the path strikes me that um that fear has made my life smaller

155
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,359
than it might have been And

156
00:41:28,359 --> 00:41:34,200
um there's a difference between sensitivity to

157
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:40,560
suffering versus fear of suffering Now I've always been ever ever

158
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:47,040
since I was a kid you know very sensitive to suffering in myself and others And generally speaking that's

159
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:53,200
been a gift that I've been careful and tried to lead a life that

160
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:00,079
does not trespass on the hearts of others um that's sensitive to their suffering

161
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,760
to my own but I'm recognizing that I'm I'm

162
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:13,240
more afraid of suffering than I realized And there's a way in which

163
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:18,319
Buddhism can be marshaled as a a means

164
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:23,720
of controlling suffering you

165
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,760
know and we never say it that way We talk about being free from suffering

166
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:39,400
letting go all these beautiful things I don't walk those back But there's another sense in which maybe maybe

167
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:45,119
um the path has been about controlling my

168
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:52,720
suffering And we don't say it that way but maybe that's how my fear construed

169
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:59,640
it And fear involves the need to control and the

170
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:05,400
aversion to um the sense of being out of

171
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:13,480
control And developing courage likely means we must relinquish the need to

172
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:22,000
control the willingness to experience helplessness the willingness to let help

173
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:25,440
find us

174
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:35,359
And yesterday I was with a group of um SA IMC SA members and teachers and um

175
00:43:35,359 --> 00:43:42,800
was just inspired by um their presence and and the phrase that I was sort of

176
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:49,040
felt like I was like attuning to each the kind of courage of each person You

177
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:54,359
know everybody has their own species of goodness their own species of

178
00:43:54,359 --> 00:44:00,800
courage And the phrase that came up you know which is not a phrase it doesn't

179
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:06,160
sound didn't sound like my mind you know but the phrase that came up in me was

180
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:12,720
don't die a coward You know that's not language I use It sounds

181
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:17,960
very Marshall And yet there it was

182
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:26,400
St Aquinus said um courage is a condition of each and

183
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:33,200
every virtue Courage is a condition of each and every virtue Everything that's good

184
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:39,640
depends in some ways on courage We can see this in the parameies the
