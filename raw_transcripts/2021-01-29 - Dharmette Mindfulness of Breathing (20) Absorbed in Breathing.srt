1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:04,160
so

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:07,359
continuing the topic of anapanasati

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:08,960
mindfulness of breathing in and

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,240
mindfulness of breathing out

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,280
the um we're kind of moving into the

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,080
territory now

7
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,000
of the second tetrad where we train

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,920
to experience joy as we breathe in

9
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,480
experience joy as we breathe out and

10
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,279
then

11
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:30,000
we train to as we breathe in to

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,840
experience happiness

13
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,360
as we breathe out to experience

14
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,920
happiness

15
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,280
and so

16
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:42,320
all along here in all the 16 steps what

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,039
they have in common is mindfulness while

18
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,079
breathing in

19
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,559
and mindfulness of breathing out and

20
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,640
there's a connection to this rhythm of

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,360
breathing

22
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,960
in and out that goes on and um

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,239
and as we move into this the joy part

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,680
the the happiness part the

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,559
kind of the sense of wellness well-being

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,320
that comes along

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,640
uh i think it's important to remember

28
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,520
that we're

29
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,760
that how important this rhythm of

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,360
breathing in and breathing out is

31
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,040
so it's as i've said the the continuity

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,560
of breathing

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,040
is keeps us can keep us in the present

34
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,479
moment

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:26,479
it's a breathing is always a present

36
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,920
moment experience

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,119
and it keeps us going and moving along

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,479
in the present and it's also

39
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,079
but it's also in constant it's there's a

40
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:38,479
discontinuity

41
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,400
because the in-breath is only there

42
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,759
while you're breathing in and the out

43
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:42,720
breath is only there when you're

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,079
breathing out

45
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,399
and one leads to the other and there's

46
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,720
this rhythm of one after the other

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,399
the sensations at the beginning of the

48
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:51,840
in-breath are different than the

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,159
end of the out-breath the sensations the

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:55,520
beginning of the out breath are

51
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,840
different than the end of the out breath

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,680
and so there's a constant change of

53
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,600
sensations of movement experience in the

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,640
body

55
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,479
sometimes for focusing mostly on the

56
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:07,200
little spot of the chest or the belly

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,520
we feel the changing texture of

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,039
sensations there

59
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,800
if we're aware more broadly we might

60
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,440
feel a changing

61
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,680
ways and places where that are activated

62
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,959
with sensations

63
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:22,000
as we breathe so there's both

64
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,920
this constancy and this inconstancy

65
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,840
uh with mindfulness of breathing the

66
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,160
constancy of the rhythm of breathing

67
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,800
and the inconstancy of all the pieces of

68
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,319
it the subsets of it

69
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,920
coming and going and

70
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,280
and so we can't hold on to any one part

71
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,640
of the breathing without causing

72
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,519
problems

73
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:47,040
if you hold on to the exhale

74
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,519
you know you never inhale and so you

75
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:50,720
know then you

76
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,920
you know run out of breath

77
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,599
if you hold on to same thing with the

78
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:57,280
inhale some people

79
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,959
kind of prioritize really don't want to

80
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,400
let go at the

81
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,159
top it's very it's going to be very very

82
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,000
subtle but some people come

83
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,040
to the top of the inhale

84
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:08,640
and they don't really want to give up

85
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,400
anything they kind of have a policy of

86
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,519
holding everything

87
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:12,720
they don't want they want things for

88
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,440
themselves so there's a little subtle

89
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,879
resistance there

90
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,400
to let go some people don't start the

91
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,680
exhale because

92
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,519
it's a kind of letting go especially the

93
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,440
end of the exhale people get little

94
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,680
very very subtly people get a little bit

95
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,440
anxious there

96
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,519
or there's a very subtle attitude maybe

97
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,440
at the beginning of the in-breath

98
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,879
no i don't want to breathe in it's just

99
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,640
a bother just more

100
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,920
work and now just leave me alone there's

101
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,159
enough input coming my way

102
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,840
so there can be very subtle attitudes

103
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,280
in that cycles of breathing and

104
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,720
that kind of little bit operate when you

105
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,080
when we get to that

106
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,480
a little bit of holding perhaps a little

107
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,000
bit resistance

108
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,799
or a little bit triggering of thoughts

109
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:03,280
of fear or resistance or

110
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,480
or you know aversion or something and

111
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,640
and you can if you're really attentive

112
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,120
you can watch and see in that cycle

113
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,040
where it is that some little

114
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,400
psychological thing is

115
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,280
triggered occasionally don't don't try

116
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,199
too hard to look for it but

117
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,240
it's a little bit there and or if we

118
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,240
start thinking about something else

119
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,880
and it's really you know preoccupying

120
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,600
really as

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,560
a major issue you can feel the breath

122
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,759
gets held and

123
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:33,040
we're still breathing in and out but

124
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,880
maybe it's all chest breathing and

125
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,639
it's you know the belly's tight and and

126
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,600
and so there's this holding going on but

127
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:42,240
if you

128
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,639
just stay with the inconstancy and the

129
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,639
flow of breathing

130
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:49,040
uh and remembering that this is

131
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:51,040
constantly letting go

132
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,000
constantly opening up constantly

133
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,320
releasing and softening and allowing the

134
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,960
flow to go

135
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,039
that it's a protection from getting

136
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:02,800
attached to anything getting hooked too

137
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,160
much on things

138
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,080
getting caught in our thoughts caught in

139
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,000
reactivity whatever

140
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,479
it's a way of keeping us limber keeping

141
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,600
us relaxed or loose or not so caught

142
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,960
and it's by degrees and um

143
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,560
so i don't think it's all or nothing

144
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,520
again but we slowly the breathing begins

145
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,400
to

146
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,560
massage us and begins to support the

147
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,919
letting go

148
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,080
and with time as the breathing becomes

149
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,400
more like a flow that goes smooth and

150
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,680
easy

151
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,280
that um the the uh

152
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:37,199
watching the breath tuning into the

153
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,680
breathing becomes a little bit like

154
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,720
sitting at the edge of a river

155
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,479
and just watching the rippling

156
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,199
occurrence so the water flowing down

157
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:49,520
the river and it's kind of like looking

158
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,360
at a fire

159
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,280
sometimes we can just spend a long time

160
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,479
just looking at

161
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,479
the changing patterns of the water flow

162
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,720
that you know that's

163
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,240
not that different from each other but

164
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,240
it's changing and it can be just a watch

165
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,680
that

166
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,880
can be very relaxing and it we're not

167
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,919
necessarily trying to

168
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,759
quiet our mind or stop thinking about

169
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,720
anything but just letting that be the

170
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
you know the way the mind kind of the

171
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,759
attention

172
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,160
gets absorbed in and flowing with

173
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,000
something gets quite quieter and quieter

174
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,039
and stiller so the same thing as with

175
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,160
time

176
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,639
um as the breathing becomes more relaxed

177
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,680
more loose

178
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,639
more open more flowing and we kind of be

179
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,720
within constancy the

180
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,280
and the constancy the incontinency of

181
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,360
the little wavelets of breathing

182
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
on top of the constancy of just the flow

183
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,479
of the river of

184
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,240
breathing we get absorbed in it we get

185
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,720
pulled into it

186
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,240
and there's a lot of it it's not like

187
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,080
we're looking at the surface of uh

188
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,960
water we're actually um what we're doing

189
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,280
is

190
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,400
feeling sensing all the sensations that

191
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,599
come alive

192
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:00,880
as we breathe and and especially as we

193
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,160
kind of get settled in

194
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,240
and really begin to settle into the

195
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,440
present moment and

196
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,120
stay with that rhythm and flow of

197
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,720
breathing that

198
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,560
um there gets born uh

199
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,160
pleasant sensations uh and um

200
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,560
uh that er that kind of can take the

201
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,240
form of contentment

202
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:23,440
it can take the form of um pleasure it

203
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,960
can take the form of

204
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,240
a joy or delight or happiness

205
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,000
um a sense of goodness a glow a warmth

206
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,520
and i know i'm repeating my things i've

207
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,360
said now but i think it's worth

208
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,880
repeating

209
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,800
and also and everyone will experience a

210
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,080
little bit differently

211
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:42,160
some people might feel something a glow

212
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,759
in their chest as they settle into

213
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,039
breathing some people might feel it in

214
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:46,319
their belly a warmth

215
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,560
something good some people maybe it

216
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:49,919
feels intense

217
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,440
um joyful tingling and kind of a

218
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:54,639
delightful

219
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,479
uh in the nostrils that the air goes in

220
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,160
and out it gets more and more intense

221
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,080
the the the sharpness of the joy

222
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,160
of the the pleasure that's there and

223
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,440
it's kind of a thrill

224
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,000
almost it might be there's a kind of a

225
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,400
sense of

226
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,360
locationless thrill throughout the body

227
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,360
that comes as we really settle in

228
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,080
and get it get absorbed just like you'd

229
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,560
get absorbed and watching the river

230
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,319
get absorbed in in this thing

231
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,879
my first experience of like this of

232
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,639
being absorbed and feeling the goodness

233
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,599
of it

234
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,800
was when i was about 10 years old and

235
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,200
i would

236
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,880
take the public bus i was living in

237
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,000
italy and a little

238
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,159
town in italy and i would go to school

239
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,760
in town and we lived in the outskirts of

240
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,800
town and

241
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:48,480
and my my bus stop that i got off on was

242
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,040
right near the very end of the line

243
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,080
and i i learned at some point oh so

244
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,519
there was a driver and there was a

245
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,360
conductor who sold the tickets

246
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,839
to two people and the conductor would go

247
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:00,880
up and down and

248
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,360
sell tickets as people got on board but

249
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,120
the conductor at some point when we kind

250
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,760
of got outside the city enough that

251
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,360
really not new people were going to get

252
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:12,080
on the the conductor would sit on a

253
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,839
particular seat

254
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:15,440
and do the accounting of all the

255
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,120
different sea tickets

256
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,640
he'd sold you know a round trip one way

257
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,959
children you know senior citizens

258
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,880
whatever it might be

259
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,200
and he had his ledger he'd write on and

260
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,640
i learned that if i sat

261
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,680
in a particular seat behind his seat

262
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,600
and kind of looked over his shoulder and

263
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,279
watched him

264
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:37,279
to do his accounting in his ledger of

265
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,440
the different kind of tickets he got

266
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,920
i would just start feeling so good i

267
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,600
would just kind of feel so

268
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,320
warm my chest would kind of glow in

269
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,600
delight and joy

270
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,480
and i feel so content i felt safe and

271
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,680
settled and

272
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,240
everything was right in the universe and

273
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,080
just watching him and i had no idea why

274
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,680
i didn't ever thought about it

275
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,360
i just knew that if i sat there i'd have

276
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,920
this really good feeling

277
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,160
and many years later when i started

278
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,200
meditating

279
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,240
i realized that um i was getting

280
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,200
absorbed in this very simple thing that

281
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,959
he was doing maybe i was

282
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,120
tapping into his concentration of

283
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,079
working

284
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,160
but just the movement of his pencil on

285
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,839
the paper and

286
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:22,320
and his focus on it somehow i got kind

287
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,680
of absorbed just

288
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,200
and it wasn't like trying to get

289
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,800
concentrated i wasn't

290
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,399
i didn't know i was you know really

291
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,320
getting absorbed um

292
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,399
it just like my world kind of got so

293
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,320
content and happy and

294
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,040
settled and just him his pencil his

295
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,160
piece of paper

296
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:41,200
watching him and um

297
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,279
so this is the this maybe captures a

298
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:44,480
little bit the

299
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,760
sense of what's possible in on breath

300
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,760
meditation as we get into this

301
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,519
fifth and sixth step we're not trying

302
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:53,839
too

303
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,560
hard it's almost like we're just sitting

304
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,000
back and watching the

305
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,720
you know on a nice quiet day and nothing

306
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,920
to do nothing to be

307
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,079
just watching the river or the conductor

308
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,880
do his ledger in the on the bus

309
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,959
and um and uh and allowing ourselves to

310
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:11,600
include

311
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,480
include the good feelings that come with

312
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,760
that

313
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
now remember they don't come

314
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
automatically and right away the first

315
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,600
four steps of anapanasati are always the

316
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:22,720
default

317
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,440
and and the basic default is the first

318
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,079
two just

319
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,560
becoming familiar with the breathing and

320
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:29,839
and developing just kind of

321
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:31,760
developing capacity to stay a little bit

322
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,079
in the present moment with things

323
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:35,440
and we're always going back to the

324
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,880
beginning and you might go back to the

325
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,800
beginning during some sittings

326
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,040
it was one way in the beginning and then

327
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,000
we're kind of back

328
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,920
near the beginning at the end because

329
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,600
who knows all the ways that

330
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,200
things change in our mind and body and

331
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,920
so uh don't have some idea of linear if

332
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,519
it's linear don't have some idea that it

333
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:55,120
has to be a certain way don't be in a

334
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,560
rush

335
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,560
but when you're settled enough and

336
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,000
present enough

337
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,360
then at some point the fifth and sixth

338
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,959
steps might be relevant

339
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,680
and this idea of kind of gently allowing

340
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,160
yourself to be absorbed in that

341
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,720
and feeling the goodness of that and and

342
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,240
kind of let the breathing in

343
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,000
and bring out always going on that

344
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,240
rhythm keep you from getting attached

345
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:18,800
and

346
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,880
wanting keeping you loose and limber in

347
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,000
the mind

348
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,560
staying with that flow in and out and

349
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,279
then

350
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,760
letting that rhythm of breathing and out

351
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,560
move through

352
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,200
or with the goodness that's there as

353
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:31,760
well

354
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,480
and let that grow and be expansive and

355
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,160
let it grow and be expensive so it

356
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,680
includes

357
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,160
it can include all the challenges as

358
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,680
well

359
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,440
without us needing to be preoccupied

360
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,200
with the challenges or caught by them or

361
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,399
needing to fix them

362
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,839
they're just there in a relaxed way and

363
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,160
so um

364
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,639
so i hope that

365
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,720
you'll feel content

366
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,120
contentment and perhaps the assignment

367
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:07,279
for the next 24 hours

368
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:09,040
is maybe you can look for more

369
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,560
opportunities

370
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,760
to be have contentment in your day

371
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,800
and i suspect that it you you can do it

372
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,760
if uh even if it's a minute or so that

373
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,519
you'll have more opportunities if you

374
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:25,279
look for them and and

375
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,600
and hang out with them a little bit and

376
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,760
that contentment in your daily life

377
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,160
will maybe support you to feel this

378
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,279
meditative goodness

379
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,920
and contentment that supports a

380
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,040
deepening of this practice

381
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,639

382
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,040
