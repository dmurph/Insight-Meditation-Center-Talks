1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,400
YouTube [Laughter]

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:15,599
yeah so welcome this is class four of five on the five hindrances and we're using

3
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,260
the story The Wizard of Oz as a reference point and I'm kind of

4
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:30,480
thinking about how these hindrances show up in that movie hi welcome

5
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:36,480
um so last week we talked about um restlessness and worry

6
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:44,340
and I just want to say again just this invitation to kind of hold the

7
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:51,300
hindrances in a few ways one is as about energy

8
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,899
energies that directed like of what you want energies are directed at getting away or pushing away from something so

9
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,660
that's the greed or the desire and the aversion so it's you can feel it in the

10
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:09,020
body right thanks Gus

11
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:15,180
and so you know this is energy you can it's a momentum

12
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,780
right and then uh restlessness is worry is too much energy

13
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:27,659
too much energy in the body or too much energy in the mind

14
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,119
and a way to think about for me the container

15
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:41,100
how the mind is holding something impacts also the energy so if you think

16
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:46,500
about a bouncing ball in a small space

17
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:52,500
it if it keeps bound it has something to bounce against it's going to keep going right longer and longer if it's really

18
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:59,399
small tight space it goes if the Space is really big

19
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,640
it's not going to keep going for as long because it doesn't keep having this resistance or this pressure to keep it

20
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:11,340
going so if we can broaden the space in our

21
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,379
minds our hearts to be with whatever's going on it can

22
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:23,420
help lessen that intensity of energy in the body and the in the mind

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:29,700
I'll just say this about sloth and torpor which is what we're going to talk about tonight

24
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:36,379
and another way you can think about what happens when you have too much space

25
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:43,080
like if you imagine you have all day two weeks one month of nothing

26
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:51,720
you have to do sometimes it's it we just kind of get

27
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,599
immobilized because there's too much space there's not enough kind of

28
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,660
something to push against or move us toward right so in an opposite way sloth

29
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:10,019
and topper might be too much space in the mind or in the structure of our life we're in the space where give permission

30
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,720
we're giving ourselves even so energy right so if we have too much

31
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,760
space Maybe we lose our energy it flattens

32
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:28,739
to little space it can create a tighter environment for reactivity and the buildup of excessive energy

33
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:34,500
so this idea of the energy helps kind of

34
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:42,420
us see I think kind of fine-tune our relationship with these hindrances not as something horrible that's haunting us

35
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:47,700
or you know that we're bad it's more about like again to me seeing it as

36
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:54,000
feedback like it's a reflection of what's happening within in some way or another

37
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,220
and if we can recognize it we can go oh maybe I need to put a little more

38
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:06,000
attention here or maybe I need to take off a little bit of attention here or if I'm leaning too much into

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,340
something like uh yeah remembering where that leads us and the same with the

40
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:18,840
aversion another way to think about the hindrances is is that they're veils they

41
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:23,880
cover something and you know the teachings in the in the

42
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,780
time from the time of the Buddha and the sutas occasionally you'll see these references that the Mind itself is pure

43
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,720
and bright just that's the natural nature of the Mind and so

44
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:42,120
what if there's something covering that what if we all have this

45
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:47,340
and there's things that cover it that prevent us from kind of seeing clearly

46
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:53,880
to it or through it and the Buddha gave similes having to do

47
00:04:53,880 --> 00:05:00,900
with water for each of the the hindrances and so a mind clear of hindrances is

48
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:05,940
described as a very clear pool of water

49
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:12,479
so you can look in you can see and penetrate see the rocks and the fish and

50
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,520
the algae and you know it's clear to you what it is and what's happening in there

51
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,460
you could see a reflection without Distortion right

52
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:31,199
if you have desire in the mind the veil is kind of equated to die

53
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,740
you know like a color crimson red or something put in the

54
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:42,840
water and so it tints right just like sunglasses

55
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:48,419
I had somebody who came to this class when we were talking about this and I was talking about you know tinting

56
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:54,300
wearing sunglasses affects the colors that you see right and so he had this

57
00:05:54,300 --> 00:06:00,000
huge aha moment because he ran through a red light

58
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,160
because of or a green light he must have stopped at a green light because the

59
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,759
tinting in his glasses turned the green to like what looked like red

60
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,660
so this the color you know the way we're seeing can impact how we perceive what

61
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,720
we're looking at so if we're looking into the pond and it's all Rosy it might make us think oh

62
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:32,340
it's so beautiful look at how the fish is this color and it's you know purple and instead it's just you know gray or

63
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:39,060
something and the impact or the veil of ill will

64
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:45,600
in the water is like boiling water so you can't see into it because the

65
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:50,759
water is not still and it's also hot and dangerous right so you can't even really

66
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:56,039
get close to it to the veil you know prevents us from seeing

67
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:01,740
with restlessness and worry it's like wind wind on a lake right really kicks

68
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:07,080
up the waves and you again it's choppy and the water is Disturbed so you you

69
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:14,160
can't see clearly and with Sloth and torpor it's equated with like algae

70
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,479
right sludge that makes it hard to move hard to see it's like have you ever had algae water

71
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:26,940
you know it's not easy to clear out you know this is not easy I had I've had

72
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:34,259
fish tanks right and you know even if you wipe off the glass you're just the water is fill me there's

73
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:39,840
a lot of work to trying to get it clean and usually you just have to get rid of most of the water clean out

74
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,900
the Rocks clean the glass and leave some in for the pH balance but you know it's

75
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:51,300
this long process it can take a while you might have to change the water a few times

76
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:56,819
so the Veil I like this idea of like you know the

77
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:02,400
nature of the Mind the nature of the heart is radiant and free of these things

78
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:09,300
and conditions just like weather happen in our lives and they're going to disturb

79
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:15,720
that capacity to see through see with see into with that kind of clarity and

80
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:21,720
brightness and we're using The Wizard of Oz as a

81
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,360
reference and I say we Diana's not here tonight because she's sick so hopefully she'll be back next week for the last

82
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:34,740
class but um we wanted to you know we Diana and I when we've taught this before we

83
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:42,419
have this idea just let's demystify these hindrances let's not make them into bad things they're if you actually

84
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:47,700
see I've said this before but think about it if you see clearly

85
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,800
what's happening you can pull the veil back the curtain back and who does this

86
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:58,800
in The Wizard of Oz who reveals Toto

87
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:04,320
right I mean here's this wizard hiding have you seen the movie

88
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,660
oh yeah so the wizard right just this little guy

89
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:15,839
making up lots of stories intimidating people pretending to have power hides behind

90
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,740
this curtain and then has this projected had with this flame coming out of it

91
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:29,760
speaking in this deep demanding voice and Toto's like to me the little symbol

92
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,959
of mindfulness right sort of this clear ability to see and he just runs over there and pulls

93
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,540
the curve back and reveals the wizard and that revealing

94
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:48,000
that's a c it's a pathway to Freedom if we can see it we can relate to it we can

95
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:53,339
know and we can be free from it we're you know remember how frightened they were

96
00:09:53,339 --> 00:10:00,060
when they were visiting the wizard as he was you know booming voice and they're all shivering

97
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:05,100
and quivering and you know you pull back that curtain and

98
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:13,019
you realize wow this is make believe and how often do we make ourselves

99
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:19,320
shiver and quiver because of our mental mind imagining creating

100
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:26,160
these intensities these stories and if we can recognize what we're doing

101
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:34,880
we can pull our own corn back and free ourselves from the Wizards of the world and our own mind

102
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:43,040
so does anyone want to say anything about working with restlessness and worry this past week or

103
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,800
any Reflections from the class from last week before we kind of move into

104
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:56,420
slop and torpor in the context of Wizard of Oz and then in the context of the Dharma

105
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:03,860
great that's okay

106
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:12,240
I was just gonna ask because you were just talking about like revealing the curtain and like similarly revealing

107
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:18,720
things in our life that were like covered before and as you were saying that I was just

108
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:24,120
thinking like like the example you gave in The Wizard of Oz it's like a very clear

109
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,540
uh thing that gets revealed but like often I feel like things are way more

110
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:37,800
complicated especially when you look like different perspectives and how like someone sees

111
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:44,399
something versus another person and it's usually not as straightforward as like oh this person did this to me it might

112
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,519
be like oh they were feeling this way and they reacted this way which made me feel this it's like I don't know I feel

113
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:56,519
like it gets very muddy and I don't know if you have any thoughts

114
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,740
around I don't I think I struggle a little bit in general with like meditation and like doing raft and

115
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:06,899
things like that because I just feel like there's usually not this very clear path

116
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:14,579
towards like walking through my feelings or emotions or like processing events

117
00:12:14,579 --> 00:12:19,740
um and revealing things when I don't know like yeah I just feel like I don't know how

118
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,740
to do it well yeah well um

119
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:32,040
I have a lot of things to say so um what can I say right now a couple of

120
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,740
you know um

121
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:41,720
remember that when we're doing mindfulness

122
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:48,060
we can only do mindfulness of our own experience

123
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:53,399
right we can only really be mindful of what we're sensing in our bodies

124
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:58,920
what we're thinking what we're feeling and know that we're seeing things but

125
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:04,980
from our own perspective we can't know exactly what anyone else

126
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:12,240
is seeing thinking feeling we can be sensitive and empathic and pick up on stuff but truly it's only the

127
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,300
other person that can and we don't have to agree we can be in

128
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:25,560
the same room in the same time same things happening and have two very different experiences

129
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:31,320
and there's there's stories I don't remember who the monks are but there are stories from some monks right who are

130
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:37,740
practitioners in Europe I don't remember they were traveling together and they were talking later about these events

131
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:44,160
that they shared and they all had a really different stories really different perceptions of the

132
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:51,660
experience and that's just the reality of life so if we're trying to

133
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:57,240
make everything match up with other people and their experience

134
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:02,279
somebody's always trying to then distort their own experience

135
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:08,880
all of our experiences colored and influenced by our history our personality the way we see and

136
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:14,160
relate our mind thinks some people think you know an image as some people think in words

137
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:20,040
some people don't really think an either you know our minds are unique and our

138
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:27,120
histories are unique in the way we even Define something is impacted by everything behind us

139
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,700
so maybe if you try and simplify

140
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:38,160
and really get clear that all you need to know is what's going on for you what your truth is

141
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:44,760
it doesn't mean it's that capital T truth but it means that you can settle with

142
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:50,279
something because you know what's true for you does that make sense

143
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:56,579
yeah the other thing I'll say is that um

144
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:02,100
in May the last three weeks of may not all

145
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:08,519
because I'm doing an intro series after this one but in May I'm doing raft just for three

146
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:14,519
weeks just draft and I'm hoping to do some practices where people are willing

147
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:20,279
to have me guide them through it and share out loud what's happening so I can guide you through more

148
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:25,440
so come back in May laughs

149
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:32,519
all right so let's talk about sloth and torpor and The Wizard of Oz for a moment

150
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:39,959
so sloth right is very the physical aspect of this hindrance

151
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:45,480
it's the heaviness the the frozenness the not being able to move or get up you

152
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:50,519
know and so who in The Wizard of Oz is stuck

153
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:56,639
slow the Tin Man right he's rested shut

154
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,279
he can't move oh okay I'm afraid he's just talking out of

155
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:07,560
the corner of his mouth and you know um so he needs to be oiled and

156
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:13,079
greased and and then if you watch him right he

157
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:19,680
he kind of has a sadness to him there's a little bit of a

158
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,959
you know a little bit of a sadness to his face and you know there's a way in

159
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:33,779
which I think depression is a little bit like the torpor right and and the energy in the body and the

160
00:16:33,779 --> 00:16:41,820
energy in the mind kind of affect the way he speaks so he's kind of like slowly his head's kind of sideways and

161
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:48,720
you know just sort of his affect his opposite of the straw man the straw man

162
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:55,380
who has all kinds of restlessness and worry right all kinds of extra energy his mood will swing from this to that

163
00:16:55,380 --> 00:17:02,820
rapidly the Tin Man no no no you don't see that right so this is a kind of an example of

164
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:08,058
how more sloth and torper manifest and look just this sort of flatter slower

165
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:13,260
kind of uh you knowness

166
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:19,079
sad subdued Maybe and

167
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:25,040
tarper and sloth actually you know they don't mean you don't have energy

168
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:29,900
they mean you're not accessing your energy

169
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,940
one you know you've seen how people can go from no energy to tons of energy snap

170
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:44,460
of a finger because something interesting comes along or something that excites them happens right so that

171
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:49,919
energy was there it just wasn't accessed because their mind wasn't turned on or

172
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:55,679
their ideas and beliefs weren't that you know positive and energetic and what is

173
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:02,220
it that this Tin Man Is Telling himself what does he tell Dorothy the straw man

174
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:09,480
he just says he doesn't have a heart he he tells himself he has no heart and

175
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:18,120
he tells them he really believes he has no heart but yet he's sad and he's romantic and he's longing a partner

176
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:23,520
right you know you don't feel those things if you have no heart but he's

177
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,480
telling himself he has no heart and he believes his story and when we believe the stories are we

178
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:36,000
tell ourselves like this it affects our energy affects our mood

179
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:41,940
and our bodies and our minds and think about

180
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,240
what is it like to imagine not having a heart not having an emotional connection what

181
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,919
what does life look like

182
00:18:53,880 --> 00:19:01,440
great really you know lacking vibrancy

183
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,520
right and that's kind of how he presents lacking vibrancy it's so pithy I think

184
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:14,340
it's so pithy what they've done in this story with these characters actually and it's quite extreme you know and the

185
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,620
story stories kind of wild but the more I think about it the more I'm like wow

186
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:28,200
this is such a great such a great way to tell us about the way we are you know

187
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,360
so there's another person in the story who tells himself that he can't do

188
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:40,260
things and things are too hard they're too dangerous and it affects him and his energy in some ways it's a

189
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:45,840
little different but I wonder about the lion and I wonder if there's some way you

190
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:51,360
know he certainly has you know worry but does he also have some sloth and torpor

191
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:57,799
in there that kind of are impacting him we can have multiple hindrances

192
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:06,620
and then there's one other really poignant example of sloth and torpor and that's the field of poppies

193
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:13,260
right drugs right poppy opiates it's like

194
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:20,520
we you know opiates make us feel like it's a warm hug and we fall asleep and

195
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:27,600
we lounge around and you know they essentially go into this field and they all fall asleep right so they're lacking

196
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:33,240
awareness in the mind and body such a another example of how you know

197
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:39,900
whether it's drugs or what we're doing that can induce states of coma like

198
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:46,860
consciousness yeah so now I kind of shift in less weight

199
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:57,440
who has other ideas anybody else have other ideas from the story that might might reflect sloth and torpor nope

200
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:03,840
if you do if anything pops up feel free to share um

201
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,620
So within the Dharma I talked about you know the the pond the algae filled Pond right it's a simile taught by the the

202
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:18,660
Buddha and you know been sort of talking about you know the sloth and torpor comes from

203
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:24,299
you know really a lot of it can come from our mind the way we're thinking about things

204
00:21:24,299 --> 00:21:29,900
the perspective we have on things how tight we are around things or how

205
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:35,159
slack we are how much permission giving we are giving ourselves

206
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:41,640
you know um and so the sloth is the physical the torpor is the mind the dull cloudy weary

207
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,740
easily drifting into thought there's something that

208
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,860
um Gill calls the sinking mind

209
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:58,380
which is related to a torpor in the mind and it actually you know in deeper

210
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:04,799
meditation it can be in a little bit seductive and pleasant it's like this feeling of just I don't

211
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:11,159
know yeah like sinking right just this sinking sinking feeling and just not

212
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:16,740
even knowing you're not aware because you're so I don't know lost

213
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:23,940
yeah and so when it's really strong there can be you know insufficient mindfulness to

214
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:27,139
even know we're in it

215
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:34,980
so um well you know emotional energies or

216
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:41,880
attitudes also affects our energy like a feeling of discouragement frustration boredom

217
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:48,780
or even indifference right boredom to me is a lack of um

218
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:55,919
Connection in the present moment it's it's not not being present an indifference to me is a form of

219
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,580
hostility really I feel um there's a feeling giving up can

220
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:09,960
induce sloth and torp or hopelessness right and the other thing is resistance

221
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:15,840
when we're resisting something we can find ourselves in a attention a space of

222
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:22,980
tension that immobilizes us in a way right so if we're something needs to

223
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:28,740
happen and we think it needs to happen but we can't do it we won't do it we can get stuck

224
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:31,740
immobilized

225
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:42,240
it can also come up when we have a sense of not feeling satisfied gratified

226
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:49,700
um it can come up when we feel like there's no benefit to us and whatever's happening

227
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:57,120
some people your all of us probably to some extent are really motivated when

228
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,240
we feel like we're being seen in a favorable way

229
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:10,820
um and when we don't feel that way when we don't feel like you know we're being

230
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:16,500
acknowledged or important it can be very easy to shut down

231
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:21,559
and kind of shift into a sloth and torper space

232
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:31,500
so there's a few more things to say but um I think I'll move to practice tips and I

233
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,780
kind of want it because I'm going to have you guys talk right in your small group and I want to give you room to

234
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:43,260
name some of this stuff right it's fun um

235
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:48,900
so just some simple practice tips always for me it's always the first

236
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:54,600
thing is to name it to be aware of it we have to recognize it right

237
00:24:54,600 --> 00:25:01,500
so the raft are recognize mindfulness bring awareness to it

238
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:06,960
and then the second part is the AE which is to allow it to be there so if we're struggling with it we're not going to

239
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:14,760
see it clearly we're it's like adding waves to the water we've got to find a way to allow it to be seen as it exists

240
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:19,580
already to give it space birth

241
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:28,140
um and maybe I'll save the other tips for

242
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:34,260
after you guys do a little small group discussion then we can kind of talk about that so

243
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:39,720
I think you know with five there's five of you so why don't you just be one group

244
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:46,620
you know and um you can just sort of make a little circle back there and go ahead and do

245
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,740
that you know just turn your chairs whatever I don't mean like you have to go but like just it's probably easier on that side of the

246
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,919
room

247
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:05,460
and just invite you first to go around the circle and say your names and a little bit about your relationship to

248
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:11,700
IMC or to practice where you live maybe

249
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:18,919
and then I'll give you the first question this is just sort of get to know your Dharma friends

250
00:27:50,299 --> 00:27:56,340
all right and um so let me just see how does this question

251
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:02,279
land for you guys right I'm open to we can fine tune so the first question would be kind of

252
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:07,799
how do you experience sloth and torp or just in general exploring and sharing a little bit and

253
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:13,260
um like you know think about it how it shows up in your mind how it shows up in your body and

254
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:18,360
where it shows up just sort of reflect a little bit let yourself connect with how

255
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:24,539
it comes into your life and and so just take turn turns one at a time I think

256
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:29,580
one at a time or do let me let me ask would you rather say one way and then go

257
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:37,320
to the next person and hear what they say like to help generate ideas or would you rather be able to talk by yourself just

258
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,919
for a couple of minutes and let yourself free flow what would you prefer

259
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,260
you

260
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:58,679
um I've never done this exact moment in

261
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:05,778
time before so I have no experience with this moment foreign

262
00:29:06,919 --> 00:29:13,980
okay how about we start with two rounds lightning rounds where you just drop in

263
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:20,159
one or two things that you're aware of just like a short little thing just to help you get the juices go and then the

264
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:25,440
third round each person take a little longer to say a little bit more how does that sound

265
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,799
great no I hey the hindrances show up

266
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:34,220
everywhere

267
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:03,120
uh

268
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:18,600
no pressure foreign

269
00:30:19,700 --> 00:30:26,640
I have just become much more aware recently of listening to my body and feeling things in my body and uh

270
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:31,980
certainly when I'm meditating I'm far more aware of nowadays of uh sloth and

271
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:37,860
thorpor showing up sloth showing up as kind of very imperceptible slouch

272
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:46,080
and also a fairly imperceptible change of the attitude of my my head

273
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,080
um it's only with lightning round you're next yeah here we go

274
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:58,620
um I want to know do they have to go together um no I mean that's a rhetorical

275
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:04,679
question but they don't always go together and for me it turns up a lot when things

276
00:31:04,679 --> 00:31:10,980
are too hard if I'm thinking about something and it's too hard and I don't want to deal with it so I

277
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,460
don't

278
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:24,120
yeah this one is difficult for me to identify but I think I'm gonna go with

279
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:30,419
the stuckness in a lot of my emotions where I get exhausted and then just lay

280
00:31:30,419 --> 00:31:37,940
out basically familiar shows up with uh

281
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:45,500
ruminations it's a sort of like a byproduct of those

282
00:31:46,679 --> 00:31:54,059
um I was going to say I guess this is a case where it doesn't go together but for I guess this is sloth like just

283
00:31:54,059 --> 00:32:01,740
procrastination like I'll have something running through my mind of like I gotta do this and then I just never

284
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:05,360
physically get to doing it

285
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:14,059
you could also kind of watch how far you're into the ice cream container

286
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:22,380
you're trying to avoid things um I think also with respect to torpor kind

287
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:29,039
of to your a couple of you guys have made this point again listening to my body sometimes if I'm not doing

288
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:37,200
something that I feel like I should be doing I'll start the sense uh tension in my body and it's weird because uh

289
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:44,340
tension and torp don't seem to go together but to the extent that I'm not being present with something

290
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:50,220
that I feel that I should be present with I'll actually start to feel it in my body I'll start to feel it as attention

291
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,398
foreign

292
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:03,960
because eight or nine o'clock comes at night and I don't want to deal and I lay

293
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:09,840
down on the couch and I watch watch Netflix and I don't want to talk to anybody

294
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,120
I don't I don't want to deal with anything and

295
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,159
I kind of like it it you know I don't do it during the day

296
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,500
and and then it's sort of helpful to end the day that way

297
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:31,380
so it's not all bad or a hindrance sometimes

298
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:36,960
to piggyback off of that I'm like going going all day that I experience the same

299
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:44,279
thing but also the long to-do list is waiting you're like okay well I don't have enough energy right now I'm gonna

300
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:51,120
listen and rest but am I being lazy should I do the five things that I need to get done by tomorrow

301
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,279
so that's how I experience it as well yeah for me it's uh

302
00:33:56,279 --> 00:34:01,860
usually follows an after afternoon nap and I'll lay there and just allow my

303
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:06,960
body to feel this deep sense of relaxation I

304
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:12,720
don't know if that's sloth interpret me but that it's a very nice state of like

305
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:20,398
you Susan it's a very nice state to be in and then all of a sudden the mindfulness kicks in and there's all

306
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:27,720
these things to do and uh and just step out of that and go on with

307
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:35,040
the rest of the day yeah I think similar to what everyone said I feel like I consume media a lot

308
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:41,398
to like stop thinking uh which I don't know if that's a form of torpor but then I don't

309
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:48,000
feel like it has the benefits maybe that you you said you feel like I feel like it kind of makes things worse or makes

310
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,138
me feel worse instead

311
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:01,080
sorry I'm still on the body think but I think sloth and torpart kind of go

312
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:07,400
together they they kind of happen together um

313
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:13,560
I have a I can potentially sit down and be on

314
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:18,078
YouTube for hours you know um

315
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:25,920
but what I've learned recently and you know I'll be splayed out in my couch watching nice big screen watching

316
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,680
YouTube you're familiar with us and uh I think everybody's from Netflix

317
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,260
YouTube uh what I realized recently is

318
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:43,859
if I just get up if I just stand up it changes everything and you know I'll go turn off YouTube

319
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:50,119
and I'll get on with my life I don't even know where I'm going but just the getting up

320
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:56,880
because I tell myself this is not what I want and then without any real way to kind of

321
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:03,839
think about it you know I can't think my way through it I'm in the state I'm kind of like the Tin man I'm stuck and

322
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:10,500
what I realized is I just randomly just pop up and then popping up all of a sudden the

323
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:15,960
Mind State changes and I think they happen kind of together and uh so then

324
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:22,400
both the sloth and the torpor kind of liver seed

325
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:28,440
I don't know but what what happens now

326
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,619
foreign

327
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:42,240
and it sounds like you know that nobody needs to wax on about it right so

328
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:47,520
um so then let's move to question two and question two is what I'd like to

329
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:54,680
invite you to do is to talk about activities and topics

330
00:36:54,720 --> 00:37:00,000
um Etc that bring a sense of Vitality to you and your life

331
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:05,760
and and then also to talk about maybe you should start with a for I don't know

332
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,800
where you want to go let's end with this Vitality I think but the other is and

333
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,880
what topics or activities leave you feeling dull drained or lifeless

334
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:25,619
um so what's that YouTube right that's me for sure

335
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:32,280
um so just and you can so like you know it doesn't have to be lightning but you can do it similarly and you can talk a

336
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:40,560
little more if you want to reflect and share more than one thing at once and just allow yourselves to connect but

337
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,740
um you could do maybe we do first round of what brings energy vitality and then a

338
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:55,220
second round of what brings a lack of it the opposite and then let's go back to Vitality does that sound good okay

339
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:04,920
okay so I have a dog and we walk

340
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:12,420
sometimes she looks at me like I don't want to walk but I love being outside and even if it's the same

341
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:18,000
root I'm happy to be outside and it's mostly

342
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:26,540
three times a day and sometimes it's early in the morning or later at night and during the day and it's fine with me

343
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:38,700
I too have been not trying to watch so much sports or TV or even have this TV on as background noise so I find myself

344
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:45,480
cooking or walking sitting at a park and on the bench

345
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:51,119
um reading a book or catching up with a close friend that

346
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:58,619
I haven't that I that's all my to-do list I find uh swimming is one of my favorite

347
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:06,180
activities I've swim first in the first thing in the morning not only twice a week but it's enough to

348
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:11,220
carry me through the entire week and when I start bogging down I go off

349
00:39:11,220 --> 00:39:17,220
to the gym and work out I find it a real excessive workout a good workout

350
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:23,240
it just you know it really puts a lot of energy in the body yeah

351
00:39:23,940 --> 00:39:32,040
yeah I think similar to everyone like movement definitely helps in whatever form and sometimes if I'm really like because

352
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:37,980
I'm trying to like wean myself off of like Tick Tock and the really like addictive apps so I'm like okay a

353
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:44,640
podcast is like a step down so I'll like listen to a podcast while I do some movement so at least I'm not like stuck

354
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,700
in one place um helps a little bit how many of the tick tocks have you

355
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:56,129
gone by where they remind you not to stay on [Applause]

356
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:07,140
so I take it off my phone and and then if I want to do it I'll put it on and then I take it off my phone so uh I mean

357
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:12,359
you guys have heard me say this before but um what really energizes me nowadays is

358
00:40:12,359 --> 00:40:18,960
the Arts just pursuing the Arts museums I'm now in a choir I like going

359
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:26,160
to Symphonies I like going anything that is that is performing arts I find very energizing I'm planning a trip to the

360
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,160
Getty museum this summer too which will be a hoot

361
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:39,839
so what does not energize me I have this Habit in the morning that after I walk

362
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,119
the dog while I drink my coffee I go through my emails

363
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:52,440
and then I look at Facebook and it's always so unsatisfying and I think why do I do this every day

364
00:40:52,440 --> 00:40:57,980
but it's such a habit and I have to start

365
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:04,040
yeah and there's nothing exciting I do a lot of deletes

366
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:12,540
Facebook social media Tick Tock Instagram YouTube and

367
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,700
um TV

368
00:41:18,619 --> 00:41:25,079
well uh I think with I still work quite a bit you know I should be retired but I

369
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:30,300
I enjoy what I do but there are some things that I don't enjoy that I do it

370
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:36,900
really uh it's like it's work that I don't want to

371
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:42,599
get my hands dirty with and I with my enthusiasm dries up when I when I have

372
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:46,940
and yet I still manage to get through it

373
00:41:48,180 --> 00:41:54,599
I was going to say like during the covid pandemic like work from home period I think I had like the most sloth

374
00:41:54,599 --> 00:42:01,200
interpreter that I've ever had and I have like a more physical I mean a more physical kind of field where I need to

375
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:06,720
like go into the office so during those like three months that I was at home I just

376
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:13,680
laid around all day and yeah I'm somewhat retired and there's certain

377
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:19,859
tasks also of the work that I do which is like oh God it's like you're having all my teeth

378
00:42:19,859 --> 00:42:24,859
pulled at the same time and it still has to get done

379
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,140
um I I'm a people person and although I can

380
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:44,579
be home I live alone and not talk to anybody for four days then I think and I'm not bored I think

381
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:50,460
I'm boring but I'm not bored and then I think I like the world I'm

382
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:57,900
gonna get out in the world and the other thing I do a lot is travel and that for me is um it's so everything it's

383
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:06,060
educational it's experience it's fabulous and I'm very lucky that I can do it so I'm going to Turkey

384
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,480
cool

385
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:18,440
we're back to question one question yeah

386
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:26,640
um I have found myself like getting rid of stuff that just sits there that you don't use so decluttering and also

387
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:33,380
Shifting the energy with the furniture that I have um it brings me a lot of joy

388
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:41,040
and I have nothing more to offer thanks I know I'm trying to think of things

389
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,300
um yeah I think definitely like talking to people if that's available

390
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:52,500
[Music] um another thing I've been doing recently is like instead of social media

391
00:43:52,500 --> 00:44:00,300
from my phone I'll go on like Google Maps and find like interesting restaurants or like things I'll just be

392
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:05,700
like oh cool I didn't even know this stuff existed around me I don't know if that starts to fall into like the desire

393
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:11,880
category but thank you it helps with the slot and torpor I

394
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,000
guess

395
00:44:17,280 --> 00:44:23,040
I don't know if I have another one uh I mean I like doing projects around

396
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:28,680
the house and uh I don't do them all the time but when I get started with one it's always very

397
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:34,319
energizing I just like doing projects on them when they're done I like going back and looking at them 10

398
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:38,300
times and just saying wow it wasn't that a nice job

399
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:45,119
nice and what happened to your energy just

400
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:53,119
during this time during your time sharing here

401
00:44:59,819 --> 00:45:07,760
Pleasant yes soft soft comfortable comfortable

402
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:15,060
uh-huh all right so you noticed in your body

403
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:20,220
and it was so funny because I was watching your body language from the back when I was asking about start with

404
00:45:20,220 --> 00:45:27,078
positive go to the black and you're like go back to the positive

405
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:35,220
more yeah and so and just thinking about these things affects what you feel in your body right

406
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:43,079
um yeah just just remarkable to notice that I think

407
00:45:43,079 --> 00:45:48,300
so um is there anything else you guys want to share with each other or any key

408
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:53,640
takeaways maybe just do another round with a mic just what's your take away from your

409
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:59,700
sharing your experience your own Reflections or what you heard you know how might this support you in

410
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:04,460
your practice whether it's daily life or on the cushion

411
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:16,619
um I'm not alone and that's a very important part of

412
00:46:16,619 --> 00:46:25,020
compassion self-compassion I think none of us is uh

413
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:31,260
weirdly separate and doing shut the uh you wish other people didn't see all the

414
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:39,540
time we're all in this together we're all dealing with it I think that is good for both

415
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:45,420
compassion for others and more importantly self-compassion

416
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:50,540
always passing it to you do you have to pass it somewhere else

417
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:57,540
um I think I was just going to say like coming into this session I was like oh I don't really know if I'm going to relate

418
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:04,619
that much to sloth and torper like I related a lot to like worry and anxiety from the last session because I just

419
00:47:04,619 --> 00:47:10,560
feel like that's my Baseline But like after hearing more about it and like talking about I'm like yeah I do have a

420
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:17,520
lot of that like sometimes stemming from the worry and anxiety that leads me into it which is interesting and then also

421
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:24,980
trying to avoid it it makes me go into like other hindrances which is interesting oh yeah

422
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:36,540
the one takeaway for me is just what I'm feeling at this moment is just

423
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:43,740
be more in the present moment I think that's a one of the best

424
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:50,480
um thank you enhancements for

425
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,980
getting out of that place of sloth and torp or just being the present moment as

426
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:00,800
soon as I noticed it then I take evasive action on it

427
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:07,859
um this is the most challenging hindrance for me to recognize

428
00:48:07,859 --> 00:48:13,819
I'm recognizing that um

429
00:48:13,819 --> 00:48:19,859
identifying it I mean naming it I have identified it but naming it

430
00:48:19,859 --> 00:48:26,940
the couch with Netflix you know that kind of thing it it's yeah and

431
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:33,000
um so that's always helpful to actually look at it and not just live it every

432
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:40,260
day nice just thank each other and maybe we can

433
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:45,680
come back to the semi-large Circle

434
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:59,359
all right foreign

435
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:16,260
so let me ask you would you like to do the guided practice now or would you like me to talk a little bit about some

436
00:49:16,260 --> 00:49:21,440
of the antidotes I would

437
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:27,060
antidotes okay great because it's all fresh in your mind okay

438
00:49:27,060 --> 00:49:33,540
um so before I go into that I just want to say a couple more things so one of the things that can happen is that if we

439
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:39,359
have something going on that we're not really ready to face or it feels like too much

440
00:49:39,359 --> 00:49:44,760
it's often you know soft and tarpal will arise and there can be some wisdom to

441
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:51,119
that so you know I think we have to at certain times when we know there's a lot

442
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,819
going on there can still be things being processed right so it's really keeping

443
00:49:56,819 --> 00:50:04,020
asking the question is it hindering me in some way or is it is what needed is a

444
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:12,060
little bit more Stillness right and one of the key ways to figure that out is notice after you rest do you

445
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:18,540
feel any lighter or better and if you don't and you feel heavier you probably need to be moving more if that makes

446
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:24,900
sense does that make sense Susan so this idea that again I'll repeat this

447
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:31,079
there can be times in our lives where there's something that's going on that we don't want to deal with it could be a

448
00:50:31,079 --> 00:50:39,119
task you brought up Joe like something that you don't want to do at work and so it brings up this like uh right

449
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:45,780
but you and and Gus both talked about just doing it right and you get through it and you feel better and that's a good

450
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:54,059
indicator that that's the right thing to do there can also be big things going on in our life like breakups or you know

451
00:50:54,059 --> 00:51:00,839
people dying or something like that that feel overwhelming that feel like they're it's

452
00:51:00,839 --> 00:51:07,260
almost too hard to be with it and so sometimes a result can be this sloth and torpor come up

453
00:51:07,260 --> 00:51:13,980
and sometimes I think there's some wisdom in that so but we still need to discern because

454
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:20,760
we can also go down in the sinking hole right and get really

455
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:28,020
heavy weighted and not move and not do things that we need to be doing to take care of ourselves right so

456
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:34,619
I just wanted to bring some ideas some balance and to the idea of like it's not always bad to be in sloth and torper

457
00:51:34,619 --> 00:51:41,940
right sometimes there's a needed rebalancing right or a need to kind of shut down a

458
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:48,359
little bit and part of that is due to an imbalance Susan I think what you were talking

459
00:51:48,359 --> 00:51:54,359
about you know you like to get to the end of the night and watch Netflix because you described a busy busy busy

460
00:51:54,359 --> 00:52:00,180
busy maybe there's an imbalance between effort and relaxation as we're going

461
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:06,839
about life so if we're putting in Cassandra I think you said this too right if we're put doing too much too much too much too

462
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:13,140
much we can kind of collapse into sloth and tarper and so what happens if we try and build

463
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:18,660
more balance more rest more breaks in our daily routine so we're not driving

464
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:26,520
so hard so hard and then just sort of collapse right so finding that balance between effort

465
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:31,740
and relaxation is part of the the

466
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:37,559
antidote right and you already named many of the things

467
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:43,020
I'm going to say one was just you know Gus you talked about just standing up

468
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:48,960
I have that experience you know where I'll just be like I'm just done I don't even have words for it I'm just like I

469
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:56,640
can't do this anymore you know and I just stand up or I you know turn off the TV or I shut my computer because I'm

470
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:02,880
just done right and it could be anything and and shifting

471
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,819
just changes can help change and get me out of it and like you said I don't even consent of you said it's hardest to

472
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:15,260
recognize and that's because it is that kind of a there's a there's a real heaviness of that

473
00:53:15,260 --> 00:53:20,640
inhibits our capacity to really recognize with Clarity what's going on

474
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:26,700
so some things to do are arouse energy particularly before you're going to

475
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:32,280
meditate okay so this is for an example or before you need to do something that's hard for you to do

476
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:38,339
go for a brisk walk right sit more upright

477
00:53:38,339 --> 00:53:46,559
open your eyes wash your face with cold water open a window cool down heat you know

478
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:53,160
right so and if you're you know

479
00:53:53,160 --> 00:53:58,380
can make yourself a little bit uncomfortable whatever you're doing so you're not just sinking into the couch

480
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:04,740
or sinking into your meditation cushions you know don't get too comfortable it

481
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:11,220
sort of invites that's falling asleep state another thing to do is to investigate

482
00:54:11,220 --> 00:54:17,160
drop in some questions like if I had energy now I would dot dot dot what

483
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:23,400
would you do if you had energy right now and then what is it I really want right

484
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:28,619
now like trying to sometimes we're you know we're not getting what we

485
00:54:28,619 --> 00:54:33,720
really want and we're not really acknowledging that so we're tuning out so what is it I really want or what is

486
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:39,619
it I really don't want right now like to help us name it right

487
00:54:39,619 --> 00:54:45,240
another practice is to reflect on death and dying all right

488
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:51,180
to think about you know life is short what does it mean what's the purpose and meaning in our

489
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:57,540
life and our practice so to you know reflect on the Buddha the Dharma the

490
00:54:57,540 --> 00:55:04,920
Sangha things that bring a sense of purpose inspiration and connect you with the preciousness of life

491
00:55:04,920 --> 00:55:12,660
and no matter what just keep practicing don't get up and walk away just because you're having a bout of sloth and torpor

492
00:55:12,660 --> 00:55:18,720
you know don't walk away from your practice I mean I mean walk away from your TV not your

493
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:24,420
practice any thoughts any additions anything else

494
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:32,420
you want to add Gus great just get the mic would ya

495
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:35,119
thank you

496
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:44,059
from what you said it sounds like there's a space for

497
00:55:44,059 --> 00:55:49,619
mindful sloth say more

498
00:55:49,619 --> 00:55:56,880
it's what you were saying about you may not be in the right space to be

499
00:55:56,880 --> 00:56:04,079
active but you can be mindful that what you need right now looks like a hindrance but it's not

500
00:56:04,079 --> 00:56:10,680
what you need yeah that's right and yeah and um yeah and so it's you know you know how

501
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:16,800
when there are times your energy can arise right away you know

502
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:22,920
but there might be other states and times where it's more because you end up finding out you were sick you didn't

503
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:29,880
realize you were getting sick you know so there there sometimes if your energy won't shift and you try

504
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:36,059
these things maybe you're just tired or maybe there's just too much then you need rest

505
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:41,700
yeah so it's discernment I guess it's hard to say mindful sloth and

506
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:47,579
torpora it's hard to but but mindful of it and then exploring investigating

507
00:56:47,579 --> 00:56:55,099
what's needed and how do I respond if I do this how do I respond if I do that

508
00:56:55,319 --> 00:57:02,420
that makes sense thank you anything else

509
00:57:05,400 --> 00:57:13,079
I don't know if it's my age or what but when you said you

510
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:20,880
know rest during the day and there's a balance so growing up it was like

511
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:28,319
I'll go the other way as I'm older as I'm old I have given myself permission

512
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:33,839
to nap during the day if I want I've retired a couple of years ago but I

513
00:57:33,839 --> 00:57:41,040
never would have done that ever you know the day was filled with doing

514
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:47,040
things and never would I do that and when I first started giving myself

515
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:54,180
permission to do that I thought this is great I love this yeah so it it you know

516
00:57:54,180 --> 00:58:00,059
it depends on also where you are in your life if you and now I know that people you know

517
00:58:00,059 --> 00:58:07,920
you have to be happy in your workplace and you should and there should be a balance but when I no I work you know

518
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:14,160
you just worked so it's a whole different thing I think yeah and you know different Generations

519
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:19,680
have different attitudes about it because some of the you know younger people I work with are I'm not doing

520
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:26,579
that they're like I'm not doing that I know I watch you do that no way thank you and that's what I mean it like I

521
00:58:26,579 --> 00:58:32,040
never would have said that yeah yeah but you know I mean we're all we all

522
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:37,980
have to look at our own patterns you know what is our what's the conditioning because there's also other

523
00:58:37,980 --> 00:58:43,200
things actually there are other messages people get

524
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:51,240
um that make it more okay or less okay for them to rest that you know in some parts of our you

525
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:57,299
know culture there are you know people who experience tremendous pressure

526
00:58:57,299 --> 00:59:05,339
to kind of always having to be on and to look good and be to present smart

527
00:59:05,339 --> 00:59:11,160
because they're pushing against a lot of stereotypes or other barriers in their

528
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:17,160
life so there are a lot of reasons that cause people to have various

529
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:22,940
attitudes about it whether it's okay to nap or not okay to nap and

530
00:59:22,940 --> 00:59:28,859
there's a there's been some books and writings about

531
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:34,200
um what's it the you know sort of rest as

532
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:40,260
Revolution you know rest as you know kind of a way to take back one's power

533
00:59:40,260 --> 00:59:47,460
you know so especially in the black community but

534
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:53,339
yeah any any other wonderful Reflections thoughts yeah Gus

535
00:59:53,339 --> 00:59:57,500
great little

536
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:08,640
I have a hard time with the death and dying part of it sometimes I'll think to myself you know hey

537
01:00:08,640 --> 01:00:13,740
you're 67 years old it's not like you know you have an internet amount of time left here what are you gonna do

538
01:00:13,740 --> 01:00:20,160
absolutely does not work for me it just doesn't good well it's good to know right what

539
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:26,359
what does work for you so what does inspire you guys

540
01:00:27,540 --> 01:00:34,920
that something that is not what that does to me what that does to me is it makes me

541
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:40,980
feel kind of guilty that I should be doing certain things it has a negative

542
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:46,200
connotation right thou should I should do this right

543
01:00:46,200 --> 01:00:52,920
it doesn't work for me so yeah it has to be positive it has to be onward leading I have a hard time with

544
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:59,220
that one yeah I just wanted to comment thank you yeah and you know none of these are um

545
01:00:59,220 --> 01:01:05,040
you know the answers for everybody right and this is the beauty of the Buddhist teaching

546
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:10,500
it's about trying and then reflecting

547
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:18,180
you know I love the teaching that the Buddha gave to rahula right this is his son his son was pretty young

548
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:26,400
and maybe had lied to somebody and so the Buddha gave him a talking and said you know rahula before you speak reflect

549
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:31,680
and think about whether this might cause harm to yourself others or both

550
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:38,339
and then during your speaking rahula reflect is is what I'm saying causing harm to

551
01:01:38,339 --> 01:01:44,700
myself to others or both and then after I'm done speaking reflect

552
01:01:44,700 --> 01:01:51,180
again because you know we our awareness can change over that period of time

553
01:01:51,180 --> 01:01:57,720
and so this practice is really about like it's not just about intentions it's

554
01:01:57,720 --> 01:02:06,540
not just about doing what you're told to do but reflect learn as you go along notice and there's never it's like the

555
01:02:06,540 --> 01:02:11,579
effort and the things we need to do are always changing because our conditions are changing

556
01:02:11,579 --> 01:02:18,540
what we need one day we might need a different something another day and we have to keep not going into automatic

557
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:24,960
pilot that takes us away from the vibrancy of our life but keep checking in keep

558
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:30,599
reflecting listening noticing the impact

559
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:36,000
yeah okay let's do raft at this point it'll

560
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:43,980
be fairly short so so the raft is the recognize allow

561
01:02:43,980 --> 01:02:49,079
feel tease apart and then trust my extra T is

562
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:54,599
trusting and you don't have to go through the whole

563
01:02:54,599 --> 01:03:01,680
thing again it might be that it's enough just to recognize something so don't try and

564
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:08,099
make something happen in your practice right allow yourself to notice what's

565
01:03:08,099 --> 01:03:11,599
happening as we practice

566
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:19,319
so taking a moment to fill your body feel your feet

567
01:03:19,319 --> 01:03:29,180
kind of be the snow globe that got set down let the snow flakes come to settle

568
01:03:29,700 --> 01:03:37,578
coming home connecting with the present moment

569
01:03:52,559 --> 01:04:00,380
so this is uh going to be an interesting thing right to try and practice with Sloth and torpor which

570
01:04:00,380 --> 01:04:06,720
can be hard to be aware of so let's see if we can

571
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:12,740
do it from a perspective of kind of more of the observing mind

572
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:19,740
so just drop in the question and see if your mind can offer you a memory

573
01:04:19,740 --> 01:04:25,020
of a time where you really didn't have energy you didn't have

574
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:30,599
mental Clarity you didn't have the mindfulness where you were kind of in that sinking

575
01:04:30,599 --> 01:04:38,420
space and remember you're here now as you see this memory

576
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:49,740
and if you could just wiggle your fingers to let me know when you've got something in mind so I know

577
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:53,480
one it's okay to shift

578
01:05:02,940 --> 01:05:10,140
okay I think I think I got all fingers wiggled so just seeing this moment in your

579
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:15,540
history your experience whether it was recent or not just kind of seeing it as

580
01:05:15,540 --> 01:05:22,260
clearly as possible recognizing the lighting the time of day

581
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:29,940
the location notice what's happening notice of you yawn or start to feel sleepy just even

582
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:36,299
being aware of that as you start to check in notice how your body's feeling as you're

583
01:05:36,299 --> 01:05:39,200
bringing it to mind

584
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:47,579
and can you practice the recognition

585
01:05:47,579 --> 01:05:54,119
like I see you and you know can is it feel right to say

586
01:05:54,119 --> 01:06:00,859
I see you sloth and torpor I see you lack of energy I see you boredom

587
01:06:00,859 --> 01:06:05,940
disinterest whatever it is that feels like naming looking in the

588
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:11,119
eyes of this energy seeing it

589
01:06:12,059 --> 01:06:16,220
in such a way that it feels seen

590
01:06:25,319 --> 01:06:30,960
and then there's a movement here when when the time is right to this ability

591
01:06:30,960 --> 01:06:35,960
to allow that experience to be there

592
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:42,720
so it's not endorsing it it's not like jumping in that pool

593
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:48,119
saying this is great and it's not saying it's bad

594
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:53,579
it's just saying allowing yourself to sense and be with this experience with

595
01:06:53,579 --> 01:07:01,260
as much mindfulness as possible right now and if there's resistance to it ask

596
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:08,339
yourself if it's needed maybe it's helping a little bit not fall into the sinking hole of it

597
01:07:08,339 --> 01:07:14,599
if it's not needed maybe invite the resistance to relax

598
01:07:18,900 --> 01:07:25,619
and as there's willingness in the system moving to feeling it in the body

599
01:07:25,619 --> 01:07:33,480
moving away from the stories or the imagery and noticing maybe a body scan

600
01:07:33,480 --> 01:07:40,319
of How It's impacting the energy in your body starting at the top of the head and

601
01:07:40,319 --> 01:07:44,720
noticing the forehead the eyes

602
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:51,140
the jaw the neck

603
01:07:51,839 --> 01:07:57,599
shoulders feeling if there's a heaviness about

604
01:07:57,599 --> 01:08:02,420
wanting to lean forward or back or

605
01:08:02,700 --> 01:08:09,980
just continuing to move down the body your own time

606
01:08:17,819 --> 01:08:23,060
trying to be as aware of possible in the present moment

607
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:37,219
connecting with the experience not the story as much as possible

608
01:08:42,839 --> 01:08:46,040
and when you're ready

609
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:55,798
when they're you know when there's Clarity or if you need to bring a little more energy into the practice the next

610
01:08:55,799 --> 01:09:02,699
part would be to allow this space maybe a big table

611
01:09:02,699 --> 01:09:09,838
of chairs and a room and allow the different parts

612
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:15,600
that are coming together to make and create this experience of

613
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:22,278
sloth and torpor to have their own seat at the table

614
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:31,020
I'm just first naming whatever seems obvious we don't need to pull on the

615
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:39,140
strings more we allow space for things to unfold to reveal themselves

616
01:09:50,219 --> 01:09:56,699
and just pulling back if you can in your mind's eye a little bit just to have that bird's eye view of that moment in

617
01:09:56,699 --> 01:10:05,300
time bird's eye view of the ability to see what led up to what contributed

618
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:13,320
thoughts feelings beliefs people situations lack of sleep

619
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:20,660
just allowing those things to be seen and invited to sit at the table

620
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:37,440
there's nothing that can't be here right this this practice is about

621
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:46,199
allowing ourselves to be with not consumed by not collapsing into

622
01:10:46,199 --> 01:10:50,658
but allowing things to have their own space

623
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:05,540
and as you look around the table

624
01:11:07,020 --> 01:11:12,480
let's drop in the question to the room is there anything you need me to know

625
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,580
about you do any of these visitors

626
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,119
is there anything I need to know about you

627
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:41,100
and as much as possible having a the grace and the capacity to appreciate

628
01:11:41,100 --> 01:11:45,380
each part and whatever it has to share

629
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:09,659
at some point here maybe reflect on what shifted and changed that allowed this

630
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,920
experience to change

631
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:24,179
that shifted and changed that helped the energy and the life force kind of come

632
01:12:24,179 --> 01:12:26,600
back in

633
01:12:41,820 --> 01:12:47,840
and what in this practice was useful for you

634
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:59,100
can you trust the practice let me trust the Insight or that these

635
01:12:59,100 --> 01:13:03,440
things come and go their states

636
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:19,800
and lots of times with the trusting part of raft it's like I suggest you kind of

637
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:25,020
imagine that laying back and this practice with soft and torper

638
01:13:25,020 --> 01:13:29,719
I'm going to invite you to imagine standing up

639
01:13:30,480 --> 01:13:35,520
reaching your arms to the sky taking a deep breath

640
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:43,280
looking around being in nature

641
01:13:51,179 --> 01:13:56,699
and then to look back in at the table and just see how these eyes see

642
01:13:56,699 --> 01:13:59,780
the situation

643
01:14:11,699 --> 01:14:17,159
and if there's a sense of appreciation for your effort for your practice

644
01:14:17,159 --> 01:14:22,940
maybe about to yourself to your heart your mind for

645
01:14:22,940 --> 01:14:30,080
relieving really revealing revealing whatever was revealed

646
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:46,620
laughs [Music]

647
01:14:55,140 --> 01:15:03,080
so recognize allow which is not the same as endorsing

648
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:11,340
it's acknowledging and allowing something that already exists to be seen and felt it's already there

649
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:18,659
it's to then maybe if there's too much resistance to what's there to recognize

650
01:15:18,659 --> 01:15:24,659
the resistance and then allow the resistance to be felt

651
01:15:24,659 --> 01:15:31,320
I kind of see it like there's this thing and if I'm resisting it the resistance

652
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:38,219
gets between knee my awareness and the thing so instead of trying to do this

653
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:44,820
with the thing I work with the resistance just turning toward whatever resistance

654
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:50,040
is there and and kind of then you could just practice with that or it dissipates and

655
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:55,320
you're able to connect more with the thing from there we move to feeling it in the

656
01:15:55,320 --> 01:16:02,940
body right allowing ourselves to get in touch with how this experience this thought is

657
01:16:02,940 --> 01:16:09,840
impacting our physical self and then to allow whatever's unfolding

658
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:16,679
in this process to kind of have its own room and space at this table with this imaginary room and

659
01:16:16,679 --> 01:16:24,020
the idea of the room being big enough for whatever needs to be there

660
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:30,659
and the trust to me is a reminder that things are impermanent this is an experience it's not me it's

661
01:16:30,659 --> 01:16:37,320
not who I am and that suffering actually is a guide

662
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:43,620
and if we can turn toward the suffering we we have a capacity to be free like

663
01:16:43,620 --> 01:16:48,960
pulling the curtain back we have the capacity to learn

664
01:16:48,960 --> 01:16:54,300
to move toward freedom so that was the practice

665
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:59,880
how was it working with Sloth and torpor in this practice

666
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:05,159
what would you say a word or more than about it Susan there's the mic right at

667
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:07,280
your

668
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:17,760
it was really interesting I felt myself resisting

669
01:17:17,880 --> 01:17:23,040
that I was sitting up straighter instead of folding into myself which I felt that

670
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:28,080
day and I thought I'm sitting up I'm not there I'm not

671
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:34,519
giving in and how did that change what happened

672
01:17:34,679 --> 01:17:41,460
it did I mean how did it change what happened yeah

673
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:46,560
sitting up and not giving in oh it felt powerful it felt powerful

674
01:17:46,560 --> 01:17:51,260
great thank you

675
01:17:51,900 --> 01:17:58,199
I was really moved by this raft image immediately popped in my head of

676
01:17:58,199 --> 01:18:05,280
something that has been really traumatic for me in the last three months and but the beauty of it like at the end I was

677
01:18:05,280 --> 01:18:10,320
out in nature with a picnic blanket with all of the things that wanted to be

678
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:14,840
there it was very moving and touching

679
01:18:19,080 --> 01:18:23,480
did he'd be interested to hear how it was for you

680
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:31,560
um I think uh if I remember right you said to like remember a previous kind of

681
01:18:31,560 --> 01:18:38,100
memory which I feel like was easier for me than doing something current yeah

682
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:44,159
um for sure and I feel like um even like yeah looking at something that

683
01:18:44,159 --> 01:18:49,860
maybe I kind of dismissed or like I was like okay that's over so I'm not going to think about it anymore and kind of

684
01:18:49,860 --> 01:18:56,940
like definitely like like when we did the table thing I was like oh there's like six different things I could name that

685
01:18:56,940 --> 01:19:04,140
were like contributing to like me shutting down in that moment beautiful um so that was really helpful beautiful

686
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:09,300
so you know how I I didn't say it tonight because I was kind of tailoring

687
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:15,840
for this particular hindrance but to when we do this practice to make sure it's not going to overwhelm whatever

688
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:21,600
we're practicing with practice with what we can be with and it's never too late to practice with

689
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:27,179
anything because even as we're having a memory we're having an experience in the

690
01:19:27,179 --> 01:19:33,659
present moment and there's a way to process that experience in the present moment even

691
01:19:33,659 --> 01:19:38,820
though we can't go back and change time you know so choosing something that's

692
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:44,880
historical that's not as intense if that's what works it works so I'm

693
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:48,139
really glad you had that experience

694
01:19:50,340 --> 01:19:53,540
yeah gus please

695
01:19:56,820 --> 01:20:02,640
um these five probably don't happen on their own right there

696
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:10,579
yeah absolutely they're mixed right absolutely um I was thinking that

697
01:20:10,620 --> 01:20:18,620
there seems to be some relationship between aversion and sloth and torpor and

698
01:20:18,620 --> 01:20:25,320
clinging and restlessness right and doubt also probably is associated

699
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:30,719
with Sloth and torpor so maybe I mean does this make sense that if you're

700
01:20:30,719 --> 01:20:37,500
feeling yourself in a state of sloth and torpart do you could you reasonably ask yourself

701
01:20:37,500 --> 01:20:42,840
what are you being aversive to right now what are you doubting right now yes but

702
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:49,020
I would say it's not just those things right because actually excessive

703
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:57,659
Desiring can lead to a shutting down and soft and Harper right and doubt can lead to restlessness

704
01:20:57,659 --> 01:21:03,000
and worry so there's there's not it's not one

705
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:09,060
directional or but it's Dynamic and so always it it's good to ask those kinds

706
01:21:09,060 --> 01:21:15,540
of questions but don't make assumptions exactly about oh you know that one-to-one correlation

707
01:21:15,540 --> 01:21:22,080
yeah and it might be a pairing that's very consistent for you but even then don't lock in that it's

708
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:26,840
okay right oh that's good yeah

709
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:36,900
so we're almost at the end and

710
01:21:36,900 --> 01:21:42,239
um you know I just want to invite you to continue to play and experiment with

711
01:21:42,239 --> 01:21:50,520
your effort what you bring to your practice all right um and that idea of more space or less

712
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:55,920
space right so in terms of the restlessness and worries they're too

713
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:03,360
much tightness construction do I need more space if there's a lot of lack and I bring a little bit more tension or

714
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:08,780
uprightness to to what's happening right now to my attention

715
01:22:08,780 --> 01:22:14,280
and you might even like actually deliberately practice with like way too

716
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:20,699
much energy and then not enough energy just playfully exploring what happens

717
01:22:20,699 --> 01:22:26,599
you know just seeing in real life what happens in you

718
01:22:26,699 --> 01:22:32,760
um so thank you for your practice your

719
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:39,300
participation your sharing so Delight I look forward to our final week next week

720
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:46,500
talking about doubt and the kind of big ta-da with the Wizard of Oz so thank you

721
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:50,719
so much with
