1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:06,319
um yeah good to be with you good to uh come back and practice kind of um you

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:13,440
know just the rhythms of a weekly thing just okay check in with our heart now

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,160
how is it to be alive now

4
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:28,000
so friend of mine Dharma friend fellow teacher

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:35,960
um said something like um she's very direct with me and she's always right so

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:42,718
she can kind of say whatever but she said

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,960
uh some people like the in breath some people like the out

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:56,440
breath you like the in breath like okay what does that mean I

9
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:04,198
thought I like the out breath I thought I like relaxation I thought I like Tranquility I thought I liked non

10
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:09,520
vigilance but she said no no there's

11
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:14,720
some int you like the intensity you know

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,479
and um there's some part of you that's very ambivalent about actually relaxing

13
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:27,479
at a deep level kind of took that in

14
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,360
okay maybe so what's maturity in

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,799
practice I think it's coming to love the in breath and the out

16
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:46,920
breath the kind of vitalizing energy intensity of the in

17
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:52,000
breath and the soothing surrender ease

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:59,880
of the out breath no control and we maybe all have a a pred

19
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,560
ction you know um where we're more comfortable

20
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:11,160
perhaps but some of what we're doing is uh learning

21
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:18,959
to um to Revel in the in breath and revel in the out breath to Revel in

22
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:26,200
alertness to Revel in surrender and tranquility and we can do that I think

23
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:34,400
at um at Great depth you know I do kind of know how to relax I do talk about

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:42,400
surrender right but we're always beckoned to let go more deeply to wake

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:50,080
up more brightly so let's um let's find our way

26
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:58,280
uh between this uh enlivening and soothing rhythms of uh

27
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,840
our body breathing

28
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:10,680
so finding your uh your posture just

29
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:17,480
uh getting cozy

30
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,480
getting

31
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,760
bright

32
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,760
e e

33
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,400
we breathe

34
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:56,400
in kind of Rush of energy into body and mind

35
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:19,360
sense of brightness and not wanting to to miss our lives it's possible

36
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:26,080
actually very possible to miss our lives

37
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,929
the in breath helps break the [Music]

38
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,600
monotony the Assumption of

39
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:02,639
permanence brings a certain kind of poignancy into our lives e

40
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:45,400
but the in breath must uh end

41
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,479
sometime sense the tension of having

42
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,520
a used the o

43
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:20,198
oygen and then uh soothing the Opera

44
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:37,319
it's almost like breathing out the

45
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:46,960
vigilance and the fear in the sense that it's

46
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:53,120
irresponsible to neglect our worry

47
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,440
concern Breathe It Out

48
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,479
e e

49
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:07,760
all the subtle ways we try to grab hold of

50
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,320
Life of this

51
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,920
moment all the subtle impulses towards

52
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:31,360
ownership we breathe out

53
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320

54
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320

e e

57
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:06,880
the cycle of breath the in breath

58
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,560
the perfect complement to the out

59
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:26,440
breath out breath a compliment to the in breath

60
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,439
Moment by

61
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:48,800
moment

62
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,360
Clarity release

63
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,120
brightness and darkness

e e

70
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:23,240
letting the out breath wash away the impulse of uh becoming bat

71
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:35,280
tanha copying and pasting our being into the next

72
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,039
moment just a little

73
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,960
better we breathe

74
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:58,400
out the softening and becoming

75
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,039
the in

76
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:21,158
breath we shake off the notion that

77
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:30,760
uh this moments just a dress rehearsal for the rest of our life

78
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:45,240
sense uh the the

79
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,480
vividness The Human

80
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Condition

81
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720

e e

90
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:13,640
can feel like when we're meditating some our life is elsewhere our real

91
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:21,279
life lies in the other 23 hours of the

92
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:34,520
day but it will only ever be in breath and out

93
00:24:36,919 --> 00:24:40,919
breath thought and

94
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,080
feeling seeing and hearing

95
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:06,320
in this sense uh this is our

96
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
life

97
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

98
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

99
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

100
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
e e

101
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
e e

102
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:36,519
okay it's good to uh to sit with

103
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:44,120
you um so in meditation practice

104
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:49,559
we sometimes talk about the the aperture of

105
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:59,159
attention uh if we think about um think about uh attention as a

106
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:08,720
spotlight you know the question would be how wide is that Spotlight and focusing on our breathing

107
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:17,919
at the tip of the nose say is a narrow aperture right whereas doing open to all six sense

108
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:24,120
Gates doing choiceless awareness that's uh large large

109
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:31,559
aperture and um with um with our with the pupil if our eyes brains working

110
00:30:31,559 --> 00:30:39,679
okay you know when there's a lot of light the pupil contracts when you enter a dark room pupil

111
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:48,399
dilates right and there's no rule for when to meditatively to adjust the

112
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:55,080
aperture no algorithm for exactly how to do that but

113
00:30:55,080 --> 00:31:04,799
generally excuse me generally in the process of settling in settling into Tranquility

114
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:12,080
Clarity um we make the aperture small you know and it's like the rest of

115
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:19,760
the world of experience is is too much it's too much light too much light it's

116
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,080
too sticky too open to it is to be pulled

117
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,919
under and the changing and uncertainty is um is

118
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:38,559
intense and so we need a kind of smaller pasture we need to perceive to

119
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:44,039
see less and the risk of going too wide to

120
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:50,279
early is that the line dividing awareness and thinking can get

121
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:56,559
quite fuzzy and so when we start um a retreat

122
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:04,360
or or even just starting starting a Sit sitting um on one's own or in a group we

123
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:09,880
often begin with a kind of with the breathing or with some kind of um

124
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:16,080
limited narrow aperture and then when there's some

125
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:22,799
stability when phenomena are a little less

126
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:28,600
intoxicating maybe we open wider and

127
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:34,519
so there's this sense of uh of of space

128
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:40,399
expanding Contracting and it's not a hierarchy you

129
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:47,720
know of this is the beginners phase and this is the advance it's not like

130
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:54,480
that as we cultivate our uh our practice we we find we can

131
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:02,320
move easily between the kind of comfortable

132
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:08,440
secluded home of the narrow to the

133
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:15,679
open homeless centerless of uh of

134
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,960
awareness and um this Dynamic this kind of

135
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:27,919
like what's why's attention now in my practice um

136
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,880
that uh that same Dynamic it strikes me that our life our life in the broader

137
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:38,919
sense not just meditation functions a little bit like

138
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:47,440
that what's the kind of aperture for the rest of our our

139
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:55,120
day we open and we uh we close you know

140
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:00,360
we're um in in the world and we Retreat we

141
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:07,240
love and we rest and what's the the kind of rhythm

142
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:13,040
of um the small and vast aperture in our

143
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:19,158
lives to what ought we attend where do we draw the line around the kind of

144
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:25,878
focus space in this moment or on this day right we draw the line around tip of

145
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:32,960
our nose maybe in one sit or around the body in a Sit well around

146
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:38,000
what are we drawing that um that line on

147
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,440
this day and I think typically we Buddhist types

148
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:54,398
have the assumption that our life its scope of concern needs to be expansive feels like contraction is just

149
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:02,040
self-absorption the small aperture to cannot pay attention in a sense to

150
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:07,800
samsara that's that's a species of self-absorption

151
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:16,320
and um and we have the sense that maybe when we're grinding or there's something

152
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:23,280
some internal friction we're struggling in some way we tend to get small and I

153
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:31,079
think that's true that suffering is inherently absorbing um and then we have the sense of like

154
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:36,640
okay we feel better we open the aperture the big aperture we tend to

155
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:42,200
think is compassion caring for others for the world for

156
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,400
society I get that fair enough fair enough but I think we want to be careful

157
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:56,160
in concluding that the contractive energy is bad and the expansive energy

158
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:03,200
is good the question is much more like what is skillful what is

159
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:12,280
skillful we do grow over time so that the our life the self system it absorbs

160
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:18,359
less energy it absorbs less energy and it's natural for us to turn outwards you

161
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:25,599
know when the when the the self is not such a preoccupation the project of our life is

162
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,680
not such a preoccupation The Gaze naturally turns

163
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,359
outwards but um everyone sometimes needs to get small

164
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:44,119
and that's actually not a sign of cowardice but

165
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:49,560
Health to simplify the rhythms of our life and to focus

166
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:54,920
what's right here just this book or this

167
00:36:54,920 --> 00:37:02,680
nap or this person or this whatever this TV show and so that the sense of like oh

168
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:09,720
it's a sin to get small to take our gaze off of some

169
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:16,720
Sor I don't know right just like it's not meditation

170
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,520
detention to go back to the breathing the Buddha went back to it

171
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:30,280
very often right and some times it's um it's

172
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:36,640
very skillful to be small when the alternative of open

173
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:43,680
awareness is overwhelm and confusion it's skillful to get small

174
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:52,240
when any attempt to open runs into a kind of debilitating

175
00:37:53,200 --> 00:38:00,079
helplessness and um and it feels like okay you should be able to do something but

176
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,560
you just can't see how that's not like a productive way of suffering it's not an

177
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:12,720
efficient way of spending your

178
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:20,280
love right marinating in certain cyclical forms of

179
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,400
pain is not onward leading narrow the aperture back to the breath

180
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:35,520
metaphorically and so I um I say this in in part

181
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:43,839
because you know I um I want to be careful you know like how much of the

182
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:51,119
ignorance coursing through the country's veins gets into my

183
00:38:51,880 --> 00:38:59,760
bloodstream and I only want to take that into my bloodstream if it will help

184
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,000
others and I fear that much of the time it does

185
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:12,079
not uh and so in in

186
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:20,599
2016 without knowing it I was sort of like trying to do Tong Len at the

187
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:28,480
national level that was not an explicit thing and I don't even know how to practice Tong Len really I a year

188
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:33,720
practicing in tibetan tradition when I first started practice I don't know the

189
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:40,680
practice but the the sense of like breathing in the pain breathing out

190
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:46,160
love I was trying to do it and failing

191
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,720
mostly failing not only failing but mostly

192
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:56,960
failing and it was like okay narrow the

193
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:59,318
app

194
00:40:02,599 --> 00:40:09,280
now there are other times when perhaps counterintuitive when meeting one's own

195
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,760
distress or smallness actually requires that we get much much

196
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:21,200
bigger right it's like I I think of that example sometimes people early in

197
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:29,240
recovery from addiction are given the instruction like go Ser care as out of your

198
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:36,359
mind you know heal yourself through giving

199
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:42,680
right and so sometimes we address our our depletion through love through

200
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:50,040
getting bigger right and the aperture actually needs to expand

201
00:40:51,319 --> 00:41:03,040
radically but we want to look look for the ways to uh to spend spend one's love

202
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,839
wisely now nothing I'm saying about

203
00:41:08,839 --> 00:41:16,240
um the contractive side of practice of just pulling the energy in is about

204
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,359
passivity or resignation it's not that I'll be in the

205
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:28,520
streets you know like I was but um we want to be careful with

206
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:38,040
our mind you know and um we we want to be uh respectful of the

207
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:43,079
limits of our equinity and the ways in which we subtly

208
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:50,920
devolve into a certain kind of marinating in pain rather than holding

209
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:59,920
it in Awareness metabolizing it and that line gets fuzzy gets fuzzy

210
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:05,400
sometimes so we're careful

211
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:14,880
careful small aperture wide contraction dilation rest and love and

212
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:22,040
service we look you know what's wise attention now

213
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:30,319
what's appropriate attention now given the state of my heart given what's needed given my

214
00:42:30,319 --> 00:42:37,000
energy given my stability what's why's attention

215
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,480
now offer this for your consideration and uh we'll keep going

216
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,960
I'll be here uh next week is holiday week for some but I I'll be

217
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:55,359
uh I'll be traveling but I'll be uh I'll be online next week with you all if you

218
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:00,480
wish to join and um yeah I wish you all a good uh

219
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:06,640
week of of practice and all the rest okay
