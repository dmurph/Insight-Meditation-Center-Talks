1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,720
thank you so much so in the beginning I invited you

2
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,840
to take a snapshot of how things were and so I invite you again to take a

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:17,799
snapshot like how's your heart your mind your body in this

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:26,760
moment this is such a simple practice to to redirect the attention back to the

5
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,640
present moment that we can do at any time what's happening in the

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,480
mind how's the heart how's the body so one of the things that's

7
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:45,039
important to me is supporting people in practice in meditation practice and and

8
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,800
to that end I'm wondering if there's anyone new to the center is there anyone here that's here for the first time oh

9
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:58,280
welcome welcome welcome yeah so this is my first time

10
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:04,280
too it's my first time teaching here I've been here I think the last time I was thinking the last time I was here

11
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:12,080
was um oh uh who was

12
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:19,360
here oh it's gone now was a

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:24,640
monastic and um but this is many many years ago like eight years ago or

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,920
something nine years ago so and and anybody newer to meditation practice

15
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:38,759
ice anybody else newer to meditation practice yeah yeah okay yeah I was

16
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,399
pretty still in here I'm like ah people know what they're

17
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:54,280
doing and you know at many points during

18
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,399
our you know know our spiritual Journeys or our meditation Journeys

19
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,680
there are places that get a little sticky aren't there maybe there's things that happen in our meditation we're like

20
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,720
what do I do with this you know it and it can be like difficult places in the

21
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,080
mind but also when our hearts start to open and expand it can feel really

22
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:27,200
uncomfortable like what's happening I remember this visceral experience that I had like of settling into practice and

23
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:32,720
being so open I'm like oh I don't want like it it felt so

24
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,879
vulnerable right and so I had to go to my teacher and say what well one what is

25
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:44,920
this what's happening I don't like it right and then how do I meet

26
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:51,000
it so I just want to give just a few minutes for a couple of questions if

27
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,200
there's any places in your practice that you notice today or maybe this week is you've been practicing where there's

28
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,480
some stickiness or something arising that you're not quite sure what to do

29
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:12,200
with or that's hard to meet and it might take some bravery in

30
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:17,519
this this group but so this wasn't recently but I do remember sitting some

31
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,560
years ago and a wave of Rage crashed over me and I've always

32
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:31,400
been afraid of anger and yet like I survived what I didn't think that could

33
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,959
happen and so I think there are a lot of surprises yeah in practice there are so many surprises in practice yeah yeah

34
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:41,959
thank you thank

35
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,280
you okay I'm with an expert group no problems in meditation you

36
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:58,000
dropped right in you're like I'm good the mind stayed steady it didn't go to

37
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,799
the Future it didn't go to the Past didn't get caught up in fantasy

38
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:12,120
amazing uh now I get caught up and all of that my my mind often is racing at uh

39
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:20,840
100 miles an hour and um I I try to sit comfortably and let that let that happen

40
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:27,919
um I think where I get a little stuck in this maybe you can help me uh would be

41
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:34,919
trying to understand when I'm trying to or maybe trying is the wrong term when

42
00:04:34,919 --> 00:04:42,560
I'm sitting and letting these thoughts roll one after the other through my mind

43
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:50,680
at a pace um uh I feel that uh I'm one

44
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:55,800
uping myself in a certain sense right I'm

45
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:02,039
observing with kindness these ideas that are rolling through my

46
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:08,039
mind sorry I'm observing these uh ideas that are rolling through my mind at a

47
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:14,320
great Pace I'm trying to understand a little bit who's the

48
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,720
Observer um am I just W uping myself into studen scene so maybe you could

49
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,880
comment on that or or help me understand that a little yeah who's the Observer it's such a good

50
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:33,120
question um and and I think there are some questions that are living

51
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:39,680
questions um which is the teacher speak for saying I'm not going to answer the question

52
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,360
like and and but I what I will do is it's watch the mind getting caught in

53
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:53,600
trying to figure out who the Observer is while you're practicing can we simply

54
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:59,080
know oh there there is something someone that we're calling Observer

55
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:04,600
knowing the arising of experience knowing the thoughts arising knowing

56
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,520
what you're calling a racing mind right and and and can you include

57
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:17,960
it all can you include the the trying to figure it all out and then come back to

58
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:25,080
Simply knowing direct experience oh thinking oh racing oh wanting to figure it out and

59
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:34,240
then we can go a little bit deeper and see is there in the wanting to figure it out something that that is uneasy in not

60
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,759
knowing right and can we meet that with a lot of kindness oh dear one yeah of course you want to know because maybe

61
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,919
this is a way that keeps us safe can I be in that disease and you know in this way we we

62
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,319
drop deeper and deeper and deeper and and get to some

63
00:06:52,360 --> 00:07:01,520
both like like some discernment about how to be with and um

64
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:07,440
like some refinement in in how to be and what to

65
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,919
be with right is that is that helpful at all very yes okay thank you all right

66
00:07:12,919 --> 00:07:19,360
good thank you so any other questions specifically about practice yeah thank

67
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:24,400
you good morning hi I have trouble sometimes giving myself permission to

68
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,120
settle on one thing when I'm practicing I will kind of um

69
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,800
you know let the mind go at the beginning and see where it wants to settle and then when it does I have

70
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:40,879
trouble saying it's okay to stay here and examine it

71
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:52,639
closely what what what is the thought that you should be doing like what um I

72
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,120
think part of it is is there something more important or is there something

73
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:03,879
that is making me a obsess about this in particular rather than approaching it

74
00:08:03,879 --> 00:08:11,479
with more kindness and less judgment and accepting that it might be important for me to examine yeah yeah yeah we won't

75
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:17,440
know unless we check it out will we so there's that part

76
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:26,479
um but also there's this like you know this indecision we we

77
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:32,279
can call that a hindrance of doubt right and and so we want to recognize doubt

78
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:38,719
quickly and drop it and and then stay and there to might be something like it

79
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:46,959
might be a little hard and so there might be something protecting like I don't I we're not

80
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:54,760
ready right and so we also have to honor that yeah and and so if there's really a

81
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:00,279
we're not ready what can we what can we support

82
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:06,079
that will help us get ready like what can we incline to and so maybe we need

83
00:09:06,079 --> 00:09:13,839
to stick with some loving kindness practice for a little while oh yeah okay

84
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:20,160
um and then and then go check it out and and here's the thing with practice sometimes we think we have to go to the

85
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,680
I'm going to fix myself I'm going to go in to the hardest thing and I'm going to

86
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,760
make it okay by by changing it and figuring it out and getting rid of it is

87
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:37,560
that our practice Yeah so some people are saying yeah that is what I do but is that our

88
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:42,720
practice right our practice is to be with things the way they are like to

89
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,120
meet them with a lot of kindness you know and sometimes we're ready and and

90
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:53,360
so then there's many skillful ways to to go in and go out we can go to someplace

91
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:01,120
neutral in the body right and just rest there and and get some steady of mind

92
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:08,279
right and then go check it out with real real gently and then we can come back

93
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:14,519
you know or rest our attention where like where it's easy

94
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,880
where there's some peace or joy and then come back and check it out like it it's

95
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:26,920
not supportive it's not I don't know I don't think it's such a good use of time to just like go in and yeah and it's not

96
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:33,200
so kind right yeah thank you thank you

97
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:40,600
yeah okay there's another question how do you recognize when your

98
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:47,040
mind is about to slip um without giving into it so how do you

99
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,480
recognize it and kind of like stay in the present

100
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:58,959
yeah um how do you recognize so so are you saying by how do you recognize the mind is going to slip how do you Rec the

101
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:09,519
mind ni the mind is about to go into thought without it like indulging in that thought yeah yeah with a lot of

102
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:16,839
practice Yeah and and and watch if there's any belief that the mind's supposed to

103
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:22,320
be doing something else and any judgment about it slipping and include that too

104
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:29,480
right the the mind what does it do it thinks thank goodness like it's so helpful for us to get through our lives

105
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,560
right so the mind will go off this way and this way and this way and and our

106
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:40,000
whole practice is recognizing when it's gone off and then coming back right and

107
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:47,000
at some point we take it as an object too right we can include all of it but it's but I want to say it's not a

108
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:55,240
problem right it's not a problem this is what the Mind does let's include that too yeah and and and you can notice at

109
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:01,040
some point like oh it's about to go right and be like whoop nope and it also

110
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,480
becomes less interesting and then it's not like there's not us doing it the mind just stays there's some steadiness

111
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:13,800
that's a possibility okay and a follow-up question often times when I found that uh when I find out my mind is

112
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:20,360
slipped and I'm uh not in the present i' like to trace my thoughts backwards to figure out where it got distracted is

113
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,600
that helpful or and maybe it's more thinking yeah okay yeah yeah I think it

114
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:33,519
is helpful maybe to to to know where it went and and notice patterns like gen General patterns oh planning right right

115
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:39,120
and then and then we can come back and notice like oh is there something is there a worry here like that is I think

116
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:44,160
coming back to the body and saying oh what's here what's What's um maybe the

117
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:50,480
the mind is helping solve or avoiding right I think that is a more useful way

118
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:56,600
yeah thank you you thanks okay maybe that's good for now I have this piece of paper that I'm going to pull out with

119
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:00,360
some notes on it

120
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:07,760
and then we'll see what happens isn't that what we're always

121
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,399
doing we're just seeing what happens our minds our

122
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:24,160
hearts at the top it says refinement and discernment right

123
00:13:31,399 --> 00:13:38,480
and so it's so heartening to be here with you you know I still haven't except for

124
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:45,519
um at Retreat centers you I teach at Spirit Rock and IMS and another Retreat Center called Vitos which is in the New

125
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,680
Mexico Northern New Mexico

126
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:58,199
um a lot of groups aren't in person yet still right and so it's really a joy to

127
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:03,959
be in person I don't take it for granted you

128
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,959
know

129
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:20,160
um and it says like oh there's something that you all came for I hope it wasn't

130
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:28,480
me [Music] um but there's something that that calls

131
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:36,440
us or or or maybe in the beginning of my practice I was a Seeker like there just

132
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:45,040
was something that wasn't working in my life right I had a lot of anger

133
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:53,279
and fear and doubt sadness and grief and

134
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:59,880
depression right when I of started on my path and it wasn't like path to Buddhism

135
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:06,240
you I took this went to found a church that I really liked and and eventually

136
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,440
found the dhama and and you know and it was

137
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:18,120
always there in some way like it was very presentent in my life because my

138
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:23,800
stepmom practiced Buddhism and had her Quan altar outside my room right and

139
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:30,120
would chant every day um but you know as often and like

140
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:36,720
with our parents things we like not doing that that's you

141
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,720
know and Somehow Here I Am um which makes her very

142
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,959
[Laughter] happy

143
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:57,079
yeah and so something brought you here today and maybe for some of you this is

144
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:03,880
always where you come on Sunday morning and for some of you maybe you're a little bit newer to practice maybe a

145
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:12,360
friend brought you they're like check out this thing called mindfulness there's a center you should go

146
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:19,399
right so there's something that brought us and then there's something that keeps us

147
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:26,160
here right and and for me and I I reference

148
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:32,480
This Heart opening thing that happened it was on the first Retreat that I went to at Spirit Rock and I didn't know what

149
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:39,519
was happening and I didn't like it but I knew something was changing like

150
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:46,720
internally that I was gaining access to something that was like good in the

151
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,880
sense of non-harming that was helpful and

152
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,199
supportive to me being the person I wanted to be in

153
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:00,399
the world

154
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:11,038
and so I think it's so helpful to like reflect on what keeps us coming like

155
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:17,360
what is it that we're curious about in our practice in our hearts and our

156
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,760
minds right and also what are those

157
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,240
edges what are those places that we notice

158
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,039
maybe we're not showing up in ways that um are so

159
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,360
kind or

160
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:50,440
helpful like externally internally and

161
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:53,440
both

162
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:03,679
right and and our practice our our meditative practice Can can support us

163
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,960
in this discernment and

164
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:14,960
and this thing called mindfulness or

165
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,440
awareness hopefully you don't only do it here but maybe that's where we start

166
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:28,840
you're like oh maybe for 5 years we just come and like this is our practice and then it goes out the window the rest of

167
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:36,360
the week that's a possibility and it's not a problem right I I uh taught a

168
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:42,039
retreat last year and there was a student

169
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,559
who was pretty um like angry at the conditions

170
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:54,960
of the retreat the people that they thought should be there wouldn't weren't there

171
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,960
and um they didn't like the silence and didn't get the whole meditation

172
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:08,320
thing but yet we're at a retreat and and so they kind of they

173
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:15,320
didn't show up to everything they kind of did their own thing but they had lots of questions and they kept like going

174
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:22,200
where I was and showing up and ended up living at a couple of different Dharma centers but still

175
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:28,120
didn't meditate and like almost a year in they're like okay can you teach me how

176
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:34,120
to meditate I'm like okay I will teach you how to meditate I was kind of excited and so I

177
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:40,240
just like all right let's sit down we tried a different couple different meditations and I was like can you just

178
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:48,400
do this for five minutes a day for five minutes a day so maybe that's where we start five minutes a

179
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:55,559
day and and they recently came to visit me and like Victoria for the last 40

180
00:19:55,559 --> 00:20:00,760
days I've been sitting for 30 minutes to

181
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:06,919
day you know so something shifted it took them a minute to to to get it and

182
00:20:06,919 --> 00:20:14,960
their way in was through Community they went to live at these centers and get to know the people and

183
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:22,320
and what they were being shown is how people were living their lives what their values were right that they were

184
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:29,200
living with deep integrity and inclining what their

185
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:35,720
Minds their words and their actions towards that which was helpful that which was kind that which was generous

186
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:42,280
that which was beneficial right and that got them really

187
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:47,799
interested oh if if in this scene there are these good

188
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:55,159
people that show up in ways that I want to show up there must be something to this

189
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,799
right and then and then we we get in there a little bit and we're like oh this place is

190
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:08,640
hard this is this is I don't like this quality of my

191
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:14,279
mind or or how the mind reacts

192
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:20,719
to particular stimuli [Music]

193
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:30,760
um and then we're like what do I do with this what do I do with this how do I meet this so often I ask

194
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,679
students like okay when you notice something in the mind this is the question I ask how did

195
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:42,840
you meet it how did you meet that and they're like what do you mean

196
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:48,679
meet it I didn't meet it I I just put it down I went back to my

197
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:52,960
breath is that helpful all the

198
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:05,000
time no right yeah um so we can start to notice as we

199
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:13,559
as we refine our practice like all the

200
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:19,440
parts like how are we meeting ourselves how are we meeting these broken hearts

201
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,360
or joyful

202
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,720
hearts and so it seems that sometimes people miss this part

203
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,799
about how we are with ourselves it's often so easy to be

204
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:48,399
generous and kind and stand up for others and not so easy to do this for

205
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:57,120
ourselves and it all matters right so on the cushion off the

206
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:02,600
cushion you can we we start to stay

207
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:09,679
here right right here present with things whatever they are more often and

208
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:16,720
when we say here with whatever is arising more often then we have more Choice don't

209
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:24,120
we right we have more choice because we we're in real time meeting responding to

210
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:31,600
what's arising and we can't do that if we're not here for it not here for our lives

211
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:38,200
like and sometimes it is so difficult right and so then we have to

212
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:42,200
find find these ways

213
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:51,400
to have some balance all right there's so many

214
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:59,360
moments in a day like just mind moments if you will right

215
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,559
and we can't ignore the ones well don't ignore any of them right but also really

216
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:12,400
don't ignore the ones where there's some peace and joy and

217
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:19,679
kindness and I know generosity and love like

218
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,679
both internally externally and and both

219
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,200
right because this is so supportive in our

220
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:40,000
practice this um like inclining to that which is wholesome and

221
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:45,640
helpful so my teacher in in has anyone been to

222
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:52,200
Nepal anyone been to lumini yeah what's lumini why is that a

223
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:59,640
famous place birth yeah birthplace of the Buddha yeah

224
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:06,200
um and so my teacher is very interested in what's happening in my practice right

225
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:13,600
like I don't know okay what what are you paying attention to how long are you staying

226
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:20,279
there right so that's part of it like there's every day there's a little refinement you know six days a week when

227
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:26,520
I go with them they're they're checking in about my practice and then like okay

228
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:32,960
just do a little bit more of this aing bring in a little bit more Equanimity bring in a little bit more

229
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:38,440
concentration okay back off a little bit right like there's that that kind of

230
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,760
discernment um but you know what they really want to

231
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:51,000
know is what am I inclining the mind to is there more kindness

232
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:59,679
Victoria are there more wholesome States arising every day

233
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:06,360
right they're very interested in that and why are they interested in that they're interested in it because it's a

234
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,120
it's a supportive condition for me to stay

235
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,880
present right and so we can check at any moment

236
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:25,320
in our day like oh what are we what are we inclining towards what are we

237
00:26:25,399 --> 00:26:31,600
feeding do you ask yourself these questions like with that snapshot okay what's in

238
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:38,720
the mind right now oh I'm being harsh on

239
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,799
myself right can I meet myself with kindness do you think it matters do you

240
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:50,960
think it counts it does I mean and check it out for yourself don't take my word for

241
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:58,360
it but it does you matter be kind to yourself

242
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,799
you know what are you cultivating it can be helpful to

243
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:14,559
remember why we're not just doing it for ourselves are

244
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:20,760
we we're doing it for our communities our families our

245
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:26,799
friends we don't keep it and you couldn't

246
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:32,799
right even if if you tried I'm going to keep all this goodness for myself

247
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,760
no right the generosity comes

248
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:46,440
out the love comes out the joy comes out the exuberance

249
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:54,600
comes out and

250
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:02,120
likewise the frustration the irritation the Judgment the ways that we aren't kind

251
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:09,840
also come out and and you know I don't mention

252
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:15,559
those things to to judge or

253
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:21,279
um yeah to judge but but it's but we need to be honest like oh what's

254
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:28,880
actually here like and is this helpful is this kind is this is this beneficial to the

255
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:34,200
world that I want to live in or not and so we have to be real honest

256
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:40,600
with ourselves like really honest with ourselves not in order to beat ourselves

257
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:45,919
up but just to have the information so we know what we're working with you know

258
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,320
in the beginning I knew what I was working with I was working with a lot of anger and fear

259
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:59,159
and and he didn't know that there was fear there in the beginning um and depression

260
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:06,159
right but I had to be really honest with myself about that so I could learn how to meet

261
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:10,519
it and learn what the antidote

262
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:18,480
was you know the beautiful thing about this practice is like whatever we're

263
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:26,720
doing whatever we're meeting or practicing wherever we are on the

264
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:33,039
path um we deepening if we're paying attention

265
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:39,039
right I often joke um you know I like to wait for people to come into the

266
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:45,159
room um and so I often joke like oh this is waiting

267
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:50,399
practice right how often do you do waiting practice in your

268
00:29:50,919 --> 00:29:58,159
life um and if we can stay there and hold it as waiting practice

269
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:04,880
then maybe it doesn't tip into frustration or judgment here they are they're late

270
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:10,720
again or you know or the like I drove down and I live in the East

271
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:18,200
Bay and guess what on a Sunday morning there's no traffic I got here so fast it was

272
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:24,159
amazing right and um so there's many gifts of living in the Bay Area where we

273
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:30,880
can practice patience traffic is one of them and so what are

274
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:37,080
the ways in which we can we can integrate um these principles that

275
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:43,600
support us in deepening in our practice in everything and can we catch it can we notice more

276
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:49,480
often right and and our like the still

277
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:54,679
meditation practice we do supports this setting of the mind and supports

278
00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:00,759
interest in staying present with things the way they are and sometimes s we're stuck in

279
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:06,639
traffic and can we know and meet like the frustration or the worry about being

280
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:12,639
late and watch what the Mind does okay I'm going to be late and then

281
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:19,840
I'm going to like I don't know they're going to be mad at me or like whatever the thing

282
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:27,120
is and my suggestion and I'd say the Buddhist suggestion would be actually let's stay here with how things are okay

283
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:33,279
some frustration here but here we are in traffic let's accept that and see what

284
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:40,279
happens instead of making up a story about what's going to happen you know have you ever been late

285
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:48,159
to something and you're meeting a friend and you put so much pressure on yourself and then they were late too and it was

286
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:54,480
perfect I was like oh and you spent 20 minutes being hard on yourself for not

287
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:02,760
getting out of the house on time right and in reality it wasn't a problem

288
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:10,880
so even if we can just get to that even if we can just get to actually like meeting what's actually

289
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:17,039
happening in real time more often with some

290
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:23,399
kindness we making a lot of progress instead of they're

291
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:31,519
lamenting the dream of the past or giving this madeup

292
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:39,320
future right maybe you had some idea about what was going to happen this morning and it's totally

293
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:45,159
different right I had lots of ideas about things I was going to talk

294
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:51,360
about but this is what I'm talking about like a you know there like a light

295
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:59,840
little script but I kind of threw it out the window so can we stay

296
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:03,960
here and what happens when we

297
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,600
do and it was so fun to like go into meditation and then I heard people come

298
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,880
in and then I open my eyes I'm like oh more people oh what a joy and

299
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,720
Delight right so what are we cultivating do you

300
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:28,600
know what you're cultivating are you paying attention

301
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,639
what are you cultivating In This

302
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:44,200
Moment let's pay attention to that what do we want to Incline

303
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:52,120
to can we incline to more generosity to patience to

304
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:56,480
kindness to compassion

305
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:05,158
and and when we notice that that's not what's happening in our

306
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:10,800
experience can we not

307
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:16,960
then be harsh with ourselves or cruel because then what are we doing we're

308
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,040
we're supporting cruelness and harshness right let's meet ourselves

309
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,720
with kindness and then then that's what we're doing then that's what we're inclining towards it's it is that simple

310
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:36,118
it's not so easy but it is that simple and and then at some point like

311
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,638
along the path we wake up and we've met our

312
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:46,878
mistake with compassion that's

313
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:54,520
huge maybe not for you maybe like you just came out this compassionate being with yourself but I

314
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:00,200
didn't right or though we find we're stuck in

315
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:07,560
traffic and it's not a problem or waiting in line and it's an opportunity to practice oh wow I get a

316
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:14,520
practice for five minutes with this cacophony of sound around

317
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:24,440
me right then each moment is like a gift cuz we get to inclin

318
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:34,200
towards these supportive conditions that are not dependent

319
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:41,880
on external conditions but on internal conditions to support our our deepening

320
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:45,680
and Awakening and refinement in our

321
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,640
practice H it's all pretty exciting to

322
00:35:54,319 --> 00:36:02,560
me maybe that's enough for me well we do have a few minutes for

323
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,319
questions y all know what your edges

324
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:22,400
are yeah Scott please or get your a

325
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:35,240
mic good morning hi I found myself very thinky this morning uhuh and U I would awaken to

326
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:41,560
that fact and bring myself back for kind with kindness and bang I was off to the races

327
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:48,000
again thinking and I guess I'm I feel like I'm meeting

328
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,040
the moment with kindness like to myself but it sort of feels feudal in a

329
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:59,520
way that that it just was so strong this inclination

330
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:08,599
and uh yeah I even tried welcoming it in you know that you know come on in you're

331
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:15,000
here and um I was just wondering if you had anything to say Beyond sort of just

332
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:21,240
keep on keeping on with that yeah yeah

333
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,280
so I mean there's a few things I can say

334
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:29,520
you know one

335
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:37,359
is sometimes we just have to say oh we're not going to do that's not what we're doing right now like we're going

336
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,920
to stay here and get what's your

337
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:48,200
anchor anomaly my breath but I sometimes have find it productive to abandon that

338
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:56,240
and just kind of go into an open awareness you know what were we doing this morning uh perseverating on my breath I

339
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:03,200
guess and not very successfully you know like that so yeah yeah and is that where the mind went was it was was it thinking

340
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:09,800
about the breath actually or was it in some thought World about the future or something yeah it was in the thought

341
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:15,280
world yeah yeah planning or like what category of

342
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:21,560
thought you don't have to say but yeah I was stupid yeah okay oh that's a

343
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:27,640
judgment right catch it it's embarrassing I you don't have to say you well no let me now I want to share it so

344
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:36,200
was I was just like reviewing this proof for the Pagan theorem I mean like the silliest thing yeah you know yeah yeah

345
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:43,119
yeah and and what was here this morning like did when you came back okay you're like you

346
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,280
came back with love to your anchor right yeah and and did you notice like in the

347
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:55,160
body was there any tension or anything hard to be with or any

348
00:38:55,160 --> 00:39:00,400
emotion was there anything that you were avoiding is my question or was there boredom

349
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:05,200
present or or

350
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:13,240
something I was aware there I was kind of being judgmental about my experience

351
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:19,680
and I know that's not a good practice but you know uh so so you're being judgmental about your about your

352
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:26,079
experience because because the mind was going and then you were there was judgment about the Judgment maybe yes

353
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:33,839
but then I was also kind of forgiving myself for that too so it it was busy yeah you know okay it was busy so yeah

354
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:40,920
and and and it is sometimes like this and then we can know what it's like to be busy like can we actually

355
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:47,480
feel the suffering of the busyness and feel the suffering of wanting things to

356
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:53,079
be different than they are and what happens when we drop into like oh this is how they are right now dear one this

357
00:39:53,079 --> 00:40:00,880
is hard and like bring a lot of care into that all right um but the the

358
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,040
fighting it it maybe isn't so helpful but the resting and meeting

359
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,400
in the suffering of wanting it to be different now that's

360
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:19,119
getting us somewhere right can we meet that fully and then the mind is off again and then we come back and then the

361
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:24,880
mind is off and this is strengthening something and so do you think every sit

362
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:32,800
that every teacher has is like so like ah or Bliss out no right and and there's a way that that

363
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:40,319
we can just we can observe the the mind going

364
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:47,720
and the irritation like I'm doing this with my hand the irritation that is there with or

365
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:55,000
agitation like of the mind or the restlessness or wanting things to be different and include it so can we

366
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:00,319
include all of it like it's not a problem and sometimes I tell myself it's

367
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:06,520
not a problem okay the mind is thinking can I just stay with oh I want it to be

368
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:12,560
different right guess I felt like I just I need to

369
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:18,119
do more of this like I I sat earlier this morning too

370
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:22,680
and the second session was a little

371
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:29,040
marginally well that's passing a judgment on it again but it seemed it felt like it was a little bit

372
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:35,119
more meditative or yeah uh inclining the mind in a more constructive way yeah so

373
00:41:35,119 --> 00:41:42,560
so let's be careful of thinking that

374
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:49,160
they're supposed to be a certain State happening for you to be practicing it's

375
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:54,200
not about any state it's about meeting what's actually

376
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:00,400
arising fully in real time and that's that's the practice that's always the practice that's

377
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,680
it and sometimes the mind is all over the place and there's agitation and there's Restless restlessness in the

378
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:12,920
body restlessness in the mind can't we meet that that's the practice that is always the practice

379
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:21,680
it's not about a state and sometimes States happen sometimes calm happens right so trust me on this one

380
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:27,599
like let go of like that part cuz that's just torture

381
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:33,799
yeah okay yeah so I think we have to stop

382
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:40,119
now um but I'd like to dedicate the Merit of our practice and our time together if that's okay let's take

383
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:43,279
another minute or

384
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:55,000
two just appreciating our willingness to show up this

385
00:42:55,160 --> 00:43:03,480
morning to show up to practice meditation to hear the dhama to be in

386
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:09,880
community to appreciate ourselves for our willingness to

387
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:19,079
meet things just the way they are and so first May the benefits of our

388
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:24,400
practice benefit us in our deepening and our Awakening and our learning and our

389
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:29,880
discernment in our inclining to that which is

390
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:36,680
wholesome and kind and then may our practice be of benefit to all beings everywhere without

391
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:43,839
exception may all beings be safe and protected from all internal and external harm may all beings be peaceful and

392
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:51,359
happy and healthy and as strong as possible and may all beings be free

393
