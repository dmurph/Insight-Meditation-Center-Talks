1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:10,000
all right nice to see everyone as we settle in I'll mention

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:18,320
that our wholesome quality for today's meditation is meta Goodwill or loving

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,000
kindness um but we'll explore it from a few different angles so I hope you'll

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,080
just follow along if you'd like so settling in

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:39,559
sensing the body and whatever posture you're in allowing the attention to come

6
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:43,480
inward closing the

7
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,240
eyes maybe taking a long slow deep breath in

8
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:57,440
[Music] softening on the out breath

9
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,798
and offering the invitation of ease to the

10
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:18,280
body so could there be an easeful way to

11
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:26,439
rest against the surface that you're resting on so softening into your seat what

12
00:01:26,439 --> 00:01:30,040
you're lying on

13
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:43,320
not having any pushing against that surface but just a softening or even a

14
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,240
melting into

15
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,320
it and then also feeling a comfortable straightness and alertness that's actually more more

16
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:06,240
easeful than collect s so soft and

17
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,040
present allowing the shoulders to

18
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,280
relax soften down maybe Imagining the shoulder blades

19
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:28,319
sliding down the back

20
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,480
softening the eyes in the eye

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,440
sockets inviting some ease through the Torso area

22
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:07,319
through the chest and heart area down into the

23
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:19,080
abdomen not any kind of a demand but just a an invitation

24
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:46,000
and softening the arms and legs so they're in kind of a natural

25
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,599
natural

26
00:03:55,079 --> 00:04:00,319
position so a sense in the body of having arrived

27
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,360
to the degree it's available right

28
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,599
now and if there are any parts of the body that

29
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,159
are uncomfortable today in some

30
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,919
way that's fine we feel that

31
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:32,199
that's okay for the body right now we just offer our caring attention to those

32
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:36,520
parts without dramatizing

33
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:00,400
them and you're welcome to continue on with

34
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,160
the meditation more on the breath or the body if that's um what feels right for

35
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,560
you the invitation is also to bring the attention into the area of

36
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,720
the heart to point the Mind towards

37
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:27,160
some good will just having a sense of softening in

38
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:34,960
the heart area and how is it there it might already be warm or soft

39
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,319
or it might feel a little bit tight or hard or

40
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:47,160
achy or [Music] numb and so for so we just see what's

41
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,160
there

42
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:08,400
some of the feelings may be physical and some extend more into the energetic aspect of the body a little

43
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,599
more

44
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,319
subtle so again using the mental function of the Mind in a skillful

45
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:34,160
way we can bring in the image or felt sense of a being for whom it's easy to

46
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:42,800
feel friendliness it might be yourself that's a totally Fine Place to

47
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:51,000
Start very classical place to start if that's not as easy you can

48
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,160
often people like to use an animal like a pet it should be some some simple

49
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:04,599
being not someone with whom you have a complex relationship so usually we

50
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:12,039
wouldn't choose our partner for example some easy being or it's just

51
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:20,000
simple to wish well but rather than focusing entirely

52
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:27,560
on [Music] them we just use their image or sense on

53
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:37,919
our heart as a way of evoking the feeling of care the focus is on the feeling in

54
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:46,800
US Good Will of an easy kind of loving

55
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,639
kindness friendliness we just want this being to

56
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,800
be happy and feeling that feeling in the

57
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,440
heart of wanting that caring about

58
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:20,560
that I'm sensing that feeling connecting it to our

59
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:31,440
breath so as the breath comes in it's like a Bellows shining on a

60
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:40,360
beginning of a fire and when we bump the Bellows the Fire gets bigger it's being

61
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:45,399
fed so as we breathe in The Meta

62
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:56,480
grows getting warmer and brighter and as we breathe out we notice

63
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:03,959
The Shining of that Flame or hot

64
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:12,399
coal Radiance of it breathing in

65
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:20,760
again this sense of this being The Meta grows flowing on

66
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:26,279
fire breathing out we notice the radiance

67
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:47,120
as you get a sense of that you can let the sense of the being go actually and

68
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,720
just notice the

69
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:59,640
meta growing and radiating

70
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:06,880
now the thing about a fire is that it radiates in all directions

71
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:14,399
equally whereas we tend to be focused on the front where our Cent orans

72
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:22,320
are so we can deliberately imagine that the radiance is shining forward start

73
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,800
where it's

74
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:35,639
clear as if we've drawn a curtain aside and it's shining freely out to the

75
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:42,839
front and then drawing that curtain around to the

76
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:48,079
right Radiance shines out to the

77
00:10:55,639 --> 00:11:01,920
right the back little messy easy

78
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:10,160
maybe keeping the feeling of matter of it feeling it extending out of

79
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:13,669
our [Music]

80
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,759
B and to the left

81
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:31,240
side and also AOW

82
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:41,160
and below so we removed all the curtains and

83
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:48,639
the heart is shining freely turning back into that feeling of

84
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:55,680
meta can you even feel it physically sense of warmth or

85
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:02,519
ease in the mind perhaps it's a pleasant feeling feeling of

86
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:10,120
friendliness openness subtle

87
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:24,040
Joy it may be that this feeling is not so accessible at this moment that

88
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:31,160
happens and if that's the case then just stay with the intention

89
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,320
and whatever feelings are present that are somewhat

90
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,880
useful letting the meta permeate the body as it shines

91
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:00,440
outward it doesn't need to go very far and a light doesn't push its energy out

92
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:06,079
so you just let it shine maybe it's pretty small

93
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,199
candle or maybe it's bigger doesn't

94
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:16,079
matter it's just The Shining

95
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:48,800
if you want to imagine that this meta is nourishing for the

96
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:54,839
body that's fine notice how it shines through your

97
00:13:54,839 --> 00:14:00,440
body before it goes out into the world we we are always the first

98
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:03,839
recipient of our

99
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,360
meta we may bring in a sense of how any being in any

100
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:27,680
direction would be touched by this field of meta

101
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:39,040
and it's quality one quality that to focus on is

102
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:41,839
its non-c

103
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:51,240
contention meta has no conflict in

104
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:03,639
it it's just it self it's just

105
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,120
friendliness joh home

106
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:44,720
you're welcome to continue if you would like but there's also an invitation to

107
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,160
now soften that deliberate use of the mind

108
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:59,199
and relax back to an open awareness of the flow of experience

109
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:05,120
but retaining this quality of non-c [Music]

110
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:10,399
contention allowing each thing in the body and

111
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:18,480
mind to have its life in the field of our

112
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:25,880
awareness without a sense that we need to decide if it should or shouldn't be

113
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:34,160
there what it's about because the awareness is just

114
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:41,839
itself just simple knowing without any conflict with what's

115
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,120
coming and going but we stay present nonentangled

116
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:53,399
and seeing if you can rest like this for a

117
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
bit

118
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

119
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

120
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

121
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

122
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

123
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

124
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

125
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

126
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

127
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

128
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

129
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

130
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

131
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

132
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

133
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

134
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
e e

135
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,200
so let's bring in now another aspect of

136
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:13,320
Mata it's been implicit in this sit but I want to make

137
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:20,720
it explicit that is to consider

138
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:28,760
that we don't actually know what will arise next in experience

139
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,399
do we so even in our own mind just sitting

140
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:41,120
quietly here you're basically just with

141
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:47,720
yourself but you don't know what's going to [Music] come you don't know absolutely

142
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:54,880
everything about your mind and so there's this certain kind of

143
00:26:54,880 --> 00:27:00,720
courage and faith in just offering this good will non-c contention I don't know

144
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:07,799
what's going to come next but the intention is to meet it with meta with a

145
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,720
non-conflicting way of

146
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:20,559
being it's kind of beautiful to have that in the face of

147
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:28,840
the unknowability of the flow of experience and similarly as we

148
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:36,840
will soon come out of meditation and soon go out into life interacting with

149
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:42,880
others going somewhere consider that in

150
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:49,120
others you don't fully know them they are always going to be deeper

151
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,640
and wider than you can see maybe even than they can

152
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:01,200
see and yet can we have this intention that we would

153
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:07,919
meet that with friendliness or kindness or Goodwill whatever dimension of meta

154
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:15,320
is appropriate in that moment and what a courageous heart it

155
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:23,880
would be to go out into this vast unfathomable world but still wish inside that we can

156
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:29,799
meet it with kindness and care and well wishing

157
00:28:29,799 --> 00:28:40,840
even in the face of that ultimate unknowability in a sense why not why not offer

158
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:50,720
Goodwill so may it be that we retain some of that momentum heading out into

159
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,640
the wider World meeing it in this good

160
00:28:56,640 --> 00:29:02,919
way certainly doesn't guarantee that everything goes well or that others like

161
00:29:02,919 --> 00:29:08,600
us or any of those smaller considerations

162
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:15,120
but it's a good place to start and what's the alternative

163
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:23,360
really so may we continue with our open

164
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:30,039
heart may we have the courage to let that be what we're about

165
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:36,519
finding a way to meet life with this care and kindness so That

166
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:42,679
Others May to the degree that they're receptive sense

167
00:29:42,679 --> 00:29:48,880
that and benefit from one kindness in many ways seen and

168
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,880
unseen may all beings receive kindness and find in

169
00:29:55,880 --> 00:30:01,279
themselves happiness and and peace

170
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:49,480
so we'll continue with the 10 epithets of the Buddha and we'll finish up

171
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,480
today um one that we haven't covered uh out of these nine that we're

172
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:02,720
mostly talking about the extra one is tat which is technically the first um not

173
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:09,880
included in the traditional practice and this means uh thus come or thus gone

174
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:17,720
depending how you read it or maybe it means both maybe the word being slightly vague is meant to convey both of those

175
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:26,639
it's a little unclear you know if you just give that literal translation what it is I like uh Gil's rendering of it as

176
00:31:26,639 --> 00:31:34,639
the one who is thus the one who is thus it's kind of just the thusness the it's just what it is

177
00:31:34,639 --> 00:31:40,360
kind of way of being that the Buddha had and I mention it today on last day

178
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:46,919
because we've reached kind of the culminating qualities of the Buddha which have an air of unfathomable ility

179
00:31:46,919 --> 00:31:56,519
about them so with that introduction we'll we'll move into the last two um

180
00:31:56,519 --> 00:32:02,639
that we haven't talked about yet the first of these is

181
00:32:02,639 --> 00:32:09,840
budo uh which simply means awake I mean it's the general form of the word Buddha

182
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:15,200
that we often use to address the the Buddha um but what's interesting is that

183
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:20,720
if you remember back from the sequence I know you may not but on the very first

184
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:28,519
day we talked about this quality Sama  which I translated has fully self

185
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:36,559
awakened so why do we now get to just buddo instead of s s budo a simpler

186
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:42,120
version now late in the list you know we've seen over the week that this list

187
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:49,679
is pretty sequential it has a a directionality to it where it starts

188
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:58,440
more internally just the Buddha's awakened mind himself then the way he acts eventually his ability to see um

189
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:04,200
everything from which he teaches so we see it's going kind of outward if you

190
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:12,760
will so why do we get to buddo now just awake the usual understanding of this

191
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:22,519
which makes sense to me from having done the practice myself is that this is meant to be a direct simple powerful

192
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:30,080
awakeness that the Buddha has about him um such that but those who are attuned

193
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,880
to the teachings can feel the presence of Freedom uh when they're in his

194
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:42,039
presence so the Buddha's awakeness was so deep and so unshakable that it was

195
00:33:42,039 --> 00:33:48,120
something that could be resonated with uh by others if they were you know of a

196
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,360
mind doesn't mean everybody could feel that um but this awake

197
00:33:53,360 --> 00:34:03,799
quality can um influence us directly in a in a at a subtle level so buddo has to

198
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:09,839
do with the Buddha's ability to connect so directly with the heart that a person

199
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,118
actually could awaken if their mind was properly trained we have to do the

200
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,960
training ourselves this isn't like a magical transmission where he just can

201
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:28,800
touch anybody and wake them up it's not that there there isn't that kind of magic in this understanding but if the

202
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:35,280
mind is trained and if the person is participating then yes actually we can

203
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,358
gain that influence from the Buddha the sutas name 10 instances of people

204
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,638
becoming fully awakened simply from hearing a Dharma talk from the Buddha it

205
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,800
was more than 10 people sometimes there were a lot of them um but if you really

206
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:59,359
analyze the sutas you can find this on Lee braisington has done this analysis uh there were 10 cases where

207
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:05,160
the one or more people became fully awakened just from hearing a Dharma talk

208
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:11,359
and presumably their minds had been prepared in some way so

209
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:17,000
um so that's you know those are in the early teachings these suggestions that

210
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,520
this is possible but um we can see you know in our own experience how does this

211
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:28,599
relate for us since we don't have a living Buddha um it can that even

212
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:35,760
translations of the Buddha's teachings you know even passed down and translated into another language there can be a

213
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:41,800
direct impact on the mind if the mind is ready I'll give as an example um I've

214
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:48,200
had experience with this I read the sutas quite a bit and um and other and

215
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:56,319
you know teachings from other Buddhist Traditions also and I had an experience one time of reading a verse translated

216
00:35:56,319 --> 00:36:01,599
from a certain B teaching it was what it was in English and it was like there was

217
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,960
a shift in my mind I was somehow just ready at that moment and my mind shifted

218
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:13,920
into kind of a meditative State and I noticed it you just from reading this verse and I thought it was so

219
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:20,920
interesting I actually put it down and you did some meditation and you know went on after

220
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:29,560
that and at some point I mentioned this to a friend and it actually had the same effect on her mind so can happen Joseph

221
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:35,079
Goldstein also mentions um he's talked about in Dharma talks that he had an

222
00:36:35,079 --> 00:36:40,319
Insight actually from something that he read I don't know what it was but he

223
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:46,240
read some kind of a wisdom teaching and he had an insight into not self so um

224
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:52,160
these things are possible even now but again it depends on the conditions we've

225
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,680
put into our mind through meditative practice and training and developing ethics and

226
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,960
wholesomeness so how much more so right now going back to this quality of budo

227
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,240
how much more so if someone is literally in Buddha's presence right so there's

228
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:15,960
this idea that awakeness is a is a thing and we can explore that you know

229
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:21,440
in our own practice the degree to which that's meaningful for

230
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:28,240
us and then the final quality attribute epithet of the Buddha

231
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:35,800
is bwa bwa and that is um that's often used in the sutas it's usually

232
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:42,560
translated as the blessed one the blessed one said this Etc and or simply

233
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:48,960
blessed if it's as a an adjective this one though um I mean

234
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:54,000
that's a translation and it's meant to you know blessed has a kind of a religious

235
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,520
quality to it and it's you know it's meant to try to capture or something but I think it's hard to put into simple

236
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:06,920
words I mean what is a blessing in a in a religion that has such a thing so I

237
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:12,040
think it's best encountered if we understand this last quality of

238
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:18,240
bagawa in doing the formal recol recollection practice itself and seeing

239
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:27,040
what it evokes for us but I'll I'll offer some words um see how they resonate for you so this

240
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,200
is from bod talking about his interpretation of these nine epithets

241
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:39,400
and he says the blessed one the fortunate one who practiced and fulfilled all

242
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:45,200
meritorious qualities and extends his waves of blessing out to the

243
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:51,680
world that's his definition of of bwa how we should recollect that so that's

244
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:59,079
interesting right what does that mean now centuries after the Buddha's physical death I don't think it's meant

245
00:38:59,079 --> 00:39:04,520
to be pinned down rationally so not something that we should think about and

246
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:12,240
analyze and um really get our get our mind around it I think it's the point is

247
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:18,680
more to rest in the opening that comes from this term um you know we kind of

248
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:27,160
land on bwa at the end the blessed one blessings maybe still happening I found

249
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:34,240
this quote in the sutas a realized one is freed from Reckoning in terms of form

250
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:41,480
they are deep immeasurable and hard to Fathom like the ocean and that talks about form and it

251
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:46,920
goes on for the other Aggregates feeling perception mental formations

252
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:52,000
Consciousness we can't really reckon them in terms of those things we can't

253
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:57,640
pin them down and say exactly what this is for that person they're deep

254
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:05,560
immeasurable hard to Fathom in the end we don't really know the Buddha's mind we don't really know

255
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:12,200
who who was the Buddha what is the Buddha it's for us to to feel in

256
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:18,280
ourselves so we find that at the end of contemplating all of these attributes of

257
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:29,319
the Buddha we're left with can't know it all just have to rest in something open

258
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:39,680
so my sense from this is that what happened under the bod tree whatever that was is still echoing in the

259
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,040
world and perhaps in a practical sense there's a

260
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,680
way that our life could be lived such that that

261
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:58,720
reverberation keeps going at least don't dampen it through the way that you live

262
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:05,640
let that keep resonating through your body and mind not deadening it not

263
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:11,960
taking energy from it so that it continues on after after you're

264
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:18,800
here in fact doing this recollection practice I would say is part of keeping

265
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,800
that reverberation going so just let it echo through your

266
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:34,400
body as if you choose to do this practice this B it just just

267
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,119
Echoes so as a recap we have the

268
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:46,040
tagata is we don't really contemplate tagata but that's the first of the 10

269
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:52,760
the tagata is Aram fully wholesome free of greed

270
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:58,760
hatred and delusion worthy of offerings that's what our literally

271
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:05,839
means s fully self-awakened didn't see just his own

272
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:11,680
Liberation from his particular set of defilements but he saw the whole picture

273
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:20,599
all the way down to the depths such that his teachings are still relevant today VI Char

274
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:28,079
Sano accomplished in knowledge and conduct able to manifest that understanding in his very

275
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:33,839
actions with his body and his knowledge of how not to get caught in anything and

276
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,640
so he is sugat happy gone to a happy place that can't

277
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:47,000
be thrown by anything that happens in the world speaking of the world he is Loca

278
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:52,200
viu knower of the world able to see and

279
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,640
understand how suffering Rises and how it can end in all situations he sees how

280
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:06,000
the mind works how the sense system works all the Realms of being that we can be in and how they flow

281
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:12,359
lawfully based on wholesome and UNH wholesome actions and how to escape from

282
00:43:12,359 --> 00:43:18,440
that he is ano pad STI the unsurpassed

283
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:25,119
trainer of beings To Be Tamed so he can tame even the wildest mind because he

284
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:31,040
always knows how to calm it he is

285
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:39,240
sat not just a trainer but a teacher for deavas and human beings explaining to us

286
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:45,000
the process how it works so that we can be empowered to also walk this path

287
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,119
ourselves and become free become independent in the DH and become our own

288
00:43:50,119 --> 00:43:57,839
teacher and perhaps teach others use budo so awake that it

289
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:04,520
communicates to us just in his presence the awakeness can enliven and awaken us

290
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:10,440
if we are receptive to that and

291
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:18,240
Bava it continues on sending blessings through the

292
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,200
world so these teachings encourage us to reflect upon the awakened mind and the

293
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:30,599
awakened life not as a way of diminishing ourselves but just the opposite as a way

294
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:35,960
of inspiring us aligning our practice showing us the way that we can

295
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:43,480
contribute to the continuing reverberation of goodness that came from Buddha's

296
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:49,160
Awakening and the sutas say specifically that this kind of recollection leads on

297
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:55,599
to a series of beautiful qualities gladness Joy Tranquility happiness and

298
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:01,079
somani there's a way way that the mind can unify and gather through this kind

299
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:07,280
of recollection so I encourage you to find some way that these Reflections are

300
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:12,319
meaningful for you if that's of Interest see how this week lands and

301
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:19,079
continues on and for those who will uh who can be in the area tomorrow I will

302
00:45:19,079 --> 00:45:25,920
teach a day long that includes the formal recollection of the Buddha practice if you want to try it out I

303
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:33,760
think it'll be recorded also so thank you very much for this week may your life be an ongoing

304
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:39,119
Resonance of what happened under the buy tree in the specific and unique and

305
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:45,119
individual way it can be for you thank you
