1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,400
so those of you in the heat

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:18,880
these days rather than saying warm greetings

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:27,519
perhaps you could appreciate a offering of cool greetings

4
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:34,239
the that's been said that uh the english language you know because it was

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,718
evolved developed in england which can be cold and

6
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,520
rainy that the idea of warmth is very appealing and heart warming

7
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:57,920
whereas buddhism developed in india where it can be quite warm and there what is wonderful is coolness

8
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:03,280
to be cool and so the idea of coolness has very different connotations than it has in

9
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,320
english where you know being cool is is being you know pretty hip or

10
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:14,159
something but being cool is being refreshed and

11
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:20,479
being delighted and being all kinds of things and so the idea of nibbana

12
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:28,560
nirvana is very much associated with with the idea of becoming cool cooling down

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,799
the cooling of the flames and and maybe in this heat

14
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,759
you can appreciate why uh how that's really really really you know meaningful

15
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:50,479
metaphor that maybe sometimes english speaking people wouldn't quite be inspired by him

16
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,920
so um i'd like to say

17
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:03,600
some preparatory words for this meditation but no preparatory kind of guided

18
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:10,640
meditation i'll just want to say my words and and that'll serve as the

19
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,800
support for the meditation today so if you'd like to close your eyes as i say this kind of

20
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:24,640
hopefully you can just listen but kind of get yourself settled and on your own as you listen

21
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:35,599
so these qualities of the dharma for today it's the one that says come and look

22
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,360
come and come and see and

23
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:46,800
and so insight the name of our kind of meditation insight meditation

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:54,319
does involve seeing and it does involve seeing more clearly

25
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:01,120
what comes into view as we see so coming into seeing more clearly the

26
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,519
experience of breathing the body sounds the thoughts emotions

27
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,760
and that's part of the value of it but one of the profound things

28
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,959
you know to see if we're trying trying to see something if we're looking to find something and

29
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:28,480
like there's some insight that will be profound something to discover that's

30
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,840
kind of profound if you're seeking

31
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,920
then what you're looking for

32
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,879
can be found in the seeing

33
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:54,560
not in what you see what you seek is found in the seeking

34
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,920
not in what you're seeking for out there

35
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:09,719
the thing to be aware of is the awareness itself

36
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:22,560
to be aware of ourselves mindful aware attentive

37
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,479
where we're at our attention

38
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,600
includes what it's like to be attending

39
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,759
to what attention takes in and so this backward step this kind of

40
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,600
turning the awareness around almost to look at itself

41
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,840
there what do we find what do we see

42
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:07,840
and we might see layers of attitudes and reactions

43
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,720
opinions preferences

44
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:22,320
but if those are there then we haven't taken the backwards step

45
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:28,479
far enough back into that which is looking to the looking itself

46
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,680
to the awareness itself in its simplicity

47
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,120
and in that simplicity that is the place to rest

48
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,960
that's the place to then open up to be aware of this world

49
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,639
as we sit here meditating

50
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,560
so

51
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:38,480
and as we come to the end of this meditation

52
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:49,440
maybe again to bring your attention not to

53
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,120
something but to attention itself

54
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,840
the attending not the

55
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:08,720
looking not what you're looking at but at looking itself

56
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,559
and in doing so maybe becoming aware of the attitudes that come along with mindfulness

57
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:23,440
with attention the wanting and not wanting the aversion

58
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:29,760
the desires the fears and

59
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:37,360
that seem somehow entangled with our capacity to be aware

60
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:48,640
maybe the delusions the thoughts the interpretations concerns with past and future

61
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:54,799
and to think of these as visitors

62
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:04,240
to awareness visitors to our ability to see is very simply

63
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:09,760
the simplest acts of perceptions are free of all these complicated

64
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,760
attitudes

65
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:24,320
sometimes those attitudes crowd out awareness itself

66
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:32,559
are recognizing it are living in it in a conscious way

67
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,360
and as all our attitudes crowd out

68
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,760
even conscious awareness

69
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:52,000
so it also crowds out the deeper deeper capacity

70
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:57,360
for love all the flavors of love

71
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:02,720
kindness good will

72
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:08,600
care compassion

73
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,760
generosity and respect

74
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:36,720
to let go to settle in deep enough into awareness

75
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,520
itself gives room

76
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,799
for more and more inner beauty to come forth

77
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,360
and may it be that your inner beauty

78
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:09,120
manifests in greater goodwill

79
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,760
and natural goodwill welling up from within

80
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:20,559
simple goodwill for all the people in your life

81
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:24,960
known and unknown strangers

82
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:33,840
may it be that through your awareness

83
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:44,000
you can tap into greater happiness for yourself and for them

84
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:50,398
may it be that through a more settled mind and heart

85
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:56,720
you make a world that is safer for yourself and for others

86
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,840
may it be that as you

87
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:13,519
have fewer and fewer attitudes and reactivities to entangled with awareness

88
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:20,000
that awareness provides peace for yourself and for others

89
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:26,799
and may it be that as you are

90
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,840
aware without being caught in anything

91
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:38,720
you provide greater freedom for yourself and for others

92
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:48,799
may this meditation practice that we do benefit self and others

93
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:54,000
intentionally and unintentionally consciously and unconsciously may all

94
00:32:54,000 --> 00:33:01,399
beings be happy

95
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:09,880
[Music]

96
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,278
thank you

97
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,079
so find myself happy to be here with you this morning and

98
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:38,000
for this third talk on the qualities of the dharma

99
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:43,440
and today uh you know so i have the simplest way that kind of very kind of

100
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:48,480
simplistic maybe a way of understanding these five qualities is

101
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,118
that they are it's about here dharma is here the dharma is now

102
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:01,520
the dharma is looking

103
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:09,838
the dharma is flowing along and the dharma is to be experienced

104
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:18,400
so um today the topic you know in a simplistic way is the dharma is looking the the literal

105
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,240
pali word as i said last week is a very common

106
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,359
ordinary expression that suggests this kind of simplicity that

107
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:36,560
i'm talking about a simplistic way of saying it is because it literally means come

108
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:41,920
look come see some people say inviting inspection they

109
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:47,119
translated it some people say there's one wonderful chinese buddhist

110
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:54,640
saying that says awakening beckons us within everything

111
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,240
and awakening invites us within everything so everything that we

112
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:08,320
see and touch is inviting us come be awake wake up what a great idea that that's how it is

113
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:15,520
and it is that way in a certain way and maybe i'll try to explain that and um but come and look

114
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:21,920
and look and uh and what we find then in this five

115
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:27,599
characteristics of the dharma the first one is

116
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:32,880
san ditiko de diti it does mean to come to come see that

117
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,800
means visible so it's visible some people say visible

118
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,440
here some people say it's in this very life that we can see and live here

119
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:51,040
some people will translate it as to see here to visible here and now

120
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:56,800
but i think just say it's visible here the third one now is to come look so

121
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,599
here we both of them have you know seeing in in the meaning of it and then the fifth one on friday

122
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:09,280
is uh to to know to experience to know the

123
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:15,280
word it means both things to know so this way of seeing and knowing is really

124
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:22,560
steep in the dharma and you find the buddha throughout his teachings he keeps emphasizing seeing and knowing seeing

125
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:28,079
and knowing and and so

126
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,119
uh cultivating or developing our capacity to narrow to settle into here

127
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:39,520
and now to discover a way of being here and now that is not in conflict not fighting not

128
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:46,400
running away escaping not afraid of here now not um

129
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,359
putting layers of interpretation and and wishes expectations on here and now

130
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,960
uh coming into a simplicity of being with here and now it's a lot of what

131
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:05,520
we're discovering in this meditation practice here and now here and now and

132
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:11,839
and that gives us an opportunity then for the looking the seeing to be relatively simple to be

133
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:18,800
uncomplicated not a lot of baggage comes along with it and it's all

134
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,880
too easy to have baggage come along one of them is to look and be mindful

135
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,000
with kind of a self-consciousness performance anxiety or

136
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,000
measuring oneself how am i doing and you know i'm not doing well enough i should be further along or

137
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:43,119
uh you know it's too difficult for me all these kinds of kind of forms of self-consciousness

138
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,440
take us out of the simplicity of here and now and also out of the simplicity of this

139
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:55,040
seeing what's here just this looking just being mindful just aware here

140
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,720
and one of the challenges for some some people will be that this simplicity of

141
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,839
here and now and simplicity's mindfulness here is boring

142
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:11,119
that it's uh it has unpromising and it's not going to provide us with the rich

143
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:16,400
things the special things the wonderful things that and um

144
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,240
and uh but maybe that's the price of coming into a wonderful state of

145
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:28,079
being is a willingness to be very simple without expectation

146
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:33,119
without wanting anything so that we can put down

147
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:38,240
the activity of boredom put down the exp activity of

148
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,240
of selfing and wanting something and building itself up just very simple

149
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:49,760
so and then to be able to look from that point of view to see to be mindful to be aware

150
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:56,880
in a way is very respectful of whatever is happening in the present moment that each thing in the present

151
00:39:56,880 --> 00:40:04,960
moment is allowed to be itself without our interference and our desires

152
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:09,960
the kind of pristine primordial

153
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:18,480
kind of appearance of whatever is happening in the moment okay this is allowed to be here

154
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:23,839
so all our emotions there's an art to allowing them all to be there here

155
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,760
without being entangled reactive and without being pushed around by them

156
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,960
without being influenced by them and so this simplicity of being might not seem so interesting

157
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,920
in the in some ways but it's a radical alternative to being

158
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:50,800
influenced by our inner life and some you know desires wishes and emotions and all that

159
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:55,839
something different can happen but as we begin to look more at some

160
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:02,400
point what becomes interesting and fascinating is not what we see and not that we can

161
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:08,640
see clearly but we can the it's the looking itself

162
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:17,040
we begin appreciating more and more that the mindfulness itself the way we are aware awareness in itself

163
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:22,160
the inner perception the perception we have itself that

164
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:28,880
maybe that's where the treasure is maybe there is where we find

165
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:34,079
a freedom awakening that this wonderful cup to turn around

166
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:41,839
and look awareness look at perception perceiving perception perceiving itself

167
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:49,520
looking the inner eye looking and seeing itself awareness aware of itself

168
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,800
in such a way that we begin shedding

169
00:41:54,800 --> 00:42:00,960
all the extra baggage that comes along with it all the extra attachments clinging

170
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,880
stress levels that come along with being aware being mindful

171
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:12,480
and this is one of the kind of ways in which mindfulness really opens up to a

172
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,480
deep equanimity is as the mindfulness as the awareness begins shedding

173
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:25,119
the complexities that we add on top of it it just becomes simpler and simpler awareness simpler and simpler looking

174
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:31,440
the simplicity of it becomes the guide oh there's where non-clinging ears

175
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,520
there's there's a little bit of stress there and how i'm aware oh and as i become aware of that stress

176
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,119
something opens something relaxes as i become aware as i become aware of

177
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:50,319
the stress in mindfulness i notice there that that awareness has

178
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:57,760
no stress in it so we're stepping back we're going kind of these layers and layers

179
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:04,000
and to finding that place where awareness has no stress no tension associated with it

180
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:11,119
and then kind of staying close to that letting the how we're aware of the world

181
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:17,520
come from that place of no tension no stress no pushing

182
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:27,520
no straining no resisting no pulling away no leaning forward

183
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,880
so that's why sometimes it's powerful to to

184
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:39,440
realize that or to have this attitude or understanding that what we're looking for

185
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:42,560
is in the looking

186
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:51,680
that attention we can in being attentive

187
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:57,200
we're we're being attentive to how we're attending

188
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:03,520
attention and attending i could use together in in having attention

189
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:09,160
we're attending to the attending itself

190
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:14,800
in the mindfulness we're being mindful of the how we're being mindful

191
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,480
in looking we're mindful of how we're looking and attending to anything we're

192
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:27,520
paying attention to how we're attending and and that is where we begin can

193
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,560
understand something a lot about what's going on in our life it begins shedding

194
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:37,839
all the different activities within

195
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:45,040
associated with attention with a practice that involves stress strain

196
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:51,839
tension involves some kind of discomfort

197
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:59,599
until we find this equanimity of simplicity the simplicity of equanimity

198
00:44:59,599 --> 00:45:07,200
so this idea of the buddha says come and look here and now in the here now

199
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:12,880
with the here now come and look come and look so today

200
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,960
as you go about your day uh you might um

201
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:24,079
take some time you know maybe set a timer be reminded periodically sit and

202
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:30,160
have tea whenever you have a chance but it's been making an assignment that today

203
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:35,920
i'll start becoming more aware of the characteristics the quality

204
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,520
of your awareness itself of your attention itself of your mindfulness turn around

205
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:47,440
and see how much extra that might be there along

206
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,920
and see how simple you can allow your your attention to be

207
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:00,240
and if there's a any kind of extended period of time this simplicity of awareness

208
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:07,359
i suspect that you'll discover that your breathing shifts and changes

209
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:13,359
it might become more useful so

210
00:46:13,359 --> 00:46:19,920
i hope that it's a wonderful day of exploration and

211
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:25,000
i look forward to our time tomorrow thank you
