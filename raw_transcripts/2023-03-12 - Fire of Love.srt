1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,660
so there's an expression in English of

2
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:13,259
fighting fire with fire little strange topics for today given it's raining

3
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:20,039
but fighting fire with a fire and my understanding of history of the origins of this expression it had to do with

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,340
farmers in the early 1800s in the Prairies of central prairies United States when there were prayer prayer a

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:30,019
prayer Prairie fires

6
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:39,260
excuse me they learn to um set smaller fires in the

7
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:44,520
you know in front of the approaching large prairie fire in order to protect

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,399
themselves and maybe unfortunately the expression eventually became also understood to

9
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,360
fight violence with violence that whatever whatever someone brings you you bring the same

10
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:02,640
there is a I think a marvelous story perhaps a myth a fable

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:10,500
uh you have the very first months of the Buddha's teaching of him fighting fire with fire so I'm

12
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:16,760
going to tell you the story he was wandering around in Northern India

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:23,880
and he needed a place to stay for the night and he came Upon A large group it

14
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:31,380
says 500 people who ascetics or spiritual practitioners reductions who

15
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,259
were living on the edge of a river who were fire worshipers

16
00:01:37,259 --> 00:01:42,299
and they had a firehouse kind of maybe like a place where they did the fire

17
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:48,060
ceremonies and you know did their religious life and uh

18
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,220
so he came upon them and he said to the leader of them that would be possible

19
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:58,740
for me to spend the night in your Firehouse he needed a place to stay

20
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:06,060
and uh the man said oh yes it would be very happy for you to stay there however

21
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:12,920
there's a ferocious um

22
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:20,040
the large powerful serpent fire serpent living in the house

23
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,560
and it won't be danger it would be dangerous for you to go and spend the night there

24
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:31,620
and then we're like oh no I can I'll be fine could I please stay there

25
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:37,560
and because it was so dangerous that man thought it was so dangerous for Buddha to do it the Buddha had to ask three

26
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:46,140
times and in India ancient India if you asked three times you usually don't say no the third time so I said okay you

27
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,140
so the Buddha went and spent mentally explains that he went in and sat down and made himself a seat inside the

28
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,959
firehouse sat down cross-legged and established himself in an upright sitting posture

29
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:04,260
and brought forth mindfulness so he was going to often the Buddha would sit and meditate through the night

30
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:11,580
that was his idea of a good night's sleep maybe and um so

31
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:17,220
sure enough this Dragon came out the serpent came out and was I guess upset

32
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:22,440
that someone was in the his house and so he approached the Buddha and

33
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,599
started shooting smoke at the Buddha

34
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:34,379
and then Buddha thought that was interesting and he said well what if I uh match the

35
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:40,560
smoke with smoke and that infuriated in the the serpent

36
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:47,519
so then he started with um you know projecting Flames ferocious Flames at the Buddha

37
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,580
and the Buddha thought well what if I match the fire with fire

38
00:03:53,580 --> 00:04:00,420
without hurting without harming the serpent and that's the magic thing without

39
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:08,700
harming the serpent and then he says and then with filled with Good Will filled with

40
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:15,840
loving kindness care for the serpent the Buddha matched fire for fire

41
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,680
so he wasn't trying to harm the harm the the serpent and but he was provide he was matching

42
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:29,040
fire with fire and this uh and so people outside could

43
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:37,259
see the flames and the smokes billowing out of this Firehouse oh no the ascetic gotama the Buddha certainly

44
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:43,020
he's going to succumb this would be his end but in the morning the Buddha came out

45
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:50,759
with um another big terrible serpent in his

46
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:56,460
begging Bowl curled up and he handed it to the fire worshiper and said here

47
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,919
and the Buddha was no less you know worse off than before he went

48
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,919
in so one of the things the images of this that stands out for me

49
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:14,460
is the Buddha sat in meditation first so he was sitting for the Buddha in a

50
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:21,479
strong posture an erect upright present posture posture where you can be really present for something for life

51
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:28,320
for yourself whatever's going on without leading in and without pulling back

52
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:34,080
without getting activated and without crumbling down collapsing

53
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:40,860
this danger came at him and he kept his strong position his

54
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:47,039
balance position this in a sense a kind of neutral position

55
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,500
but also in a sense a very strong position posture of strength

56
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,780
but a stroke a posture of strength which is unassertive

57
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:06,900
a power of strength which is not asserting power over anyone not being aggressive just their present

58
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:14,280
and when the serpent came and attacked him the Buddha responded somehow in kind

59
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,639
but was it really with smoke was it really in Flames there's um

60
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:25,620
another teaching somewhere else where the Buddha was talking to a person who's a

61
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,639
wood gather as a profession Gathering Woods for fire and uh the Buddha in the course of their

62
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,280
conversation says says to them I have given up the burning

63
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:45,479
of wood I burned the blaze of wisdom Within

64
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:52,740
so he's lit in the fight he like he doesn't like the fire of wood he lights the Fire Within and so the inner fire

65
00:06:52,740 --> 00:07:00,360
light or but they say idea of flame of inner fire is also a little bit of a of

66
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:08,360
a representation of some kind of strength and power but it's inner

67
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:14,160
and so the serpent comes towards the Buddha and the Buddha keeps sitting there and doesn't move

68
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:21,060
but I imagine that he looks the serpent right in the eye and flinchingly

69
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:28,500
and that's you know maybe this is a myth but that's a powerful idea that danger comes and you neither turn

70
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:35,460
away you don't turn the other cheek but you also don't attack

71
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:42,360
it's not eye for an eye kind of thing for the Buddha it's the fire I would

72
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:51,000
suggest the fire of loving kindness his loving kindness a match to

73
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,699
the anger of this terrible serpent

74
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:01,860
apparently the Buddha thought it was can loving kindness something by

75
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:10,860
kindness be powerful and strong or how do we how do we let our love have

76
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:17,039
a strength and power to it that can meet the challenges of our life that's kind of the question

77
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:23,520
is it possible and I think that often enough in our kind of Buddha scene where we emphasize

78
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:28,639
a tremendous amount of you know compassion and loving kindness and these things

79
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,279
sometimes it goes along with a kind of meekness a kind of not you know not you

80
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,700
know just kind of accommodating or accepting others and not trying very careful that you have not harming

81
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:47,100
sometimes it's interpreted um make sure no one feels hurt

82
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:53,519
and that's a big difference between harming and people feeling hurt sometimes harm and hurt are two

83
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,640
different things if you tell me that you know that I'm pretty lousy teacher because I'm wearing

84
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:06,660
I guess a red shirt I don't think your Harmony you're you're harming me to say that but I might feel

85
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,300
hurt if my identity is tied up with my shirt

86
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:18,779
so if that if so I have to kind of go along and help me with this to stay or you know this distinction I'm making

87
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:25,080
between a hurt and harm there is a distinction that does anything important here

88
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:31,680
so we have a tremendous emphasis on not harming but even with that we can't be

89
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:37,019
responsible that some people we feel hurt when there's no assertion no no nothing

90
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:43,080
you know we're not trying to do anything and sometimes simply being present in a

91
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:51,420
strong way some people feel intimidated by that sometimes holding our ground is taken as

92
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:56,640
being assertive sometimes not giving in and accepting of

93
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:01,760
people saying is seem as taken as an offense

94
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:09,240
and maybe all these things are true sometimes but uh I think as I think there's a some

95
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:15,660
kind of an under a shadow side of our Buddhist tradition that I've seen over the decades I've been in it of people

96
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:22,160
being a little bit kind of ready to lower them so weaken themselves or or

97
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:29,100
diminish themselves and uh in order to make other people comfortable

98
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:34,140
there's a time for that for sure but the shadow side is that sometimes done too

99
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:40,500
often and so the flip side of that is often not learned in our tradition I think and

100
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:50,480
I could be wrong and you can correct me but what's not really emphasized that often is idea become a strong person

101
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:58,100
maybe even become a powerful person but in what way

102
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:05,399
strong and powerful in yourself

103
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:11,700
for yourself in a certain kind of way over yourself

104
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:17,880
so I'll give you some examples or at least one of uh something that was very small

105
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:25,260
at the time I haven't thought about it for decades but recently I've been thinking about it I said wow that was this represents a real turning

106
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:30,839
point for me in my Buddhist practice that I did this

107
00:11:30,839 --> 00:11:37,140
and uh and how did I come across this idea to do this through this practice

108
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:42,240
and I kind of thought back at my early years my first year when I was kind of a

109
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,360
full-time Zen student so um

110
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:55,680
I was living at the San Francisco Zen Center which is a and they have a farm in Marin

111
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:03,060
County called the green Gulch Farm so I was working as a farm hand there and doing a lot of farm work

112
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:09,380
and one day with another person I had to carry some very heavy equipment

113
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:15,360
from one side of the farm to the other Just the Two of Us

114
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:21,600
and it was kind of a long walk and it was really painful for my hands to hold this it wasn't I don't remember what I

115
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:28,920
was like my arms but really really dug into my hands and I said okay well my attitude oh this

116
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:37,680
is interesting let me see if I can manage this without having any reactivity in my mind

117
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:44,459
can my mind stay at ease well my hands were feeling this pain

118
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:50,220
and so I don't know how well I did I can't proudly say that I succeeded

119
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:56,579
somehow but what I succeeded to do was to to maintain the practice of doing this looking at it looking at my

120
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:02,760
reactivity letting it go trying to decouple the pain in my hand from the

121
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:09,420
state of my mind and this decoupling that I was trying to

122
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:15,480
do there then represented a kind of a continued way in which I practiced where

123
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:22,380
I tried to find a receive my reactivity in my mind and see where I had choice not to give

124
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:28,860
into it not to pick it up to leave it alone and this I think is so where did I learn

125
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:36,500
that and I think I learned it by sitting in meditation that as I sat in meditation

126
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:42,660
there was first a physical Stillness that was hard to learn to do

127
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:48,540
but I had to not give in to the impulse to move move to itch myself or to avoid

128
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:54,300
discomfort and that was a tough thing to learn to not have the physical reactivity to

129
00:13:54,300 --> 00:14:00,899
it but I learned to do that for okay but then the next stage was to you know

130
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:06,660
what you're left with then is kind of like the mind and I discovered how much my mind reacted

131
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:12,060
I discovered that the reactivity of the Mind often made other pain much worse

132
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:18,120
physical pain emotional pain much worse so I learned to watch my mind closely

133
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,959
and see okay let go don't do that don't go along with that go back to the breath go back to here

134
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:31,680
and I was going back to some peaceful place and so over so that so I think that's

135
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:37,740
where I started to learn this what was going on in my mind tracking my mind so when I was carrying this heavy equipment

136
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:43,260
across the farm it had become now a reference point for it not just

137
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:51,540
meditation but in daily life as well to track my mind to see what my mind was doing and to exercise some choice

138
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:56,639
about what goes on in my mind some Choice by what I pursue how I practice

139
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,779
with it what I'm involved in and in some sense uh I was cultivating a

140
00:15:03,779 --> 00:15:10,440
kind of self-control a certain kind of agency uh strength

141
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:18,360
over my reactivity to not give into it my reactivity was strong in itself

142
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:23,820
maybe that was a serpent and I learned to not have the serpent

143
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:29,760
have the upper hand and so then you know

144
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,660
I don't know if that was the first time I really started doing this in daily life with this heavy equipment but it was you know represented a kind of

145
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:43,320
direction that my practice went then that the related track was going on my mind

146
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:52,620
a next phase that happened and after a few more years of Zen practice was that I discovered that as I had this

147
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:58,139
little more control over my mind which meant that not so much that I could then use it

148
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:03,660
assertively or you know you know make something happen in the world

149
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:10,800
that was a power over leaving the Mind alone with not infusing the mind or

150
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:16,139
having the Mind caught up in reactivity that's where the control was

151
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:21,240
and as I I became less and like reactive in my mind

152
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:29,639
I just what became important was love love Compassion Care tenderness that's

153
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:35,220
what kind of there was space now for these other ways of being to a being to

154
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:41,220
well up Wellspring within of a lot of goodness

155
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:46,980
that hadn't had space before because it was crowded out by my

156
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:53,040
reactivity it was crowded out by all the thoughts and stories and ideas and

157
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:58,980
proliferations of imaginations that I had

158
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:05,100
and as those quieted down there was space to feel and sense something deeper

159
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:11,699
Within and it became a very special time at

160
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:19,880
some point or a choice I made at some point where I realized that um that the

161
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:26,880
compassion love kindness was partly a choice

162
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:33,299
not to do it so much but a choice to lose it

163
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:38,820
the choice to lose touch with it was a kind of a subconscious unconscious

164
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:44,520
choice that my mind would make if I gave in to my reactivity

165
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:51,240
if I got caught up in this in the swirling thoughts and ideas and fantasies of my mind that closed that

166
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:56,520
part of me out and so at some point I kind of made a commitment

167
00:17:56,520 --> 00:18:03,840
to love to compassion not because I was going to like work hard now to be compassionate

168
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:10,799
that never was interesting for me but rather I was going to work hard at

169
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:16,799
not covering it over not making not having it have be

170
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:24,960
available for myself for to be flowing through and so over then to over time I learned

171
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:31,440
this wonderful thing that so many different sides and flavors and qualities

172
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:37,380
that are really beautiful to have but it could also be

173
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:43,679
be very strong love can be powerful or maybe say differently

174
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:50,400
love can be matched or be supported by or come along with

175
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:58,380
a kind of inner strength that we learn to carry with us

176
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:04,380
an inner strength that is comparable in daily life to the Buddha statue here the

177
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:10,679
Buddha sitting in meditation practice and sitting upright strong neither assertive

178
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:16,740
nor pulling back neither

179
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:22,740
you know attacking nor afraid neither giving up

180
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:28,799
nor requiring anyone else to give up but very present

181
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:33,960
looking people looking at everyone he has a very soft gaze usually the statues

182
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:39,360
of the Buddha in meditation usually they always have him with his eyes half open

183
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:46,260
and one of the theological bootological theories for that is that Buddha is always connected

184
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:52,020
to the world but with soft eyes a soft gaze

185
00:19:52,020 --> 00:20:00,080
can the strength of and presence of meeting challenges angry people

186
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:08,220
can we have such strength that we can be with soft eyes can we meet anger not with anger

187
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:14,580
but with love so when the Widow fought fire with fire

188
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:19,799
I would suggests that there was two different kinds of Fire

189
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:26,280
maybe the serpent was a fire of anger for the Buddha it was a fire of love

190
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:32,760
and the Buddha said that hatred and anger is never overcome by hatred

191
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,500
it's always overcome by love

192
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:47,160
so can that be something strong and I would emphatically say yes

193
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:54,059
but it's not a strength of reactivity it's not a strength that is so much a

194
00:20:54,059 --> 00:21:02,039
doing except it's a strength of getting out of the way so a natural presence

195
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:09,960
our ability to really be present and state for what's happening has a chance to kind of flower here for

196
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,659
us and be really present in a strong full way

197
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:22,740
I had a neighbor once who was really angry at some noise

198
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:28,020
workers were making and were in the property

199
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:33,360
and came over and yelled at me

200
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:40,620
just came over and yelled at me was very angry Furious it was completely I think unreasonable the whole thing because

201
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:48,720
but anyway was it I don't know exactly why and so I stood there just looking at him

202
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,220
I felt kind of uncomfortable a little bit um a little bit afraid

203
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:00,900
so it wasn't like I was just kind of fearless and uh but I still stood there

204
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:07,679
just I didn't back away I didn't attack I just stood there and looked at him and

205
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,559
I did wonder how long can someone have a monologue like this

206
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:21,679
and then when he finally stopped I just looked at him in calmly and I said

207
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:27,600
you know when you're talking about talking this way I feel afraid

208
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,480
I don't think I was expressing fear but I just it was kind of true but it wasn't like a

209
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:39,240
I just looked at this that's what's happening and in a sense that was my my meeting

210
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:46,880
fire with fire I just said this is what's happening and um

211
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:52,980
he immediately calmed down he immediately kind of apologized and

212
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,559
left and that's the last time that neighbor has yelled at me

213
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:06,480
and we're kind of friends now again but um you know so I think I wouldn't have been

214
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:12,059
able to do that unless I'd learned to track my reactivity to track my fear and

215
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:19,679
how I relate to fear and how fear sometimes gets the upper hand and I believe it and I you know

216
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:26,100
the usual kind of hindrances around fear might have come up it might have been the fear of you know when hindrance is

217
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:32,280
is anger you know to blame him anymore attack and others is shut down another

218
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:39,539
is to get all Restless enough know what to do it's all kinds of things can happen there the reactivity part

219
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:46,380
but uh you know by knowing and tracking my ability how I'm reactive I was able

220
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:51,780
to have how I was be much more the realm of my choice

221
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:57,539
stay here and be here with it I'm not going to give in to these habits

222
00:23:57,539 --> 00:24:04,880
and then I was able to make a wiser choice the one wiser Choice was just stay watch

223
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:16,500
this was I was pretty confident this was not a person who was going to be violent even though the voice was strong

224
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:23,460
but also strength

225
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:29,100
some of you know that Martin Luther King has a wonderful writing on in the book

226
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:36,059
called the strength to love how often do you associate love with

227
00:24:36,059 --> 00:24:41,340
strength how often do you um

228
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:47,820
bring forth something in the family of love all the different qualities that we call a family of love

229
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:54,120
how how often do you bring it forth in a way so it's present in a strong way

230
00:24:54,120 --> 00:25:00,299
not strong because it's infused with what we want desire which is often makes

231
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:06,480
love complicated and which often gives love a lot of strength this like you know

232
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:15,500
because we want something but what is it love that is not entangled with desire

233
00:25:17,659 --> 00:25:23,580
that is offered to the world without assertion

234
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:28,799
without need without wanting something without leaning forward without pulling

235
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:36,659
back but allows us to be very present upright alert

236
00:25:36,659 --> 00:25:44,880
available for the world and available for wisdom and Care flowing up within us

237
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:54,140
so that the wisest part of us can then decide to choose what to do

238
00:25:54,419 --> 00:25:59,580
So lately I've been thinking of this as being a kind of strength

239
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,799
but also I'm thinking maybe to start using the expression self-control which

240
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:12,140
is kind of taboo in our Buddhist scene first because of the word self

241
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:18,059
and second because there's a lot of teachings that don't try to control your experience don't try to control your

242
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:24,840
experience and both these caveats I think are important

243
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:31,919
but sometimes there is very important part of Buddhist practice is in fact being able to control

244
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:39,539
yourself not controlling what happens but controlling the reactivity with

245
00:26:39,539 --> 00:26:46,080
which you respond to what's happening including your reactivity to your

246
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:52,320
reactivity some reactivity you can't it can't help at doing but then at some point we have some

247
00:26:52,320 --> 00:27:00,139
choice some Choice some point we take some control over the situation

248
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:08,900
even if all it is which is not a small thing is I'm going to be mindful of this

249
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:16,200
I'm going to not shoot a second Arrow

250
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:21,900
that's that's taking control that's taking agency that's taking

251
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:27,200
um engaging in the practice

252
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:35,840
and the self part you know is self-control it's a non-philosophical

253
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,620
non-metaphysical self you know it's like

254
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:53,059
if you say I'm gonna I'm gonna go pee that I is not the metaphysical problem

255
00:27:53,059 --> 00:28:00,720
there's no I in Buddhism you can't use that well you could do it

256
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:07,799
for me then you know so it's just kind of that kind of simple way

257
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:13,020
who else is going to care for you take care of all the

258
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:18,120
waste products in your mind don't expect that other people do it for

259
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:23,340
you so um

260
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:28,620
so this wonderful little tale of the Buddha fighting fire with fire

261
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:34,200
which I interpret to be that he fought the fire of hatred

262
00:28:34,200 --> 00:28:39,600
with the fire of love and what does it take for you

263
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:46,020
to have that as a strength so you can match whatever comes your way

264
00:28:46,020 --> 00:28:52,260
with something that's comparablely powerful something that's effective something that matches what comes your

265
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:59,460
way the Buddha and his teachings put a very high value on the this capacity to do

266
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,679
this very high value to do this no matter how

267
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:09,960
difficult the challenges you we have and some of the stories are in the

268
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,179
middle teachings of how to do this are kind of outrageous that you know the challenges that he describes that you

269
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:21,620
should always have loving kindness and and maybe it's religious

270
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:27,899
hyperbole you know that he's talking these examples but it puts an emphasis

271
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:35,520
like wow it is possible to develop oneself it is possible to

272
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:41,880
grow something so that we don't become victims

273
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:48,299
of what life brings but we become you know the

274
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:55,020
the I don't know

275
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:02,240
the first responder that's ready to meet any fire that comes our way

276
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:09,440
with something that can put it out

277
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:18,059
so I hope that uh gave you something to think about and uh

278
00:30:18,059 --> 00:30:23,820
and reflect on and maybe it's a wonderful this idea of this Buddha and

279
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:29,220
the firehouse house is kind of a symbolic kind of tail

280
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,600
that maybe um

281
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:40,799
can be interpreted in other ways or well as well or can it be applied or elaborated if you think about it

282
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:46,640
so maybe you'll do that so um

283
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:53,340
I thought that rather than taking questions today maybe I'd like to suggest those of you

284
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,740
who are willing to stay that you form little groups of maybe three

285
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,840
and and have a little discussion about what this talk has evoked for you

286
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:09,659
and we have about 15 minutes or 10 minutes you know that we so we'll probably take maybe six seven minutes

287
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:14,820
for that and then we'll come back as a big group and then we can take some questions and hear a little bit more

288
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:21,539
and then we'll take a break and then at 11 o'clock we'll have the community meeting so if you don't mind turn to someone

289
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:26,820
near you and three or so people and introduce yourself and and

290
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:34,700
um and if you're not interested in staying then you thank you for being here okay
