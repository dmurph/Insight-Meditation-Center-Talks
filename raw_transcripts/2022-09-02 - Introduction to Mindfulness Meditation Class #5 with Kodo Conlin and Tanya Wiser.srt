1
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:25,840
whoa that is a little loud

2
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,040
yeah i was testing the mic oh that's better thank you so much

3
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:45,680
okay let's test this one it's not very loud is it loud enough

4
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:53,239
not quite yes tracy is it loud enough yeah okay

5
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,439
are any of you concerned about um exposure if i take my mask off while i'm

6
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,520
talking okay

7
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:17,600
all right well it's 6 30. um

8
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,720
so i'll just do a very brief review of where we've been

9
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:31,280
just to help remind the mind like you know what what we've been practicing

10
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:37,840
so first of all just to say what we've done with this series is

11
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,200
we've taken what we normally experience as

12
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:49,439
you know our how we normally perceive and we've invited ourselves to

13
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,079
kind of focus in on different parts of our experience instead of having it

14
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:03,680
all be clumped in together right so it's not that everything isn't still happening

15
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,039
we don't ever stop breathing when we pay attention to mindfulness of the body but

16
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:14,720
rather we're working on choosing what we're focusing on

17
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,160
and giving more of our awareness to that thing one at a time

18
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,840
to help us become more familiar with that part of our experience

19
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,560
so we started with mindfulness of breathing

20
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,000
and we talked about establishing an anchor also with that first week and many people usually we talk about the

21
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,080
breath as an anchor but it doesn't have to be the breath an anchor can be anything that helps you

22
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:51,920
stay present stay aware so sound can be a really great anchor and bodily sensations like

23
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:58,000
the feeling of of sitting right your your the weight and the support and the lift

24
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,760
of the spine so we spent the first week really kind

25
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:09,760
of getting intimate with breathing and with establishing an anchor in the second

26
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,800
week we talked about mindfulness of the body

27
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,519
and for me i like to this idea that the body is a gateway to the present moment

28
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,200
when we're caught up in thinking and things that are going on and we're having a hard time

29
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:32,239
bringing ourselves into the moment by tuning into the experience in the

30
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:40,239
body because sensations are only happening in the present moment right touch only happens here

31
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,280
right so the body is such a great doorway

32
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,640
out of the mind and into life i'll put it that way

33
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:57,360
then the third week we talked about emotions and we practiced with emotions

34
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,439
we talked about being the riverbed and allowing emotions to move through us

35
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:10,159
like the water moves through a river and sometimes we are a small riverbed

36
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,239
sometimes we can be wide and broad and allow pretty much anything to flow through us

37
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:22,479
but to practice with that and the idea that emotions are you know if we measure when they measure

38
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,600
them and they look at the biochemical makeup of an emotion it lasts for

39
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,800
60 seconds 120 160 seconds something like that is about

40
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:40,080
the lifespan of an individual emotion it's different than a mood state

41
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,479
moon states are more prolonged but individual emotions unless we feed them and refuel them

42
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:53,520
re-trigger them they have a short shortish lifespan i can hear my

43
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,879
muffledness is that any better yeah okay

44
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:08,080
and we talked about you know practicing with you know tal how much we can tolerate practicing

45
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,479
letting different experiences move through us like that riverbed and maybe we can't do it for a long time

46
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,639
but for short periods of time trying to just practice letting things flow through

47
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:28,560
letting them move then last week we brought up thinking

48
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:35,039
mindfulness of thinking and we talked about that there's different

49
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,240
ways of thinking there's a narrative thinking where we're

50
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,440
talking to ourselves some people actually see words

51
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:51,360
some people think a lot in images some people

52
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:58,800
have sort of mini movies playing all the time where they can see a lot of stuff playing out in their imagination

53
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:04,880
sometimes our thinking is more uh subtle

54
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,000
um more a little bit of a background hum a little bit of a

55
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:19,039
you know like there's this feeling of something's working in us so sometimes our thoughts aren't

56
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:25,120
so visible or clear or audible depending on how we think

57
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,600
and there also can be a way of thinking that's like holding a view or holding a belief

58
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,478
like i should be doing something right now

59
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,639
so if we if we're kind of walking around with this idea i should be doing it better i

60
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,280
should be doing something it's a way of of thinking that can generate a lot of activity

61
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:56,479
and if we think we need to be doing something it also can proliferate into a

62
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:03,560
lot of other thoughts about what i should be doing yeah

63
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:10,720
another thing that we talked about is that um i'm not my thoughts

64
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:16,800
it's part of our experience just like sensations just like sounds

65
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:23,360
just like emotions things come up and come into our experience

66
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:28,639
and that it's possible to know these experiences to be the knower

67
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,720
instead of the thought or the thinker

68
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,039
another thing we talked about as helpful is using a light noting practice

69
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,319
so if we're trying to attend to the breath in

70
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:52,800
out would be an example of a simple noting we also might think about

71
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,000
naming oh planning so we don't want to get elaborate in our noting we want it

72
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,800
simple we don't want to get caught up in the noting thinking we just want that oh there's a there's a

73
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,039
human kind of thing there's a thought oh and if it has a lot of energy

74
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:19,039
uh last week in the meditation koda talked about the ships right this idea that

75
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,080
we've got this warship you know and then we've got the the

76
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:31,199
dance ship and the you know all these things these kind of big thoughts that come through and so you

77
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,719
can just kind of name the theme of them right and see them

78
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:50,920
koto is there anything you would want to add to uh our last session summary of

79
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,959
yeah that covered a lot of ground i think one thing we've emphasized a lot

80
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:08,480
that bears repeating is that all aspects of experience

81
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,360
can be included in mindfulness practice at its best

82
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:23,839
with mind with mindfulness practice nothing needs to be left out nothing that has arisen has gone wrong

83
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,000
and a corollary of that is that mindfulness practice is impossible to

84
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:38,160
fail at yeah yeah just practicing over and over

85
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:45,040
in this this simple capacity of attention in all the ways that tanya was talking about and we've talked about over these several weeks

86
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,959
but everything gets to be included and that's a great segue to tonight so

87
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:56,959
i'll say something and then we'll go back to this but this idea we've been breaking up our experience

88
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:02,399
and what we're attending to but it's not that everything else is stopping

89
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:08,240
right we're we're just trying to kind of get more intimately uh connected to the

90
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:14,640
certain kinds of experiences and that they're all kind of actually distinct in some ways and then they get really

91
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:19,920
kind of tangled up together and so tonight we'll do a practice that

92
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:25,839
invites you with this idea of having that anchor to step back and once you get kind of

93
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:31,600
settled to let different things come up and to be mindful of them and not to be

94
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,800
working to just track thinking or emotions or the body or breathing

95
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:47,839
so before we do that we want to give some time for reflection on your homework your practice this last week

96
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,720
what did you notice was there anything that you know came up

97
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,800
you know as you were working with thinking that you know you were able to pull up some of the stuff that we talked

98
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,839
about in class and have it support you anything you struggled with i'm hoping you were sitting even if it's

99
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,959
a little bit you know most days so

100
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:18,160
does anybody have anything they want to share or ask

101
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,079
great

102
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:32,320
i wanted to share um that i feel grateful

103
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,079
sort of yeah okay

104
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,680
hello okay much better thanks um i feel grateful that um

105
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:48,800
that's um another tool that i've been conscious of using is

106
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,160
being mindful of my thoughts or noticing if i'm thinking

107
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:01,200
and i think that um it's helping me to feel more free because uh when i notice that i'm

108
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:06,880
thinking then i can go back to a space of just

109
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,480
feeling the feeling in my chest or feeling feelings in my heart

110
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,440
or my torso and yeah i feel like it's peaceful

111
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:24,639
and i can be free from thinking at least for some time so yeah

112
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:29,760
i appreciate you teaching us that great

113
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:36,000
great i always i this happiness happiness is here

114
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,200
that's great anyone else it doesn't have to be great

115
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:47,519
news you can also share what's not working or an instruction they were like tanya what were you talking about

116
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,800
you know it's oh it's all welcome

117
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:02,560
so very close oh because of the mask i guess

118
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:08,480
i noticed that

119
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,560
i don't meditate with a mask on very often so i notice that it's a different

120
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:21,920
experience with the whole focusing on the breath thing and having it feel warm

121
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,920
against your it's just different so i'm

122
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:33,200
appreciating the opportunity to learn

123
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:39,680
other things to focus on other than just the breath because of course that's the first thing we learn

124
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:46,639
right is focus on the breath but focusing on the breath can make me feel hot and

125
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:53,519
you know uncomfortable so i i am appreciating

126
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:58,720
learning how to use other things to focus on

127
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:04,240
great what have you found helpful tracy is there something else that you've you

128
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,880
know so uh number one opening my eyes makes a difference and

129
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,760
and that just seems counterintuitive to everything that you're taught about meditation but what i did last week when

130
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:25,839
i was feeling that way is opened my eyes and focused on this sky and trees and window

131
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:31,920
which helped me feel less warm and

132
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:39,199
i don't know it's it's a strange thing for me to meditate with a mask on let's just put it that way yeah

133
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:42,600
thank you tracy

134
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,720
anybody else

135
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:08,560
anything you want to say before i move to the next

136
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:13,839
okay okay so um i'm going to

137
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:19,040
talk about a couple of things leading into kind of how to

138
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,639
work with open awareness practice

139
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,800
and we talked about one of the things that we talked about when we talked about mindfulness of the body was

140
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,320
um the idea of watching like a football game without a narrator turning the

141
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:42,720
sound off right so this idea of how to be with our direct experience without doing a lot of

142
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,120
adding perceptions and narrating kind of trying to be more simple and direct

143
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:55,279
right and that's very helpful um it's very helpful to do that it keeps

144
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,600
everything a little bit more simple um but you know our minds

145
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:07,839
our minds construct things so i i um i brought a flower to share with you

146
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:13,600
tonight and um you know it's a it's it's a pretty

147
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:20,639
enough flower right and um you know just sort of get to enjoy this

148
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:28,320
beautiful little flower yeah and just take it in for a minute see what you notice about it

149
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,680
how much you like it or you know yeah

150
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:39,199
so i have this flower and

151
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:42,800
i also have this flower

152
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:52,320
so when i bring this flower up how does it affect how you see this

153
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:59,040
flower does this flower become more beautiful

154
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,839
less beautiful does this flower become a big flower and this one becomes a small flower

155
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,678
right so how you know the color oh that's a vibrant pink that's kind of a dull pink

156
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,319
whereas this was just pink before right

157
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,159
yeah and then

158
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,079
i also have this flower

159
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:35,360
and so does this flower still seem big when i have this flower it might am i not

160
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:41,679
all of a sudden maybe this flower seems like oh it's just a lot of little flowers

161
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:48,240
but it was big before and this seemed quite vibrant perhaps

162
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,039
and now maybe it seems muted

163
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:04,400
so this happens automatically and all the time

164
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:11,039
and if i just brought this flower up and shared it with you and talked about how beautiful it was you probably would

165
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:17,039
have just been right along with me for the ride yeah and now

166
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:22,159
seeing these is it a little bit hard to be excited about this one

167
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,440
you know not because we don't want to be but it it's when we start to cluster and

168
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:36,240
compare the mind is automatically creating little hierarchies and valuing this more

169
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:42,320
than another and having these thoughts and oh well this one where you can see it's kind of all you know all of this

170
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:49,280
extra extra stuff so this is a an example of

171
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:55,840
that narration that happens in the mind and how much it can really change our

172
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:01,679
experience of the same thing one minute something can be

173
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:08,799
remarkable and then next not worthy of any attention at all just

174
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:15,360
because of a subtle shift or a comparison or a narration a way that we're talking about it all of a sudden

175
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,400
and describing in our own minds so

176
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:27,280
the opposite is just trying to be with a direct experience in this really simple way

177
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:32,720
that's why it's so good to just do the simple noting coolness

178
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:38,160
warmth sound instead of annoying car alarm

179
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:43,919
going on out there how dare they do that what's the sound pollutions going on right

180
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:51,440
it can just be sound or it can be this whole other thing

181
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,160
and if we can let it just be sound it there's probably a lot less suffering

182
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:04,480
certainly less aversion and if it was sound that i liked it might be that i'm not i'm not having as

183
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:11,440
much greed or desire right there we go high sound

184
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,559
sound arising

185
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:23,600
all right so um with this open awareness practice

186
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,960
let's see i'm just needing to orient to time here

187
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:35,000
okay let me talk about a few things first more things

188
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:41,120
so when you you know you've been coming

189
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,158
now most of you right everybody's been here

190
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:52,159
and you've been practicing and uh

191
00:20:52,159 --> 00:21:01,960
do you feel more mindful than you did when you started yes does anybody feel like you're not sure

192
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:10,960
sometimes we feel less mindful and do you know why that might be

193
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:16,080
we're actually more aware of all the extra stuff that's happening

194
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:21,280
we're more aware of all this added chatter and stuff that's going on

195
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:28,640
and we're trying to be mindful and so we're struggling and or maybe we're judging and all this stuff makes it even

196
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:34,240
kind of we get to see what the mind the gymnastics the mind does when it's you

197
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:39,360
know comparing and wanting this instead of that

198
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:45,760
okay so

199
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,760
that's one part that we've been working on but trust me you are you're growing your strength

200
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,120
just coming here if you come here and you try and do the guided practices and you you're trying to track even if

201
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,640
you're not practicing formally during the week you are you are being changed

202
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:09,039
you are you are growing something inside of yourself because it's it's in us anyway this

203
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:14,320
capacity is innate we just need to grow strengthen it learn

204
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,640
it tune into it create more room for it and sometimes when we practice open

205
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:25,840
awareness it can feel like

206
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:31,200
you know we're i'll just tell you now so this there's a here's a great image for

207
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,880
this practice which is to imagine a small little cottage one room cottage

208
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:43,120
with a door some windows no fancy anything just a chair in the

209
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:49,360
middle nice cozy chair recliner a little bit not too cozy you fall asleep but you

210
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,480
know something solid and that's all that's in this room

211
00:22:54,480 --> 00:23:00,240
and the practice of open awareness is like sitting down in that chair

212
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:06,559
and letting things come up like things come

213
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,600
up to the window like you see a bird flying by but you stay in the chair you don't get

214
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:17,039
up every time you see a bird out the window you stay in the chair and you're aware

215
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:23,919
of bird thought emotion might come to the door

216
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:29,280
and you stay in the chair and the emotion might come in and leave

217
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:35,360
but the idea is kind of letting things pop up visit come and go

218
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:40,880
while you stay in the chair does that make sense

219
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,679
so when we're doing this practice it might feel like there's just one thing after another after another

220
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:53,360
every window and doors being you know popped into and or it's just you know

221
00:23:53,360 --> 00:24:00,799
it can feel like that and that's still the practice and it also can feel like

222
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:06,720
there's just this huge vast open space

223
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:14,559
and you know it's like it's just this is going

224
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,480
this is over here like it can feel like there's just lots of spaciousness not much is

225
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,840
happening can feel like you know one can feel like oh that's a squirrel oh there's a bird

226
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:31,120
oh it's a bluebird the other one can feel more like oh there's something flying

227
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:36,159
you know just it can be very different our experiences so it's not like there's

228
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:42,000
any right way to be aware with this practice

229
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:47,158
okay they're both fine

230
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:52,480
all right how do you feel about doing a little practice

231
00:24:53,600 --> 00:25:01,520
so we'll start by finding an anchor we'll start by

232
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:07,600
getting grounded in our bodies and

233
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:14,159
that that will will give ourselves time right to just just settle let the mind

234
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,759
quiet slow down a little bit if it wants to

235
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,440
so taking your time and richard maybe the air conditioning you want to bump it

236
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:31,600
up a little bit so it's not too too cold yep i see a sweater going on

237
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,720
so yeah getting comfortable need your sweater on off you know

238
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:42,159
how do you want to be sitting now we're going to sit for about 15 minutes

239
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:48,960
so finding a posture that you feel comfortable that you can sustain feels awake

240
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,240
but settled like a chair where you can sit back in a

241
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:01,120
little bit you don't need to lean forward you can just sit back just a little

242
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:08,320
and let experience start to become more clear

243
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:14,400
and so whatever your anchor is if it's the breath if it's sound

244
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:22,600
if it's just gazing just getting connected to your anchor

245
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:35,440
just noticing if there's a tension any stress in the body

246
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:41,039
maybe even a holding and you might need to okay i gotta lift my shoulders up i need

247
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:46,159
to roll them back i need to take a few conscious deep

248
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:51,440
breaths we're gonna support ourselves in settling

249
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,240
that's part of the work of mindfulness it's a gift we're giving ourselves to

250
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:05,158
take the time feeling our feet

251
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:13,760
our bottoms is tuning in to what it's like to be

252
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:20,120
here right now in this body right here

253
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,640
is there ease and dis-ease and if there's dis-ease it's okay

254
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:31,600
give it permission to be here just take care of yourself

255
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:38,000
if there's ease can you rest into it a little bit

256
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,559
you might just do a little brief body scan

257
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:54,639
feeling into or breathing into places where you might be holding a little

258
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:01,840
invitationally invitationally inviting a softening or relaxing

259
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:09,720
if that part feels so inclined

260
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:23,799
taking as much time with each each place that you can encounter as needed

261
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:35,200
it can be helpful to just notice the forehead

262
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:43,919
jaw these are areas we hold a lot of tension

263
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:49,600
sometimes we just need a little bit of a awareness a little bit of an invitation

264
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,799
to like oh it's okay eyebrows you don't have to pinch together

265
00:28:54,799 --> 00:29:00,480
well that's my efforting to try and be a mindful okay all right relax a little bit if you'd

266
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,480
like

267
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:45,679
and when you feel maybe settled enough maybe tune in to the experience of

268
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:48,799
hearing sounds

269
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,480
you might be able to hear the air conditioning a fan

270
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,279
a car driving by

271
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:13,679
you might be able to hear the sound of someone else breathing or even your own breath

272
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:19,520
sometimes there's the experience of even hearing our own heartbeats

273
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:26,320
just receiving whatever sounds arrive in your ears

274
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:35,000
sort of sitting back and allowing them to come to you

275
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:53,440
maybe bringing your awareness back to whatever your anchor is if it's not sound

276
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:00,279
attending to sensations

277
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,559
wherever it's easiest to stay present with them

278
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,159
maybe even just thinking about like three breaths in a row just this sort of

279
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:30,880
a a the breath feeling

280
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,960
or sensation or if you're using sight it might just

281
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:45,640
be you know the subtle moving of leaves

282
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,840
and if the timing feels right if you feel a little bit settled

283
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:19,118
you can let go of the deliberate energy of attending to your anchor

284
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:25,040
if the breathing is still prominent great that's fine

285
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,480
but it's the letting go of the deliberate focus

286
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,158
it's that sitting back a little bit into the chair

287
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:42,878
broadening the awareness a little bit to allow

288
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,358
the mind to just sort of witness the awareness to witness things as they arise

289
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:52,919
and pass away

290
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:16,480
whatever is most clear just allowing that to become

291
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,760
the primary focus

292
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:30,760
it might be a sensation or sound an attitude

293
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:37,119
there's no one kind of experience that's right or wrong

294
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,200
awareness can meet each experience as it arises

295
00:35:43,359 --> 00:35:48,800
and mindfulness can know it directly in that simple way

296
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,920
we talked about directly knowing

297
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:04,480
and then as whatever primary experience is happening fades away

298
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:11,839
something else may become more prominent and you can allow your awareness to

299
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:19,200
receive that everything can be included

300
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:27,440
knowing it simply just allowing the awareness to be

301
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,520
easeful receptive that's sitting back in that chair that

302
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:37,880
feeling of resting back

303
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:34,720
and if you find yourself getting lost in thought or fantasy or planning

304
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:40,640
or maybe the mind becomes vague kind of sleepy

305
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:47,280
it can be helpful to return your attention back a little bit more effortful way to your

306
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:55,040
anchor just establishing a little more clarity a little more connection

307
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:01,040
or you might just try the mental noting just see if that helps with a little

308
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,280
more clarity

309
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:25,680
there's two minutes left in the practice and i just sometimes it's helpful to know oh

310
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:32,800
can i just sit back and relax for two minutes and allow or two breaths

311
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:40,480
and just allow the little things to appear and disappear being simple

312
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,920
allowing whatever arises to arise

313
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,000
everything can be welcomed and known

314
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:22,039
just as the night sky is spacious

315
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:30,720
the moon can appear stars come

316
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:39,000
awareness can be like that too a vast field holding it all

317
00:40:53,140 --> 00:41:02,010
[Music]

318
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,119
so

319
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:30,480
i'd love to hear what happened inside your mind

320
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,078
anybody willing to share

321
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:51,359
hello good evening i just felt like my brain and my thoughts were just like scattered marbles and

322
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:57,680
just everything was everywhere and then just trying to anchor

323
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:04,640
you know go back to the breath to anchor everything but it was just so many things going on and

324
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:10,400
and then you feel kind of feel i was feeling kind of defeated by this practice not from what we've been doing

325
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,599
just just for myself like oh i let this get to me again or i'm letting other people's thoughts

326
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:24,640
invade my own and i don't know who to listen to or if i should it's just

327
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:31,599
so if i just feel so defeated right now no but it's okay it's okay

328
00:42:31,599 --> 00:42:38,400
oh yeah thank you for sharing thank you for sharing who of us can't say we've been discouraged

329
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:43,599
um yeah i heard i heard there's a there's a

330
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:48,880
lot happening mentally a lot of mental activity um

331
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:54,240
sort of two paths of inquiry come up from you one is like that could just be a really full day

332
00:42:54,240 --> 00:43:00,480
yeah it could be a lot going on and then um

333
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:08,079
what's our relationship to that what's our relationship to um the the mind being like a bubble machine

334
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,520
pop pop that's something else

335
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:19,440
something else that comes to mind to share with you is that as we um as we start to practice i heard

336
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,960
i recently heard this liken to like polishing a floor if you never mop the floor i don't know

337
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:30,319
if any of you have gone through phases like this i did when i was in college i didn't mop the floor very much

338
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:37,040
you don't even notice when you drop something on the floor you can't even see it but if you frequently

339
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:43,040
are polishing the floor you'll see like the tiniest thing so we decided so we as a group have

340
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:49,359
decided we're gonna sit down and be aware and be attentive of what's coming up it's like we're

341
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:54,880
polishing the floor and then we see so much more so much more

342
00:43:54,880 --> 00:44:00,079
anyway my my heart is with you please um borrow some of my confidence if you need it

343
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:04,520
thank you very much sure

344
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:18,000
so the idea of mindfulness practice is something you

345
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:24,000
can't do wrong i think i can accept that but there's always this part of me that's

346
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,920
thinking well i'm not doing it wrong but you know i want to

347
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,440
i'm not getting as much of a fruitfulness out of it like you know i think it could be better it

348
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:41,280
could be worse so i see that judgment coming up a lot so it's like yeah you're not doing it

349
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:47,520
wrong but you're [Music] still kind of wasting your time here you know it's just like it just

350
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:52,800
this bypasses that and just i just start thinking like you know you know

351
00:44:52,800 --> 00:45:00,000
i could be doing this more fruitfully and that's the thought coming up a lot

352
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:07,040
i got an idea great um

353
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:13,599
yeah my first impulse is to normalize the uh the i think part of what you're describing

354
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:19,839
like doubting doubting if the practice is working or like am i doing it right or like what am i getting

355
00:45:19,839 --> 00:45:25,119
out of it it's so normal that there's like there's a

356
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:31,440
particular buddhist name for it it's like so it's so common to the meditative experience that

357
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,920
the name of doubt has been given to this this whole collection of like

358
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:43,119
oh maybe that maybe i didn't understand the instructions or um who are these people telling me about

359
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:48,400
this anyway and you know all of these um this sort of like

360
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:55,359
b-side track that's going on next door to attention that's telling us about how the practice isn't going right

361
00:45:55,359 --> 00:46:02,640
um the you've got a couple ways that we can practice with this one i mean the first

362
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:08,880
one you're already so attentive to it like you you see that it's happening clearly i know it seems counterintuitive but

363
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:15,359
that's a moment of mindfulness it's like a moment of clear recognition

364
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:21,839
just like we were talking about a couple weeks ago could be interesting to could be interesting to like follow the

365
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:28,319
follow the path back and see if there's something in the body or some physical sensation or emotion

366
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:33,680
underneath and see if you can experience it on that level too

367
00:46:33,680 --> 00:46:40,560
i think what you'll find over time is like the that b side track may still continue to

368
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:45,680
be there but you've also got some other information about

369
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:51,119
how things are developing or growing or changing yeah thank you

370
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:57,119
i'll just i'll just add the flower story right

371
00:46:57,119 --> 00:47:03,359
so you you describe mindfulness a flower

372
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:10,480
can you just be with the experience without comparing it to the other flowers

373
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:18,240
right it's too much i'm not you know like i'm not getting it's not good enough

374
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:24,400
can it just be the flower that it is without all the added

375
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:29,000
does that make sense yes

376
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:50,078
so what i noticed was that

377
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:56,400
my body needed attention once i was quiet enough to listen yeah i

378
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:02,880
felt like my head had been scrunched up all day and my neck and my

379
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:10,079
my shoulders needed some some attention and i wouldn't have

380
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:17,119
noticed that unless i was sitting quietly and paying attention

381
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:25,520
that's what came up for me thank you thank you for sharing could i ask how did you know how to

382
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:30,720
what language did the body use to let you know uh

383
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:38,800
i felt this is going to sound strange i felt like i had a headache in my face

384
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,960
once i was quiet enough i think you said something about the forehead

385
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,640
and i realized that i feel like i was scrunching up my forehead all day and

386
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:57,839
then once i finally said you're scrunching up your forehead and you know

387
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:03,839
just try to breathe into it and relax then i realized oh and and your neck is

388
00:49:03,839 --> 00:49:11,920
also a little tense so being quiet helped me to focus

389
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:17,838
enough to hear that my body needed some attention

390
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:24,480
yeah thank you so much some really really good uh clear attentiveness there and and in

391
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:31,359
addition to clear attendance like the instinct of care that is such a thing to appreciate

392
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:37,200
instinctive care for yourself thank you thank you

393
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:48,800
um so at the at the risk of having sort of a

394
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:54,160
bummer comment um what i noticed uh during this practice period

395
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:59,280
was the closer i got to like open awareness or what i'm assuming is open awareness

396
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:05,920
the more i also felt like a kind of rising level of fear just kind of like

397
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:12,000
what happens like when you have like open awareness or like what other things come up

398
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,520
so that was my experience

399
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:23,520
how did you work with that i just kind of

400
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:28,800
stuck with it i guess i i remember from like the uh

401
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:35,200
emotions um meeting we had it sometimes you can just kind of like stay with it like how does

402
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:41,200
it feel like what are the like i don't know contours of it look at that helps but

403
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,160
fear is so powerful right and um

404
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:52,480
we just it's almost like we're afraid of fear itself so it can

405
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:58,480
it can grow quickly in our our minds you know

406
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:04,960
so um i i really still like that idea of

407
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:12,240
having the what are the name of those shoes with the big thick soles

408
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:18,640
no um doc martin doc martin oh yeah yeah you know like you know just remembering

409
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:25,040
that awareness is like the doc martens and if we stay grounded you know that

410
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:31,839
the electricity of fear doesn't have to kind of keep pulsing through us

411
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:38,240
you know and it sounds very skillful to direct your awareness toward the sensations

412
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:44,640
because it's so much of the what feeds fear is the story

413
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:50,400
you know that what we're imagining oh no and uh

414
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:57,760
so it sounds like you worked with that really skillfully and um it's also common for fear to come up

415
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:03,040
just to say it's not you know like it's a good thing to start to practice

416
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:05,839
with

417
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:21,040
any i don't know if there's anyone on youtube writing in comments richard no okay

418
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:26,480
all right anyone else want to share anything or

419
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:33,000
we're good to move on great

420
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:56,000
so i one of the things i appreciate about

421
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:05,040
having time for reports and q a is that we get to share with each other this whole array of experiences

422
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:12,240
it's like uh it can really at any given time it can seem like a wildly different experience it's happening

423
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:18,640
this person's sitting next to me but something that it highlights or emphasizes to me is

424
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,920
um sometimes our attention is directed to an emotion sometimes it's directed to a thought

425
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:32,400
sometimes to the breathing sometimes to the body directly the scope is so broad

426
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:39,440
and when we're practicing this open awareness practice you know sometimes it feels like we can

427
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:46,240
get a little scattered and as tanya was saying we come back to the anchor come back to the anchor

428
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:51,040
steady ourselves center ourselves calm ourselves

429
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:58,559
and when we think about extending the practice further same sort of motion applies

430
00:53:58,559 --> 00:54:03,920
the the meditation seat can be our anchor

431
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:10,720
it's the place we come back to steady ourselves settle ourselves

432
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:16,559
and the line between the edge of your meditation say matt if you're on a mat or a chair

433
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:23,359
and the rest of your life it's pretty arbitrary isn't it

434
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:30,160
pretty arbitrary uh the the line between meditation

435
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:35,760
and applying clear attention in the rest of our lives it's pretty fuzzy it's

436
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:41,440
pretty fuzzy what this opens up is that we can open up we can open our practice we can extend

437
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:47,839
it we can move it into the rest of our lives really common for uh people starting to meditate to

438
00:54:47,839 --> 00:54:53,520
ask the question okay kind of getting getting a hang of this meditation thing maybe

439
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,720
what about the rest of my life so just a few a few thoughts about

440
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:06,640
practicing in daily life first thing i'd like to share is that um

441
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:13,839
in the spirit of softening the the perceived boundary between your meditation seat and the rest of your life

442
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:20,559
is that your mind and your body go with you wherever you go when you're seated you're practicing

443
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,920
with your mind and body it's that same mind and body in a manner of speaking

444
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:32,078
in another buddhist manner of speaking we might say it's a totally different mind and body every moment

445
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:40,400
but the same mind and body gets up off the cushion and extends the practice

446
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:46,079
i think what's important here to emphasize when we're on the cushion so to speak

447
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:52,319
cultivating attention cultivating clarity and these other wholesome qualities

448
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:58,640
and those same qualities don't disappear when you stand up we can keep practicing these same

449
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:03,839
same qualities of clear attention open-heartedness letting go

450
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,200
steadiness kindness

451
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:16,160
yeah very commonly meditation is associated with sitting it's like the icon the icon of

452
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,520
meditation as a silhouette of a meditating figure

453
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:27,200
um [Music] and there are good reasons that meditation is associated with sitting

454
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:32,319
like that we we've seen over the course of these weeks like how

455
00:56:32,319 --> 00:56:37,760
stillness cultivates our attention so

456
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:43,760
strong i think that's like a strong endorsement for seated meditation practice or still

457
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:49,280
meditation practice and

458
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:54,720
the practice extends to all we call four four noble postures

459
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:00,480
sitting standing walking

460
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:05,680
lying down um

461
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:14,079
to give you something of the flavor of like how old this notion is of all the different activities you can include and

462
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:20,480
mindfulness practice there's this text that that's something like the the foundational instructions

463
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:26,319
for uh insight insight practices that we've been doing and there's a section called the section

464
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:31,760
on full awareness and it says something like

465
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:38,799
practitioner acts in full awareness when going forward and returning

466
00:57:38,799 --> 00:57:44,480
acts in full awareness when looking ahead and looking away

467
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:50,079
acts in full awareness when flexing and extending the limbs

468
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:56,559
acts in full awareness when wearing robes carrying the robin bowl

469
00:57:56,559 --> 00:58:02,720
or eating drinking consuming food and tasting

470
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:09,920
acts in full awareness when defecating and urinating acts in full awareness when walking standing sitting falling

471
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:16,640
asleep waking up talking and keeping silent

472
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:23,640
i wonder if we left anything out is there anything we left out

473
00:58:24,559 --> 00:58:30,319
surely something but yeah i hope i hope you can get a sense of like

474
00:58:30,319 --> 00:58:35,440
the scope we can apply it we can apply this mindfulness practice

475
00:58:35,440 --> 00:58:41,359
everywhere so some of the ways that we start to work that skill

476
00:58:41,359 --> 00:58:46,880
it's like as we're uh as we've been talking about one of the central metaphors for these weeks is

477
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,480
this notion of concentric breathing in the middle body emotions

478
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:58,960
thinking open awareness if we extend further

479
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:05,119
some of the things that can be really helpful is uh trying out little by little

480
00:59:05,119 --> 00:59:10,880
if we uh if we have the uh have the idea okay now this today i'm gonna be completely mindful from the time i wake

481
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:17,440
up to the time i go to sleep and i'm not gonna miss a moment i'm probably gonna maybe get frustrated if that's my karma

482
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:23,280
or disappointed if that's my karma or my tendency

483
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:28,960
but start small one of the ways that when i was living in monasteries one of the ways that this

484
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:34,799
really worked well was that there's a right after right after meditation often there is a very

485
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:41,440
short period of silent cleaning it doesn't matter what the activity is it could be cleaning that's so great for

486
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,559
mindfulness but the idea of getting up off the meditation cushion

487
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:53,119
and rather than going straight to the phone or straight to a conversation do something silent

488
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:59,040
with your body and be a body be a body doing an activity and there's a way that that can help

489
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:05,839
bridge stillness and activity another way to do extend mindfulness

490
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:10,960
from the cushion into daily life have some other activities that are particular throughout your day that

491
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:17,520
remind you to be mindful um one thing that i will do is

492
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:24,799
before i cross a threshold in a door oftentimes i will i'll pause just for a second and feel

493
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:31,359
it's a moment to check in with my body and feel how i am in this room and then i step through and i feel myself feel

494
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:36,400
again so i get two check-ins back-to-back and there's something about something

495
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:42,559
about that that works for me you might have other cues like you could

496
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:48,960
set a timer to go off at random times throughout your day if you want to do that just a pause and have a brief moment of

497
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:54,559
mindfulness take not han of course is well known for

498
01:00:54,559 --> 01:01:01,200
for um talking about the the practice of mindfulness while washing dishes

499
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:07,599
there's so much so much tactile data to sink into

500
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:14,480
and be there with the warmth and the suds and the dishes he used to say just do the dishes to do

501
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:20,799
the dishes instead instead of taking that time to plan or

502
01:01:20,799 --> 01:01:26,160
think about something else just be there i think in a nutshell when it comes to

503
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:31,359
finding little ways to practice in daily life we can do a little better than than the

504
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:36,480
old slogan of be here now finding tiny moments to be here now in

505
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,640
your day

506
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:50,319
so the noble postures

507
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:56,160
sitting standing lying down i'm going to get up off the cushion and

508
01:01:56,160 --> 01:02:01,520
where i'm going to demonstrate walking meditation here in a moment

509
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:08,160
the reason why we want to introduce walking is that um maybe you've noticed as we as we've gone

510
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:14,160
along how the continuity how the the momentum of the tension sort of builds

511
01:02:14,319 --> 01:02:21,680
you might notice this in a sitting it can be a nice thing to do if you're looking for ways to

512
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:27,839
help establish your practice further you're sort of inspired by what we've been doing here one of the things you can do is set aside some time to do a

513
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:33,040
period of sitting followed by a period of walking followed by a period of sitting if he

514
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:38,480
wanted to do that but walking meditation bringing

515
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:44,720
bringing this full attention and awareness to the moving body in the same way that we do when we're on

516
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:51,440
the cushion um i find i find actually sometimes i get

517
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:56,559
even more concentrated doing walking meditation than i do with seated meditation

518
01:02:56,559 --> 01:03:02,880
something about the rhythm of the movement keeps me here the sensations that i'm that i'm tuning

519
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:07,680
into um

520
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:14,640
walking meditation can also be useful to balance our energy there might be times where it's hard to meditate more

521
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:19,920
really sleepy walking meditation can be a nice alternative

522
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:26,160
to bring up the energy a little bit help balance i also find it's a really useful

523
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:32,640
transition practice sometimes i'll just do maybe five minutes of walking before my seated

524
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:38,559
meditation and there's a way that um there's a way that for me if especially

525
01:03:38,559 --> 01:03:44,799
if my mind is busy say the at the end of the day my mind will take to walking meditation

526
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:52,480
more easily for a few minutes and that can be like a way to coast into sitting practice after settling

527
01:03:52,799 --> 01:03:58,079
just some thoughts about that uh so let me show you how we do it in

528
01:03:58,079 --> 01:04:05,760
this in this tradition luckily i have a walking meditation path outlined in blue right here on the floor

529
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:10,838
you'll see this

530
01:04:16,480 --> 01:04:21,680
yeah pretty simple what you want to do

531
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:30,880
choose your path ideally maybe 30ish steps at least 10 or 30 feet at

532
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:37,440
least 10 steps and i'll start on one end

533
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:43,839
and i'll pause and set up my posture see if i'm aligned i'm steady

534
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:50,640
take a few deep breaths and let myself know oh here i am i'm here i'm standing

535
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:55,838
and then it's simple it's just as simple as it sounds

536
01:04:56,480 --> 01:05:02,078
once the attention is established in the body beginning to walk

537
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:08,720
and we're not going anywhere can be little steps some people take

538
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:14,400
really little steps some people take a longer step

539
01:05:14,400 --> 01:05:21,640
the pace can vary find the pace the backup

540
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:28,160
find the pace that encourages the feeling of ease for you

541
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:33,760
for now and that will change interesting thing is the mind gets more concentrated sometimes the body tends to

542
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,480
get smaller or like the steps get smaller and slower

543
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:45,119
so start at one end do this thing that this thing that is probably common to many of our day which

544
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:52,319
is walking just attending to the body as the anchor

545
01:05:52,960 --> 01:06:00,799
once the attention is in the body let this let the let the sensations of the feet and the legs be the anchor

546
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:06,319
and then we meditate in just the same way that we have been if something more compelling comes up and draws the

547
01:06:06,319 --> 01:06:12,079
attention away you can pause attend to that thing

548
01:06:12,079 --> 01:06:20,798
feeling emotion thought and then when that's finished come back to your anchor which is the walking body

549
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,480
a couple more things about the form so walking along nice and easy come to the

550
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:34,559
end of your walking path just pause stop i turn around

551
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:40,480
pause i'm taking ev the pauses i'm taking every opportunity to come back into my

552
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:46,240
body because uh there's a there's a way that the attention can drift

553
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:51,599
you know walking is so commonplace for us and often it

554
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:58,839
when i get to the end of the path and i pause it brings me right back yeah simple enough so

555
01:06:58,839 --> 01:07:04,640
turn walk back at the pace of ease

556
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:12,720
and again some people do hands in pockets some cross their arms or behind the back anything

557
01:07:12,839 --> 01:07:19,039
works think that may be all i wanted to say about how to walk

558
01:07:19,039 --> 01:07:22,039
yeah

559
01:07:28,799 --> 01:07:31,119
sure

560
01:07:39,359 --> 01:07:46,319
thank you how's the volume is that okay great

561
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:53,960
how about how about now great

562
01:07:58,799 --> 01:08:06,559
okay so we'll have some time uh if there are any questions about walking practice

563
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:13,680
we will have time for that right at the end but i want to i want to carry on with this idea of um

564
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:19,120
a question that a lot of us come may be coming up for a lot of us as we come to the close of the these five

565
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:25,758
weeks what now where do we go from here um

566
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:33,359
yeah maybe maybe actually what's coming up in my heart is to pause and appreciate that

567
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:40,000
uh that we have come to this point in the in the in the class the course together

568
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:47,679
it feels really good i feel like we've done a lot of wholesome activity together wow i'm appreciative for the

569
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:53,359
the attention and the sincerity and the the work that's gone into it and my

570
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:58,400
my hope is that something useful has come into your life

571
01:08:58,400 --> 01:09:04,798
as a result whether that's meditation or you found something useful that you heard that is

572
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:09,759
uh framed your experience in a way that you appreciate

573
01:09:09,839 --> 01:09:15,520
so from i mean taking that taking that that wholesome wholesome sense

574
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:22,159
what do we want to grow with it so some of the some of the ways we can grow some of the ways we can grow this

575
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:28,238
where do we go from here um is we have so many activities at imc

576
01:09:28,239 --> 01:09:33,600
so many opportunities for practice there are these um

577
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:39,199
we're all pretty savvy online i imagine and can see insight meditationcenter.org

578
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:45,120
for the full array but some things i want to highlight there's the

579
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:51,520
sunday morning talk it's a sit and a talk it's a little bit longer than we've been sitting here

580
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:57,679
35 minutes and then then a dharma talk something i like about these is

581
01:09:57,679 --> 01:10:03,280
community they're available online but they're also available here and many of us know

582
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:08,800
the benefit of being together sitting together talking together plus the the informal things

583
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:15,280
that happen after monday nights longer sitting

584
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:20,320
probably silent 45 minutes sitting

585
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:26,560
it seems like a really long time when i say it something i found myself saying

586
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:32,960
frequently recently is that i remember it took me a long time before i could even before i could sit 20 minutes and

587
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:38,960
that felt like a really big milestone and 45 minutes felt like no way no way ever

588
01:10:38,960 --> 01:10:45,600
but just little by little you know a couple minutes at a time yeah

589
01:10:45,600 --> 01:10:50,640
so the difference sits sunday and monday um some of you may be familiar with the

590
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:58,480
the sittings that are happening on youtube in the mornings yeah gil gil does a lot of them uh 7am

591
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:05,120
7am sitting 7 30 talk it's usually like a 12 or 15 minute talk and it's usually on

592
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:10,960
a theme for the week these are so good great way to start the day i

593
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:16,719
find myself doing it around the time that i'm making breakfast

594
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:23,840
there's an afternoon evening sitting on usually on zoom happy hour

595
01:11:23,840 --> 01:11:29,280
loving kindness practice or brahma-vihara practice he's like so such nourishing heart

596
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:34,640
practices in the spirit of sangha or in the spirit

597
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:40,640
of community something i want to say is you'll notice on the website that there are a number of groups

598
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:46,480
i love the way that that the mindfulness communities sort of like weave into

599
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:53,840
weave into these like subgroups and then weave into each other grow and shrink

600
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:58,960
but there's there's any number from support groups to affinity groups

601
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:04,800
of other types uh buddhism in the 12 steps that happens on sunday nights

602
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:10,159
there's an lgbtqia group that meets um

603
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:15,440
there's a support group for folks who are practicing with life-threatening or chronic illness

604
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:20,480
so there may be something you don't expect that's available online so

605
01:12:20,480 --> 01:12:25,600
check out the list uh oh the 20s and 30s group at home in

606
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:30,080
the world that meets on sundays and zoom with max

607
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:37,840
so where to go from here in addition to these like one-off events and community

608
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:44,159
something we've emphasized a lot already is the the power of daily practice

609
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:51,440
the the wholesome power of daily practice if you've got three minutes

610
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:57,360
if you have five minutes 10 minutes 15 minutes this is a wholesome thing to do

611
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:03,840
i had a friend who was um he had played the guitar for many years he was a fabulous guitar player and he

612
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:08,880
said he had a commitment i asked him how did you do this how did you grow so much

613
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:15,199
skill on the guitar he's like every day didn't matter if i if it was only two minutes i picked it up i put it

614
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:22,000
in my hand and over over the years i became became a

615
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:28,000
skilled guitarist i think we can do the same thing in meditation i find it's helpful to have a consistent

616
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:35,920
sort of schedule for myself so i don't always have to wonder where is this going to fit so having a 40-minute sit such-and-time

617
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:40,239
in the morning or maybe you're an evening person

618
01:13:41,840 --> 01:13:46,960
something that daily practice does is helps to generate mindfulness of course

619
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:53,199
and it also helps to develop our powers of concentration and you'll find as the as concentration

620
01:13:53,199 --> 01:14:00,159
and mindfulness grow together then all sorts of openings of the heart start can start to happen all sorts of

621
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:05,520
wholesome letting go can happen and uh i

622
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:11,280
i'm sure tanya used this analogy of concentration as like the tripod

623
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:17,760
that allows the telescope of mindfulness to see clearly the night sky they work really well really well

624
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,239
together to reveal what what's actually happening here

625
01:14:24,640 --> 01:14:31,199
along with daily practice you can start to look toward retreats of all lengths we do a half day

626
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:38,159
retreat in the mornings on wednesdays day longs are often offered tanya will be offering one the

627
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:46,480
beginning of september september 10th september 10th and then we'll do another one on the first of october

628
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:53,440
um and then from there it just grows uh four day retreats oh

629
01:14:53,440 --> 01:15:00,000
there's a whole retreat center associated with the imc called irc insight retreat center near scotts

630
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:06,640
valley retreats in length from four days to now three weeks

631
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:11,800
can be quite a quite a powerful experience to

632
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:19,360
dedicate your time to mindfulness practice i find even

633
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:24,560
even just the benefit of setting setting aside most most or all of my normal

634
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:30,080
concerns for a week is so nourishing to the system

635
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:35,280
because we we don't write we don't read we put away our phones and

636
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:43,520
we dedicate our dedicate ourselves to being attentive as much as we can just little by little

637
01:15:45,280 --> 01:15:50,320
so there's all that if you like this series format tanya's

638
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:56,480
about to launch another one called establishing a practice aptly which begins on next thursday

639
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:59,760
you don't even have to change your schedule

640
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:07,520
and then the last thing i'll say is there's um it's a literature counter this is what i'm calling it

641
01:16:07,520 --> 01:16:12,560
along the back here the flyers and events uh you'll find these online if

642
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:19,120
you're listening on youtube also here uh in the building section for books that are published

643
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:25,840
through the sati center in the corner here that are offered freely and then by the door one

644
01:16:25,840 --> 01:16:33,760
of my go-tos that i go back come back to again and again is gil's collection of essays the issue at hand

645
01:16:33,760 --> 01:16:40,159
also available online too so i hope that gave you

646
01:16:40,159 --> 01:16:47,520
maybe more than enough as far as places you can go places you can go routes you can take to

647
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:53,679
deepen the practice from here it probably goes without saying that

648
01:16:53,679 --> 01:16:59,600
i think this is a really worthwhile experience in itself

649
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:05,760
and a um it's a practice that can that opens up all sorts of

650
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:11,440
beautiful qualities of the heart so i i wish that

651
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:17,280
we've got some time now for for questions if you want to ask anything about walking or if you have specific

652
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:22,400
context about like oh my life is like this what can i do to deepen my practice now

653
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:29,360
or anything else that's coming up across the whole course and let me give you this mic back

654
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:33,040
oh sure here i'll turn this on

655
01:17:36,159 --> 01:17:44,880
so um i procrastinate like a lot of people do and i am noticing this past month doing

656
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:50,800
this that um i'll talk about today i um

657
01:17:50,800 --> 01:17:57,199
you know i took the day off from work today because i wanted to iron out a bunch of stuff for you know

658
01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:04,080
a job transition and i just didn't i just wanted to focus on that and i was so unproductive today until like the

659
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:10,320
last hour before this started and then i think in like panicked focus i got it done

660
01:18:10,320 --> 01:18:16,560
but i just couldn't wait to come here like i just there's more i need to do when i get home but i'm just like i just want to get here and you know not have

661
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:22,239
to do this and i get to sit and do nothing isn't this great you know and so um

662
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:27,360
yeah i just was wondering if what you all could speak to that because i think

663
01:18:27,360 --> 01:18:33,679
there's you got there's stuff you got to get done and you just got to do it and you know i i can kind of see

664
01:18:33,679 --> 01:18:40,600
myself using this as a excuse to avoid as well

665
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:47,760
could i defer to you sure great uh one thought that came up is um

666
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:54,800
you could alternate sitting and doing so uh you know if you enjoy coming and

667
01:18:54,800 --> 01:19:01,600
doing nothing right or being the the doing of awareness

668
01:19:01,600 --> 01:19:08,480
um you know you could make a bargain with yourself that if you work for half an hour you can sit for

669
01:19:08,480 --> 01:19:14,320
you know and alternate in your life to give yourself maybe a little bit of a

670
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:19,600
more of a sip experience of getting things done with lots of little

671
01:19:19,600 --> 01:19:24,880
breaks um does that feel like anything within

672
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:29,280
reach or not at all it's okay if it's not

673
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:36,080
i don't know i think but i making a deal with myself that might be

674
01:19:36,080 --> 01:19:42,320
i might try that i don't know yet the other thing is um you know you really can practice while

675
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:48,480
you're doing and that feeling of

676
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:54,640
for me when i can just sort of settle in right and be

677
01:19:54,640 --> 01:20:01,199
uh with my breath and my experience there's something i don't know really peaceful

678
01:20:01,199 --> 01:20:07,630
uh soothing pleasant joyful for me about it but actually if we um

679
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:14,239
[Music] there are lots of things we can do that way in our life if we it's it's a it's

680
01:20:14,239 --> 01:20:20,400
how we're doing it it's the polishing the floor with care

681
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:28,800
sorting the papers with care like oh noticing how it feels smells

682
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:34,400
you know just being present for it i think a lot of it a lot of

683
01:20:34,400 --> 01:20:40,800
we kind of disconnect with our to-do's we just want them to be done but

684
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:49,360
what does that really mean what are we disconnecting from that we could stay close to

685
01:20:49,360 --> 01:20:55,840
so i'm offering also just a whole nother approach to

686
01:20:56,480 --> 01:21:02,480
to doing life i guess so

687
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:10,080
now do you want to say anything else you have another idea that sounds great relationship to what's happening

688
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:16,560
thank you oh i had another idea

689
01:21:16,560 --> 01:21:23,760
so um another thing you can do is um you you can look at speaking of

690
01:21:23,760 --> 01:21:29,679
relationship to your experience like okay i oh i don't want to do this

691
01:21:29,679 --> 01:21:35,360
i'm having a lot of resistance and you can kind of start to be mindful

692
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:42,320
of the resistance and get more curious about that what is it about it and start to kind of

693
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:47,360
watch the filters and the mind and the associations and the

694
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:52,400
wanting to escape if that's what's coming up so

695
01:21:52,400 --> 01:21:58,880
kind of being more curious about why why don't i want to do things

696
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:05,280
why do i want to procrastinate what is that about for me so like just but you got to watch it's not like a thinking

697
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:11,679
exercise it's a it's an observing exercise so aversion desire

698
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:17,040
escaping you know looking at that

699
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:23,520
can you go into more of the difference between sure observing the thinking

700
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:30,400
sure okay i'll make something up here

701
01:22:30,400 --> 01:22:36,239
so it's you know nine o'clock this morning i've taken the day off work

702
01:22:36,239 --> 01:22:40,480
i've got my list of things that i need to do

703
01:22:42,000 --> 01:22:50,080
and i find myself on the computer watching youtube videos

704
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:56,400
and um an hour and a half goes by

705
01:22:56,400 --> 01:23:01,679
and i kind of notice what time it is and i'm a little bit hungry

706
01:23:01,679 --> 01:23:10,320
and i get up go get something to eat come back go right back to youtube but then you know let's say 12 o'clock

707
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:17,040
i'm starting to feel the pit in my stomach starting to feel sick like

708
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:22,400
i have all this stuff i have to do so that at that moment it kind of gets more

709
01:23:22,400 --> 01:23:30,080
pronounced right i'm not in the distraction but i'm in between and i can say okay this is uncomfortable

710
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:36,320
i i feel uncomfortable what's going on for me um

711
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:41,760
and just simply noting it sometimes like yeah i guess i'm

712
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:47,600
escaping but is it helping i actually don't feel that great right

713
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:53,679
now um i feel like i need to do this stuff but

714
01:23:53,679 --> 01:24:02,678
i don't want to do it just sort of like i'm just sort of naming okay there's a lot of like

715
01:24:02,880 --> 01:24:10,638
there's a lot of energy and avoiding actually i'm trying to avoid but i'm it's not very pleasant

716
01:24:12,960 --> 01:24:18,400
and kind of get really clear i could go back

717
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:24,400
to the youtube i could go back to the computer and do more of this

718
01:24:24,400 --> 01:24:30,000
or i could decide to see what happens if i go clean the bathroom

719
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:37,360
and stein try and just do one thing and see how i feel afterwards right and practice

720
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:43,040
kind of working with myself in this way so i don't know if that was a good enough

721
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:49,920
example okay great great so that you know one of the classes i'll

722
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:56,000
be teaching at some point won't be for a while but is the five hindrances we talked about doubt which

723
01:24:56,000 --> 01:25:04,000
you brought up aversion not liking not wanting greed wanting desiring

724
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:10,480
restlessness and worry where you know there's the mind is spinning and we can't be still

725
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:15,600
sloth and torpor sleepy no energy in the body mind is diffused

726
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:22,239
these are five hindrances that are very common in our practice they hinder our practice

727
01:25:22,239 --> 01:25:29,360
normal human experiences been around since the time well before the time of the buddha i'm quite sure

728
01:25:29,360 --> 01:25:34,400
so it's also helpful to notice what's going on which of these hindrances is

729
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:39,760
present and then you know if you see oh it's a lot of

730
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:44,880
aversion okay so how do i turn that around instead of

731
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:50,400
putting all my energy into not liking something how can i shift

732
01:25:50,400 --> 01:25:56,159
right what's the antidote if i've got a lot of greed and i want a lot of pleasure

733
01:25:56,159 --> 01:26:01,280
you know pursuing the pleasure it's helpful to notice that well i've

734
01:26:01,280 --> 01:26:07,840
got a lot of greed around watching and doing the computer but it's actually not pleasant how it's feeling right now

735
01:26:07,840 --> 01:26:15,040
and so noticing that that there's unpleasant with that so soft and torpor it's

736
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:21,040
opening the windows making it cold standing up you know doing the opposite of the energy that's happening in the

737
01:26:21,040 --> 01:26:29,880
mind and body so there you go hey thank you yeah

738
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:51,120
this may be our this may be our last one how do you like calm yourself

739
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:56,560
in the midst of things like just to remember especially if something's really feeling chaotic like what do you

740
01:26:56,560 --> 01:27:01,679
say like i know gil said i noticed that i'm feeling

741
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:07,679
like that just just continue to do that but then i then i find that my emotions

742
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:13,120
like i feel like i'm suppressing them because i'm trying and so oh

743
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:20,960
oh i see so you you um you're feeling you're feeling an emotion

744
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:28,239
there's a lot going on you you use that sort of sentence stem i notice i feel

745
01:27:28,239 --> 01:27:34,080
fill in the blank and then there's this there's this second thing that comes in which is

746
01:27:34,080 --> 01:27:40,239
um [Music] sort of like judgment that you used the tool

747
01:27:40,239 --> 01:27:47,199
it's like you you're suppressing suppressing the feeling by by looking at it or like me pretending

748
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:52,560
to be mindful like i'm i'm aware that i'm feeling frustrated so let me try not

749
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:57,600
to be frustrated and then something happens and then i just

750
01:27:57,600 --> 01:28:01,840
double over and then

751
01:28:02,639 --> 01:28:08,400
but then it's maybe it's more so my response and my reactivity to things

752
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:14,159
and it's something that i need to be more mindful of and just being still though in here was helpful because

753
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:21,360
you're right the work day was crazy and yeah just you know but thank you both tonya koto

754
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:26,400
thank you so much yeah yeah um

755
01:28:27,600 --> 01:28:33,360
just to pause for a second is there anything you anything you would feel okay sharing about what's happening in your body

756
01:28:33,360 --> 01:28:39,440
right now oh maybe a bit of trepidation thinking about tomorrow

757
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:44,560
all the all my actions of today and what i did prior to

758
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:49,679
i just it's just building yeah it sounds like it sounds like that was a thought

759
01:28:49,679 --> 01:28:57,679
anything in your body that's going along with those thoughts oh or anything you're feeling in your body now i can't really say i can't

760
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:03,920
really identify oh i it's just i feel very relaxed though just sitting

761
01:29:03,920 --> 01:29:10,639
here it's just the mind that's racing oh oh i wonder i wonder how possible it might be for

762
01:29:10,639 --> 01:29:17,520
the relaxation the that sensation to be a little more in the foreground and

763
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:23,760
let the mind have its have its space in the background is that is that a possibility

764
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:29,679
also like transferring my focus oh because it's like things become

765
01:29:29,679 --> 01:29:35,520
what you focus on it becomes what you i see i see yeah

766
01:29:35,520 --> 01:29:40,639
oh yeah okay maybe something so simple and then as the maybe this would be the

767
01:29:40,639 --> 01:29:47,678
last thing i'll say if that's all right and if there's if there are more questions or more comments we can talk after

768
01:29:50,159 --> 01:29:56,480
something to keep in mind as we go along with the practice is that the uh

769
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:03,280
the effect that we're expecting uh it can really easily flip over into a

770
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:10,320
demand where um where i end up i've had this happen before where i i suspect i'm like

771
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:16,800
okay i'm i'm frustrated i'm gonna watch my breath for two minutes and that's gonna calm me down and that's the deal that i've just

772
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:23,120
made with myself and then my frustration doesn't cooperate with me and i do my i do the practice

773
01:30:23,120 --> 01:30:28,800
and actually i feel the same i feel the same so something has gone wrong and clearly i

774
01:30:28,800 --> 01:30:34,560
did it um it's simply the fact that the

775
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:41,840
the the web of conditions that's making up the current state is so dynamic

776
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:49,360
that we we can't like flip it off with a switch let's say but we can feed something wholesome into the system

777
01:30:49,360 --> 01:30:55,760
that over time is nourishing but but we're not we're not we're not 100 in

778
01:30:55,760 --> 01:31:01,920
control so just some things to to keep in mind as as you go along

779
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:07,280
if it's unpleasant it doesn't mean that anything has gone wrong

780
01:31:07,280 --> 01:31:14,920
okay thank you so much that was very helpful thank you i really appreciated you being here these weeks

785
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:45,280
these things together and it's a wonder that everything that imc does is done is offered completely

786
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:52,320
freely completely where does that happen um

787
01:31:52,320 --> 01:31:59,280
if you feel like you had got some benefit from this from this practice and you feel inspired in the direction

788
01:31:59,280 --> 01:32:05,440
of the deep joy of generosity there are ways to do that the kiosk over there and

789

793
01:32:32,719 --> 01:32:38,800
dedicating the merit that maybe would be nice to share

794
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:44,080

you encounter others in your life maybe you're leaving a little bit calmer

798
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:10,239
a little bit more present and you can share that with somebody

799
01:33:10,239 --> 01:33:16,719
and then it's a gift that's been given from you to them and then hopefully they can give it to somebody else and

800
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:22,560
