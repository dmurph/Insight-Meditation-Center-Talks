1
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,400
so good morning and good day to everyone welcome to

2
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:32,840
our morning meditation and in the topic of

3
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:40,360
samadei a word that's associated with it in Pali is the word sama s A M

4
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:46,399
A and uh I think one of the appropriate translations of this

5
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,399
word is harmony a kind of um

6
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,680
balanced mind that's balanced in the middle of how things

7
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:05,680
are the harmonious mind and to and for samadei there's a

8
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,080
harmony that's coming into play we're in harmony with what's

9
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:17,840
happening and it's a harmony that's closely related

10
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:23,080
to recognizing

11
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:35,040
the signs recognizing the signs that signify that we're

12
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:43,479
getting settled calm centered that we're letting

13
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:52,240
go and so to simply

14
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,520
recognize to let go and recognizing how that feels good the rightness of

15
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:05,600
it to feel the tranquility to feel the settleness to

16
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,920
feel the stability to feel the

17
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,720
tranquility and to not try to make something

18
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:25,080
happen and there is a kind of letting go letting go of trying to make anything

19
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,480
happen but there is a a small prioritization for

20
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:39,239
samadei and that is to take in to appreciate what is good what is

21
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,800
wholesome as we sit and meditate of course there's many things that can be

22
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,440
difficult many things which are challenging but many minds are overly

23
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:57,239
concerned with those things and meditation is a time

24
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:04,239
where it isn't we want to push these things away but it's also a time that it's okay

25
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:13,560
not to be concerned with them preoccupied with them and instead orient

26
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,080
oneself to what is going

27
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:26,319
well from the meditation if we are a

28
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:34,360
sailboat and your sailboat is heading directly into the wind and the

29
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,799
waves it'll just it won't go anywhere might even be pushed backwards

30
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:47,680
and it'll be very rough very unpleasant it's appropriate for the sailboat to

31
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:55,799
turn away a little bit from the wind about 45 degrees and then the wind can fill the

32
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:03,680
sails and then the sailboat can go so then the wi the boat is in har the

33
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:12,799
sails in harmony with the wind so to assume meditation

34
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,799
posture and to gently close the

35
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:30,280
eyes and right from the start assuming this

36
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:36,000
posture is there anything which feels

37
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:44,639
good nice for you to have put down the concerns of the

38
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,800
day or to return to your meditation [Music]

39
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,159
posture to be here for this

40
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,800
meditation and to feel

41
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:11,600
sense what feels good even if it's just a teeny

42
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,280
bit you're a little bit already a little bit calmer

43
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:29,560
settled more content just to be this

44
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,759
way let that fill your sails

45
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,039
let that be what you

46
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,919
notice instead of heading into the wind of your

47
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:54,800
challenges find the wind that fills your sails in a good

48
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,320
way and gently taking some deeper

49
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:06,400
breaths then relaxing your body as you

50
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:23,400
exhale a little longer exhale than usual so the relaxing can be fuller

51
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:45,840
and maybe if you pause momentarily at the end of the

52
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:53,600
exhale just long enough to let there be some deeper

53
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:58,680
relaxing letting go in your body

54
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:09,400
maybe in the shoulders maybe in the belly

55
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,880
And then letting your breathing return to

56
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:41,880
normal and now feel are there any

57
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:52,280
further feelings of calm or tranquility settling

58
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:07,120
with an ordinary breathing on the exhale relax the

59
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:16,840
thinking mind quiet the thinking mind

60
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,919
and at the end of the exhale have a little pause ever so

61
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:42,399
slight so that you drop into your body more settle into your body for the

62
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,399
inhale

63
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,959
gently relaxing the thinking mind on the exhale pausing and dropping into the

64
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,959
body

65
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,839
and then let being now centered on your

66
00:09:35,959 --> 00:09:41,640
breathing breathing in and breathing out

67
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:58,120
what signs what feelings are there now of

68
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:07,040
calm stability maybe a lightness

69
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:19,279
Maybe a greater intimacy with your

70
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:35,519
body if awareness of breathing is your

71
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:44,040
sail let the good feelings however subtle and weak they may

72
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:50,680
be let them be there as the wind filling the sail

73
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:58,000
of awareness of breathing

74
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,519
letting the

75
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:18,519
mind be simple

76
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:36,800
the mind is in harmony with whatever feels good in the

77
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,800
meditation

78
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,920
if there's any feelings of

79
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:06,160
well-being even small feelings of joy or

80
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:13,959
delight contentment And let

81
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:20,160
that fill the wa the the sail of your

82
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,639
awareness let that gently fill

83
00:15:29,079 --> 00:15:36,519
you fill your awareness of breathing

84
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,040
as if you're sailing over the breathing the body

85
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:55,279
breathing filled with with whatever wellbeing is

86
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:58,279
here

87
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:40,839
keeping the sails full of wind so the sails don't collapse

88
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:52,480
the sail of awareness filled with well-being in harmony with whatever

89
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:58,720
feels good from sitting and

90
00:16:59,399 --> 00:17:05,079
meditating whatever feels good in your body

91
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,120
as the thinking mind gets

92
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:21,400
quieter the sail of awareness gets fuller

93
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,520
allowing the feelings of well-being

94
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:51,640
calm quiet to spread through your

95
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:58,679
body as if your whole body is the sail of awareness

96
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:06,240
sailing continuously on the inhale on the

97
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:11,039
exhale the whole

98
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,880
body pervaded

99
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:37,160
with whatever feels good about sitting in meditation

100
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:06,679
and taking a few moments to sense

101
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:16,480
feel whatever feelings of well-being that are here from meditation

102
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:22,559
to harmonize with those

103
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:32,240
to open to those to breathe with

104
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:48,919
And as we come to the end of this sitting no matter how slight it might

105
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:55,360
be feel whatever sensations feelings of

106
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:00,320
calm or tranquility

107
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:09,440
well-being settleness you might have feel it in your

108
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:18,720
body and it's probably not a specific sensation but a sensation which

109
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:27,919
is more diffuse or something that spreads or through the

110
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:39,960
body and imagine that it spreads beyond the edges of your

111
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:49,360
body the eyes closed the edges of the body are not so sharp

112
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:58,320
sometimes to feel porousness of how feeling sensations of

113
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:04,679
well-being expand beyond the edges of the body

114
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:19,799
seemingly and [Music] imagine that your feelings of well-being

115
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:28,799
are like radio waves or light waves that spread from you transmitted

116
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:37,000
from you out into the world just like we don't see radio

117
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,039
waves so we don't see these wonderful waves of

118
00:28:44,679 --> 00:28:52,480
well-being that are carry that carry with them your care and well-wishing for this

119
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,480
world

120
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:05,080
and may it be that this meditation we do supports

121
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:10,200
us to spread well-being into this

122
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:20,158
world by wishing may all beings be

123
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:27,640
happy may all beings be safe

124
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:33,440
may all beings be

125
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:39,760
peaceful may all beings be

126
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:50,559
free and may each of us stay in touch with our own sense of

127
00:29:51,880 --> 00:29:59,760
well-being as a reference point for what we can wish for

128
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:09,399
others may we spread good will into this world

129
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:25,559
[Music]

130
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,039
thank you

131
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,200
so hello and welcome to this next talk

132
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,240
on this series on samadei

133
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:15,720
and we've spent some time now on the

134
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:22,320
approaching the deep immersive experience of samadei this is where samadei becomes

135
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,159
mature or full and uh sometimes the language of

136
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:35,519
being fully absorbed is used sometimes u immersed fully immersed in experience is

137
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:43,679
used and um the uh in the in the Buddhist uh

138
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:50,360
discussions of samadei um it's to uh enter and

139
00:32:50,360 --> 00:33:00,600
abide in Janna jh a na and um I love this expression to

140
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:07,360
abide to dwell to rest to uh in these wonderful immersive

141
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:13,600
states And so we enter into and this entering

142
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:18,720
we approaching and at some point we enter and there's this transition

143
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:26,480
sometimes it's a slow transition we just find ourselves fully immersed and um sometimes it's a little

144
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:34,960
bit faster sometimes it can feel like we are just um happily kind of settling into a

145
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,039
body of water and um some people it's a little bit troublesome this image if

146
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:46,240
they had you know some challenging experience at the water but um it's not

147
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:53,559
uncommon for some meditators to feel like they're going underwater and very happy and very

148
00:33:53,559 --> 00:34:00,559
peaceful and when they come out of Janna or out of this deeper immersion And it feels like they're coming up out of the

149
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:07,279
water ahead surfaces and then they can gently kind of let go into the samadei

150
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:14,240
and they're happily going into this peaceful world the Buddha used the analogy of one one

151
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:22,118
analogy for being so immersed in samadei as underwater lotus flowers beautiful

152
00:34:22,119 --> 00:34:27,679
multicolored lotus flowers which haven't really surfaced above the water so

153
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,358
they're underneath the water you just see them through the clear water and they're just floating in a very peaceful

154
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:40,079
clear water peacefully and kind of just immersed in the water touched by the the

155
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,358
gentle water that's unmoving so there's this idea of enter

156
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:51,358
we enter and for sometimes it just feels like there's a kind of suddenly a flip

157
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,920
like the light the a switch has been switched and suddenly we're we're in a new state some people have the

158
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,560
experience like it's a suddenly a quantum leap um but it's not usually a leap it's more like a dropping and more

159
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,119
like a letting go and it's just oh wow now I'm

160
00:35:10,119 --> 00:35:18,640
here and sometimes it comes with feeling like now we're really here there you know sometimes we gradually go into it

161
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:25,359
and we find ourselves uh we're not we're not the whole mind and body is not

162
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:32,400
really going to leave we're abiding we're resting we're fully here with no

163
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:39,839
tendency to wander off and um and one of the things that keeps

164
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:47,800
us here now one of the things that's is a feeling of pity the poly word is p i

165
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:53,040
ti and it's um it's a feeling of usually

166
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:58,160
it's translated as I like to translate it as joy some people like to give

167
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:05,640
stronger words for it because it can be stronger uh some people will use the word bliss

168
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:11,920
um uh but it doesn't have to be strong it could be sometimes uh just

169
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:19,680
delightfully sweet and um but it's a some feeling of uh of uh sometimes it's

170
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,200
a little bit of a thrill a trill thrill with it i feel like oh this is good like

171
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:33,359
it's delightful it's like a little bit energized oh this is good now we're here

172
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:41,119
sometimes it feels like there's a little charge through our body there's tingling and and uh warmth sometimes it's

173
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:48,560
centered in certain parts of the body that are tingling or vibrating in a nice kind of clear way and joyful way kind of

174
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:55,200
like you would do if you um uh smiled and uh some people even if they don't

175
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:02,320
feel joyful and happy just simply making a gentle turning up of the lips of the

176
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:11,160
corners of the mouth some something kind of travels through the face a little bit that's feels like a little bit of joy or

177
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:17,960
delight and um but what it is uh the sense of I I just like to call it

178
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,119
well-being a feeling of of the lightness of joy

179
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:30,560
Some people this pity is experienced more as a light like seeing a white light sometime some people it's

180
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:39,560
experienced more as um as a pervasive feeling of of um of joy and

181
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:45,760
happiness and um and uh the idea is to

182
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,079
and it comes from the kind of this I from this absorption just being fully

183
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:58,560
here uh there is nothing which um is distracting us anymore and all the

184
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:04,200
different things that we have in our life that are our challenges and difficulties our judgments

185
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:12,000
are negative conclusions or negative bias have have gone on vacation have

186
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:17,359
taken a rest receded into the background and there's nothing in the mind that's

187
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:22,800
unh wholesome there's nothing in the mind which is troubling us in this state

188
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,560
and so without those troubling feelings thoughts uh what's left is feels good it

189
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,680
feels like a relief it feels joy um sometimes the the analogy the Buddha

190
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:41,920
uses for this is of having um no longer being in debt having paid back a loan

191
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,800
and being free of that burden or no longer being ill free from

192
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:53,119
illness uh that feels good it feels like oh this finally I'm not sick or not

193
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:59,200
injured or I can uh uh or uh being freed from prison

194
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,760
sometimes the mind and these difficult thoughts can feel like a prison sometimes he describes it as

195
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,440
being um uh have coming out of a difficult desert journey that was

196
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:19,280
dangerous and finally come out the other side and it's you're finally safe so now all this unh wholesome all

197
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:27,440
these difficulties have kind of faded away all the dangers have faded away and now we're fully here and this is good

198
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:33,839
and um and the idea is to be in harmony with that so some people can still feel

199
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,520
like uh the acquisitive mind the appropriating mind the desiring mind can

200
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:46,160
still operate and they try to push it and and have this experience be more intense just kind of pushing it and

201
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:53,839
being it and that's usually not so useful what the Buddha talked about is um

202
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:59,040
taking the good feelings that come from being immersed being fully here now

203
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:05,200
settled here take the good feelings and the and let it spread through your body

204
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:12,160
uh he used a variety of words pervade suse the body and that's really the only

205
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:17,880
instruction he gives when we get into this first state to the first what's called the first

206
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,040
Janna that's characterized uh many people characterize it by this

207
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,560
feeling of pity of joy of delight of thrill that can be ah this is really

208
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:36,280
great I'm here wow and flowing along with it but an important thing to

209
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:44,079
appreciate is that uh entering into these absorptive states of Janna

210
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:51,560
have a lot to do with letting go in one place the Buddha says that um

211
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:58,880
um these are known through letting go seen through letting go attained through

212
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:05,280
letting go and realize through letting go so this kind of letting go don't try

213
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:12,079
to push anything don't try to make something happen uh don't try to hold on to anything just like it's like you're

214
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:18,319
letting go into and it's a little bit like for those of you who maybe done some sailing

215
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:25,680
it's little but like you have to let go of the the sail enough so it can be filled with the wind you have to

216
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:34,000
sometimes uh uh um loosen the rope that's holding the sail uh in tight

217
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:40,720
against the side of the middle of the boat so it can feel better and better with u you have to let go so something

218
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:48,520
can feel let go so it can bellow outwards or balloon balloon

219
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:54,359
outwards and um and the spirit of this is to is

220
00:41:54,359 --> 00:42:00,920
harmony how can you do how can you stay harmonious in harmony with the good

221
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,000
states and we stay in harmony by not doing anything getting caught by

222
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:14,800
anything any clinging any attachment any appropriation into self any self-

223
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:23,839
congratulations and uh and um so at some point as the meditation deepens as we

224
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:30,560
settle in uh what's valuable is to start feeling the sense of well-being that

225
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:37,200
could be here even before we go into immersive absorpt absorptive states

226
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:43,359
it's to uh let there be a reciprocity a feedback loop between whatever little

227
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:50,160
sense of relaxing peace tranquility you have as a way of uh the gentle wind

228
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:56,400
that's filling the sail of awareness the gentle kind of encouragement yes stay

229
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:02,680
here stay with the breath really be here in the present moment don't

230
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:08,240
overemphasize the feelings of well-being don't at this point try to push them and

231
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,400
make them bigger so much it's just let let them kind of fill your awareness let

232
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,880
them encourage you stay here yes so there's almost a feeling of yes

233
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:28,160
let go into this let go into this awareness let go into the breathing let

234
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:36,560
go into now so um the Buddha said that this kind of

235
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:42,960
pity this feeling of joy that can arise and immersive meditation is not

236
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:51,359
something to be afraid of and um it's not something to um avoid

237
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:58,000
and this was maybe one of the great contributions he made in the religions of his time where there was a tremendous

238
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:05,440
emphasis on aestheticism and and in some places in other places emphasis on ordinary

239
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:12,200
ordinary everyday kind of joys and delights and pleasures and he was offering something very

240
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:17,880
different something that was coming up was arising from a very deep place

241
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:24,800
inside that wasn't an ordinary pleasure but was a kind of a spiritual pleasure

242
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:33,319
deep heart pleasure or joy a deep pleasure of being in

243
00:44:33,319 --> 00:44:40,000
harmony with the moment with the experience right here and now so that we

244
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:46,440
enter and abide in states of well-being

245
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:53,280
so this week we'll talk about this first Janna and uh the different factors that

246
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:59,760
come into play and um and for those of you most of you you know you're not

247
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:05,440
going to be in the first Janna but perhaps as you listen to this that um

248
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:12,520
it's relevant even in in lighter states of meditation and maybe also it's uh

249
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:17,680
inspiring that what's possible that we have we all have the human

250
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:24,760
capacity for this and to know this is kind of a wonderful north star that

251
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:31,000
um that uh inspires you to just be

252
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:39,680
here to let go into now so thank you very much and um we'll

253
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:43,160
continue tomorrow
