1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,400
good morning friends

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,160
welcome I uh I'm just slightly late I wanted to respond to a couple requests

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:20,439
yesterday and the day before for the texts that I'm referring to this

4
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:26,039
week some people you know that's that's useful in their practices bow to you and

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,679
other people it doesn't make any it's not supportive so I've stuck them in the

6
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:38,200
chat there and lost a few minutes in the lost a few minutes gained a few

7
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:45,360
minutes in the in the so doing so welcome Friday um it's been a

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:51,600
lovely week for me and uh to be with you all and to share some Dharma and to sit

9
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:57,239
together and uh to explore for me this particular text of teaching which is as

10
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,920
I said at the outset um of

11
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:10,920
seldom referred to uh as far as I know and uh quite quite sweet and uh again

12
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:17,320
the theme for the week has been the Buddha smile this idea that as this text

13
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,759
suggests that when we cultivate a meditation practice when we deepen the

14
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:31,840
Stillness and the collectiveness of the meditation in particular that five knowledges can arise uh and will arise

15
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,560
Naturally by themselves and I've further suggested that as we notice those and

16
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:42,799
they come to attention that they're strengthened and uh maybe I'll review

17
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:50,640
them briefly when we when we later in the in the darat um but uh that all of

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:02:00,079
them can be accompanied by a sense of ease a sense of pleasantness and pleasure and thus deeply sort of settled

19
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:08,800
in our minds as being wholesome and being onward leading that I think is uh the source of

20
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,800
this smile that comes in meditation and that we can see reflected in depictions

21
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:23,720
of the Buddha and take as a as both inspiration and instruction so today interesting we get

22
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:30,239
kind of tactical the fifth knowledge that arises in the meditation

23
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:38,879
is that uh I quoting here I mindfully enter into and emerge from this deep

24
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:48,280
meditation and uh as I'll say a little bit more in the guided and then in the daret um sometimes we we we rush in as I

25
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,800
did today get here right at 7 and you know settle into meditation and just as

26
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:58,959
quickly the bell rings and boom you know we're we're back into daily life and I

27
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:05,360
think this today's teaching brings bring reminds us that the entering the way we

28
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:12,239
enter into the meditation and the way we leave are really important in sort of

29
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:20,680
protecting the practice and in some Buddhist Traditions there's a whole sort of um culture of protecting the

30
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:26,440
practice and that will be our Focus today we get a lot more instruction

31
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,519
about entering in a way because as we start a guided typically teachers will

32
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:39,319
give a sense of how to enter the meditation we get a lot less about how to leave and that's where I'll Focus

33
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:45,319
comments later but in the meditation today maybe I'll I'll try in the guided portions at the beginning and the end

34
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:52,360
maybe I'll I'll bring a little bit of sort of entering and leaving uh a little bit more to the

35
00:03:52,360 --> 00:04:00,879
four Great to the meditation then that over there

36
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,599
so I'm going to take a sip of tea as I encourage you to prepare for meditation

37
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:13,280
and this is the most important thing maybe about entering is to do so as this

38
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:18,799
text suggests mindfully and I'm going to say deliberately

39
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,560
intentionally and I'm pausing to take a sip of tea if you have a cup of tea handy you might do the same and prepare

40
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:33,400
to meditate think about oh what what condition can be put in place that will

41
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:39,440
help deepen the meditation and along with a sip of

42
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:46,639
tea and maybe uh settling into a physical location and I'm starting to bring the

43
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,199
eyes down because that's what I do to bring attention inward maybe we can also

44
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:58,240
bring to mind intention what is it that we sit for why

45
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,520
do we sit together and just touch base with our desire to

46
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:09,759
be free and remind ourselves that as we

47
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:16,680
settle into meditation that the mind with which we prepare the

48
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:24,680
meditation uh is an important part of the benefits that we can expect from the

49
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,880
meditation we bring an intention for our own well-being and the well-being of others

50
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:37,880
into the meditation as an inspiration as an intention

51
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:42,440
and thus we prepare the mind to

52
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:51,319
meditate so instead of just sort of plopping down on the cush cushion or in our chair it can ease in

53
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:57,919
gradually and touch in with our fundamental intention for the

54
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:04,639
practice maybe it's just some ease maybe it's some momentary relief

55
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,759
from stress and maybe it has a deeper course

56
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,720
in our lives maybe it has to do with um more

57
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:23,120
spiritual oh I don't want to say objectives or aims spiritual

58
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,400
orientations that we want to be free we want others to be

59
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:36,000
free and and in addition to relief we want release and that this is a wholesome

60
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,639
aspiration in our practice the meditation as I suggested

61
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:50,560
yesterday whether it's returning to the breath or settling in can be

62
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:59,599
unhurried and in this un hurriedness there's wholesomeness

63
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:08,319
meditation is a place where we let go from hurry we let go from

64
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,240
striving we balance effort with allowing as we said

65
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:25,680
yesterday and we take our time as we take it

66
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:33,520
easy so inter interestingly the meditation is deeper

67
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,280
this day's teaching suggests when we enter mindfully and I would suggest that

68
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,520
part of that is entering without

69
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,879
hurry we enter with ease we enter with good

70
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:59,120
intention because these provide important conditions for the deepening of the meditation

71
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:17,960
and now after sipping tea looking around

72
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:24,199
settling in carefully and unhurriedly touching in with

73
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:32,080
intention intentions for this sit to be here now and maybe for the whole practice practice to be

74
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:40,800
free having done these useful skillful

75
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:50,360
Preparatory actions now we can make contact with the

76
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,080
breath and we make contact with a breath in a way that brings these intentions

77
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,399
with it and today every time we return attention

78
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:10,040
to the breath every time we open our attention back up broadly when it's become tight and

79
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:18,240
contracted we can retouch with this intention to be fully here to let things

80
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:27,399
arise and pass as they will and want and this intention to find ease to

81
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,519
lean in toward ease to L the Mind toward

82
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:42,160
ease and now well prepared with intention with

83
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:49,600
instruction we can settle into some time in

84
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
silence

85
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

86
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

87
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

88
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240

89
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160

91
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

92
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
e

93
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

94
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

95
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

96
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

97
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

98
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

99
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

100
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
e

101
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

102
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

103
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

104
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

105
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

106
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

107
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

108
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

109
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

110
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

111
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

112
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

113
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

114
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

115
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
e e

116
00:26:25,159 --> 00:26:32,279
so this teaching this week encourages us to mindfully leave the meditation as a way

117
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:36,200
to deepen it

118
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:45,159
interesting so let's just slowly bring attention back to this

119
00:26:45,159 --> 00:26:51,480
meditating being in the

120
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,399
world maybe start to take some stock of our surroundings perhaps there's a handy

121
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:03,240
sound perhaps there's a sensation of the body

122
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:08,760
against the cushion or the chair that can help sort of start to bring us

123
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:14,720
gradually unhurriedly and gently sort of back

124
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:20,000
into um the different more

125
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:28,039
energetic interaction with the world with our experience in the world

126
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:37,440
and in the daret we'll talk about some specific ways we could do this

127
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:45,559
don't have to do them all each time we leave the meditation but for Here and Now what

128
00:27:45,559 --> 00:27:50,480
comes up is perhaps touching it again with Our

129
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:57,519
intention maybe we had an intention for this particular meditation period to

130
00:27:57,519 --> 00:28:05,200
just be here with experience without fighting against it so much and whether or not that was the

131
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,519
experience of the meditation it's useful to reconnect with that

132
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:17,840
intention oh yeah yeah and kind of compare maybe our

133
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:25,240
experience with that intention and notice places where yeah there was some greater ease

134
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:32,039
with experience have a choice here to maybe focus on the

135
00:28:32,039 --> 00:28:37,480
the positive what felt good what was

136
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:42,799
wholesome as we touch in with those mind States they're

137
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:50,000
stronger and we could touch in too with intentions that go further than today's set

138
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:56,760
and have to do maybe with why we practice oh right there's

139
00:28:56,760 --> 00:29:05,640
this strong desire for well-being there's an aspiration to be

140
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:12,320
Freer and there's a heart that would like to be open to

141
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:19,440
others we can just recall those intentions for our

142
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,320
practice these are this is a realm of intention in which we take the intention

143
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:35,799
for this little meditation period or returning to this breath in this moment even and we bring it out into the larger

144
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:43,399
world to meet experience without struggle so that we act and interact

145
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:47,799
with the mind in

146
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:59,039
peace anyway touch in with intention as a way to leave the meditation mindfully

147
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:07,519
and as we do so we can commit to sharing the benefits of

148
00:30:07,519 --> 00:30:13,000
the meditation with those around us and by

149
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,200
implication spreading out in concentric circles with all beings

150
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:37,190
[Music]

151
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,000
so welcome friends

152
00:30:52,799 --> 00:31:00,679
um leaving the meditation mindfully continues now for for me but for all of

153
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:05,760
us and uh I'm reaching for my cup of

154
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:13,279
tea I feel the mug I note that it's cooler than at the beginning of our sit

155
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:20,159
I take a sip and in all of this I'm aware of

156
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:26,240
leaving mindfully which will be the main focus of darat

157
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,960
today so though to to say yes day five of what we call the Buddhist smile we

158
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:38,159
call I mean I called this week we called I didn't mean to say we call like it's a

159
00:31:38,159 --> 00:31:44,360
common thing no this week's Focus became the Buddhist smile

160
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:50,440
the idea that in the meditation understanding about the meditation arises understandings about

161
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:56,480
how to make it deeper how to keep feeding it keep encouraging it and that

162
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:04,120
with these understandings comes a smile a sense of contentment sense of ease that maybe

163
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,600
inward maybe outward may be shared with

164
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:16,480
others um for those who might be just joining now I did include in the

165
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:22,320
chat pointing out I'm like push that Bell And subscribe or whatever but I I'm

166
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:28,919
just saying I guess it's over there in the YouTube chat I did responding to a request

167
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:34,799
yesterday provide uh the name of the suta the discourse that I've been

168
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:41,200
riffing on this week and also because a couple people asked the specific sutas

169
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:49,399
in the majima Naya the collection of middle L this courses of the Buddha where the particular topic of this idea

170
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:55,399
of cultivating the pleasantness or the pleasure of meditation are are

171
00:32:55,399 --> 00:33:03,440
uh brought forward um all right mindfully entering and

172
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:10,679
leaving meditation I call this daret protecting the practice uh and I'll say this probably

173
00:33:10,679 --> 00:33:16,799
at the beginning at the end but the idea of protecting the practice I really love

174
00:33:16,799 --> 00:33:24,880
that I ask we ask so much of this practice and we can we can also ask what

175
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:32,240
can I give the practice go what my the practice benefit from that I can

176
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:40,720
provide and um one thing we can do for the practice is give it um our sort of

177
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,159
full attention and consideration our respect

178
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:52,600
almost and we can do this in the way we we enter and leave the

179
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:59,880
meditation so regarding entering where I feel like there's more instruction provided uh you know we we get a lot of

180
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:07,080
instruction around uh connecting with the breath and how to return to the breath in those first 15 20 30 minutes

181
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:12,398
depending on his personal things in the day the weather interior weather

182
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:18,679
exterior weather how long it takes sort of for the mind to settle because it takes time for

183
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:25,040
everyone um we learn a lot about that entering process to to those kind of

184
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:30,158
familiar instructions I would add a couple uh additional

185
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,320
ideas one is just begin begin meditating before you sit down begin meditating

186
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:43,679
before you meditate set things up bow smile whatever whatever you do that's

187
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,720
part of the it doesn't have to be a ritual but just uh a habit because this

188
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:57,320
is a wholesome habit that replaces less wholesome habits however you prepare if it's in my

189
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:03,680
case walking upstairs you can walk upstairs to or downstairs or around the

190
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:12,040
house to the place you meditate you can look around the place you meditate you can sort of take stock of

191
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:19,480
this ambient sounds what's happening in the body is there hunger

192
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,480
um you know any is there gurgling is there a need to use the bathroom is

193
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:30,640
there um restlessness is there still some sleepiness whatever notice what's

194
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,680
happening in the body notice the quality of attention in the mind you know is

195
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:41,480
there ease is there hurry is there anxiousness is there contentment is

196
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:48,800
there warmth is there Stillness whatever and as I think I've emphasized

197
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,040
quite a bit this week don't hurry take it easy as I said yesterday but don't

198
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:01,640
hurry there's no hurry needed here hurry is

199
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:07,560
counterproductive in this practice unlike you know much of the rest of our lives when we sit down to meditate

200
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:12,599
there's a way in which we leave to one side we don't push them away we don't

201
00:36:12,599 --> 00:36:21,680
have to pull them out by the roots we're just setting them aside while we meditate some of the um some of the way we strive and

202
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,720
approach life outside of the meditation and it's very very nice to set them down

203
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:34,000
set them to one side side for a period of meditation so don't hurry um Gil says

204
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:40,200
I don't think he made it up but I like it when he says it reminds people that

205
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:45,760
in this practice the quickest way from point A to point B from here and now to

206
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,960
where we want to be the quickest way to get from point A to point B is to be

207
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:56,119
fully present here at Point a it's here we want to

208
00:36:56,119 --> 00:37:01,440
be and we don't have to hurry to be

209
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:08,880
here um in fact when we get hurried we sort of you know we're less here now

210
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,760
we're more there then be here now we say

211
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:21,960
another way to say that might just be don't hurry there's no reason to hurry we're not trying to get

212
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:29,040
anywhere um we're not trying to get anywhere else okay having said that

213
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:36,440
about mindfully arriving mindfully entering the meditation here's a little bit more

214
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:41,960
about mindfully leaving or exiting the meditation which I think we we you know

215
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:49,319
we hear a lot less about the talks the guidance tends to come in the beginning of the meditation and so it focuses more

216
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:55,440
on entering so when we come to the end of the meditation these are things I didn't

217
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:02,920
do in the guided but they're useful to keep mind take a few deep breaths and bring awareness back to the body and as

218
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:08,720
you do so notice any sense of ease that's there

219
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:17,280
be with the awareness that noticing it strengthens it so kind of notice where we are

220
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,319
sometimes you'll notice this most um

221
00:38:22,319 --> 00:38:29,000
forcefully when we Open the Eyes there will be awareness oh the eyes are really kind of focused like the mind in this

222
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,640
middle distance you know and it takes a while maybe for Focus to kind of come

223
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,079
back and just be aware of what that's like before stirring before moving from

224
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:49,599
the cushion another thing that's very useful to do is come out a teacher an early

225
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:55,440
teacher sort of once taught me come out the way we went in retrace our

226
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:00,880
steps whatever that means if there's any depth that's come up in

227
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,040
the meditation any ease excuse

228
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:13,400
me um come back out the way we went in so

229
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:20,599
that we're creating a path it helps to remember how we got in

230
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:26,400
to go in next time and this may be things like um just

231
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:33,720
noticing uh you know what was the breathing like where was the Mind

232
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:40,800
centered um what led up to Greater ease or greater

233
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:49,359
contentment and then sort of make a mental note of that and sort of be prepared to try

234
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:55,000
those same steps uh the next

235
00:39:55,079 --> 00:40:04,160
time the conditions we created both entering and leaving are really important in deepening the the

236
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:11,560
meditation there's also this there are in some Buddhist Traditions the Tibetan the Maham mudra in particular really

237
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:18,240
quite sophisticated um approaches to what's called sometimes protecting the

238
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,480
practice and um in this case and I'm quoting here protecting entails a

239
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:31,000
comparison of immediate experience of the medit ation with the teachings

240
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,240
given and this can be a very powerful thing to do as we leave to meditation is

241
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:44,680
to notice that oh there was greater ease when there was less attention to

242
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:50,000
self or there was more letting

243
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,880
go when I returned to the breath without judgment these are really important

244
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:04,560
things to notice because they connect the experience of this particular sit with the teachings that lead

245
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:11,839
onward and I love the idea of protecting the practice taking care of the practice you know we look at the

246
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:16,880
practice as a tool and

247
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:21,960
um just thinking of my father and the fact I have some of his tools and I don't take care of him like he would

248
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:30,240
have and uh this is a place where taking care of the tools you know after we've used a tool as I was taught you know use

249
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:37,359
a shovel wash it off let it dry in the sun don't let it get all rusty in the

250
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:45,280
garage I've got to wash off my shovel later um but protecting the tool taking

251
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:51,520
care of the meditation is something that can really powerfully deepen it that's

252
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:58,200
the point of entering and leaving mindfully as it helps the meditation grow deeper

253
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:05,079
so this is all before we stir from the cushion so and then before you get

254
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:12,480
up we might take time to feel grateful for the time we spent meditating almost

255
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:18,040
you know thank the practice and don't leave

256
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:24,520
entirely right throughout the day we can keep practicing we can keep the breath in mind for

257
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:31,079
example and then if we sort of keeping the breath in mind keeping some of these instructions in mind keeping some of

258
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:37,800
this ease in mind keeping some of this peace with us yeah we create a more

259
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:44,040
sustained mindful awareness throughout the day and it's there next time we go

260
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:50,280
to sit down that is where all we been with the breath we've been we've been

261
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:57,480
preparing so not leaving entirely is a way of you know kind of always being

262
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:03,359
ready to enter so that's what I have for this

263
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:10,200
week um and maybe I'll kind of in a couple minutes that

264
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:17,160
remain just refresh our memory our Collective memory for this

265
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:23,800
teaching and uh I'll I'll read some of it sort of verbatim

266
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:32,280
practitioners this is addressed then and now to us to people who practice develop the

267
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:40,760
meditation deepen the meditation cultivate the Stillness and collectiveness and well-being of the

268
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:48,960
meditation and when you do so five knowledges will arise what

269
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:55,240
five um that this meditation is

270
00:43:55,240 --> 00:44:01,040
pleasurable now and results in benefits in the future Pleasant

271
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:07,160
benefits we can lean into that that wholesome contentment a wholesome

272
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:15,280
satisfaction that arises in the meditation that this meditation points on toward greater

273
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:23,359
things toward deep spiritual um knowing and

274
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:31,480
release that this immersion this um deep meditation we cultivate in Good Company

275
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:37,559
one another and other people who share these aspirations who seek to open their

276
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:43,520
hearts who um seek to be act with a mind at ease mind at

277
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:48,839
peace and ultimately we practice together with the Buddha and others who

278
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:55,559
have awakened in this practice Thursday yesterday with the

279
00:44:55,559 --> 00:45:02,720
take it easy idea the knowledge arises in the meditation that this peaceful this peace

280
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,800
this Tranquility this unification or collectiveness of mind isn't held in

281
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:15,839
place by force that we are better off when we balance effort with

282
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:21,319
allowing and then finally today that we benefit the meditation we strengthen it

283
00:45:21,319 --> 00:45:28,680
with when we enter and leave um and maybe it's a usually uh this is an interesting order ing for me uh because

284
00:45:28,680 --> 00:45:35,760
it's tactical most tactical at the end and yet it's perfect for this 7 a. sit

285
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:43,280
in that um it gives us something very specific to do when We Gather again uh I

286
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:51,640
won't be with you Monday as in the teacher seat but when the group gathers again next week um there will be this

287
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:58,119
renewed opportunity to enter and leave mindfully in a way that strengthens the meditation

288
00:45:58,119 --> 00:46:04,280
it's always a pleasure to do this I uh I'm happy to be with you I uh um

289
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:11,400
appreciate people coming together to support one another one another's practice in this way always happy to sit

290
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:18,400
in for Gil with my wonderful teaching colleagues Yang and Kim and um the many

291
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:25,359
others who who uh sit the 7 a.m. with you so take care everyone till
