1
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:09,759
one of the opportunities and often purposes of Buddhist

2
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:15,960
Meditation is to settle deeply inside of

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,400
oneself become calm and settled in order to understand oneself

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,279
better and uh and by understanding oneself better uh being able to let go

5
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:35,680
of that which doesn't serve us that which gets in the way of further understanding further

6
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:43,000
Clarity so I offer an analogy that if the kitchen sink the

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:48,199
faucet is on and the kitchen sink is blocked and the water fills and Spills

8
00:00:48,199 --> 00:00:53,399
over onto the kitchen floor and you come home and see the floor

9
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,760
wet and then you run around the house looking for buckets and

10
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:06,640
sponges and and maybe eventually you find them and you start mopping up the floor and mopping up the floor and

11
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,080
emptying the water and mopping up the floor and after a long time of doing

12
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:20,880
that you're getting tired of all the soaking up and throwing away it occurs to you how about just turning off the

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,920
faucet and uh so that it's that way in our lives sometimes that we can go

14
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,920
around with a lot of challenges of kinds we can go around with a lot of conflict of all

15
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:40,399
kinds and we might be trying to take care of them and and uh sometimes we do

16
00:01:40,399 --> 00:01:46,439
take care of them and it's important to care for a lot of things but the opportunity in

17
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:53,240
meditation is uh to sit quietly and no longer

18
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:58,960
objectify our experiences our life our challenges ourselves the world around us

19
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:06,079
but drop into a deep subjective experience of what's here so we can come to the place and

20
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:12,560
recognize where the fet is on so we can turn it

21
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,400
off and the more you're preoccupied with something upset about something

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:25,239
concerned about something even thinking about something more you're you're involved in you're

23
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:31,120
involved in a certain kind of objectification there's the issue there the thing you're thinking

24
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:37,560
about even if what you're thinking about is something that's present for yourself right now we'll often objectify that

25
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:43,800
we're thinking about it concerned with it figuring it out analyzing it um and

26
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:51,400
the opportunity here is sitting quietly is to begin feeling our way into

27
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:58,280
what's deeper where the faucet in where the energy is coming from where and one of

28
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:07,879
those things is tension one of the simple ways of where's the tension where's the the stress where's

29
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:14,720
the uh agitation because that the energy of

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:24,319
agitation the running water of agitation the running water of tension the running water of stress if if that's still

31
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,879
on it'll produce we we keep getting caught up in this objectification objec

32
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:36,040
objectif objectifying world of concerns and there's often we don't see

33
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:42,360
we're so caught up in the concerns we don't see that the faucet is

34
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,200
on but there is a faucet that's giving it energy giving it power giving

35
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:54,480
it the helping us be attached to it and I'd like to propose for this

36
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,079
sitting that uh uh the faucet that's on

37
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:07,599
the running water that's uh flooding the kitchen floor is

38
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:14,120
um discovered through T the its tension the agitation the

39
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:22,919
stress the constriction that we find in our body and mind and if you find that see if you can

40
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:28,240
relax it see if you can calm

41
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:37,680
it sof soften it and maybe you can't turn off the faucet but maybe you can um

42
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:48,840
slow down the flow decrease it AIT little bit so to assume a meditation

43
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:59,160
posture and being reminded that it's a posture with which we are going to

44
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:08,240
really show up in our body here and now for our present moment

45
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:17,080
experience so a posture that is almost

46
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:23,919
like taking a stand yes this is where I

47
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:31,479
am this is where my attention will be here and now

48
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,600
not denying anything but here to

49
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:46,120
see how everything manifests as present moment

50
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,319
experience that the direct experiences Here and

51
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:55,918
Now gently close your

52
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,560
eyes and just to the extent that's

53
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:09,759
comfortable for you take some deeper breaths longer

54
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,039
inhales and on the exhale relax the

55
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:30,000
body maybe stretching out the exhale a bit

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,319
so there can be more time to soften let

57
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:38,319
go

58
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:55,759
release and then letting your breath breathing return to

59
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:05,800
normal and continuing on the exhale taking time to relax the muscles of the

60
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:20,919
face there's a way as we relax the muscles of the face we sense the sensations of the face

61
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:23,199
more

62
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:36,720
fully maybe extending the exhale a little

63
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:44,520
bit to see if there's a little additional relaxing of the

64
00:07:53,840 --> 00:08:01,319
face releasing the muscles of the face

65
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:14,280
and then doing the same for the shoulders on the exhale softening the

66
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
shoulders

67
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,959
and relaxing the

68
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,440
belly softening the

69
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:04,120
belly and for wherever in your belly B you're relaxing see if you can feel or imagine

70
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:11,040
your yourself deeper into the belly for a deeper

71
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:30,079
release and then bringing the attention to the area around the heart

72
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:37,519
and there too gently maybe lovingly on the exhale

73
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,320
relax around the heart

74
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
center

75
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,880
maybe a softening throughout the

76
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
chest

77
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,880
and then taking some minutes here also to relax in the thinking

78
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,639
mind the muscles in the face the eyes the

79
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,120
forehead associated with

80
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:20,120
thinking any tightness and pressure agitation in the

81
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,800
mind on the exhale allow it all to

82
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
soften

83
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,240
and

84
00:11:52,360 --> 00:12:00,959
finally on the inhale feel some

85
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:07,560
your own way a global experience of the body and on the

86
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:13,320
exhale release relax the whole

87
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
body

88
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:49,000
and then settling yourself into the body's experience of

89
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:55,320
breathing accompanying the rhythm of breathing in and breathing

90
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:04,720
out and if anything troubles

91
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:10,040
you feel your way into the body mind

92
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:16,040
heart to where the tension is the stress or the

93
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:27,760
pressure and see if you can relax it relax the tension the pressure

94
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:31,360
soften on the

95
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
exhale

96
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
for

97
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
for

98
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:20,529

for

102
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
e

103
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:11,120
rather than thinking your thoughts feel the underlying tension or

104
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,639
pressure to think to be

105
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:27,558
troubled and as you exhale relax the tension and the

106
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:35,120
pressure wherever it might be gently

107
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
slowly

108
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
for

109
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320

00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

111
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

112
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

113
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

114
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

115
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

116
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

117
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

118
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

119
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880

[Music] and then as we come to the end of this

124
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:59,159
sitting to gently almost like writing

125
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:04,679
outwards on the inhale expansion of the

126
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:10,960
chest movements of the lungs as you breathe

127
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:18,570
in in your way feel as widely in your body as you

128
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:25,720
[Applause] can and on the exhale let

129
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:33,640
go on the exhale relax the

130
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:46,919
body on the exhale release any holding that remains in the

131
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:01,760
body and then like and then let go of even trying to let

132
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:10,720
go and sit here for a few moments breathing not even meditating just being

133
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:26,520
present and as we come to the end to turn our gaze outward into the

134
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:33,320
world from The Mind's Eye

135
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:41,640
imagination bring in the people in your lives near and

136
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,840
far the people in the world who are suffering

137
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,518
terribly aware of them from a relaxed

138
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:12,840
state from which maybe we have access to love compassion respect

139
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,320
care no matter how much how challenging it is what we're

140
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,440
considering and from that place of care

141
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:38,880
wishing well on Others May all

142
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:46,120
beings be happy may all

143
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,480
beings be

144
00:28:51,799 --> 00:28:59,399
safe may all beings be peaceful

145
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:03,760
may all beings be

146
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:17,919
free and may we contribute to the welfare and happiness of the

147
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:25,279
world from a place within that there is no stress and

148
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:29,320
tension no agitation

149
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,039
so that how we contribute to the world is through the

150
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:44,240
medium of being peaceful ourselves may all beings be

151
00:29:54,910 --> 00:29:59,320
[Music] well

152
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,880
thank

153
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
you

154
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
for

155
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:22,159
so hello and uh welcome to the second talk on the Buddhist teachings related

156
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,679
to quarrels quarrels disputes and um

157
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:35,559
the idea that human beings live in conflict with each other was very well recognized by the

158
00:31:35,559 --> 00:31:41,600
Buddha and not only he have a lot to say about it but it could be understood that

159
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:52,360
the core teachings of the Buddha even the whole purpose of becoming enlightened um is uh has to do with um

160
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:58,120
creating a world where people are not driven by unethical

161
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:05,320
behavior that the core teachings of the Buddha are ethical with an ethical goal

162
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:13,919
a person who is awakened is defined as someone who will not harm anybody at all

163
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,679
including how the n in the way in which we have disagreements with people

164
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,519
certainly we'll have disagreements uh but uh to disagree in

165
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:32,600
an argumentative way with hostility and anger and and um assert assertions of

166
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:40,799
power and and um demeaning other people uh is

167
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:47,000
not uh the direction in which the Dharma teaching Dharma practice the Buddha

168
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:53,840
taught um he really wants us to take responsibility for our contribution to

169
00:32:53,840 --> 00:33:00,519
suffering in the world and certainly that that's not enough to diminish the suffering in the world just to look at

170
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:08,399
ourselves but without that without a deep look at ourselves and what's going on with us uh we could actually

171
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:17,360
inadvertently continue being models and perpetuators of hostility of hate of uh

172
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:24,360
assertion of power of of um all kinds of ways that uh are continue the endless

173
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:31,240
cycles of harm that has existed since the time with the Buddha so his teachings on quarrels is

174
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:36,399
the topic for this week and um and one of the ways

175
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:42,000
so the primary strength of the Dharma the

176
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,799
Buddha taught is the capacity of this practice for us to really take a deep dive in ourselves and understand

177
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:53,960
ourselves not to ignore the world but I like to think of it as we Deep dive

178
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:00,480
inside of ourselves to really see ourselves and and and free ourselves from the inside out turn ourselves

179
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:07,200
inside out and return to the world with a heightened sensitivity and capacity to

180
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,720
care to love without any hostility without taking on any stress in that

181
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:20,118
process without any kind of conceit that gets in the way of caring for others and

182
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:28,118
the world so in one set of teachings about quarrels disputes the Buddha talks about

183
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:37,679
six Roots um that um uh six roots of of quarreling and

184
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:44,398
these are the six kind of uh problematic ways in which uh underneath the quarrel

185
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:51,520
that give that from which we contribute to the quarrel to the argument to the disagreement in an unhealthy

186
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,280
unbeneficial way and so we want to find a way to go under the under the surface

187
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:05,160
take a go a layer down um and not kind of constantly be involved at the level of the coral and

188
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:11,440
who said what and what's going on and what I should do and which is living a little bit in an objectified world of

189
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:19,040
what you the problem but we also want to take time out to really understand what are we

190
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,359
contributing what gasoline are we putting Into the Fire and so one of the

191
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:32,119
purposes of things like meditation is the introspection to drop a layer at least a layer into our being into our

192
00:35:32,119 --> 00:35:37,400
psychology to see what is the what are we contributing in terms of pressure in

193
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:44,839
terms of energetics agitation stress uh onto how we contribute to the

194
00:35:44,839 --> 00:35:51,720
quarrel so the Buddha talked about six uh six roots and in fact each when he

195
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:57,040
talks about them he pairs up there pair so somehow they're considered Maybe

196
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,640
synonyms or close synonyms or part of a family um these six

197
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:09,960
pairs and uh each of them we can understand to imply that as they settle

198
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,720
maybe they get replaced by their opposite the first uh uh root and the

199
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:23,040
and WD uses the word root because uh it the reference point is a plant that if

200
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,200
you cut off the plant at the surface um it uh it sprouts again from the roots

201
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:35,400
and if you really want to uh take get rid of a weed you have to really get down there and pull out the roots so it

202
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:43,079
doesn't nothing can re uh re resprout so the first of these roots is

203
00:36:43,079 --> 00:36:48,800
uh anger and resentment and um and anger is in the

204
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,440
Buddhist lexicon is maybe not the same as the English word uh the Koda is the

205
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:00,680
word in po um in involves uh some people in the west want to justify certain

206
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:07,560
kinds of anger clean white anger or something uh Justified anger but the

207
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:14,200
anger that Buddhism is uh say is a problem is a poison is anger that in

208
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:20,920
that has within it hostility has within it hatred so and resentment is also kind

209
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:27,319
of a kind of a poison that um that uh certainly har harms the person who's

210
00:37:27,319 --> 00:37:34,160
resenting and so these are two Roots the first first root is is anger and

211
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:42,720
resentment and if these settle down then uh what's possible is

212
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:50,280
friendliness care uh we can come from a different place we might still disagree but to

213
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:58,640
disagree in Friendly ways there and if we can't be friend friendly because that's too high a bar to disagree with

214
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:06,400
care for the welfare of everyone involved what does it take to really engage in disagreement in a productive

215
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:14,119
way not easy the second route is contempt and

216
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:21,280
spite to have this attitude towards others who are in disagreement with and

217
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:28,640
have contempt and Spite and we know that uh there's whole movements and political movements politicians who are demonizing

218
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,359
the opponent and uh kind of contempt in spite uh that it just uh uh putting

219
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:43,119
gasoline on the fire on the fire of a lot of social political National um

220
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:50,119
conflicts that exist in our time and uh there's no hope to resolve a a conflict

221
00:38:50,119 --> 00:38:55,520
if there's contempt spite hatred um demonization of the

222
00:38:55,520 --> 00:39:03,720
other and uh and uh so there the alternative is respect to enter into

223
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:10,000
disagreements with respect for the other even if they don't respect

224
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:16,119
us the third route is envy and greed and the word for greed

225
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:23,560
can also mean selfishness so envy and selfishness and um Envy for some people

226
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:30,480
is a really deep poison that uh it's not an issue for me but I've talked to people and I'm so surprised when I

227
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,480
started talking to people learning from people from which who how toxic it is for some people to live with envy and it

228
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,880
seems to maybe come along with a certain kind of uh um um undermining of One's

229
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:47,920
Own Integrity or well-being to just kind of be envious of others and what they

230
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:56,000
have and their situation uh or to be greedy uh selfish to uh want more want

231
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,200
everything and so some of the uh disputes has to do

232
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:08,440
with we want what they have and they don't want to give it to us or we can't have it the alternative if that settles

233
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:13,839
if that level of tension within quiets down the alternative is uh the healthy

234
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:21,079
alternative is generosity uh to want other people to be well to have things give them some of

235
00:40:21,079 --> 00:40:28,800
our things um wish them well then the next route for uh disputes

236
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:37,560
quarrels is deceit and deceptiveness to uh uh uh so uh to be

237
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:46,680
trying to deceive people into getting what we want uh to be deceptive in what we say to lie and uh this also is poison

238
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:52,920
for our society poison for our interpersonal relationships and uh it means that there's no trust there means

239
00:40:52,920 --> 00:41:01,720
that again there's no respect for others uh we're just trying to uh get our our way um without any cost at all the

240
00:41:01,720 --> 00:41:11,880
alternative to that as we relax the inner tensions forces of Deceit and deception is honesty honesty is medicine

241
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,359
honesty is uh the food for health

242
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:23,280
psychological spiritual health then that spreads and

243
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:31,880
inspires uh the next one uh the root of uh quarrels is uh evil and wrong View

244
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:37,440
and what exactly is meant by evil is not so clear but a wickedness just a pure

245
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:44,480
and simple maybe um tendency some people have just wanting to cause harm uh

246
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:50,119
without any other reason but to cause harm in some way and uh and wrong view

247
00:41:50,119 --> 00:41:57,040
is the wrong view that doesn't understand the nature of uh what is harmful and what is not harmful

248
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:03,079
so both of these evil and wrong View and from the Buddhist point of view involve

249
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:08,119
some kind of tension some kind of contraction some kind of agitation

250
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:15,920
within just like all the other Roots so as we drop down in our awareness of self

251
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:23,800
below the level of the coral and really in the subjective subjective level we start discovering these tensions and we

252
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:29,920
discover what we can relax and if this this one relax evil and wrong e and

253
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:35,440
wrong view uh there can be greater wisdom and the core wisdom in Buddhism

254
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:40,839
is the wisdom that uh penetrating wisdom that applies to almost everything is

255
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:50,040
what what causes harm and what causes welfare real welfare and the f f last root is

256
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:56,640
attachment to the world just being attached to this life that we're living and uh it can seem like like of course

257
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,079
we should be that way but uh the alternative is to be generous to the

258
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:09,760
world and um we don't have to be attached to the world to live a full full life in fact I would suggest that a

259
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:15,280
a world that would not at being attached to anything but being able to give being

260
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:24,680
able to be um a u generative from what inside out uh is uh is really what is a

261
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:31,280
kind of fantastic sense of well-being and and freedom um to be attached to the world

262
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:37,640
means that we are a consumer only holding on and not giving

263
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:43,839
away so the primary lesson that I'd like to pass on the Buddhist lesson is that

264
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:53,800
we want to be able to sit quietly enough in some way or other or find a way to be that we can um step below look below the

265
00:43:53,800 --> 00:44:01,079
level upon which the quarrels are going going on the disputes the fights that we have to see what is our contribution

266
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:07,559
within what's ATT tension pressure what are the roots within us and this list is

267
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:12,760
a good checklist to see are any of these present and as we find them to really

268
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:17,800
feel the physical subjective way in which that tension pressure is present

269
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:25,280
for us the agitation and then learn to relax and maybe it's easier to relax

270
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:31,800
physically mentally emotionally even than it is to

271
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:36,880
pull out the root itself initially to stop being envious but we might have

272
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,520
access to relaxing the tension around it so I would propose to you today if you

273
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,960
have any of these things today anger and envy

274
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:55,359
greed um deceit lie tendency to lie attachments of any kind contempt for

275
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:05,280
other people that you read about in the news politicians whatever it might be uh stop look below it subjectively is

276
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:12,920
there any tension and if there is see if you can relax and see what healthy

277
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:22,720
alternative is possible when you're relax so thank you very much and um look

278
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,880
forward to seeing being with you with you again tomorrow
