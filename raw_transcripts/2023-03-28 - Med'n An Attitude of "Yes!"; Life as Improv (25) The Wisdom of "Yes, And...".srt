arriving in the body arriving in this moment in time with an attitude of yes

15
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:58,399
an attitude of yes in our hearts yes yes

16
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:15,259
to this moment yes to this body however it is

17
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:21,200
it may be feeling great it might be tight and

18
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,880
icky hurting whatever is happening

19
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,480
the body in this moment can we say yes

20
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:45,420
can we say yes to all of it

21
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:50,839
with an open heart yes

22
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:20,640
exploring experimenting with

23
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,880
this perspective shift in perspective just a tiny bit

24
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:33,200
see how it shifts and changes our experience

25
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:38,839
starting with the body saying yes

26
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,839
to however it's showing up

27
00:12:05,339 --> 00:12:08,480
there is tightness

28
00:12:11,579 --> 00:12:17,220
achiness Etc

29
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:24,260
opening up these areas saying yes you're here

30
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,500
yes accepting the truth of the moment

31
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:45,500
this is what's arriving right now yes

32
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:57,240
instead of blocking pushing away which brings more agitation and

33
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,820
tightness a mind and heart

34
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:17,420
saying yes to the body relaxing softening

35
00:13:30,899 --> 00:13:34,639
saying yes to the breath

36
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:45,440
each breath each in breath each out breath individually

37
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,600
see if the acceptance the saying yes and come

38
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:07,819
from your heart from your body not from your head

39
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:17,779
your heart taking a stance of yes towards whatever is arising

40
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:51,779
foreign noticing where there are these subtle

41
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:57,440
no's no to experience

42
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:02,720
In This Moment

43
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,519
and first can you say yes to the no

44
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:28,199
accepting full yes to the resistance seeing what happens to the resistance if

45
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:33,959
there is any this attitude of yes

46
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:37,459
it's not to be forced

47
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:47,339
or sing no's to become a yes but accepting those with a yes see what

48
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,579
happens

49
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,959
maybe the heart softens the body softens some more

50
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:11,240
and then there can be a genuine subtle soft yes yes

51
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,380
whatever is arising

52
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:55,940
and being curious light-hearted exploring the different

53
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,539
tones of yes

54
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:13,279
how does a subtle yes feel in your body a gentle soft

55
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,419
yes

56
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:25,100
like the gentle arrays of

57
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:30,740
Morning Sun

58
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:36,740
yes yes

59
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,220
but if you turn the volume up and you're internal yes

60
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:03,660
what does an enthusiastic use the fortune yes feel like in your

61
00:21:03,660 --> 00:21:06,320

you can change experiment with another volume

69
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,760
it's one to ten maybe a five or maybe a one

70
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:40,820
a whisper

71

Pekka Equanimity beautiful thank you so much

133
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:45,320
so so I like to offer some reflections foreign

134
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:55,760
of this week which is uh inspired from the practice of Improv

135
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:03,839
which actually is a for me it's it's it is a deep and sacred practice you know

136
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:09,960
on the outside it can look really it's funny and silly but it's actually

137
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:15,000
it is a practice so

138
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:24,140
the uh there are many teachings in in the Canon of Improv

139
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,520
yesterday we started with the attitude this attitude of curiosity interest

140
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:39,119
lightness this just the sense of curiosity and the fullness and emptiness

141
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:45,359
in in our language in in Buddhism coming together with this this

142
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:52,400
um with with the lightness and also with with the actions in the world

143
00:43:53,099 --> 00:44:00,170
so today we turn through um we return to

144
00:44:00,170 --> 00:44:05,760
[Music] um What's called the teaching on yes yes

145
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:12,839
and which is the equivalent of that in our practice

146
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:18,900
is acceptance is accepting opening to experience not blocking experience but

147
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:26,480
being open to experience because if we block experience even if experience is difficult and challenging if we Block

148
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:31,800
it's becomes harder it becomes much more difficult

149
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:38,540
um but accepting there is a sense of opening of softness and it allows possibilities

150
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:45,420
so so in improv and and all of yeah let me just talk about improv for a

151
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:51,540
moment so an improv with teaching on yes and there's a concept of yes and

152
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:58,560
and the idea is that if you block so there's the concept related to that is

153
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:06,000
the concept of blocking versus accepting so so blocking is when

154
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:13,260
an offer is made for example if you're interactively if you're in a relational

155
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:18,720
situation as we often are in life saying improv if you're in a relational

156
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:25,500
say scene and playing with another player and they make an offer they they

157
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:30,839
make a you know made-up offer because improv is made up you're improvising and

158
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:37,440
our lives are also made up there's a lot of improvising

159
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:44,640
when when a player makes an offer to you for example says you know it gives you

160
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:51,720
an imaginary I don't know saucepan and say oh here take the saucepan whatever

161
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:57,240
if you say oh this is not a saucepan or oh I don't want a saucepan or a if you

162
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:04,319
block if you block if there's energy of blocking energy of no energy of no oh

163
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:09,660
that pretty much kills the interaction that kills the interaction and you can

164
00:46:09,660 --> 00:46:14,760
notice that in your own life um you can we actually often notice it

165
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:19,800
more in others when they block our invitations or block our offers

166
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:25,260
um you want to do this no I don't want to do that do you want to do that no I don't oh ouch

167
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:31,680
kills the energy whereas the idea of yes and

168
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:39,119
um save if for example you're offering you're inviting someone would you like to do this and say yes I would love to

169
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:44,940
do something with you and how about we do this because this is what I have energy for this is what I have time for

170
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:50,280
so there's a flow in the energy of life there's a flow in the energy of

171
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:57,180
interaction there's a flow in the energy of the moment yes and yes and so an

172
00:46:57,180 --> 00:47:03,060
improv concept of yes and is the most fundamental rule of improv you yes you

173
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:08,880
say yes to what's offered and you add something to it you add something it's

174
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:17,460
the and instead of yes but but we often do yes but it's yes and yes this is a

175
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:22,859
you know this is a cooking Implement and and yes and oh I needed one I'm about to

176
00:47:22,859 --> 00:47:29,940
make eggs or whatever or yes yes and yes and there is a sense of this Spirit of

177
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:35,220
generosity so blocking so we often block the energy

178
00:47:35,220 --> 00:47:42,119
of life even even when things are difficult when we push them away say for

179
00:47:42,119 --> 00:47:47,579
example um as I was guiding and leading this meditation I had a lot of aches and

180
00:47:47,579 --> 00:47:52,619
pains and tightness in my body and I've learned through my practice that if I

181
00:47:52,619 --> 00:48:01,740
tighten around them no I don't want this pain why this pains is terrible I get stuck I get stuck in in that or stuck in

182
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:08,220
life whereas yes yes yes okay all right yes there is there is this tightness

183
00:48:08,220 --> 00:48:15,480
there is this pain there is this discomfort yes I open up to it my heart opens up to it my heart opens up to it

184
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:22,859
and it softens it's it's acceptance it becomes part of the experience and it's not taking Center Stage so there's a lot

185
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:28,140
of wisdom in saying yes and in the in

186
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:34,140
the with the wisdom of acceptance and and

187
00:48:34,140 --> 00:48:41,700
through improv we can see it from a different perspective because we often see it from you know from the dharmic

188
00:48:41,700 --> 00:48:47,280
perspective it's usually a similar perspective that we have and acceptance opening

189
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:57,240
versus from the the inspired by improv this way of saying yes and yes and

190
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:02,819
um there's a sense of opening even to the challenges in life even to the child

191
00:49:02,819 --> 00:49:07,980
it's not always easy and and and and Roses

192
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:13,760
um and yet can we open up to what is instead of

193
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:22,200
blocking it no no no no no or coalescing around the the difficulty

194
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:29,400
with make giving it central stage um there is so much possibility and

195
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:36,420
openness there's so many routes and there when we say yes it opens options

196
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:43,440
it opens our way of seeing it opens our perspective it opens um it opens lots of options the same way

197
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:48,660
that in improv saying yes then you have a lot of options yes and let me try this

198
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:54,240
yes let me try that yes all these options whereas when we say no or resist

199
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:59,640
or there's there is this blocked energy in our heart just kind of kind of gets

200
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:05,160
stuck in in the uh in the blocking so

201
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:12,960
concept of blocking versus acceptance and the yes and so so the

202
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:21,359
invitation I have for you today is to try saying yes is to try saying yes

203
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:26,640
um to to what is to try saying yes and the yes could be a

204
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:32,460
very subtle yes of yes I acknowledge yes it is like this right now yes yes and

205
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:39,000
can you add can you have more creativity instead of just ending with the yes can

206
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:49,440
you invite your creativity we all have creativity as human beings can you say yes and yes and

207
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:57,240
when invitations come in can you say yes and instead of no can it

208
00:50:57,240 --> 00:51:03,480
be a yes and yes I'd love to do this and I can do it in this way or yes I'd love to do this and let's do it that's

209
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:10,020
embellish it yes and can we bring more creativity can we bring more possibilities

210
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:17,819
um to to our lives today especially relationally relationally with others or even our own

211
00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:23,760
Hearts when something comes up maybe it feels like all the same old same old uh

212
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:33,540
no I don't want to do this uh oh but yes yes can I find a way to say yes and and

213
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:38,700
make it more creative and find other ways can we challenge ourselves this is

214
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:44,940
such this life is so impermanent and precious and

215
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:50,460
and it's amazing to be conscious for anything to exist at all but here we are

216
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:56,280
with all these opportunities these Myriad opportunities to learn and grow

217
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:02,760
even when things are difficult as they often are and it's okay it's okay it's

218
00:52:02,760 --> 00:52:10,020
part of being a live learning growing so may you be well may you may you say

219
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:17,099
