1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,920
so welcome and let's begin meditating together today

2
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:21,520
so coming into the sense of your body sitting or lying down

3
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,840
standing whatever posture you're in

4
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,440
just letting go of any energy of arriving and settling in

5
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:41,280
and connecting with others and just now feeling that sense of being here

6
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,840
in the group and also in your body

7
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,680
if it's comfortable doing so you can close your eyes

8
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,360
just bring the attention inward

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
and it's often good at the beginning of a sit to just connect briefly with your

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,799
posture how it is that you're sitting

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,200
because in a sense the way that we have our body and our posture has an effect on the

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:27,280
mind during the sit so we connect in with where we're

13
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,799
sitting [Music] the body resting against some surface

14
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:40,680
cushion or a chair or bed with a floor

15
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:47,840
i'm just sensing those contact points where you're being supported

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,640
allowing yourself to relax into those

17
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:05,399
feeling the stability of where you're sitting

18
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,599
having a stable base or groundedness

19
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,560
and then you can sense the uprightness or the straightness of the body when

20
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:46,080
it's supported in that way so if you're sitting you may feel the way the spine rises up from the seat

21
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,720
almost as if suspended from above or the way a sea plant

22
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,680
rises off the sea floor floating in the water

23
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,599
just gently buoyed upward

24
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:16,920
even if you're lying down you can sense into the straightness of the spine that is easy when the body is well supported

25
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,280
and then allowing some softness in the rest of the body

26
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:37,280
liking the plant the fronds of the plant float in the water

27
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,440
the arms float the head floats on the spine

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:02,640
we can soften any tenseness in the shoulders

29
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:06,480
in the belly

30
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,519
softening any bracing in the legs

31
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:38,440
even relaxing the thinking muscle in the mind

32
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,198
not so much to stop any thinking but simply to reduce its intensity

33
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:59,280
letting some of the softness and spaciousness of the body

34
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:06,280
absorb some of that intensity of thinking

35
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:21,280
and then connecting in with the sensations of breathing

36
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,960
the gentle coming in and going out of the breath

37
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:35,160
just naturally however it is right now is fine

38
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,360
being receptive to the sensations of the breath

39
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:07,160
as if opening the door to them when they arrive as a guest

40
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:15,400
welcoming them in and out receptively

41
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:51,680
we may sense that the breath is a whole body experience

42
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:59,599
it doesn't only touch us in the nasal passages and the ones

43
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:06,560
kind of anatomical breath but it affects

44
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,960
many things throughout the body as we feel the gentle expansion of the

45
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,120
body as the breath comes in and then the softening

46
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,960
and release as it goes out

47
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:31,520
as the breath energy distributes itself throughout the body

48
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,400
just seeing if you can sense the breath as a whole body experience

49
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,840
in whatever way it is for you right now

50
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,320
and now i will offer an image

51
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:53,120
so imagine that you are sitting under a tree

52
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:58,720
on a warm and mild summer day

53
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:05,760
it's cool in the shade of the tree

54
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,680
and the grass where you're sitting is soft

55
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:25,839
and you're a little bit secluded like maybe up on a small hill

56
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,760
and your eyes are a little open and you're watching people

57
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,440
working or playing harmoniously down below

58
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:52,640
maybe they're working in the garden or perhaps it's a group of children

59
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,160
laughing as they play

60
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:09,839
and just in this simple scene you you feel a sense of well-being

61
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,120
there's kind of a completeness or a wholeness

62
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,759
to this moment on this day

63
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,959
you can simultaneously feel your body resting under the tree

64
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:39,600
the warmth of your skin the relaxation in your muscles

65
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,600
and you can see the harmonious activity going on below

66
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,680
which gives you a warm emotional feeling

67
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:13,959
now you can gently let this image fade

68
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:23,760
can let go of the effort of bringing it to mind but just keep that feeling of well-being

69
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,839
letting it pervade the body and mind

70
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:43,839
and just keep resting with the with the breath

71
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:48,959
and if the mind gets busy or begins to drift away

72
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,079
to something else when you notice that

73
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:59,760
you might just call up again this sense of well-being

74
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,759
just inviting that back in in a gentle way

75
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:25,279
if the emotions or sensations are very strong we might just have the well-being

76
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:30,600
as a partner with them along the side

77
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:41,040
or maybe it's possible to gradually return again to that sense of unity and

78
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,040
alignment

79
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:04,558
one teacher has called this experience of well-being

80
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:11,360
an experience of being coherent between the mind and the body

81
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:21,280
our system has somehow become coherent together when it's aligned like this

82
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:30,480
it can be very helpful in practice to find places within our system that do

83
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,919
feel coherent aligned and be able to

84
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:42,080
connect with those or even rest in those even if there are other parts that are

85
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,559
not so coherent

86
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,360
so we're aware of all of it but we particularly know where there is

87
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,480
this sense of well-being and we can connect in with that

88
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:08,960
seeing if you can stay with that even in the face of other experiences

89
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,520
happening too

90
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,679
um

91
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:37,760
when there's been a period in meditation when

92
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:44,480
the mind is somewhat coherent mind and body it can be helpful

93
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:52,080
to open and notice the experience of knowing

94
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:57,120
what is it like to be aware in this

95
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:02,960
state of mind what's it like to be aware of a

96
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:06,158
state of well-being

97
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,880
can you sense the quality of attention or knowing

98
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,840
in this state

99
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:32,559
there may be a kind of brightness or warmth

100
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:36,880
or openness and receptivity

101
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:45,039
somehow in the mind nothing needs to be done with it

102
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:51,679
just to know the quality of that awakeness

103
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,679
scented

104
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,919
and as we gently begin turning toward

105
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:12,278
the rest of our day or evening

106
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:19,760
we may consider how we can bring this

107
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,440
inner harmony to whatever degree it was experienced

108
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,799
out into the world

109
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:37,440
this sense of well-being or

110
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:42,120
unity or alignment

111
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,400
more coherence

112
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:54,960
this quality that we've touched in ourselves to whatever degree

113
00:25:55,279 --> 00:26:00,559
how might it manifest out in the world

114
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:10,440
surely we will encounter what is not harmonious what is not coherent

115
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:19,200
but is there a way that we can still touch that with a

116
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,279
harmonious mind to be in harmony with what is not

117
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:28,000
harmonious

118
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:39,840
to have coherent understanding of what is not coherent

119
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,520
we may not immediately see how

120
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:05,120
that affects the world now in the moment we may not

121
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,200
have a change in the situation but there is an effect

122
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:19,360
from the larger picture all of our minds are interacting and

123
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:26,399
when there are some that are somewhat harmonious and

124
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:34,880
caring connected it contributes to the whole

125
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,640
often in unseen ways

126
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:50,559
and all we need to do is make to make a contribution is to remember

127
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:57,440
to stay connected to that part in us that has the well-being

128
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:05,600
and the coherence to whatever degree we can

129
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:09,080
it all helps

130
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:31,840
so we wish well for ourselves and for those around us

131
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,799
for the whole world

132
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:48,399
and we wish also that others may discover this part of themselves that is

133
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:54,480
in a state of well-being that is collected that is unified

134
00:28:54,480 --> 00:29:02,000
may they too know such experiences may they too contribute to the whole

135
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,600
whenever possible for them

136
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:15,760
in this world so in need of peace and harmony and wholeness

137
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,399
may we do all we can to contribute to that

138
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:08,799
okay so as we learn to

139
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:14,080
be with our body this series is called the depth of the

140
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:21,360
body we'll begin to experience tranquility of the body

141
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,960
and we can discover ways in which the body and the mind

142
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:32,880
can find harmony at least in some areas and then maybe

143
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,760
spread that out and that degree of harmony that we can find supports our well-being

144
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:47,759
so the body is a tremendous support for well-being in the mind and the heart

145
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:54,720
so we'll unpack this a bit today so there is a suta that is devoted

146
00:30:54,720 --> 00:31:00,240
entirely to mindfulness of the body for those of you who like references

147
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,720
it's mn 119 the kayak

148
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,120
and i find this to be a very interesting suta because the buddha

149
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:17,039
communicates many of the teachings about body practice

150
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:24,799
through images it seems to be you know somehow that was what he was inspired to talk about when

151
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:32,399
he talked about how to be mindful of the body and how to use mindfulness of the body to develop the

152
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:37,760
the path to awakening so i want to convey some of these images

153
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:43,039
today and you know you can maybe

154
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:50,640
just rest in the the images that are offered they're not really meant as visualizations you know

155
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:57,519
we don't need to put them up into our cognitive mind in a certain way

156
00:31:57,519 --> 00:32:03,760
but they're you can imagine the image but i think it's meant more as a visceral

157
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:09,600
experience to try to touch in what into what that would feel like

158
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,039
to be conveyed by the image so there are a series of

159
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:20,320
meditative states where the mind and the body become deeply unified

160
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:27,200
these are actually known about in many traditions but they're described in a particular

161
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:33,919
way in this tradition so perhaps you've heard the word samadhi

162
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:39,919
this literally means collected together or composed or gathered

163
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,480
and there are many different forms of it there isn't just one one correct way to

164
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:52,559
do it or one experience of it and there are many different levels of it also you know we

165
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,760
can have some degree of genuine samadhi actually in daily life

166
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:02,960
if our mind is sufficiently unified around what we're doing

167
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:10,000
and then there are also you know many meditative states that have this quality of being gathered together

168
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,039
so i um i brought the text with me today

169
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:21,200
and i thought i would actually just read some of these images

170
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,200
some of you may have heard them but nonetheless it's really nice to just listen to

171
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:35,679
so here's one just as a skilled bath man or a bath

172
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:40,799
man's apprentice heaps bath powder in a metal basin

173
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:47,840
and sprinkling it gradually with water needs it until the moisture wets the

174
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,679
ball of bath powder soaks it and pervades it inside and out

175
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:59,840
and yet the ball itself does not ooze so too

176
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:06,000
a practitioner or meditator makes the rapture and pleasure born of

177
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,040
seclusion drench steep fill and pervade this body so that there

178
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,960
is no part of their whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure

179
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:24,638
born of seclusion it's a really nice image so

180
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,878
we have this rapture and pleasure pervading and filling the body

181
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:38,158
and in this particular image we kind of work them into the body like working water into

182
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:45,599
bath powder according to this image we don't really use bath powder but we could imagine a flower say working

183
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:51,118
the water into it to make a nice dough something like that

184
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:57,440
and so there's a sense and this is at the beginning of when one starts to practice this on the

185
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,640
cushion so maybe there's a sense that we need to kind of connect the body and the

186
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:08,640
mind together there's two different things being unified through our effort

187
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,320
of filling the body with rapture and pleasure in some way

188
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:20,640
so that's kind of nice and then after that it goes on to images that are much more

189
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,320
about water there's a sense of um of water the purity

190
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:34,160
clearness of water so here we have this image just as though there were a lake whose

191
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:40,480
waters welled up from below and it had no inflow from east west

192
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:47,680
north or south and would not be replenished from time to time by showers of rain

193
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:55,440
then the cool fount of water welling up in the lake would make the cool water drench steep

194
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,440
fill and pervade the lake so that there would be no part of the whole lake

195
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:08,480
unpervaded by cool water so too a meditator makes the rapture and

196
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:16,160
pleasure born of concentration drench steep fill and pervade this body

197
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:22,400
so that there is no part of their whole body unpervaded by the rapture and pleasure

198
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:29,040
worn of concentration so as we get a little bit more settled there's this lake image

199
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:35,599
where the lake doesn't have any rain coming in it doesn't have any streams coming in

200
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:41,359
maybe it's a mountain lake and it's fed by an underwater spring

201
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:48,800
and the waters from that come up and fill the entire lake and we're to imagine the

202
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:55,839
body as being like a lake and there's a way in which this well-being that we're experiencing

203
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:02,320
begins to well up from within you know maybe before we were thinking about

204
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:09,119
external reasons why we could have well-being the body is feeling calm i've managed to

205
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:15,440
get it quiet in my house you know i'm at ease because i just had that good cup

206
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,640
of tea you know we're kind of settling in um but these are a little bit external

207
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:26,079
and then there's a point where something internal kicks in and the body has a sense somebody in

208
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,680
mind have a sense of well-being that comes entirely from inside

209
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:37,440
and then it goes on [Music] we'll just look a little bit farther

210
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:42,480
and then we have an image of lotuses in the water

211
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,400
it says there's a pond with blue red and white lotuses

212
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:56,240
some lotuses are born and grow in the water and they thrive immersed in the water without rising out of it

213
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,160
and the cool water drenches steeps fills and pervades these lotuses

214
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:10,160
to their tips and their roots so that there is no part of the lotuses unprovated by cool water

215
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:17,200
and so too the meditator [Music] feels this sense of

216
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:23,839
rapture and ease actually at that point there's only pleasure and ease of filling the body

217
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:29,200
so it's the same kind of image but it's actually a little bit more settled instead of having a

218
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:34,560
bubbling spring coming up and filling the lake we can imagine some dynamic

219
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:41,359
motion from that there's instead a sense of just a lotus standing still

220
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:47,480
with the water all around it it's a calmer image if you will

221
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:54,640
you know and then it goes on in certain ways they're quite amazing images um

222
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:00,640
and now they're not as i said they're not meant as visualizations we don't sit and imagine ourselves as a lotus but

223
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,839
they're meant to describe experiences that we can have when the mind begins to

224
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:12,320
rest with a single object for with a fairly good continuity of attention and these are

225
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,320
natural occurrences there's nothing that we need to force into existence for these things to

226
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:23,920
come about so i think what i want to convey with these is that this is a state that's

227
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:29,359
very healing you know the mind and the body become healed

228
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:36,880
through this strong presence of the body in these visceral bodily type images

229
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:43,920
if we just stay in the mind during our meditation it doesn't penetrate perhaps as deeply

230
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,920
into these more [Music] sensory based images so there's a way

231
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:57,440
that they bring healing and wholeness to our system so many of us are looking for healing in certain ways from meditation

232
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:02,640
my sense is that samadhi is really a good

233
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,400
possibility for that it may be how the buddha encouraged that among his followers

234
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:15,680
so the buddha isn't done with images yet in this suta he describes all these meditative images but he then goes on to

235
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:22,480
talk about the kind of wholesome strength that comes when we are connected deeply with the

236
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:29,040
body and he says that a person who has very well developed mindfulness of the body for

237
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:35,200
such a person mara who is the force that represents distraction as

238
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:41,040
well as on wholesomeness and buddhist teachings what it says is mara cannot find an

239
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:47,119
opportunity or a support in that person and so then there's a bunch of images about that

240
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:53,520
and maybe i'll just read one of those too so when the mind

241
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:59,520
is not well developed when mindfulness of the body is not well developed it says

242
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:06,240
suppose a person were to throw a heavy stone ball upon a mound of wet clay what

243
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:12,640
do you think would that heavy ball find entry into that mound of wet clay

244
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:18,720
and of course the monks say yes yes it would and then the buddha goes on and says

245
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,800
well for somebody who has well developed mindfulness of the body

246
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,000
suppose a person were to throw a light ball of string at a door panel made

247
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:36,400
entirely of heartwood what do you think would that light ball of string find entry through that door

248
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:41,680
panel made entirely of heartwood and of course the monks say no

249
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:48,640
so the buddha says well in the same way someone without well-developed mindfulness of the body mara

250
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:54,400
can find an opportunity just like a ball entering wet clay whereas

251
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,839
for someone with well-developed mindfulness of the body mara cannot find any entry or

252
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:06,319
opportunity just as if throwing a light wall of string at a wooden door panel

253
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:13,760
and there are other images given also so there's a sense then that mindfulness of the body creates a

254
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:18,960
lot of inner strength in a person you know the mind and the body become

255
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,560
unified and even if we don't go into you know very deep

256
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:31,040
states of of meditation there's a way that i think even just over time having a lot of mindfulness of

257
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,880
the body gradually imparts more and more strength to the system and i see that as

258
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:42,000
being related to the what i was calling alignment and coherence you know a

259
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:49,440
system that is coherent is stronger than one that's kind of scattered and going in lots of different directions

260
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,640
and this strength has very practical effects according to the suta

261
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:01,440
there are a whole bunch of then advanced benefits listed of mindfulness of the body i won't go through all of them

262
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,560
but here are a few one becomes a conqueror of discontent

263
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:13,839
and delight discontent does not conquer oneself and one abides overcoming discontent

264
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:19,040
whenever it arises one becomes a conqueror of fear and

265
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:24,640
dread and abides overcoming them whenever they arise

266
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:31,839
one bears heat and cold hunger and thirst contact with gadflies mosquitoes wind

267
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:38,720
the sun and creeping things one endures ill-spoken unwelcome words

268
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:45,119
and arisen bodily feelings that are painful and even life-threatening

269
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:52,480
so there's a lot of endurance and strength that comes through mindfulness of the body

270
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,920
practicing this will help us become more resilient in the face of

271
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:05,440
life maybe we don't have gadflies but maybe we too mosquitoes wind the sun and creeping

272
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:10,800
things so the inconveniences and difficulties of the natural world

273
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,720
heat and cold hunger and thirst how about ill-spoken unwelcome words

274
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,400
mindfulness of the body can help us become strong in the face of those

275
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:29,200
as well as other mental and physical difficulties discontent or risen bodily feelings that

276
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:35,920
are painful and i notice that it even includes delight we become a conqueror of delight

277
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,040
so of course we you know it's not that we don't want to have pleasure and delight in our life

278
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:46,319
that's fine but we we become conquered by them if we can be

279
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:52,160
drawn in and knocked off balance made giddy if you will by

280
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,200
pleasure and excitement so also mindfulness of the body will help us to

281
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,800
remain grounded during pleasant experiences so this is quite a lot of good things

282
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,599
that come from mindfulness of the body and then later down in the list it goes on even to say that

283
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:14,640
we can reach awakening through liberation through mindfulness of the body

284
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:21,280
and the buddha knew what he was talking about from his own experience it said in another part of the teachings

285
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:27,119
that when the buddha before his awakening was contemplating how he might reach

286
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,720
awakening he remembered a time when he was sitting peacefully

287
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:40,079
under a rose apple tree watching his father blow conduct a plowing ceremony

288
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:45,680
in the field and he was a boy at the time so he was not participating he was just watching

289
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:51,920
from under the tree and his mind spontaneously became unified and peaceful

290
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:58,480
you know there in the in the world sitting under the tree and he thought to himself as he remembered this

291
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:05,359
just before his awakening he remembered back to this and he thought is this the way to awakening

292
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:12,079
it is he had the insight oh that's the way and that was his inspiration to sit down

293
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,760
under the bodhi tree and have the insights that led to his waking up

294
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:23,839
so this gently unified mind that we're cultivating is quite important for

295
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:31,440
setting us up to be able to see clearly and deeply and tomorrow's topic will be the body

296
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:37,359
as a vehicle of insight so if you can join then i will see you then

297
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:40,599
be well
