1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:07,600
so good morning everyone good day

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,719
and uh a little introduction to

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:21,279
further introduction to this idea of contemplation of a corpse

4
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,960
so we know that one of the core practices of

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,920
theravada and buddhism of much of buddhism is the four foundations of mindfulness

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,680
and within that those teachings is this teaching on the

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:48,000
corpse contemplating of a corpse but it's i think of it as as a part of a triad

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,199
of meditations the one on the parts of the body the ones on the four elements

9
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,039
or properties and this now this one the corpse and they come together because they all

10
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,439
involve um using something like the imagination

11
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:10,960
and some kind of the words that word that's used especially the first two for the

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:18,320
verb the action is imagine or or visualize something

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,640
and here also it's not we're not going to see a corpse literally but as if we're seeing one so using the

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:31,200
imagination and some people would protest that mindfulness practice is not about using

15
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,240
the imagination it's the opposite it's about seeing directly what's here

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:43,840
and that's true but uh we live in imagination quite a bit

17
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:50,320
without realizing it sometimes we think that we're in touch with reality but it's really through the

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:57,200
filter of how we interpret how we imagine things to be how we construct things to be

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,320
and so here we're using imagination to overcome imagination using

20
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,039
imagination to somehow pop the bubble of the previous imaginations

21
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:15,200
so that we can do this deep work of seeing things as they are

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:20,879
and so in some sense this corpse meditation is kind of preliminary supposed to help us

23
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:27,040
be able to go into the next three foundations and really see much more deeply

24
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:33,599
and with the parts of the body and the four elements we're beginning to

25
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,720
take apart what we take as a whole and with a whole we tend to then

26
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,840
project on all these ideas of what the whole is and we're starting to see

27
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,519
the parts but you kind of drop the image of the whole the idea of the whole and see the

28
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,879
parts of who we are and this ability to look at the parts

29
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,920
then we use the course meditation the classic reason for doing it

30
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,840
is to overcome identification with this body

31
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,280
taking this body as this is who i am or this is mine in some way

32
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,480
and we know that people are very body conscious in the sense that they very much identify with their body and their

33
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:23,280
physical body and how it appears to other people this body we have is all made from

34
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:29,599
borrowed material in a sense it's given to us for the

35
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,959
duration of our life or not even that because there's so much recycling going on even while we're alive

36
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:40,239
but all the material parts of this body are here temporarily

37
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:47,760
and they're here they've been recycled many times before and after these these elements in our

38
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:53,920
body uh our body is finished with them they'll go into uh into other other

39
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:59,040
transformations or their bodies or their living beings other

40
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:04,959
i take other forms at some point i will start dying will

41
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:11,200
die and this body will be transformed if we do green burial and bury our body

42
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,680
in the ground um fungi and worms and bugs and different

43
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:24,800
things will gently devour this corpse starting from the outside perhaps

44
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:29,639
working its way in bacteria

45
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,240
and um if we get cremated the fire just begins on the outside with the skin and burning

46
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,000
or burning its way inward in the old days you leave the body and

47
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,280
out in the open and the birds would come and peck at it and worms would crawl into it

48
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:56,560
and and start from the outside and so the skin would go first dissolve

49
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,080
first the flesh would dissolve next the tendons next they're harder

50
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:08,720
eventually just the bones are left and then the bones are left and they begin to

51
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,320
bleach in the sun and begin to get more brittle and eventually they

52
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,320
dissolve into dust and so the meditation on the corpse

53
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,600
contemplation of corpse is to kind of follow this possibility for ourselves

54
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:31,440
this dissolution of the body as a way of disidentifying as me myself

55
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:39,440
that i'm my body and this is me in some way to soften those strong associations

56
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:44,720
but also to quiet the mind

57
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:51,520
because the mind that is thinking a lot is the mind is a thinking that constructs many of the ideas we have

58
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:58,479
about the body and as meditation goes deeper and deeper the same kind of

59
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:03,600
journey happens as a dissolution of the body after death the corpse

60
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,800
we first the boundaries of the body get soft and they have skin and the boundary to the outside world begins to dissolve

61
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,919
and it gets very very soft and open and then the

62
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:23,280
we go in closer and the muscles the experience of muscles the sense of being in a

63
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:29,600
muscle body flesh body begins to fade away from consciousness

64
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:34,960
and then you get deeper into the body even the sense of hardness might be the last thing hardness somewhere in the

65
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:41,520
body heaviness and eventually that dissolves as well and so in the meditative process also

66
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:47,360
involves a dissolution and so this the solution of the corpse meditation

67
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,880
is both a way of disidentifying and a way

68
00:06:52,880 --> 00:07:00,560
to begin preparing yourself for this deep process of meditation that can happen

69
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:07,280
so we'll do some of this today so taking a meditation posture

70
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:18,400
and the care that you give to your posture the love and compassion you give to taking a nice posture

71
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,360
is maybe the context for doing this meditation

72
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,800
and maybe with the same care and compassion to gently take some deeper breaths

73
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:43,000
to connect to yourself more fully to connect yourself more kindly

74
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,039
relaxing as you exhale

75
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,960
some people when they die the first minutes after they die occasionally

76
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,560
there's a lot of letting go of muscular tension they've been holding for a lifetime

77
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:17,198
it's good not to wait to let go of the tension

78
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,879
letting your breath breathe itself ordinary breathing

79
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:32,399
relaxing letting go of the holding which will let

80
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:35,959
go as you die

81
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,680
letting go into your body

82
00:08:52,480 --> 00:09:00,600
and then taking a few moments a few breaths to just settle into ordinary breathing

83
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:53,360
as you exhale as you inhale feel any tension in your

84
00:09:53,360 --> 00:10:01,360
mind your thinking mind any pressure or agitation

85
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:08,480
and with love with care on the exhale

86
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,760
relax the thinking mind

87
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:26,120
soften

88
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,079
and then whatever way that it occurs to you

89
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:44,639
feel the edges of your body where the skin

90
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:50,000
it either touches the air or touches your clothes

91
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:04,240
as you exhale imagine that you're relaxing

92
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,360
that contact with the world around your skin

93
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:26,920
maybe feeling the spaciousness the space that's around all around you

94
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:48,640
and maybe you feel the porousness or the soft boundaries of

95
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:57,639
the edges of your body and what's beyond the edges of your body and what's inside

96
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:11,279
breathing with it soft boundary

97
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:18,720
breathing letting go of the skin being yours

98
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,079
that you're defined by your skin

99
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:37,440
like a corpse loses its skin

100
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:43,440
it gets eaten or dissolved or burned so

101
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:50,480
let go of your skin let go of that boundary place

102
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,040
and feel deeper into your body

103
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,480
maybe the warmth of your flesh

104
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,079
the substance of flesh through your body

105
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:14,320
maybe it's a warmth maybe a coolness tingling pulsing

106
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:25,680
if flesh which right now is still alive with the sensations

107
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,399
this too will begin to dissolve and break up

108
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:44,800
and decay and disappear when your body is a corpse

109
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,639
the flesh will go

110
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,959
relaxing this flesh relaxing a sense that it's yours

111
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,199
that you're defined by your flesh

112
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:16,639
imagine that you your corpse is dissolving and the flesh

113
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,519
is disappearing

114
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:28,759
and then more deeply

115
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:41,680
all your organs in your torso all dissolve all

116
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,279
are eaten they're burned up these two are not

117
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,079
our possession not what defines us

118
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:59,079
they all the elements they return to nature

119
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:09,040
imagining a large empty cavity

120
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:16,160
in your rib cage and your torso as all the organs

121
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,120
vanish decompose

122
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:35,680
and then imagine that all you are left is skeleton

123
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:42,480
hard bones

124
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:59,360
and this skeleton is not your possession it's also borrowed materials

125
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,399
it too will dissolve this too we have to let go of

126
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,920
and first the skeleton all the tendons decay decompose and then

127
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,040
bones fall apart from each other and lay in a heap

128
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:27,839
on the ground disconnected bones

129
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,360
there's no more shape of the body

130
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:43,440
body shape has disappeared a heap of bones

131
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,399
and over time the bones

132
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,880
break into pieces are brittle slowly slowly

133
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:07,360
they turn into dust

134
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:15,438
and as the bones turn into dust they blow away in the

135
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,199
to wind across the land

136
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:32,640
falling into the soil on which new life

137
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,200
grows

138
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:50,960
let go of bones this whole body dissolved is gone

139
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:58,160
the absence of body vast space

140
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:04,280
vast openness in all directions

141
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:40,000
whatever way that you might be more settled or calmer in your sitting now

142
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,398
maybe more peaceful cozy

143
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:53,840
let go let go of everything

144
00:27:53,840 --> 00:28:02,600
but let go into that calm let go of your body

145
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:11,320
your skin your flesh let go of your bones

146
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,120
feel the way that letting go

147
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:30,799
is a better alternative to holding on and being tense

148
00:28:30,799 --> 00:28:34,039
let go

149
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:08,240
and as we come to the end of the sitting imagine

150
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:18,240
encountering other people in situations where it's safe to do so

151
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:25,120
safe comfortable situations meeting other people

152
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:33,760
and letting go fully just letting go and being present

153
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:40,159
with your caring with your care your love your good will

154
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:46,679
your warmth your non-defensiveness

155
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:55,120
free of impatience or desires or wanting things different

156
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,240
just with people

157
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:07,600
offering something profound a presence of attention that wants

158
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:14,880
nothing needs nothing just there to be present

159
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:20,440
and perhaps to care to love

160
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:29,760
may our care spread out into the world may it be that this practice of letting

161
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:36,480
go deeply is a support for the welfare and happiness of ourselves

162
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:42,080
and the whole world may all beings

163
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:49,559
be happy may all beings be safe

164
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:57,360
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

165
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:00,600
be free

166
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:31,880
thank you so

167
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:40,000
contemplation of the corpse it is um

168
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,440
in terrible buddhism sometimes it's understood that one of the best practices

169
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:55,679
at the time of dying is the four foundations for awareness for attention

170
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:01,360
it's the one that most conducive towards liberation towards freedom

171
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:07,919
and that's one of the best times better late than never to become free

172
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:13,919
and so sometimes this this text that we're studying becomes read at people's bedside that

173
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:19,519
they're dying sometimes in pali they don't understand it but somehow it's

174
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,200
meant to be beneficial and sometimes it's red after people die

175
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:30,640
so this text this text has a connection to death and dying and here it's at the

176
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:35,919
center of it with this contemplation of a corpse

177
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:43,760
and so there was i offered a small guided meditation on with this kind of in the

178
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,320
as a reference point and and um i don't know if i set it up well enough

179
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:58,240
and short amount of time we had but i'd love to see some comments in the chat probably brief comments but

180
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:04,880
what it was like if you were able to follow along with the dissolution of the body kind of meditation

181
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:11,279
and i'd like to know what uh how this was received or what

182
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:17,519
what you learned from it or what what benefit came from it so um

183
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,720
take a couple of minutes here and i'll say a few words until they start appearing

184
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,360
the um i think here in the west many people will emphasize the importance of the

185
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,440
value of mindfulness of death and dying corpse because of how it makes us really

186
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,039
here we go daunting freeing got a sense of no self very powerful got

187
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:49,600
to the point to the big question who am i made me smile freeing

188
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:54,640
love preparing for my death freeing we are not the body

189
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:59,679
i found it profoundly freeing i now notice a dissolving of attachment

190
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,360
very beneficial but do it again very powerful tangible perspective

191
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:10,960
and they were going very fast now the process helped with reducing fear of death

192
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,398
calming i pictured myself decaying in a field of flowers

193
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:23,358
felt like a deep knowing of our mortality the rising of deep compassion

194
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:30,079
i thought i'd be afraid but it's going so fast ended up in a puddle

195
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:36,240
beautiful spacious onward leading first revisiting then very peaceful

196
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:41,358
freeing an insight into true reality very spacious hard to come back into my

197
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,720
thinking mind i felt like i was in outer space

198
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:54,879
reassuring connection to nature in the universe is powerful and comforting

199
00:34:55,040 --> 00:35:02,240
body is not myself connected was very light non-attached free

200
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:07,838
powerful helpful new and different dissolving into space

201
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:14,960
was able to follow peaceful i want to go back and listen to the whole series thank you

202
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,880
we'll have green burial just following breath

203
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,400
pouring in teaching but i was not so ready to take it this too to my heart

204
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:32,560
i wasn't into it my body was blown into the wind identification with itself disappeared

205
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:39,359
spacious really good work the sense of increasing space awareness was quite profound

206
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:45,520
each layer became more and more spacious very calm body just a vessel the experience of

207
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:52,160
emptiness relieving great well thank you for those who wrote that and i know that this wasn't going

208
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,359
to work for everyone and for those of you who might have found it and not so

209
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:05,680
peaceful or nice hopefully you can just put aside this part of this

210
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,960
we're going to get to you know

211
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:16,720
we'll leave this behind in a way as we move to the next next second foundation next week

212
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:22,960
before i go on i just want to mention that um i will i won't be here monday so we

213
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,560
won't have the 7 a.m sitting this coming monday but we will start again on tuesday

214
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:33,680
and that's when we start with um the

215
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:42,079
feeling tones the second foundation for awareness for mindfulness and this is often considered

216
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:48,560
kind of the pivotal part of the satipatana and i'll talk a

217
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,240
little bit in how structurally and different ways it's pivotal to a huge transition that's going to happen in the

218
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,960
practice as we go from the body to the mind

219
00:36:59,359 --> 00:37:05,839
so i was going to say that many western dharma teachers will talk about mindfulness of

220
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:12,640
of death as a way of really cherishing that we're alive and really then appreciating we're alive and enjoying it

221
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,079
and being with it more fully and that's a certainly a wonderful thing to do

222
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:24,800
i think the tradition tends to focus on it more in the way that it helps us let go of attachment attachment to self

223
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:30,400
attachment to the body and in particularly attachments to concepts and ideas

224
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:36,560
that and all these things all attachments will keep us from

225
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:44,960
really sinking in deeply into this satipatana into this awareness practice that word of cultivating and developing

226
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:52,079
some people though find that this satipattani's contemplation of the corpse is a very

227
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:58,160
engaging visualization practice and some people who visualize well

228
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:05,520
find that they get really concentrated by doing this and having a you know actually the contemplation is nine parts

229
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,960
and so having is not this structure of nine parts to solution going through it over and over again

230
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:16,400
some people get very concentrated and that's one of the things that supports this awareness practice is

231
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:23,599
concentration and and the idea is to get it concentrated enough so we can do the refrain

232
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:29,839
so that we can we don't have to worry about the mind wandering off anymore and we can just settle back and just observe

233
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:35,040
our experience in a deep way and and then we're

234
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:41,440
let go of the corpse meditation at that point but uh one of the things we set back in this deep concentrated state and

235
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,200
just observe is the arising and disappearing the rising and dissolving of sensations

236
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,920
experiences thoughts feelings and and this contemplation of the corpse

237
00:38:53,920 --> 00:39:00,880
prepares the ground for that because sometimes it's disorienting for people to see everything dissolving

238
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,560
and then appearing and dissolving and disappearing that can happen when the mind is very very still and quiet and

239
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,160
not organized around ideas and concepts and attachments

240
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:17,599
and um so um um so this course meditation kind of

241
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:22,640
prepares the ground also for the deeper dimensions of the refrain

242
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,800
deeper dimensions of the practice as it opens up uh in case so to make it a little easier more comforting or more

243
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,400
easier to go through when everything just appears to be arising and passing and rising and

244
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:40,079
dissolving so

245
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,960
sati patana helps us to appreciate this life to live in the lived experience

246
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,880
the only place we can know we're alive is here and now and and the sensations of our body our

247
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:00,640
thoughts our feelings they're like the manifestation of life of being alive

248
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,640
and to really appreciate that so we show up for it and they're present for it don't miss it by

249
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:13,040
being in our thoughts and ideas and being too busy and then to begin

250
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,480
being present in such a way that we feel it more acutely we feel more

251
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:25,280
sensitively to the the arising and passing of things so we can let go of the attachments we

252
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:32,400
have and as we let go more and more attachments sati patana becomes better and better it becomes like richer and

253
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:37,520
richer and more more wonderful and

254
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:44,560
occasionally a little frightening but the corpse meditation prepares the ground that it's okay to let go it's safe to

255
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,480
let go we can let go of everything so um

256
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,880
thank you and thank you for the comments that you wrote i will um

257
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,640
i didn't was able to read all of them as we were just they came so fast as i was sitting here but

258
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:09,119
when we finished now i'll go and read them all and see what you said and

259
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:16,240
and then i look forward to being here on tuesday to um

260
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:22,800
to continue with satyapathanam and given that what we did today was a

261
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:28,640
kind of a contemplation of a corpse dying maybe you should be a little bit careful

262
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:34,800
with yourself for the next hour or two or for the day that this can be very tender and touching and sometimes

263
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:40,720
challenging and even disturbing and so care for yourself and

264
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:47,280
err on the side of maybe being slow and calm loving caring do some nice things for yourself

265
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:54,560
go walk around the block and get you know yourself a little bit more

266
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:00,079
grounded if you need to and and if it's you feel spacious and wonderful

267
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:05,839
stay close to it stay close to this spaciousness and peace

268
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:12,720
one of the great things to do when you're peaceful is to then practice live your life

269
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:18,560
at the speed of peace meaning go about at the speed of doing things

270
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:24,640
whatever you're doing so you don't dissipate the peace so you stay close to it

271
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,920
so thank you all
