1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,980
so also welcome welcome folks

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,699
um yeah nice to uh nice to see I'm familiar

3
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:22,800
with a lot of those names very sweet to see you uh in the chat

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,060
and um

5
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:36,300
yeah happy to be with you this week so Let's uh let's do a thing we do

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,559
and uh

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:49,680
kind of just take the posture and um trust that the dharma's there waiting

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,100
for us

9
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:24,920
maybe we've sat enough times

10
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,619
contemplated and Dharma

11
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,500
or enough months or years

12
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:49,100
just taking the posture reminds us of everything

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,860
the poignancy of our life

14
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:19,159
the endlessness suffering in this this realm

15
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,620
strength and fragility of goodness

16
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:50,959
the miracle and blessing

17
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,560
of this path

18
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,580
and I wasn't feeling all of that five minutes ago

19
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:51,200
but in seeing your names

20
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:03,140
taking the posture it's all right here now

21
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:54,840
let your breathing

22
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,759
remind you of the Dharma

23
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:21,720
their practice of course is about opening opening to the intensity of this

24
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:30,918
realm but it's also about

25
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:39,000
Refuge protecting ourselves from

26
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,259
the intensity

27
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:58,620
we use these simple ways of

28
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,120
directing attention

29
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:10,880
the rhythm of our breathing

30
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:23,940
as a way of taking a kind of uh shelter for the heart momentarily

31
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:45,180
is a way of putting down the riddle of our life

32
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:48,180
temporarily

33
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:20,839
in the world it's a small and as big

34
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:25,399
as our breath

35
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:19,260
whenever our mind

36
00:14:20,839 --> 00:14:25,100
goes uh tending

37
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:32,600
to what we imagine our life is

38
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,720
we just fold that into the breathing

39
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:47,279
just fold it all back into the breathing it's like we feed it

40
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:54,000
we feed our thoughts ruminations

41
00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:01,320
anticipation and memory we just feed it all

42
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:04,880
to our breath

43
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:49,039
our breath can absorb the body blows of Hope and fear

44
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,320
can subtly

45
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:21,380
soothe in the unrest of fear anticipation

46
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:45,080
can settle the leaning forward

47
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:55,159
excitement agitation of Hope

48
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:14,640
we put all our hope into this moment

49
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,660
this breath

50
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,380
foreign

51
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,179
language of uh entering entering

52
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:22,039
dhamma fields

53
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:41,460
it seems like we're just pointing the uh attentional Spotlight to the sensations

54
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:50,100
of breathing but more generally we're entering

55
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:56,539
a field dhamma Dharma field

56
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:06,480
entering a realm where everything

57
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,960
including our so-called mistakes our Dharma

58
00:26:12,659 --> 00:26:15,320
where everything

59
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:21,559
reminds us

60
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,020
foreign

61
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:15,080
foreign

62
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:43,200
okay so uh it's good to uh good to practice

63
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:50,460
with you uh I sort of realize I kind of assume like

64
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:56,460
you we all already know how to meditate because I was I don't know what that was

65
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:02,039
but it's good to know how to meditate and then see what instructions like that

66
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:08,360
do to the heart so um

67
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:16,380
everything uh everything is teaching us uh says right famously

68
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:23,039
everything is teaching us we want to learn from life and

69
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:29,000
maybe we say implicit in that is that we we neither want to

70
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:37,220
over learn or under learn from experiences

71
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:46,279
so over learn when we over learn we make an experience mean too much

72
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:52,620
this or that experience disproportionately

73
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:59,820
um shapes our model of the world or model of ourselves

74
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:04,980
right we know those experiences that have such a deep kind of emotional

75
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:12,179
resonance a deep impact that we make it means so much

76
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:18,360
Maybe an experience of fear for example

77
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:24,659
we can over learn from that we can generalize in ways that are not

78
00:32:24,659 --> 00:32:31,860
justified we make it mean too much about

79
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:37,260
the rest of our life that experience means too much

80
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:42,659
there's so much feeling and so much affect so many thoughts

81
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:48,500
that we endow it with this enormous significance

82
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:56,120
we can overlearn but we can also under learn under learn

83
00:32:57,240 --> 00:33:05,399
and by under learn what I'm pointing to is the ways we can fail to appreciate

84
00:33:05,399 --> 00:33:12,320
that this experience has implications for everything else

85
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:22,500
and in our Dharma practice we're sort of weaving and bobbing between over

86
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,940
learning and under learning we're trying to learn

87
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,919
and this this week

88
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:42,120
um I'll be uh exploring the theme of of mortality

89
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:49,080
and the ways we can learn from it the ways in where you

90
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:57,299
can be softened or hardened by it and this is a Zone where

91
00:33:57,299 --> 00:34:02,960
we can over learn or we can under learn

92
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:10,040
we can endow it with too many meanings or too few

93
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:17,300
we can on the one hand just appreciate

94
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:23,480
mortality death is not such a big deal

95
00:34:24,139 --> 00:34:30,839
and uh and we can also appreciate the the depth

96
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:38,179
of poignancy this life birth death

97
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,280
and so I'm I'm thinking about this um

98
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:53,280
really because I I sort of always am but uh also I had a death in the family one

99
00:34:53,280 --> 00:35:00,000
month ago and and I've just been watching my heart watching my heart

100
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,880
and um trying to appreciate that the

101
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:11,040
ordinariness of death you know like at the the funeral

102
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:18,480
the people the gravediggers who were like very respectful

103
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,960
but they're there having a very different day than everyone else they're planning their day they're coordinating

104
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,820
they're eating their lunch very very ordinary

105
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,640
and and we ought not

106
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:45,359
make that seem too ordinary or we must not miss its significance we cannot we

107
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:52,680
ought not under learn the letter um Kafka wrote the meaning of life is

108
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:57,920
that it stops and

109
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:07,140
we can interpret that in a kind of very Bleak way that that death blots out all

110
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,960
meaning meaning of life is that it stops

111
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,900
or that

112
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:25,640
finitude is what makes anything meaningful

113
00:36:26,099 --> 00:36:33,540
immortality obliterates meaning life is Meaningful

114
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:37,280
because it ends

115
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,720
and so this week he has about death supporting life

116
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:53,940
informing life teaching us about them the ways that um mortality informs our

117
00:36:53,940 --> 00:36:59,400
practice and I

118
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,440
um you know consider this sacred ground

119
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:13,800
sacred ground uh I I remember I was 29 years old and I

120
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,020
was doing the the year to live practice Stephen Levine's practice of

121
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:24,660
you know following a book with a group and living as if it's the last year of

122
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:31,200
one's life and I was 29 and healthy and I remember telling my neighbor who was

123
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:38,040
uh uh lived right across right across the hall and she was Holocaust Survivor

124
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:45,599
entire family was was killed and um and very you know

125
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,300
that was an ever-present reality in our life and I remember she asked me about

126
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:57,000
the program like what are you doing and that I remember her indignation you

127
00:37:57,000 --> 00:38:03,839
know and when I explained this this practice you know and I remember Sarah saying like

128
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:09,599
uh you know you weren't there you weren't in the

129
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,720
camps you you don't know you don't play games don't play games

130
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:22,880
with this question you know and uh

131
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:31,500
yeah I don't know and I'm trying to understand and uh

132
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:37,440
ask your understanding we all have our own relationship to this question

133
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:43,099
and um this is sacred ground

134
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,820
numb old enough now where uh uh

135
00:38:50,820 --> 00:38:56,880
Kaiser is is actively searching for uh for my death

136
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:03,980
and testing my body each year and this year negative next year

137
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:09,800
don't know this not negative forever

138
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:20,040
my um maternal uh paternal grandmother

139
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:26,400
um paternal grandmother died when my dad was 12 just before his apartment

140
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:34,020
actually and um and my paternal grandfather

141
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:41,220
had mental illness and uh often thought he was dying even when

142
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:49,079
he wasn't and um maybe not an accident that both of their

143
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:54,500
children studied medicine my dad and uncle

144
00:39:54,500 --> 00:40:02,160
study medicine trying to navigate Master the realm of uh

145
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:08,000
of illness and birth and death and so

146
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:16,980
somehow I've always kind of yeah I just felt felt the presence of

147
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:22,619
death the meaning of it trying not to uh

148
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:27,619
under learn or over learn from it

149
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:37,440
and so how can um how can our Dharma practice be informed

150
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:43,320
by this how can our our wisdom and love be informed

151
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:50,579
by mortality and I I sometimes

152
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:57,480
um sometimes say something like uh a good death

153
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:02,420
Starts Now good death Starts Now

154
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:10,859
I get that but um I was struck with I I said that

155
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:17,520
some retreat and this Yogi uh in one of our practice

156
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:24,660
meetings very thoughtfully kind of pushed back you know

157
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:32,960
I was so struck by what she said she said like what do you mean by a good dad

158
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,000
and she said that uh very

159
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:46,680
great mystery you know really equivalent to The Mystery of Life

160
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:54,119
and uh I took what she said to heart yeah don't know

161
00:41:54,119 --> 00:42:00,980
and so we we respect uh we respect that respect the

162
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,859
the mystery of it all and um

163
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:13,260
I don't uh I don't know that Dharma or

164
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:21,480
anything is uh is a kind of perfect perfect consolation

165
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,780
for death for the changingness of of all things that may be the perfect

166
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:33,720
consolation but uh it's pretty good

167
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:41,520
pretty good so that's uh that's our theme

168
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,560
