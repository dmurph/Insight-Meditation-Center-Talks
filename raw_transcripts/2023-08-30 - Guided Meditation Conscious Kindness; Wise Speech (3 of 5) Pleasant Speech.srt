00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,220
hello from Insight Meditation Center

2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,540
welcome to the meditation and one of the

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:20,220
important Tendencies to become

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,119
conscious about is how much of our Behavior our words and our thoughts

5
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,059
our attitudes are in fact unconscious or

6
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:38,660
operating on habit energy we don't think about it we're not aware that

7
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:45,660
you know we're not choosing it they're just kind of moving along and unthinkingly kind of thinking doing

8
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:51,059
saying whatever kind of comes up

9
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,879
and the opportunity is that with mindfulness is to be aware

10
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,480
of what's operating within us what are the habits of attitudes habits

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:09,420
of beliefs habits of ways in which we relate to ourselves and

12
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,540
to others and habits are kind of how we speak to ourselves or speak in our mind

13
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,680
and uh to uh to see it clearly enough to see that we have a choice or notice

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,100
where we have the choice and so that

15
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:36,360
we can choose to think to relate to ourselves to

16
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,360
speak to ourselves in our mind in a way that is kind a way that is

17
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:50,100
supportive a way that is nourishing a way that is produces or brings about some of the

18
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,100
best qualities of our hearts and to speak to us ourselves or have an

19
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:03,180
attitude towards ourselves that heals that that helps create friendship within

20
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,880
ourselves and a caring attitude of all of Who We Are

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,300
where we're not in conflict with ourselves or not saying things are

22
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,480
being in ways with ourselves that or with others that if we really step back

23
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,819
and listen or hear or feel the impact of what our mind is doing

24
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:32,160
we would feel sorry we would have compassion we would have maybe even some

25
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,040
sorrow over wow this hurts this is difficult let's see how we could do it a different

26
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:44,940
way and the choice point in meditation has to do with how we then

27
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:52,440
bring our mindfulness how we bring our attention to what's here can we find a way to when we have a

28
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,140
choice to be consciously aware to shift some of the inner Dynamics so

29
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,739
there is a kind of a friendly holding of our experience

30
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:11,280
some kind of way of being with experiences kind of like being with a difficult person who all we have to do

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,420
is listen and be present and make room for them to speak that they begin to relax they stop being defensive or

32
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:25,140
assertive and and they can feel or that we're not going to harm them

33
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:31,980
so to listen and shift our attention to ourselves that way and to come from that

34
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:38,879
place of meditative care meditative friendliness or kindness

35
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,940
um not to override what's happening but to begin shifting how we relate the

36
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:51,140
place of choice in our relationship so in this meditation

37
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,480
to settle in and start becoming aware and

38
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:05,159
noticing what we're doing with our mind that is not connecting to this warmth not

39
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:11,459
connecting to a meaningful supportive connecting way of being with ourselves

40
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:18,239
that we begin holding all of who we are in a attitude of

41
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:25,560
kindness friendliness support and um

42
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:31,979
and so one of the next axioms or maxims for this is to

43
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:37,500
be still and gaze upon everything kindly

44
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:43,280
be still and gaze upon everything kindly

45
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:51,320
so assuming a meditative posture

46
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:57,540
and you might think of the posture as not something that is stiff or forceful

47
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:02,580
but something that the posture itself promotes

48
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:09,780
both alertness and a friendly attitude

49
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,340
and a warm-heartedness

50
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:25,340
and then to gently lower the Gaze or close the eyes

51
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:35,660
and gently in a way that feels caring and just right for you

52
00:05:35,699 --> 00:05:42,960
take some little deeper breaths just enough to adapt their breath that

53
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,419
you really start feeling connected to your body

54
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:58,199
when you have breathed in deeply you might take a moment or half a moment

55
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:06,300
to hold your breath before exhaling just long enough so that

56
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,880
your attention Gathers around

57
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,919
the top of the inhale

58
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:28,919
and then breathing out exhaling relaxing and letting the exhale be longer than

59
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:35,960
usual just a little bit so it feels doesn't feel challenging

60
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:52,500
and they're also for a moment a quarter of a moment just

61
00:06:52,500 --> 00:07:01,699
very briefly holding the breath before breathing in holding that end of the exhale

62
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:09,800
just so that there's a beginning of a gathering a little bit more Focus

63
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,840
on the experience of breathing

64
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:41,419
and then letting your breathing return to normal

65
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:49,620
and as you exhale look around your body for places that

66
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:55,220
you can relax softening the body on the exhale

67
00:08:19,979 --> 00:08:27,479
and you might take a moment or so to pause at the end of the exhale

68
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:37,339
and in that pause to relax the body more let go release the holding

69
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:18,260
and then settling into

70
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:24,019
be attuned to your breathing

71
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:30,660
and seeing if you have any choice whether that Attunement that attention

72
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:40,160
to breathing can be done with a attitude of good will

73
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:47,100
attitude of kindness or care friendliness

74
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:19,519
and as you continue with your breathing from time to time notice

75
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:24,920
in the deeper and deeper layers of the Mind

76
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:32,720
is there any habits formation of

77
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:37,800
unkindness unfriendliness

78
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:43,519
criticalness or even animosity

79
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:52,760
and it might not be possible to stop that

80
00:10:54,660 --> 00:11:00,199
but with your conscious mind seeing that

81
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,480
to hold it all in kindness

82
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:11,959
in Good Will and care

83
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:21,420
Let The Habit be habit and let you

84
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:25,639
be that place where you choose

85
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:32,899
a caring attention to what is here

86
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:33,600
to what degree are you operating on habit energy or

87
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:42,080
habit of thinking and that in that habit the attitude

88
00:21:42,539 --> 00:21:46,639
maybe is not the one that is

89
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:55,580
nourishing for you and nourishing for how you'd like to be in the world

90
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,740
and to the degree to which you have choice

91
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:16,039
can you choose without forcing you

92
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:22,279
an attitude of friendliness or good will

93
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:11,899
okay and as we come to the end of this meditation

94
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:20,640
to consider that Buddhist Meditation is moving towards a

95
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:29,120
radical transformation of how we relate to ourselves

96
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:36,139
so that we relate to ourselves without any animosity without any

97
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,220
greed or delusion that we relate to ourselves with Good

98
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:47,240
Will and care

99
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:58,020
and as we learn to do that meditation we realize that this is good to do in

100
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:02,240
all directions not just for oneself

101
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:11,340
and so to express that or be reminded of that we end the meditation with the

102
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:16,399
dedication of Merit dedication of the benefits

103
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:24,799
may it be that the benefits that have come from this meditation today

104
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:30,980
may it serve for the welfare and happiness of this world

105
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:36,260
in whatever way that they can spread out

106
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:46,080
mayor care extend out to the other other people and other beings

107
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:52,679
wishing them well may all beings be happy

108
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,820
may all beings be safe

109
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:08,360
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings be free

110
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,179
and may we find ways

111
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:24,120
to live with this attitude the attitude of care and love for all

112
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,539
beings

113
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,679
[Music]

114
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:49,229
thank you [Music]

115
00:29:48,299 --> 00:29:54,179
so hello welcome to this third talk on wise

116
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:59,279
speech and um

117
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:05,820
and calling it wise speech it includes the idea of kind speech

118
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:11,100
or speech which supports healthy relatedness healthy

119
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,919
relationships with others and then bring that to the Forefront

120
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:22,740
that we want to establish healthy relationships that are beneficial that

121
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:29,399
are mutually supportive that are caring that express love and respect

122
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:36,740
and it's all too easy for our words to not do that our words to carry with them

123
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:43,260
sometimes hostility sometimes our frustration sometimes are

124
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:51,419
criticalness of others and in that the Habit formation and then of saying things which are mean or harsh

125
00:30:51,419 --> 00:30:58,700
saying things in which the relationship doesn't come together into some kind of

126
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:05,460
connectivity or or um you know real real healthy relatedness

127
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:10,620
but actually the opposite we're pushing people away we're creating bigger

128
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:16,140
divisions between people bigger Rifts between people by what we say and if

129
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:25,140
we're in extreme versions relationships might take a lot of work to repair or maybe some times when we

130
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:30,860
use our our harsh voice

131
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:38,100
we do it to strangers and we never have a chance to repair anything if it's clearly created a kind of we push people

132
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:43,860
away and maybe that's what we want to do yelling at someone who's driving we

133
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:49,799
don't like and um and we'll never see them again and

134
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:55,860
um but it contributed to the society a society of angry people frustrated

135
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:02,340
people of people who somehow feel now defensive or feel more likely to be

136
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:08,100
triggered and stressed by everything and um

137
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:14,399
so uh wise speech supportive speech speech that connects

138
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:21,360
people it creates Unity unifies people not divides people and these are

139
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:28,279
teachings clearance instructions from the Buddha he talked about the importance of speech which unifies and

140
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:35,419
rather than divides and um the um

141
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,480
uh he talked about abandoning malicious speech which divides people

142
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,700
but speaking in supportive ways and kind ways that unifies people brings them

143
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:55,020
together so one of the ways that in terms of these five areas five ways

144
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:00,779
of why speech the Buddha talked about speaking with a

145
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:08,340
um a hey okay sometimes it's translated as a

146
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:14,159
gentle gently gentle speech Pleasant speech

147
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:21,419
soothing speech these are all translations of the Pali word and and I think of it as speech which oh

148
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:27,600
it's speech with the Buddha says go straight to the heart so in a good way

149
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,799
a speech which is pleasing to the ear and so here we're still looking at the

150
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:42,600
question is how does our speech connect us to other people how does it unify us how does it create good Bridges

151
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:48,059
between us and other people and for and what in addition to that in

152
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:53,880
what way can we speak that brings out the best in people that touches them in

153
00:33:53,880 --> 00:34:01,440
a good way and how we speak is really really important so uh to speak with a tone of

154
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:08,280
voice that is not harsh some of the voice a speed of voice a loudness a

155
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:15,358
voice which doesn't come across as harsh doesn't come across as unpleasant doesn't make people cringe or pull back

156
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:24,780
or shut down but to speak in a way in a pacing a tone a a loudness a choice of

157
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:29,940
words which uh is nice to listen to pleasing

158
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:37,618
to listen to it goes right to the heart it doesn't shut the heart it opens it it

159
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:45,000
warms it it it helps the kind of support a warm-heartedness

160
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:50,460
and um so this is much more than so one of the

161
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:57,720
aspects of this is to be conscious be mindful enough of how we speak when

162
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:03,780
we're speaking on the Habit energy habit speech where we're not really conscious

163
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:10,140
of what motivates us to speak and we're speaking impulsively and often when we do that we're

164
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:19,500
asserting ourselves on other people we're asserting our wishes our attitudes our feelings onto others and in order to

165
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:24,900
get our way and uh sometimes within reason that's

166
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,599
okay we need to do something like that but to assert ourselves in such a way

167
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:38,520
that it's unpleasant for the other person is that really necessary is there another way and I would like to suggest

168
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,339
more often than not there is another way there is another way of caring for

169
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:52,880
ourselves and and taking care of ourselves in this situation but doing it in a voice that is

170
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:58,760
is not perpetuating the divisions not perpetuating the harshness the

171
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:04,560
unkindness that can exist and and sometimes it's by saying things

172
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:11,940
like um wow that was difficult to hear but to say that in a kind voice to say

173
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:18,900
that in a gentle voice wow that was difficult to hear or wow that was quite something and can we pause a

174
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:26,520
little bit or can you can you you know did I hear right what was that about and um as opposed to immediately coming

175
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,980
back with something harsh and critical make space and something like that oh

176
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:38,400
that was hard to hear or I don't think I heard that properly to say that in that

177
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,280
kind voice highlights for the other person what they just said so they can become more

178
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:49,980
conscious some people then will give it a second thought some people become aware of

179
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:56,640
their impact that they've had that maybe this wasn't the best thing to say rather than meeting a harshness with

180
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:02,760
harshness is you meet it with some other way that of what you can do

181
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,119
and um the and I think of this kind of gentle

182
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:16,859
Pleasant speech is one where we maybe are caring for ourselves and trying to find out trying to get what we want but

183
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:22,099
we're not asserting ourselves and others we're not pushing on others we're not

184
00:37:22,099 --> 00:37:29,820
diminishing the value of others it's done with respect for others and in respect that they can feel in how we're

185
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:35,820
speaking is this too much work is this too much

186
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:41,280
of a burden to pay attention to how we speak and speak in a nice way

187
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:49,859
it is if that's uh that's the only thing we're doing but uh hopefully for people who meditate

188
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:55,980
um we're doing it on a foundation of being settled on ourselves maybe even

189
00:37:55,980 --> 00:38:01,740
feeling at home and connected to ourselves when we don't feel settled on ourselves

190
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:07,320
we don't feel connected to ourselves then for mindfulness practitioners it's

191
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:13,260
a high priority to find a way to do that because if we're not settled if we're

192
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:19,920
not at home if we're not comfortable in ourselves or really present for ourselves some modicum of calm

193
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,579
that that's when we're more likely to do things that we later regret

194
00:38:26,579 --> 00:38:31,880
and so we want to uh and so on that Foundation of well-being

195
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:38,940
then speaking kindly pleasantly caringly for others it goes right to the heart is

196
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:44,760
not uh we're not forcing ourselves or doing a should where it's welding up

197
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:50,160
from within in a way that seems natural of course we want to do this way

198
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:56,940
and so so not just to take these as admonitions speak kindly but take it as

199
00:38:56,940 --> 00:39:04,560
a as a encouragement instructions that speak kindly yes but do the inner work

200
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:11,339
so that you have a foundation of well-wishing of well-being yourself

201
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:17,400
that from which speaking kindly seems like a natural thing that speaking harshly feels like you're

202
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:22,800
doing violence to yourself why would you do that

203
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:30,240
and uh and speaking kindly speaking gently speaking pleasantly becomes something which nourishes

204
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:37,020
ourself something that is supportive for ourselves we feel the benefits it goes

205
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:42,839
right to our hearts it comes from our heart rather than closing it or

206
00:39:42,839 --> 00:39:48,000
or irritating it or you know

207
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,280
harming ourselves in the process so uh to spend time care

208
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,900
to speak gently kindly respectfully

209
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:07,440
politely maybe I don't know what the best word is for here in a tone of voice that's not harsh

210
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:14,060
and um and that's Pleasant to hear that's Pleasant to speak

211
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:19,859
and if you can't do that maybe there's it's time to take a pause and really

212
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:25,160
kind of do a check do a and sometimes these kind of checking in with yourself

213
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,599
doesn't have to take long there's what I call the three minute three breath

214
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:36,420
Journey just take pause for three breaths and you really connect to yourself

215
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:44,220
and those three breaths doesn't take long but that might be enough where it just feels more easy and natural to

216
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:51,480
avoid harsh speech and um so I want to end with um

217
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:56,300
a I think a very

218
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:07,079
inspiring at least for me but also instructive and and challenging uh

219
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:13,560
quote from Mahatma Gandhi is this is from his autobiography

220
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:20,400
my hesitancy to speech which was once an annoyance is now a

221
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:28,020
pleasure its greatest benefit has been that it has taught me the economy of words

222
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:33,540
I have naturally formed the habit of restraining my thoughts and I can now give myself the

223
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:40,020
certificate that a thoughtless word hardly ever escapes my tongue or my pen

224
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:45,060
I do not recollect ever having to regret anything in my speech or writing

225
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:51,960
I have been spared many a mishap and a waste of time experience has taught me that silence is

226
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:59,940
part of the spiritual discipline of the Seeker of Truth proneness to exaggerate to suppress or

227
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:05,160
modify the truth wittingly or unwittingly is a natural weakness of

228
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:11,520
people and silence is necessary in order to surmount it

229
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,579
a few a person of few words will rarely be thoughtless in his or her speech

230
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:25,980
he or she will measure every word so I'll end with the idea

231
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:29,240
that um

232
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:38,119
if silence is the better option don't speak

233
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:46,740
it doesn't mean don't speak at all don't prefer silence but when silence is the better option

234
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:53,880
maybe don't speak if you're going to make the situation worse through your speech

235
00:42:53,880 --> 00:43:01,140
maybe you should not speak or at least pause and be silent and see what you can find

236
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:07,859
so as you go about this day if you're interested you might try

237
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:14,220
um first look to establish yourself in some

238
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:21,119
little modicum of well-being or subtleness or connected to yourself maybe do lots of times through the day

239
00:43:21,119 --> 00:43:26,579
the three breath Journey just be quiet and just attend to three breaths

240
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:33,420
and then go about what you have to do or say and and see if you can experiment with

241
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:39,560
speaking words that go straight to the heart that come from the heart then go to the heart that are Pleasant to hear

242
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:45,180
Pleasant to speak and um and uh just experiment with that

243
00:43:45,180 --> 00:43:51,359
and see what it's like see how you benefit from that and see how it might benefit the relationships you're in that

244
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:58,700
people you're with the connection you have with them so um

245
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:08,119
so thank you and um I look forward to continuing tomorrow
