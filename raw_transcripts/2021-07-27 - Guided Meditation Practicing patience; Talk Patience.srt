1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:09,519
welcome welcome everybody hope that you're well

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:17,920
and i'm happy to be practicing with you with you all

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:25,920
so to begin our meditation

4
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,840
just arriving this moment

5
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,840
arriving to this constellation of experiences

6
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:06,640
and feeling into the body what is it like to be here and now

7
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:13,840
at this moment

8
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,159
i like this expression to sit and know you're sitting

9
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:55,840
to sit with some balance some ease some alertness some uprightness

10
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:05,200
maybe checking in with the body and see if there are any obvious places

11
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,800
of tightness or a little bit of discomfort

12
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:22,640
can we gaze upon them kindly with our mindfulness

13
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,040
it might be that if we bring some kindness some warmth

14
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,879
some non-aversion to those aspects of our experience that

15
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:39,840
are uncomfortable

16
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:51,200
they might unfold differently under the gaze of kindness

17
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,239
no guarantees

18
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:11,920
this is such a part of mindfulness practice it's bringing our awareness

19
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:33,840
to whatever is arising including the uncomfortable aspects

20
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,519
allowing the awareness to rest on the sensations of breathing

21
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:33,120
feeling the expansion contraction as the body breathes

22
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,960
we might feel that in the chest maybe in the belly

23
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:11,840
maybe we feel the air going in and out of the nose

24
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:44,720
and when the mind wanders as its want to do

25
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:53,840
just very simply gently begin again

26
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:49,840
allowing the attention to rest on the sensations of breathing

27
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:30,720
and when we find ourselves replaying a story lost in a fantasy

28
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:38,240
a memory or planning we just very simply begin again

29
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:44,800
with the sensations of breathing

30
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:53,360
can we do this without annoyance or irritation or exasperation

31
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:59,840
when we realize that we've been lost in thought

32
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:13,840
just very simply gently begin again

33
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,720
it doesn't matter how many times

34
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:09,839
we need to begin again

35
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,399
so much of what mindfulness practice is about

36
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,959
let's just beginning again having the patience

37
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,000
to hang in there

38
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,920
and allow the awareness the attention to come back

39
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:51,839
to the sensations of breathing however many times it needs to

40
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:04,160
what would it be like to bring patience to our practice

41
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:10,640
recognizing that it takes time for the mind to settle

42
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,519
maybe you've had a busy day lots of planning lots of decisions or

43
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:25,680
problems that to work with can we just bring patience

44
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,200
this recognition that things might be a little bit uncomfortable or not

45
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:38,399
settled but that's okay we just

46
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,839
begin again

47
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:22,640
learning to be patient with our practice in our practice with

48
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:30,080
our minds is a way that we can make room for them

49
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:38,480
to be the way that they are sometimes our minds are busy restless

50
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:45,840
sometimes they may be drowsy or foggy

51
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:55,440
but many of us who have a meditation practice know if we just exercise a little bit of patience

52
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,960
and very gently begin again with the sensations of breathing

53
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,240
and the mind settles

54
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:18,480
so how might we bring this lesson of patience to other areas of our life

55
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:27,840
so that our practice can support us and those we come in contact with

56
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:34,000
so that our practice is for the benefit of all beings

57
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
everywhere

58
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:34,880
so a very warm welcome i wish that you are all

59
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,320
safe and have some well-being

60
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,039
really warm welcome

61
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:53,120
so tonight i'd like to continue on this exploration of the pyramids

62
00:30:53,120 --> 00:31:00,720
these ten qualities that our support for awakening and support for our

63
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:05,840
improved or for our general well-being

64
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:12,000
last week i spoke about loving kindness which was a little was out of sequence

65
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:17,440
but i gave the dharma talk on loving-kindness because i had taught about loving-kindness in another

66
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:23,039
setting and it was what was on my heart and mind

67
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:31,919
but now i'd like to go back to the sequence of the pyramids these ten qualities of generosity

68
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:37,360
ethical behavior renunciation wisdom

69
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:46,399
energy patience truth resolve loving-kindness and equanimity

70
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:54,240
so loving kindness is number nine but now i'd like to go back to number six patience

71
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:03,200
and maybe i should say from the outset as i was thinking about this talk and doing some reading and

72
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:10,559
listening to other dharma teachers you know how did they approach uh patients it became abundantly clear

73
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:17,600
to me that oh this is the parame for me i hadn't really noticed it so much

74
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,039
before but how much impatience shows up in my own life

75
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:30,640
so i'm humbly sitting here sharing this with you this recognition that yes in particular

76
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,919
i think patience is something for me to to work on and to practice with and it

77
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:43,919
shows up in so many different ways maybe it um shows up in all kinds of

78
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:49,760
different ways for you too and i'll talk about some of that this evening

79
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:57,679
but patience is sixth in this list of parmies or perfections these qualities

80
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:02,880
that we can perfect quote unquote as a support for our lives and as a

81
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,960
support for awakening so patience comes after energy

82
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:15,679
viria and we might say that patience and viria counterbalance each

83
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:21,440
other that is that is

84
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:29,039
when i spoke about the pyramids of energy i shared this um the simile

85
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,200
about the goldsmith so that is that the and the buddha gave this simile

86
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:41,200
saying that when a goldsmith wants to work with gold they heat up a crucible

87
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:46,960
a um a container and when it's hot they put the gold in there

88
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,279
and sometimes the goldsmith blows on the gold to heat it up sometimes they sprinkle

89
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:59,919
water on it to cool it down and sometimes they just stand by

90
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:06,799
so pointing to this need for sometimes heating things up with energy sometimes cooling them down and

91
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:14,240
sometimes just standing by and we could say that this just standing by is patience

92
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:20,480
so the permeate energy is about arousing energy kind of like allowing

93
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:27,200
energy to arise but also to balance it with patience

94
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:34,158
that is that it's practice isn't only about applying more and more energy i think we all know this

95
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:40,638
but sometimes we don't think about a counterbalance as being patients that is this way

96
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,839
that we can allow things to unfold

97
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:52,638
to kind of like stand back and look on and see how things are going does it need a little does the gold need

98
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:59,839
a little bit more blowing on or does it need a little bit of water to be sprinkled on cooled down

99
00:34:59,839 --> 00:35:06,240
one thing that i appreciate that in this simile about the goldsmith buddha continues with the simile and

100
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,560
says that when the gold is the right temperature when it has the right amount

101
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:17,680
of malleability then the goldsmith can make earrings or

102
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:25,359
necklaces or bracelets or garlands out of it we might imagine that it takes patience

103
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:32,880
also to make jewelry earrings can be really small you know some some

104
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:39,839
minute uh fine details some fine work take some patience and some steadyness

105
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:46,720
just to work with the gold any artisanal activity we might do whether

106
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:52,000
it's knitting or crocheting or sewing or

107
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:58,720
woodworking or sculpting whatever it might be this certain amount of patience is

108
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:05,839
required in just the same way that the way we kind of like are shaping our minds

109
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:13,839
with mindfulness practice

110
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,599
yeah sorry sorry that i am i had to cough there i'm frantically looking for the

111
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:41,838
mute button so that i can not cough into the microphone

112
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:48,800
and but if we might say that if one is too patient however and then

113
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:54,960
one doesn't make any effort then just letting everything take its own course just standing by

114
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,680
then we can get bogged down into maybe this sloth and torpor or laziness

115
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:08,640
or slovenliness or sometimes you know just if we have is our standard approach just

116
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,480
to not put any energy forward some of us might not have energy due to

117
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:22,400
illness but to not put any energy forward whatever amount that we have

118
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:28,800
then we might just feel that our life kind of drifts away and it doesn't we don't accomplish

119
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:34,480
things that are helpful for our lives that help our lives unfold in a

120
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:39,920
direction that we would like to go towards greater and greater freedom so

121
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:47,280
what we need is a delicate balance some energy some effort some endeavoring

122
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:53,680
as well as some patients standing back looking observing seeing what's

123
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,079
happening without interfering

124
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:06,560
so those of you who are familiar with this simile of the goldsmith might know that actually the buddha says that the

125
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:13,599
standing by and looking on at the gold is actually equanimity he's not saying that it's patience so we

126
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:22,560
might ask what is the difference between patience and equanimity they both have this quality of

127
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:32,320
looking by or you know not being pushed to jump into activity

128
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:39,119
so patience we might say is not acting on our impatience

129
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:46,240
it's not acting on our irritation our annoyance our exasperation our wish for things to

130
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:52,400
be different so we might note we notice we might sense that there is a

131
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:58,480
some discontent a little bit of uneasiness this might be obvious with some really strong

132
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:05,680
restlessness or it might be subtle might be really subtle just this little nagging feeling

133
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:11,200
that sometimes the mind has this restlessness of this is boring

134
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,480
what else is you know what else can i um conjure up in my mind that's a little

135
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:23,359
more interesting or there might be a sense of i wish

136
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:31,280
something else was happening that's not quite right this kind of feeling of things not being

137
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:39,359
quite right we could say this impatience why aren't i awakened completely yet

138
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:46,160
so patience allows us to go through these all these

139
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,400
experiences of life these these little annoyances irritations

140
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:57,280
exasperations without acting on them so it's not

141
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:03,920
saying that we aren't experiencing those that's all those different uh

142
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:10,000
expressions of discontent but we're not acting on them

143
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,119
we're staying with what is we're not acting out

144
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,200
in contrast equanimity is when we're not actually experiencing

145
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,720
irritation exasperation annoyance if this

146
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,800
discontent that wishing that things were different and a desire for things to be a certain way or an aversion to the way

147
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,960
things are equanimity is when those things simply aren't arising

148
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:47,040
so maybe from the outside patients and equanimity look the same but patience is allows us to be with all

149
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:52,160
the experiences of our life we're not always equanimous we probably

150
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:59,119
won't always be equanimous until we're completely awakened so patience is a way that allows us to

151
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:04,880
engage with the completeness of the human experience

152
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:13,280
and allows us maybe is an expression of some wisdom that we might bring to our experience of

153
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,560
things having some dukkha things not being exactly as we would like

154
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:26,160
and i appreciate that sylvia borstein she calls patients this unglamorous courage

155
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:33,040
the quiet moment-to-moment adjustment to unpleasant circumstances this

156
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,880
recognition that this does not match my preferences

157
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:43,200
but i'm not going to act out

158
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:51,760
so in this way practicing patients require some unpleasant circumstances

159
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:58,400
it's not like that we can practice it in the absence of unpleasant

160
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:04,319
circumstances you know it's not like a quantifiable object it's not a commodity

161
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:10,800
that we can just get an abundance of and then draw on it later even though

162
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,760
sometimes our language might be that i'm feeling short of patience or i'm getting to the end of my patients

163
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,640
i'm losing my patients we have these expressions but instead patience is a quality that

164
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:29,680
arises in the midst of some difficulties

165
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:36,400
just like courage courage and patience these qualities that

166
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:43,119
we develop and when in the midst of our lives and our daily lives

167
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:48,240
and so we don't need to devise situations in which to cultivate patients

168
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:56,839
or present themselves freely and i've been thinking about this

169
00:42:56,839 --> 00:43:02,800
patient's back when i was um a research scientist

170
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:08,800
and i often would want to kind of create shortcuts on my experiments

171
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,359
i felt like oh incubate overnight oh i don't need to incubate this overnight i can just do it for two hours surely

172
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:20,400
that's enough and and then the experience of you know

173
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:26,079
experiments not turning out so now when i look back on that just the

174
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,359
way that kind of impatience shows up and i didn't really have the

175
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:38,319
patience then to really follow the protocols and trust

176
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:45,839
that you know following the instructions in these ways might be helpful even if it takes longer

177
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:51,040
maybe we have the same way with cooking oh i don't need to marinate this

178
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:55,839
overnight it'll be fine if i just cook it the way it is

179
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:03,200
unlike these research experiments the food still turns out fine but it turns out differently

180
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:09,040
so what are some ways in which uh impatient shows up for you

181
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:17,440
maybe i'll share another thing for me sometimes while i'm driving i find myself as uh not very

182
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,440
kind hearted but sometimes when i find myself behind somebody who's going

183
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:30,000
on the freeways going way below the um the speed limit i find myself you

184
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:38,079
know a little bit irritated like and i find myself saying out loud the rest of us are on the freeway

185
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:46,480
so a little bit of you know irritation that shows up so patience how might we take different

186
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:54,000
just so many small little opportunities that we have in the day to say oh okay here's my chance

187
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,599
here's my chance to practice with patience what does it mean to not try to pull out

188
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:08,480
our phone and immediately entertain ourselves what does it mean to not give in to the

189
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:14,800
impatience and allow it to tumble forward and get more and more irritation and said

190
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:20,319
can we just notice oh yeah this is what impatience feels like

191
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:25,119
maybe i'll say something else that i noticed in myself that

192
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:33,839
sometimes um when i first started a meditation practice and i was a yoga practice

193
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:39,119
i was just getting more and more accustomed to bringing my awareness to what my body was doing and

194
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:45,280
how it was oriented in space you know kind of really firming up this mind-body connection

195
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:51,280
and one thing that was really noticeable for me is that sometimes standing in line

196
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,480
grocery store or whenever i'd be standing with my hand on my hip

197
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,480
you know okay like maybe with my hip jutted out with this idea you know if you were to see me you

198
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:10,000
would see like oh that person's impatient but i didn't even notice that i was impatient until i noticed the

199
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:17,119
posture that my body was in so again what are some ways in which

200
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:22,960
inpatient shows up with for you not so that you can beat yourself up about it

201
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,760
but so that we might say oh okay practice the pyramids it's a practice

202
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,680
that's really encouraged to do in our daily life so what would it be like to have a

203
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,599
little more patience in this moment

204
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:47,359
so in our daily life but also in our mindfulness practice if mindfulness is not a practice about

205
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:53,839
patients i'm not exactly sure what is the fact that mindfulness requires

206
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:58,880
patience is an early lesson right when we start practicing mindfulness maybe

207
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,640
the first lesson is to realize how out of control our minds are and maybe the second

208
00:47:04,640 --> 00:47:10,319
lesson is oh yeah this is going to require some patience

209
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:18,319
just bring the mind back again and again

210
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:24,800
and again over and over we do meditation session after

211
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:31,440
meditation session we go on retreat after retreat we listen to dharma talk after dharma talk

212
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:37,839
just like any skill just like any thing that we wish to learn it takes

213
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:40,400
patience

214
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:50,480
so chances are that we started a meditation practice because we had some expectations

215
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:55,760
we wanted to feel better we wanted to embark on a spiritual practice

216
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:01,359
perhaps and chances are that our expectations

217
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:06,400
weren't met the first time that we meditated but maybe there was a hint

218
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:13,440
of something of the possibility that our expectations could be met

219
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:20,640
but when starting our practice we realized oh when i have these really high

220
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:26,079
expectations perhaps i had this pleasurable meditation experience and

221
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:33,119
i'd like to have that experience again we we all have this experience of wishing for that to happen again

222
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:39,440
and then when it doesn't this feeling of frustration or irritation

223
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:46,000
so can we bring some patience to that of course we want things to turn out a

224
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:53,520
certain way of course we have expectations this is the human experience

225
00:48:54,720 --> 00:49:01,040
as our mindfulness practice grows as our maybe our wisdom

226
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:07,440
practice grows we can start to see how creating and holding onto really tightly to

227
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:14,880
expectations is creating the conditions for suffering but we only see that

228
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:21,519
or really learn it after we've seen that countless times how many times

229
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:27,520
but patience allows us to watch our experience of mind and body

230
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:35,359
over again and with this kind of watching the mind and the body we discover how we are perpetuating our

231
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:40,720
suffering how we are perpetuating our difficulties

232
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:47,599
whether it's the big giant big giant difficulties or the small ones

233
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:55,440
what role does our mind have and and contributing to the suffering

234
00:49:55,520 --> 00:50:02,640
as a society we certainly want things to happen quickly the insta pot just the name of this

235
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,640
right was a sensation i know a number of years ago people were talking about this new cooking appliance with this

236
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:17,119
name instapot like how can we not want something that's going to instantly cook things not only do we want things

237
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:23,440
to happen quickly but we want them to be pleasurable and predictable

238
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:31,280
but with patience can we be willing to just simply practice

239
00:50:31,359 --> 00:50:38,480
can we be willing to embrace our mindfulness practice as an opportunity to simply meet each moment of our

240
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,319
experience as it is without insisting that the moment be

241
00:50:44,319 --> 00:50:50,319
different without insisting that we be different

242
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:56,640
and just like sometimes we notice that at the beginning of the meditation period our mind might be really restless

243
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:04,319
the body might be uncomfortable but with with some patients as the

244
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:10,400
meditation session progresses most often there's some settling there's some more

245
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:17,119
ease that arises so with that kind of recognition that if

246
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:23,760
we hang in there then there can be some greater ease and

247
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:29,280
there can be some greater wisdom some learnings as the mind starts to settle down we

248
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:37,040
start to see where the impatience if i can use this word is showing up as some aversion or some

249
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,079
desire some of these root

250
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:50,559
the word is defilements but i don't like this word defilements some of these root tendencies that we

251
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:54,000
have that humans have

252
00:51:55,839 --> 00:52:01,440
so with patients we can start to hang in there long enough that we can

253
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:09,359
start to see how we contribute to some of our suffering and then we can soften or let go

254
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:14,400
some of those ways in which we contribute to our suffering

255
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:23,119
so also we can have patients in our interactions with others

256
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:29,520
patients just how things how situations are unfolding patients in our mindfulness practice and

257
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:33,839
patience with how we interact with others

258
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:41,839
patients pre is a way that it protects our good qualities in the way that

259
00:52:41,839 --> 00:52:48,160
perhaps anger which we might say is the opposite of patients if patients is some cool

260
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:54,160
standing by patients is some fiery engagement

261
00:52:54,160 --> 00:53:01,200
and in the way that anger we might say or do things that are destructive

262
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:10,160
including our sense of well-being or destroying our relationships or

263
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:18,079
our sense of our self you know the we might um have regret and remorse

264
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:26,960
anger can easily lead us to be off balance

265
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:33,200
and to maybe there's like this blind anger of

266
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:38,240
lashing out which we are disconnected from our wisdom

267
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:45,680
maybe disconnected from ourselves in the moment in some kind of ways and lashing out blindly is

268
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:52,800
never the way to solve problems but instead with patience we can solve problems

269
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:59,200
and this gets um highlighted in a story that the buddha

270
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:05,040
tells to some of his monastics

271
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:11,200
so the buddha is telling the story about the this battle that went on between the

272
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:18,480
gods and the demons and i guess maybe in ancient times or something like this

273
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:27,920
and you know as is the case for these types of stories the gods win the battle and the demons lose

274
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:34,160
and then the ruler of the demons his name is vaipachiti is brought

275
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:39,838
to the ruler of the gods sakka

276
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:47,599
demon hurls all these insults at the ruler of the gods and while this

277
00:54:47,599 --> 00:54:55,119
is happening the ruler of the gods sakka his charioteer so somebody who is part of

278
00:54:55,119 --> 00:55:03,040
his army is nearby and sees that the ruler of the demons

279
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:09,599
is insulting his king the king of the gods

280
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:15,040
so metalli is the name of the charioteer

281
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:22,319
so mitholi says to his king the king of the gods o sucka is it from fear

282
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:29,040
or from weakness that you put up with such harsh words in the presence of a

283
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:34,240
pachitti so matali is i can't believe that

284
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:41,760
he's that uh sokka is not fighting back it is not

285
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:48,160
spewing um angry insults even though he won the war the battle

286
00:55:48,160 --> 00:55:53,839
and vapor chitty i guess is in um irons or it's in harnessed in some way so the

287
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:58,880
charioteer can't believe that this happens that uh sakka

288
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:05,839
is not fighting back maybe i should say that this is verse it written in verse and for me it

289
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:11,040
has a little bit of a feeling of a shakespearean play it's not exactly that but has a little

290
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:16,240
bit of that kind of feeling so the charioteer says osaka

291
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:22,480
is it from fear or from weakness that you put up with such harsh words in the presence of apachetti

292
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:30,559
saka responds it's not out of fear or weakness that i'm patient with vaipachiti for how can a sensible

293
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:36,000
person like me get in a fight with a fool

294
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:43,359
the charioteer responds but fools would vent even more if there's no one to put a stop to them

295
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:49,119
a wise person should stop a fool with forceful punishment so the

296
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:54,960
charioteer clearly doesn't like that sakka is just being patient thinks he

297
00:56:54,960 --> 00:57:00,960
should have punished the king of the god the king of the demons

298
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:07,680
saka responds i think that this is the only way to put a stop to a

299
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:13,359
fool when you know that the other is upset be mindful

300
00:57:13,359 --> 00:57:23,359
and stay calm when you know that the other is upset be mindful and stay calm

301
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:30,079
metalli just can't agree with us and he responds i see this fault in just being patient

302
00:57:30,079 --> 00:57:35,680
when a fool thinks he puts up with me out of fear

303
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:41,440
then the fool will will go after you even more like a bull chasing someone who runs

304
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:48,160
away then osaka responds let him think

305
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:54,799
he puts up with me out of fear if he wishes goals

306
00:57:54,799 --> 00:58:02,160
culminating in one's own good none better than patience is found

307
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:09,599
of goals culminating in one's own good none better than patience

308
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:18,160
is found patience and when experiencing

309
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:23,520
insults in this example but how many other

310
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:30,480
situations in our lives might patience be the right response

311
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:37,680
when our minds get overrun and obsessed by anger or whatever it might be

312
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:45,920
we might feel miserable and want to get rid of it but we can't because these thoughts keep bubbling up

313
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:53,599
can we have some patience and just like our meditation practice that recognizes okay with time

314
00:58:53,599 --> 00:58:58,640
the mind can settle the heart can soften

315
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:05,839
if we create the conditions in which some settling can happen if we have the patience

316
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:14,640
then we can come back maybe to our bodies to the moment and allow our greatest wisdom to arise

317
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:23,200
this last line of goals culminating in one's own good

318
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:31,599
none better than patience is found so may you find patience when you need

319
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:38,640
it for any of your difficulties that you meet in these days and might we meet some difficulties with

320
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:44,720
patients that allows things to unfold in a way that brings greater ease and well-being not

321
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:52,240
only to ourselves but to everyone to others so that our practice

322
00:59:52,240 --> 01:00:01,838
might be for the well-being of all beings everywhere thank you

323
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:04,480
you
