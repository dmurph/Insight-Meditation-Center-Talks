1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,640
i guess it helps if I turn the microphone on Good

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,599
evening Welcome Welcome Nice to see you

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:20,039
all So I'm going to start the talk tonight with this uh kind of playful

4
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:26,960
silly whimsical poem and uh unpack it a little bit

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,079
because it actually allows us to point to a few like classical

6
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:38,399
teachings And I'm wondering if we can turn down the volume just a tiny bit It

7
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,760
feels just a little bit loud And oh can we make it just be a little bit louder i'm sorry Jim I'm always doing this

8
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,960
right okay Thank you Okay So this poem is called The Cookie

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,920
Thief by Valerie Cox The Cookie Thief by Valerie

10
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:07,280
Cox This poem rhymes which is kind of unusual these days right so here we go A woman is

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,600
waiting at the airport one night with several long hours before her flight She

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,560
hunted for a book in the airport shop bought a bag of cookies and found a place to

13
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,600
drop She was engrossed in her book but happened to see that the man beside her

14
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:32,400
as bold as could be grabbed a cookie or two from the bag between which he tried

15
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:39,680
to ignore to avoid a scene I think I said the wrong a wrong

16
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,799
word here The first one is she was engrossed in her book but happened to see I think I said happy to see happened

17
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:53,840
to see that the man beside her as bold as can be grabbed a cookie or two from the bag between which she tried to

18
00:01:53,840 --> 00:02:00,960
ignore to avoid a scene She read munch cookies and watched the clock as the

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,439
gutsy cookie thief diminished her stalk She was getting more irritated as

20
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:14,360
the minutes ticked by thinking "If I wasn't so nice I'd black in his

21
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:20,040
eye With each cookie she took he took one

22
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,319
too." When only one was left she wondered what he'd do With a smile on

23
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:35,599
his face and a nervous laugh he took the last cookie and broke it in half

24
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:41,560
He offered her half and he ate the other She snatched it from him and thought "Oh

25
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:48,920
brother this guy has some nerve and he's also so rude why he didn't even show any

26
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:56,239
gratitude." She had never known when she had been so gied with relief when her flight was

27
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,720
called She gathered her belongings and headed for the gate refusing to look at that

28
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,400
thieving ingra She boarded the plane and sank in

29
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,080
her seat then sought her book which was almost complete As she reached in her

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,760
baggage she gasped with surprise There were her bag of cookies

31
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:29,319
in front of her eyes If mine are here she moaned with

32
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:36,560
despair Then the others were his and he tried to

33
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:45,920
share Too late to apologize she realized with grief that she was the rude one the

34
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,040
angry the thief

35
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,640
this playful poem It's kind of funny right like the

36
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,200
story and uh for me it feels a little bit like it was the night before Christmas when all through that right it

37
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,680
kind of I think it has that similar uh rhyming scheme maybe and uh proity I'm

38
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,320
not sure So here is this uh woman at the airport

39
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:25,440
and she has a view about what was happening that the person next to her was a thief was didn't show any

40
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,840
gratitude and she was getting irritated and he was rude and ungrateful like all

41
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,800
this stuff about this guy that's sitting next to her I don't know Can you just imagine

42
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,000
what this feels like when you realize oh no But then all that was needed

43
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:50,160
was one piece of information Just one piece of

44
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:59,280
information and like completely rethinking everything realizing oh everything that I was so

45
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,680
sure about and created such a big story

46
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:10,440
about one little piece of information realized everything was

47
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:17,720
wrong But she was so sure she was getting so irritated about this person

48
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:23,600
and just like things uh just evaporated as soon as she had this piece

49
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:30,479
of information And I've had something not exactly the same right i didn't take

50
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:37,199
cookies related to somebody but maybe there's a way in which we do this Something for me that I've told

51
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,320
this story a few times And now I'm like forgetting the

52
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,680
details but the the gist of the story is you know waiting for somebody We were

53
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:53,840
supposed to well this has happened to me more than once but waiting at a restaurant

54
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,120
and my friend isn't there And just kind of like the impatience and like making

55
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:06,759
up this story Oh I can't believe this person doesn't respect me They think they're so important

56
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:13,840
and how I don't want to be here and how dare they leave me waiting and be late

57
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,680
Like all this story making that's happening when somebody is not you know

58
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:26,560
meeting me at the time that we had decided to and then only to discover finally when this person does get into

59
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,280
contact with me that there's a reason why they couldn't contact me earlier and it was a perfectly legitimate reason

60
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,400
when they realize oh right of course I probably would have done the same too I would have been late to not be able to

61
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:47,039
contact you so just you know this for me just recognizing how I was just really

62
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:55,639
holding on to this particular story and then poof it's just go on with some more

63
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:01,160
information I'm sure all of us have different versions of this

64
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:08,560
story So we might say that having this idea this notion this view this belief

65
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:13,680
about how things are and being pretty confident about it

66
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:21,120
and then realizing oh no actually it wasn't that way at all This is a word that feels a little um

67
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,360
uncomfortable but it's in the kind of like the Buddhist teachings we use this word

68
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:32,639
delusion Delusion often just associated with ignorance just not knowing the

69
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,680
whole picture not knowing everything Maybe knowing a little bit of it but uh

70
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:43,280
not all of it So but also delusion sometimes in the Buddhist teachings also

71
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:50,080
kind of get expanded to like this lack of attention like just not paying attention to what's happening maybe

72
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:55,360
being you know busy with thoughts or just simply not paying attention Or

73
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:00,599
there's also a way in which delusion can be uh understood as

74
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:07,120
confusion as this uh like what like not really a what's like feeling disoriented

75
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:13,280
or like what's happening or yeah I'll say delusion and sometimes that's associated with some

76
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:19,919
bewilderment too And I could imagine if I were this woman at the airport and I

77
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:26,400
was thought I had some cookies and somebody was taking them I think I would be confused and bewildered and like the

78
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:35,240
usual social norms aren't uh being uh followed So this idea of uh

79
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,880
delusion sometimes ignorance sometimes just not paying attention sometimes confusion

80
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,680
Those of you who are familiar with this some of the classic Buddhist teachings will recognize or know that uh delusion

81
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:57,640
is also one of what's sometimes called the three poisons or often um also the

82
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:06,000
three unh wholesome roots Greed hatred delusion

83
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:13,160
So everything that's humans do that is unhelpful unskillful

84
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:20,480
unhealthy comes out of greed hatred or delusion Kind of like the Buddhist

85
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:28,800
getting down to just three a list of three like from which everything uh everything that's unhelpful arises

86
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:35,760
So I've talked about the hindrances and the hindrances are like have sensual desire and aversion of them that's

87
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:41,440
definitely part of uh coming out of greed hatred and delusion But there's a way in which we could say that

88
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,880
everything that's uh not so helpful and uh at one time I kind of got confused

89
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,399
about all these lists Okay there's these and wholesome roots There's hindrances

90
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:59,440
There's this word clatas There's these uh now I forgot what they're called Oh

91
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,480
there's taints There's like all these lists of all these things that are unhelpful but we could just simplify it

92
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,760
just to these three Come out of greed hatred and delusion And there's this way in which

93
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:18,240
delusion like we don't know when we're in delusion if we did then we wouldn't be

94
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:23,440
deluded right so sometimes I um I've given the teaching because I use this

95
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,640
for myself when I was practicing and somehow I would get confused like have

96
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,920
entering into maybe some new meditative states or something that I hadn't experienced before there'd be some

97
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,680
confusion but then there's this recognition just to say oh this is

98
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:47,640
confusion then there's a moment of clarity and the confusion is dispelled just to say oh This is conf

99
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:55,440
confusing Is it really a way to kind of help be grounded so there's this way in which when delusion is operating we

100
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:01,399
don't know what's operating In fact we would say that delusion feels like

101
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,279
truth And in this poem right this person was really convinced that the other

102
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:15,680
person was the cookie thief But the truth is maybe I mean maybe

103
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:22,800
there's a a few different ways in which we might uh want to talk about truths

104
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,600
but one is

105
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:35,760
that most of life is uncertain We like to think that we know

106
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,760
We like to think that we have the truth and that we know the whole picture and all this kind of stuff But there's a few

107
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:49,079
things we can point to that the part of the Buddhist teachings are that things are always

108
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:54,560
changing So even if we felt like we understood exactly how something is

109
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:01,680
maybe it's different in a meaningful way now than how it was Or maybe there's a way in which it's

110
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:07,600
arising and passing or flickering and it's uh it's uh seen to not be as solid

111
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,880
as we thought it was there's this changing quality and we feel like okay

112
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:17,920
it's like this oh no wait it's like that or it's like this or there's this way in

113
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:22,959
which things are uncertain not only maybe do they have this flickering or

114
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,360
unreliable uh quality but things

115
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,639
end right this is also one of the basic truths that uh or the Buddha is pointing

116
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,680
to is some of these uh characteristics of phenomena is that they're changing

117
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:45,959
and that they end And so they can't be these lasting sources of

118
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:52,040
happiness Instead they often can cause a certain amount of

119
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,800
uneasiness some way in which it makes us feel

120
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:03,040
uncomfortable And we don't like uncertainty Humans don't like

121
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:10,639
uncertainty Probably all living beings don't like uncertainty because there's risk It highlights our vulnerability If

122
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,519
we can't predict precisely what's going to happen next it highlights how you know we might be in danger We can't plan

123
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:23,760
or assume things in the way that we like to that we want to It makes us feel more

124
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,040
comfortable But the truth is right we don't really know There could be an

125
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:35,440
earthquake in the next moment right i'm planning to finish this talk you're probably planning to stay here and then

126
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:42,760
just happily drive home at the end or something like this right we don't know what's going to

127
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:48,600
happen And so because humans don't like

128
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:56,399
uncertainty we make things up We just create stuff because information

129
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:04,160
feels better than just recognizing the the unpredictability or the fact

130
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:12,760
that we just simply don't know to recognize that we can't control things So we're making it up as we see in this

131
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:19,760
story and we can also see this in um individuals who are losing their memory

132
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:26,240
This is well established that they often can't quite figure out like now how did

133
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,440
that get there they don't can't remember exactly that they put it there So they

134
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:38,000
make up a story about why it's there and they believe it and they're describing to somebody else oh yeah that's there

135
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:45,519
because I was thirsty so I put the glass I took it out of the dishwasher and put it there But you know maybe they forgot

136
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:52,199
that uh somebody had returned the glass to them and put it there and they're making a story for it to make

137
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:57,360
sense I don't blame them I can It's got to be pretty scary if you're losing your

138
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:04,240
memory and little bits of things are falling apart But you know it's not just only

139
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:10,800
people who are losing their memory that are making things up We saw in this poem

140
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:16,959
Rachel had she created this whole persona of this very gracious and

141
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:22,160
generous person She was thinking he was awful a

142
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:28,160
terrible person And turns out he was so nice He took the last cookie and and

143
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,399
broke it in half and shared it with her He didn't yell at her he didn't a big

144
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,800
huff and get up and move off of there and or something like this or I don't

145
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:49,040
know there's all kinds of things that might have happened right so there's this way in which

146
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:55,839
people often have an idea so I gave an example of losing a

147
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:02,000
memory and the poem is about trying to explain why somebody's uh taking cookies

148
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,800
from the same bag he's taking cookies from But um this is you know happens so

149
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:15,120
often This was highlighted for me when I Well maybe I'll just say this Um I've

150
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:20,639
had a number of conversations where I've seen like people they have this strong belief and they just say "No it's this

151
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,880
way." And then if you poke a little bit at their logic they start coming up with all these ideas that really don't make

152
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:34,320
any sense but they're just trying to support what they said initially they don't want to back down at all or look

153
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:40,959
at things differently or admit that what they said wasn't quite right Or maybe

154
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:48,560
people this is like um well established this idea of uh

155
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:54,000
confirmation bias too Um when we have this view that we will discard

156
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:59,759
information that uh seems to contradict it and we will like seek out information

157
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:06,280
that promotes our favorite view and or just interpret or just simply only

158
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:12,678
remember little bits of information that support our views

159
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:20,160
So there's this way in which we navigate this truth of inicha this truth of

160
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:27,640
impermanence this truth of changeability of phenomena by clinging to

161
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:34,000
views We cling to views to help us feel better to help us feel more comfortable

162
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:39,720
about the uncertainty help us feel better about

163
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:47,600
impermanence And for me I was a little bit fascinated like this poem is uh playful and fun but I was I was

164
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:55,520
fascinated at the end She didn't stop to ask herself why this person was taking

165
00:17:55,520 --> 00:18:01,360
the co her cookies or did ask him or anything Instead she just immediately

166
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,760
boom made up this big uh story about this uh other person She just made up a

167
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,960
story this person's a cookie thief and maybe it's not said in the poem but

168
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:20,320
maybe she thought oh he doesn't even deserve to be spoken to or she had this you know this uh righteous indignation

169
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,559
like she know knows what's actually happening and was uh behaving from that

170
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:33,720
perspective from that view and there's this way in which we are clinging to

171
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:39,160
views and maybe discarding alternative ones but clinging to our ones

172
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:46,559
which of course is really encouraged Our media is built on this That whole all

173
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:51,679
our media probably mainstream media and social media is all about they're

174
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:59,440
wanting you to have a view They're wanting you to take a side It's all about this for you to set

175
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:05,360
up an us versus them me versus you thinking

176
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,400
It's a incredible industry People are making lots of money to try to make sure

177
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:17,440
that you are taking a side I heard this uh from Matthew Bren

178
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:23,400
some time ago and uh I loved what he said He said when when there's this

179
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,600
conflict why don't we take the side there'll be pressure to take side Are you with me or against me are are you

180
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:37,480
part of the us are you part of the them why don't we take the side of not

181
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:44,400
suffering take the side of freedom Take the side of ease instead of us versus

182
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:51,919
them Can we see oh here's where more suffering is and here's where less suffering is Such a great way to

183
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:57,360
consider it and to think about it And that might even be a way not might this is often a way that I think about the

184
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,640
four noble truths the truth that there is suffering there's the arising of

185
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,120
suffering there's a sessation of suffering and there's a path leading to this sessation of suffering This could

186
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:18,600
be like a framework in which we could use instead of us versus them to be saying uh suffering and not suffering

187
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,919
So this way of uh clinging to views is a way that we are navigating uh

188
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:32,679
impermanence and na but it's there's something implicit in

189
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:38,080
here that we often don't even recognize

190
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:43,159
but there's a way in which we're offering often assuming that we have

191
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:49,360
omniscience that we know everything It's so clear We're the good guys They're the

192
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:54,799
bad guys You know what we're doing is good What they're doing is bad I'm the

193
00:20:54,799 --> 00:21:00,799
one who knows and you are the one who doesn't know or you know something like this There's this way in which we're

194
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,880
assuming omniscience and kind like batting away other ideas or batting away

195
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:12,640
other information or not even having any curiosity about anything It's so much

196
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,120
easier just to slap on this label which is completely 100% fabricated Just slap

197
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:25,280
on this label I'm good Slap on another label to everybody else You're bad It's

198
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:30,360
not that simple And we all know that We know it's not that

199
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:37,000
simple But there's this way there's this uncomfortableness sometimes with this uncertainty or there just

200
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:44,400
uncomfortableness with conflict And so there's this way in which we just

201
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:51,520
want to take a view And this is another way that delusion gets described is

202
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:58,480
clinging to views Clinging to views is

203
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,720
delusion It's a come it's a and we could say in the classic Buddhist teachings as

204
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:10,559
well as that you know clinging as a source of suffering the

205
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:17,760
source of uh a lot of difficulty and it's amazing the things that we can cling to and it's amazing

206
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,280
the things that we have views about we have views about ourselves and as I've

207
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,679
been pointing to but we also have views about what does it mean to be a self

208
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:36,600
What does it mean to be um disconnected or isolated or distinct from everything

209
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:44,640
else and is that really true we have so many of these views

210
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:52,039
And then this here's another idea from Matthew Brun that I think is really great and that we can see in this

211
00:22:52,039 --> 00:22:58,120
poem is he said that views are

212
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:04,559
channels into which our greed and hatred

213
00:23:05,240 --> 00:23:12,159
flow Views are channels into which our greed and hatred flow

214
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:18,240
So we're making up views about all kinds of things just to help us orient to the

215
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,000
our experience help us understand the world But the ones that we hold on to

216
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,960
and cling to are being fueled by greed and or

217
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:35,880
hatred These words are like terrible words like greed and hatred None of us want to feel like we have greed or

218
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:41,600
hatred but there are strong words and there's a way you know just like I need

219
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:46,799
more or get that away from me You know these are the few different uh ways we

220
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:54,240
might understand uh greed and hatred And this is what's uh fueling our views And

221
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:01,799
we might say that clinging to views is delusion So here we are these root defilements

222
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,480
So how can we work with delusion by definition we don't see it when we're uh

223
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:18,880
in the midst of it when we're lost in it One is just like in this poem it's by

224
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:26,240
meeting other people If I there it's like reflected back to us you know our thoughts and our

225
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,200
views Sometimes we have some ideas and uh if we don't share our ideas it can they can get a little weird you know if

226
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:39,919
they're not like uh shown some daylight and shared with others I know this has happened to me

227
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:47,120
many times but um and it's happened you know when people like accusing me or I remember

228
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:52,480
this was some years ago I won't say the details but uh somebody saying dad I

229
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:58,159
can't believe you did that because of x y and z and I'm like Wow that's very

230
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:04,000
creative that you came up with X Y and Z It was actually had to do with this some

231
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:09,840
you know completely different I'm sure all of us have had this where like people made assumptions

232
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:17,039
about our actions and project onto us things or and we're doing this to other people all the time

233
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:23,440
So one way to work with delusion is be not only to meet other people talk share

234
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,279
some of our views meet other situations but here's the second that part of that

235
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:35,960
is being willing to learn Being willing to learn from

236
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:42,840
others being willing to learn from our experiences Of

237
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:50,480
course be willing like when we get some new piece of information like a bag of cookies and are when we're on the plane

238
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,440
and to rethink like oh yeah I'm actually the cookie

239
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:04,000
thief And then just to maybe like well how did I um not notice that and for me

240
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:09,360
it's noteworthy that in this poem she's reading a book while she's just like

241
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:14,720
grabbing cookies So she's not paying attention at all

242
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:20,400
disconnected from her bodily experience and lost in some other fantasy or

243
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,600
whatever the book is about We don't know And this is often when the delusion is

244
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:32,080
happening is right when we're not paying attention to what's our experience And

245
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:38,880
we could point to specifically our bodily experience There's a way in which um

246
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:44,080
when we're lost in thoughts which views are that um you know we can talk

247
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:49,279
ourselves into and out of just about anything and everything like why it's a

248
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:54,320
good idea to eat so many cookies while waiting for the plate for example or

249
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,679
something There's a a way in which if we're disconnected from our bodily experience

250
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:09,360
then our thoughts they can just run rampant and create the whole stories and

251
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,760
fabricate whole entire worlds right that have completely disconnected from what's actually

252
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:23,679
happening here But there's this way if we can feel into our bodily experience that

253
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:29,440
maybe she could have felt the irritation and the discomfort and really

254
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:35,559
like wow this is actually really uncomfortable that this person is taking my

255
00:27:35,559 --> 00:27:40,960
cookies and maybe just address him with kindness Uh or you know or maybe

256
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,120
officially offer him so he no longer has to be a thief and then he re or you know like would you like some cookies these

257
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:52,960
are my favorite I I guess you like them too Or you know or maybe it was been an opportunity to connect with this person

258
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,320
and they could have had a funny laugh together and they could have been embarrassed together like "Oh my gosh I

259
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,000
can't believe this happened This is what a story Oh I'm so sorry Let me buy you

260
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,360
some more cookies or maybe can I buy you a coffee to go with your cookie?" And you know maybe they would have had fun

261
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:17,600
to you like connect while they're waiting for the plane I don't know Right That was a whole story I just made up

262
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,799
But there's this way in which to work with delusion is to be maybe with our bodily experience If she had noticed the

263
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:29,600
irritation and but was still like you know connected to the chair or the cushion she could have turned to him and

264
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:37,480
said something different So this is another way to work with delusion

265
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:50,440
I was I'm I think maybe I'm going to stop here This

266
00:28:50,440 --> 00:28:57,200
idea about delusion and

267
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:03,919
views this poem Maybe I'll read this poem

268
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:09,600
again There's this I don't know I was touched by this

269
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:17,679
idea that um maybe part of the reason why this poem is uh funny and uh playful

270
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:24,000
is maybe we can recognize ourselves in our in it or maybe we could feel this

271
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,760
internal horror like that she can't apologize or maybe we've had some of this experience too like we did

272
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:38,960
something that turned out to uh we thought it was one way and turned out to be completely

273
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:47,760
different The Cookie Thief by Valerie Cox A woman was waiting at the airport

274
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,200
one night with several long hours before her flight She hunted for a book in the

275
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:58,799
airport shop bought a bag of cookies and found a place to drop She was engrossed

276
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:04,240
in her book but happened to see that the man beside her as bold as could be

277
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,279
grabbed a cookie or two from the bag between which she tried to ignore to

278
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:16,399
avoid a scene She read munched cookies and watched the clock as the gutsy cookie

279
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,440
thief diminished her stalk She was getting more irritated as the minutes

280
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:27,520
tick by thinking "If I wasn't so nice I'd blacken his eye

281
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:33,600
With each cookie she took he took one too When only one was left she wondered

282
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:39,520
what he'd do With a smile on his face and a nervous laugh he took the last

283
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:44,600
cookie and broke it in half He offered her

284
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:51,679
half and he ate the other He offered her half and he ate the

285
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:56,799
other She snatched it from him and thought "Oh brother this guy has some

286
00:30:56,799 --> 00:31:04,000
nerve and he's also so rude Why he didn't even show any gratitude." She had never known when she

287
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:09,760
had been so gied with relief when her flight was called She gathered her

288
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,679
belongings and headed for the gate refusing to look at that thieving ingrate

289
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:23,039
She boarded the plane and sank in her seat then sat her book which was almost complete As she reached in her baggage

290
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:30,520
she gasped with surprise "There were her bag of cookies in front of her

291
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:39,760
eyes If mine are here," she moaned with despair "Then the others were his and he

292
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:49,039
tried to share Too late to apologize she realized with grief that she was the rude one the

293
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:54,559
ingra the thief It's fun right to hear this poem

294
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:00,720
again when you know how it's going to end These little uh these little uh foreshadowings that gets kind of dropped

295
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:09,840
in there that you can interpret So just an encouragement So often we are holding on to our views and

296
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:16,960
I've gotten this uh from Gil a number of times I think uh as a demonstration so

297
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,240
often we're like holding on to the these views That thief he's taking my

298
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:30,640
cookies But of course we need views because things are impermanent and we need to know how to navigate the world

299
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,559
And so you may ask well Diana what do you do you hold views like this with an

300
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,679
open hand This is completely different than

301
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:47,519
like this and maybe even shaking it Right just holding views with open hand

302
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,799
This willing to learn something new from what we encounter from what our body is

303
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,000
telling us from situations that we experience And then you know the views

304
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:03,600
can change and morph when we're not holding on to them so quickly

305
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:10,039
So with that I'll end and open it up to see if there are some questions or

306
00:33:10,039 --> 00:33:13,360
comments Thank

307
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:33,000
you Thinking about um making up stories I was

308
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:41,080
uh with this five-year-old that I'm very close to I volunteer with her anyway And

309
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,559
she I forget what story she made up but about this person that she'd seen or

310
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,519
interacted with and it was so you know it's so easy to give advice versus to see it in

311
00:33:53,519 --> 00:34:01,840
yourself So you know I'm going "Oh sweetie we don't know anything about that person or how their day was or you

312
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:08,320
know trying to encourage her to be more open-minded and and uh and that kind of

313
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:16,240
triggered me to to think about uh stories I make up even just little

314
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:23,679
little ones and how uh you know prejudices

315
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:29,919
that uh you know just maybe little ones with strangers Oh look at that person I

316
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:40,480
don't know whatever story I make up So I like I like the continued idea of of oh

317
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:46,398
that's just a story I made up Okay maybe I can just you know Yeah let that let

318
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:52,079
that go Yeah that's I find myself sometimes using this when I'm like in my uh when

319
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:57,680
I'm talking to somebody Well here's a story that I have that it's due to blah blah blah But you know just even saying

320
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:05,599
here's a story that I have just lets people know this is my current thinking It might be different later And maybe

321
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:11,680
I'll also offer that um what comes to mind of years ago

322
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,040
So before I really had to practice but I was um feeling like you know I had been

323
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:22,880
wronged about somebody had treated me poorly and I had made up this whole story about it

324
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:29,040
and all this kind of stuff and uh um and my friend she said well let's make up

325
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,640
other stories with the same facts Okay so all we know is X Y and Z And I'm like

326
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,480
no this is what happened you know this person really did it because of blah blah blah you know all this stuff that I

327
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,640
didn't know but that was such a great thing And then we had fun like let's make up all these different stories that

328
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:52,640
would account for the exact same facts And so that's useful for me to keep in mind And maybe it could be fun for

329
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:58,880
children too to like oh let's make up all kinds of story The UFOs came and

330
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:05,200
they uni unicorns uh touched this person and they did I don't know We could make

331
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:14,160
up anything So it's funny to me that I can with a

332
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,280
lot of behavior I can see it more clearly in other people you know kind of

333
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:25,839
judgmental or whatever that and then I go oh yeah I do that too wow

334
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:32,480
thank you Lena that's exactly right and that's part of the I would say the characteristic of views when they're

335
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:38,760
other we see them in other people they think idiosyncratic irre rational a little bit odd but

336
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:46,160
ours perfectly logical reasonable appropriate Yeah it's

337
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:57,520
funny Thank you very much for the talk Um I'm thinking about what you said

338
00:36:57,520 --> 00:37:03,640
about if if she could drop into her experience that it might help shift her

339
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:09,599
views and wondering if you can just say some more about that I'm curious Yeah So

340
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:15,520
for example the agitation maybe she could have felt like some of the tightness maybe in the chest and the

341
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:22,079
shoulders going up and grinding the jaw in this kind of way like you know the kind of like this this little bit of

342
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:29,280
anger And then she could have realized oh yeah okay this is actually kind of

343
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:36,240
odd and irritating that somebody's taking my cookies and then could have maybe done something that maybe spoken

344
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:42,480
to him But there's this way in which we're so disconnected from our bodily experience We're just running with the

345
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:47,839
stories and never there's nothing to consider that we should do anything

346
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:53,119
except believe them Is is is that helpful yeah it's

347
00:37:53,119 --> 00:38:00,240
it's reminds me of like the concept of being grounded Yes When we're in our bodies then we um are more grounded and

348
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:08,680
that that helps our balanced thinking Yes Yes Perfect Yep

349
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:16,800
Okay I think it's kind of this kind of related to the last question Um a part

350
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,960
that I wasn't um sure I was getting was in the talk uh you mentioned like we

351
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,839
make views from uh or they're channeled through uh

352
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:35,599
hatred or greed um is the thought that like

353
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:42,640
uh probably by being more in tune with our bodies like looking for places where there's greed or hatred and that will

354
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:50,160
uncover some of the some of these views that are most likely wrong Um is that

355
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:57,480
kind of the process or maybe I'm misinterpreting the No [Music]

356
00:38:57,480 --> 00:39:04,079
Um so we have to make views in order to orient ourselves in

357
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,240
the you know to help understand things right because we're not omnisient So we we make

358
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:15,680
views and the ones that we make like which ones do we choose to make are come

359
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,200
out of we would say some of this our greed and hatred our conditioning but

360
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:28,320
the ones that we um the ones that are causing problems are the ones that we're really holding on to and I would say

361
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:35,680
greed and hatred um support the the clinging of the view as well as the

362
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:42,400
content of the view and the the content of the

363
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:50,000
view may have some may the greed and hatred may be minor but it's the real

364
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:56,720
clinging that and so it's where the real delusion and the suffering is views I

365
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:02,960
mean we have to make views because we don't know everything I don't know is this helpful what I'm saying it is yeah

366
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:12,000
um I think uh part of it it's hard to live without views So I don't want to throw entirely Um but uh the idea of the

367
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,520
content and the clinging I think I need to be able to separate those Um I was

368
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:23,040
thinking a lot more about the content and how to unpack wrong views and um but

369
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,200
maybe clinging is also a signal Um yeah Yeah Thank you and thank you for

370
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:35,920
giving me the opportunity to highlight that distinction It's the clinging to views and you know the views when we're

371
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:41,000
making up stories they are going to you know be a reflection of

372
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:49,920
our our inner life our conditioning our biases and those are they coming from

373
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,319
they're they're colored by greed and hatred and delusion

374
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,599
Well thank you It's a really good story Um the other thing that I noticed about

375
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:12,319
this poem is that we try to live with the problem rather than address it Oh

376
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:18,599
properly because she doesn't want to make a scene So she's uncomfortable with

377
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:23,920
conflict whereas the conflict could be dealt with in a gentle way rather than

378
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,599
making a scene Yes I think she just didn't want to deal with the issue which

379
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:37,839
we do We just put up with the neighbors whatever or our co-workers whatever

380
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:44,800
instead of addressing the issue So we we suffer we choose to suffer Yeah Yeah

381
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,119
Right This uh con like not wanting to have conflict and the things that uh we tolerate when we actually would be

382
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:58,480
better to just address Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah thank you for highlighting that Hi

383
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:07,040
how's it going good Um I just want to say Jim did a great job uh last week while you're away Oh great Y

384
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:13,359
Thank you Jim Oh great Great I I was teaching a

385
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:19,000
retreat I I knew it would be in good hands

386
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:27,560
Any other comments or questions before we close for the evening

387
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,400
okay So I wish you a wonderful rest of the evening and safe travels home Thank
