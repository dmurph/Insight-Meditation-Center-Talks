3
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,279
so for today's practice

4
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,640
i'd like to share um a quote that

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,719
i saw earlier today that um moved me and inspired me and i'd like to

6
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:46,079
share that with you and this quote is from francis of assisi

7
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:53,199
and francis of assisi says remember that when you leave this earth

8
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:59,760
you can take with you nothing that you have received

9
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:05,840
only what you have given a full heart

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:11,280
enriched by honest service love

11
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,400
sacrifice and courage let me read it one more time

12
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:26,240
we'll use this as the basis of our practice today remember that when you leave this earth

13
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,640
you can take with you nothing that you have received nothing that you have received

14
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:40,159
it's quite profound nothing that you have received only what you have given

15
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,439
a full heart enriched by honest service love

16
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,320
sacrifice and courage so this quote

17
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:58,240
moved has moved me so much and it also stopped me in my tracks today as

18
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,280
many of you know i i love teaching and practicing mindfulness

19
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,119
of death and this practice of mindfulness of mor of

20
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,879
our mortality realizing that we are going to die we're all going to

21
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,640
die it's all everything is impermanent but especially our

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,680
life is impermanent and as we stop

23
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,239
through our day as we stop in moments and realize we are going to

24
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,239
die and everything that we are concerned about getting getting in

25
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:43,280
life getting in life as francis of assisi beautiful he says

26
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,319
um we take nothing we take nothing that we

27
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:53,040
have received we take nothing that we have received

28
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,800
and really what

29
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:08,080
what we the only thing that we take is what we have given

30
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:16,080
and what we give really what we give is a heart that's enriched by service

31
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,680
by love sacrifice and courage

32
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,720

00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:46,559
may i be safe from inner and outer harm

172
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,120
may my heart be expansive generous

173
00:33:57,039 --> 00:34:03,840
knowing knowing that nothing nothing i receive

174
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:10,560
nothing that i receive i will take with me when i die

175
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:16,159
which is inevitable ungovernable

176
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:25,358
may the generosity of my heart be expansive the gifts that i give

177
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:30,158
the cultivation of goodness

178
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:39,280
may be the way i show up internally with my thoughts

179
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:44,440
externally with my words and actions

180
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:55,358

thank you debra yeah

199
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:25,599
neil says it was lovely the way you offered compassion to the zoom bombers it's so easy to be irritated by a

200
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:32,570
knowing people thanks for for being a beacon of compassion thank you neil and debra um

201
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:38,320
[Music] it's i mean it really we

202
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:45,920
as i was saying and what what i was offering it's it's heard people hurt people so you know

203
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:53,119
someone or beings if their entertainment is dis disturbing

204
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,640
so you know meditation session there must be so much pain just imagine

205
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:05,040
how much pain they must be and you know we're irritated by them for

206
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,720
a few minutes right but they live they live in that body in that heart in that

207
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:17,040
mind how how painful it must be that that is your your entertainment the way

208
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,680
it just it's so painful so of course of course i mean how else can

209
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:29,520
how can compassion not arise how can compassion not arise

210
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:36,560
may they be free may they be well may they be free from suffering

211
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:47,200
the floor is open for any reflections you're welcome to raise your hand

212
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:52,480
um [Music] you're welcome to type in chat in the

213
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:57,560
other reflections anything is welcome

214
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,319
also about the um let's see i see joe's hand is up

215
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:13,200
the zoom hand there you go joe please

216
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,599
so a couple of years ago i was in a day-long class not a not a not a retreat

217
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,800
with no john jeff and i can't remember the context but the

218
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,319
subject came up of compassion for people who hurt other people

219
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:36,079
compassion for i mean traditionally they're called enemies not not you're usually called difficult beings now

220
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:42,480
how can you have compassion for somebody like that who's hurting others and he he offered a metaphrase that

221
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,319
might be useful which is may you find the causes of happiness and

222
00:40:48,319 --> 00:40:54,240
act on them and you said you could wish that for anybody

223
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,560
it's very easy to wish for anybody so i thought they'd throw that out i i do that's part of my

224
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,240
meta practice now yeah beautiful beautiful yeah thank you for sharing

225
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,839
that joke yeah causes of happiness exactly and yay may i say that happier

226
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:18,400
is a cause of happiness for for me and and many people so yes yes thank you

227
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:23,520
thank you um and he says may we open our hearts with

228
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,920
the offerings of our benefactors to trust them and not be suspicious of their motives yes

229
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,920
indeed indeed and we have appreciations coming on

230
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:43,040
youtube from richard challenging much gratitude

231
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:51,119
challenging said due to busy mind but was able to settle into a bit of the tenderness and heart space offered here

232
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:57,520
yeah and from barbara after a busy day

233
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:04,000
appreciating wisdom and compassion in this space and susan right view

234
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,000
and emma joining from sydney after exercising great good afternoon to you

235
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,680
and i think i saw maybe mima's hand earlier physical hand yeah okay

236
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:22,480
sometimes i do see physical hands here yes there you are mima please

237
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:28,480
um i was noticing um that coming to this method

238
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,960
practice with happy hour with this sangha i've noticed some internal changes within me

239
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:39,119
they're very subtle i look for

240
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:48,000
certain reactions that i used to have that i don't have anymore and it's so much easier uh to feel compassion

241
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:54,560
um and it's almost like before it used to feel strange because i'm fairly new to the practice but um

242
00:42:54,560 --> 00:43:01,359
now i'm i can notice it more and i can get really comfortable in it and it's really sweet

243
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:07,599
it's it's a good experience and and i noticed like i've had a hard day today but coming looking forward to the coming

244
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:15,040
to you know to the practice i just let everything go and and feel

245
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:20,480
full like i'm being fed and i i so appreciate everyone i appreciate you too

246
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:26,640
nikki thank you thank you we were feeling so much appreciation for

247
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,240
for what you shared your report your practice report and observation over

248
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:37,520
time this is so beautiful thank you oh and i saw hearts

249
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,800
in the space and appreciations for what you shared oh

250
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:48,720
sweet pepper says vitamin meta so cute

251
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:56,480
yeah now says i was moved by what you mentioned in the guided meditation on

252
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:04,240
taking nothing with us when we die it makes me wonder if the only thing we really take are these ideas and how far

253
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:10,480
they might lead us yes yeah and you know if we

254
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:15,839
um if we

255
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:23,000
uh before for those for those who um uh are open to the eye to the

256
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:28,319
multi-life model or rebirth to the idea of rebirth

257
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:34,480
um our wholesome karma follows us follows you know or that where the wholesome

258
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:40,560
karma is what the karma the the potentiality of our actions is what gets

259
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:47,280
reborn into our next life so really that is what not the self but that's what we kind of

260
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,960
follows us so these ideas these generosities these services

261
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,000
um yeah thank you enough it's something that i want to continue

262
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,520
to sit with being being met with a sense of mortality

263
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:10,000
kind contemplation and depress is the last reflection before we go into groups please um

264
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,680
my thought is that the focus isn't about what we

265
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:24,160
take with us as much as what we leave like not the position possessions that we

266
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:30,400
leave but all the good actions and generosity

267
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:36,000
that we've um practiced during our life that

268
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,800
to me i don't know there's just it's just a slight distinction because i really i'm not sure we take anything with us i

269
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,000
think but but if we focus on what we leave

270
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,040
um the intangibles that we leave behind i think

271
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:59,760
i don't know it works better it works better for you yeah tonight yeah i appreciate that and and

272
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:07,920
i think those are two different perspectives yes and for again what i'm gently bringing in

273
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,680
is for for some people they are open to this multi-life

274
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:19,200
view and rebirth and in that case yes it is what you kind of take with you um

275
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:24,560
and for some no it's it's a sense of the one life model and you know there's a

276
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:33,119
sense of don't know mind so both of those frames let's be open to either or both and if

277
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:39,599
we feel challenged by one ah let's have a doughnut mind about the other because the to what we

278
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:45,760
leave that's an easy one i agree of course you know we can all sign up to that one that's what we leave and what

279
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:52,240
we take i know it's like yeah do i think i don't know about that okay cool let's let's let's have a don't know

280
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,280
mind about that or not it's all good

281
00:46:57,280 --> 00:47:03,359
yeah they were just happy to take it with me to the next life too

282
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:11,520
that's great so dear ones we have come to uh the invitation for us to enter and

283
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:18,480
practice in small groups together size of three take care of yourselves take care of each other sharing as little or

284
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:24,880
as much as you you wish and remember you don't take anything well

285
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:31,599
anything you have received you don't take with you so so i'm creating the rooms and we're

286
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:36,720
