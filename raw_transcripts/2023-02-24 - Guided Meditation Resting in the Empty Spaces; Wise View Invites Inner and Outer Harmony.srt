surface is supporting you softening the eyes

20
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,400
maybe closing them if you're comfortable closing them

21
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,739
I'm tuning in turning into your surroundings

22
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:10,260
maybe one or two more intentional deep slow breaths

23
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:19,459
where you let any excess tension anything else out on the out breath

24
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:27,239
allowing the tongue to stay soft the face

25
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:30,379
to stay soft

26
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:37,640
noticing your immediate surroundings

27
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,140
maybe a different distant train whistle soft rain

28
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:52,440
Hawk cries or Birdsong whatever ambient

29
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,879
sound is around you

30
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:04,220
and noticing too

31
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:15,439
the way your body is situated and immersed in the moment

32
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:21,859
feelings of warmth or cool

33
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,319
pressure or lightness

34
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:38,360
perhaps vibration or tingling from the inside of your body

35
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:50,300
and the Comfort to sense of

36
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:58,380
support support of the chair maybe the support of the map of the

37
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:01,580
ground beneath your feet

38
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:21,560
feeling health held by the Earth

39
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:44,660
having the attention rest

40
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:49,160
ing on the breath

41
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:58,580
on the sensations or sound flowing through this moment

42
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,340
settling

43
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:51,300
if distraction arises you know the Mind continues in the world

44
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:59,060
of thinking that it's so common just noticing that with kindness

45
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:04,400
beginning again

46
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,699
returning to the moment

47
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:27,620
rededicating yourself to awareness

48
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,539
this breath this sound

49
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,580
from time to time rededicating yourself

50
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,160
to non-preoccupation

51
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:28,040
the Simplicity of Silence the spaces in between

52
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:41,660
spaces in between but sound

53
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:03,680
simply being

54
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:53,360
in the last few moments of this meditation

55
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,100
the invitation is if you haven't already

56
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:04,740

57
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:11,950

oh dear son go we are now in the fifth of five

80
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:58,500
books explorations on inner and outer Harmony

81
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:04,440
we've drawn from the Buddha's teachings on the saranya dhamma

82
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,980
principles of cordiality so just a quick overview if you've just

83
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,380
joined us today welcome and um

84
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:23,120
the previous days Monday was mindfulness and wisdom of benefit for ourselves

85
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:28,460
others self and other and everyone

86
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:33,840
Tuesday was the benefits of kindness and

87
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,179
Goodwill internally and externally personally and relationally

88
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:46,260
Ben was a sharing or generosity and yesterday was the power of ethical

89
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:51,840
consistency or persistence in today's topic

90
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:57,720
which the Buddha held is the most important by far amongst these

91
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:05,820
principles or qualities is noble and freeing wise View

92
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:11,520
wise View area so it's

93
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:18,200
um awakened wise View and this is a huge topic it could easily be its own series

94
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:25,980
and today I'm going to most of you explore why have you compared to the alternative

95
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:34,679
which is fixed speculative views opinions buying into our opinions about reality

96
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:42,658
other people ourselves wise view instead isn't an opinion

97
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:50,700
it is a perspective an understanding about the way things unfold through

98
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:56,339
conditionality how disparate conditions

99
00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:02,520
come together and form this moment everything that came

100
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,940
to now formed now all these little interactions

101
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,579
so the simplest and most famous formulation

102
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:21,420
of wise view conditionality is a kind of a diagnostic process I think of the

103
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:27,420
Buddha as a doctor and that is the Four Noble Truths

104
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:35,760
first is acknowledging suffering exists second is seeing the arising of dukkah

105
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:43,320
suffering disease in any given moment third is the ceasing the ending of true

106
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:48,540
God or suffering and the last fourth Noble Truth is the

107
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:54,359
path to the ending of suffering now I'm not going to go into detail

108
00:35:54,359 --> 00:36:01,560
about this this morning it amply covered by other teachers including a series of girls talks for

109
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,940
this from 7 A.M online Sun got back in 2020 which you can find on

110
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:14,760
audiodarma.org if you want a lot more information excellent teachings

111
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:20,880
instead I'm going to talk about how process perspective including the

112
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:27,780
diagnostic process perspective of the Four Noble Truths provides an alternative to being Swept

113
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:36,180
Away by distorted by our internal obsessive thinking imagination speculation

114
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:42,480
and these obsessions are what the Buddha focused on in his more relational

115
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:47,820
teachings about group compatibility friendliness getting

116
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:53,339
along cordiality because they're quite damaging when

117
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:59,060
bought into and often lead to quarreling

118
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:06,420
so in so many Adama the principles of cordiality the Buddha teaches that wise

119
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:12,839
view is being aware of versus obsessed by unhelpful Tendencies

120
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:20,700
of mine and this is incredibly powerful he specifically mentions being aware rather

121
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:28,740
than obsessed by the five hindrances of lust for sensual experiences ill will

122
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:37,760
sloth torpor and rigidity restlessness and remorse and doubt

123
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:43,940
now that too is a list that can be amply covered in series

124
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:50,280
but just to notice rather than even trying to remember all the words I just

125
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:58,578
said in that list notice when we're hooked and when we're not hooked

126
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,740
more than anything as I mentioned the Buddha highlights

127
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:11,760
the freedom from being obsessed by adhered to speculation

128
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:17,940
especially speculation that leads to quarreling disputing or as he put it

129
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:23,820
stabbing each other with verbal daggers right

130
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:29,280
instead the Buddha speaks of an alternate way of

131
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:34,740
being a non-ranking a lack of need to win arguments or be

132
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:41,700
better than rather than being better than or worse than there's this deep internal respect

133
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:47,160
for differences relationality among each living person

134
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:54,660
each living being this kind of non-comparison is a radical

135
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:59,940
kind of humility it's an understanding that vast web of

136
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:08,280
conditions actions possibilities pasteurizings that we emerge from in any

137
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,000
given moment it's well known in Buddhist cultures and it's known in other cultures too

138
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,180
including indigenous cultures my dear colleague Kyra Duolingo

139
00:39:20,180 --> 00:39:26,579
introduced me to Enrique Salmon's idea of kin-centric ecology

140
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:33,240
this is an understanding that he articulates as that life in any

141
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,640
environment I'm quoting here is viable only when we humans view the life

142
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:45,799
surrounding us as can as kid

143
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:53,339
can we see those we disagree with as kin to

144
00:39:53,339 --> 00:40:01,680
rather than winners or losers or some kind of flavor of other or wrong or bad

145
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,280
it doesn't mean condoning Behavior or attitudes or opinions of those we

146
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:13,680
disagree with we're still allowed to have differences

147
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:19,800
and discern what behaviors our attitudes might be harmful or hopeful

148
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:27,060
that too is wisdom instead it means seeing the humanity

149
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:32,099
the other conditions or just knowing that they're there the conditions that

150
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:38,579
derive Behavior underpin attitudes and understanding that

151
00:40:38,579 --> 00:40:44,520
those two come from this interplay of all different kinds of

152
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,520
life forces that we may or may not have shared with

153
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:57,240
these others this takes a deep insight

154
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:03,720
a radical kind of perceptual humility an absence of need

155
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:09,859
to have my own opinion or my own speculation be right

156
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:17,579
and the Buddha kind of illustrates this there's a story from the ancient um

157
00:41:17,579 --> 00:41:23,339
Buddha's teachings this comes from the imagine the middle

158
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:30,660
length discourses and um it's a story of the Buddha who's sitting

159
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,880
calmly calmly in the forest meditating I think perhaps receiving

160
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:43,500
visitors I don't know when Along Comes this young man big stick like a walking stick right

161
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:48,900
and his name in the soutas in the discourse is literally dandapani which

162
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:54,000
means stick in hand now to really understand the resident

163
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,300
said this you have to understand that the term stick and handle often implies violence

164
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:06,060
it's kind of a phrase used to talk about violence or

165
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:11,460
quarreling right so don dapani apparently the

166
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:19,200
commentaries explained he's kind of just puffed up debater type amongst many in that era

167
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:24,300
and he is going out for exercise or walking comes upon the food is like ah

168
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:32,160
someone I can argue with and begins to provoke the Buddha asking him what what

169
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,680
he teaches and what his doctrines are right

170
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,160
well the Buddha answers him this self-important philosophical debater he

171
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,460
answers him I offer teachings that quarrel with no one in the morning

172
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:54,920
I do not quarrel with anyone in the world

173
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,440
and apparently he did so with such peace

174
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:08,280
such equanimity and such evenness that dandapani was just completely put off and they

175
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:15,119
described him making a very funny face his eyebrows shoot up his tongue Wags and he sort of shakes his head and walks

176
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:23,160
away so some of the Buddhist followers I can't remember if they were around or if

177
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:30,300
he just relayed the story afterwards but um they asked well what did you mean by

178
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:36,660
that and a senior teacher

179
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:43,440
and the Buddha both explained explained that the Buddha instead of adhering two

180
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:50,880
opinions views sees the world in terms of dependent

181
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:58,500
arising conditions arising and can see the perceptual distortions

182
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:04,020
as such rather than being booked by them now I

183
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:13,800
am definitely paraphrasing and condensing here it's quite a deep teaching but the Buddha is resting in oriented to

184
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:19,859
the process of understanding subjective experience

185
00:44:19,859 --> 00:44:25,560
as it is which is kind of orthogonal to any kind

186
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:33,480
of particular opinion so basically

187
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:38,700
he teaches over and over if we take our perceptions distorted by obsessive

188
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:43,980
thinking to be reality that causes

189
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:51,680
or helps to cause conflict argument and suffering the alternative

190
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:57,000
internally and externally is to focus on the conditions that

191
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:02,460
lessen suffering and increased peace

192
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:07,740
the grounding of how we move through the world here now in this moment

193
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:13,920
versus what might happen there and then right always asking noticing

194
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:21,680
where's the suffering right now reuse the piece right now

195
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:29,960
it's a great alternative to stunning wife stories

196
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:36,240
so noticing being versus being caught by

197
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:42,420
the mind's tendency is towards concoction speculation

198
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:47,359
and taking those Tendencies with a sense of humor

199
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,400
I just think of the current Dalai Lama's infectious laugh he's asked basically

200
00:45:53,400 --> 00:46:00,420
are you fully awakened I mean it just laughs and says my mind tried sneaky stuff on me all the time but he notices

201
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:07,920
it of compassion and humor being aware versus being obsessed

202
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:13,200
is the key because anything anything we clearly see

203
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:20,480
with awareness is fuel for wisdom food for awakening

204
00:46:20,579 --> 00:46:26,940
this is where the other qualities of Mind we've gone through this week are really supportive mindfulness of what's

205
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:34,319
beneficial to ourselves what's beneficial to others our attitude is their kindness and good

206
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:40,460
will sense of sharing or generosity

207
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:48,380
and the consistency and Persistence of always beginning again with kindness

208
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:54,839
all of these things support us in being able to respond to alleviate suffering

209
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:00,300
rather than perpetuate it in our own minds Hearts lives

210
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:04,460
and in the ways we relate to each other

211
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:12,180
so in the days between now and Monday if you wish to you might consider noticing

212
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:18,000
what lessened suffering and what increases peace

213
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:23,960
in your own practice in your life and your relationships

214
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:30,119
so thank you thank you dear Sandra very much for your kind attention

215
00:47:30,119 --> 00:47:33,559
it's been a joy to be with you
