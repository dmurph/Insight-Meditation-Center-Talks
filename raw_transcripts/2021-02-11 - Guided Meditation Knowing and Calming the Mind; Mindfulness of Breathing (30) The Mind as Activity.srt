1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:08,720
so warm greetings everyone and welcome to our meditation time

2
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:16,240
and uh one of the principles of mindfulness meditation

3
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:23,840
is or one of the potentials is to be equanimously mindful

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:32,160
of everything that no matter what the experience we're having it's possible to have a relaxed calm

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,040
clear recognition that this is happening and in relationship to mental activity

6
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:46,960
the topic of this week thinking uh mindfulness meditation

7
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:53,520
is not making an enemy of our thinking it's not uh condemning it to some

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,559
place where it's not supposed to exist at all and we're supposed to get rid of it

9
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,400
it certainly can calm down thinking and it's quite nice to have it become quieter and

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,439
still there sometimes there seems to be thinking stops entirely and it can be very peaceful but that's not

11
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:18,720
necessarily the point the point of mindfulness meditation is to see clearly without being for or

12
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:26,080
against the experience being forward against that's uh

13
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:31,600
you know that that is a different capacity of the mind it's a different function of the mind

14
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:38,000
that sometimes has a role and sometimes doesn't but for mindfulness itself it's just a

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:46,078
simple being present for our experience so with that as an introduction

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,280
just to maybe just close your eyes as you are and think that the principle for

17
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:59,119
mindfulness meditation is that you're allowed to come as you

18
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:07,280
are to come as you are meditation and and so when you sit and close your

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:15,599
eyes one of the possibilities is begin first by just noticing how you are

20
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:23,840
without any effort to meditate just notice how you are right now

21
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,760
what's happening for you and your body what's happening for you

22
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:38,959
in your heart and what's happening for you in your mind

23
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,080
and to

24
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,720
in particular for the purposes of today

25
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:04,159
without any idea to be any different notice your thinking

26
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:13,519
allow yourself to think whatever you have to be thinking but just become aware of it be curious

27
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,840
a simple recognition of what you're thinking

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,799
maybe a little bit as if you could step away step backward a few steps

29
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:38,480
and then turn around to look at yourself look at your mind

30
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,319
as if it's thinking

31
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:53,439
thinking in words thinking in images sometimes just that clear recognition

32
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,640
and allowance to think

33
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,439
the thinking quiets down or even stop sometimes it'll come back so just take your time

34
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,159
and notice how it is

35
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:17,518
and notice the energy of thinking the pull of it

36
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,600
is it strong is it weak

37
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,479
do you have an attitude about your thinking

38
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:43,600
are you do you relate to your thoughts as if they're

39
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:51,840
you know you relate to them in a friendly way in a hostile way

40
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,840
in different ways

41
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,520
and what it would be like to neither be friendly nor hostile

42
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:19,600
and certainly not indifferent just present and seeing

43
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,560
in the way that you would maybe look at walking down the street

44
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:35,600
you might look at a tree here look up in the sky and watch clouds

45
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,840
sail by

46
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,240
and is there any physical sensations connected to thinking

47
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,800
is there pressure or attention

48
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,960
contraction

49
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,280
is it the experience not what you're thinking about but the

50
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,600
experience of thinking in and of itself as an experience as something that

51
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:22,560
this has sensations or you can feel it in some way

52
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:35,840
is it pleasant or unpleasant

53
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,240
and now thinking of thinking of thoughts you're thinking imagine your

54
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,240
thinking are like bubbles thought bubbles

55
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,360
take a deep full breath as you exhale let those bubbles float

56
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,840
away

57
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,840
deep breath in relaxing the mental activity

58
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,919
relaxing the pressure and tension

59
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,720
and now continue thinking

60
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:43,039
as the mind wants to think but can you think in quieter ways

61
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,599
can you think with a quieter voice or calmer images

62
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,319
maybe you let the images recede a little bit further away from you

63
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,319
or they slow down the quieter thoughts

64
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,680
slower thoughts adjusting the volume and the speed of

65
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:13,840
your thinking

66
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:32,318
and then instead of letting yourself think whatever you wish to think about

67
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,560
choose what you think about and what i'd suggest is you choose to

68
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,479
think instructions for meditation

69
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:50,000
maybe i'll give you some now you can repeat them to yourself

70
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,200
in a quiet calm thinking or you might have variations

71
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,200
gently softly

72
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:13,680
take a few fuller breaths and as you exhale

73
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:23,839
relax your body

74
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:36,160
as you exhale softening the shoulders

75
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,920
releasing the shoulders

76
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,839
as you exhale softening the belly

77
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,839
letting your breathing return to normal

78
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:21,360
as you exhale soften the muscles of your face

79
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:33,839
around the eyes and the forehead

80
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,279
and soften what can be softened in the area of your brain

81
00:10:45,279 --> 00:11:01,839
even if it's softening around the brain

82
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:18,160
and then to settle into the experience of the body breathing

83
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,800
and for these minutes you'll accompany your breathing

84
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:32,399
maybe imagining that your you and your breathing are walking along

85
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:37,519
holding hands so there's continuous contact between

86
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,279
awareness and the breathing breathing and the

87
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:45,839
awareness

88
00:11:53,519 --> 00:12:00,000
and without leaving the attention to breathing if

89
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,680
while you're breathing mindfully you notice that it's easy to relax the

90
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:11,839
body more you might do so

91
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,560
if you notice that there's a feelings of well-being or contentment

92
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,279
or joy

93
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:31,600
allow it to grow mix allow it give it space in your body

94
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:40,560
and if you notice it's possible to relax the mental activity the thinking muscle

95
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:50,839
without leaving your breathing maybe on the exhale relax the mental

96
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,160
activity but all along accompanying your

97
00:12:56,160 --> 00:13:02,160
breathing awareness and breathing walking along

98
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:07,839
hand in hand

99
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:09,839
softening your thinking slowing your thinking down

100
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:18,480
quieting your thinking and with your thinking quieter

101
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:25,199
maybe it's easier to relax the mental activity

102
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:37,839
the drive the push the pressure

103
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,720
an image for relaxing the mental activity

104
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:30,799
is that of a flower bud that goes from being tightly closed

105
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:37,600
to opening up wide so the inside of the petals

106
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:44,000
are open to the wide open sky and space

107
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,000
so we relax the mind

108
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:56,720
and intuit or feel the vastness of quiet space

109
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:00,480
all around

110
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:12,080
and in that space we stay rooted in the breathing

111
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:21,840
relaxed and open receiving the experience of breathing

112
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:13,280
maybe you can assume that for these next minutes there's nothing that you need to think

113
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:20,480
about even though you might think there's no need to

114
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:25,360
no need to invest any importance in your thinking

115
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,240
and there might be a greater contentment available

116
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,440
by dropping into your body to feel what is more tender and soft

117
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:51,600
and open in your body

118
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,080
the quiet still place within

119
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:05,840
through which you could be breathing from which you can be breathing

120
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:06,720
thinking can be a powerful storm

121
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:15,440
howling wind and thinking can be a soft breeze

122
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:22,720
a soft refreshing breeze that lightly moves through us

123
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:29,440
and with the lightest softest

124
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:36,960
maybe almost insubstantial or imperceptible thoughts

125
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,960
have thoughts of good will for others

126
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:55,760
maybe thoughts of wishing them well wishing them happiness and peace

127
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:03,120
and see how softly is there from a still tender place

128
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:12,880
within that you can silently in your mind atone

129
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:19,919
evoke thoughts ideas wishes of goodwill

130
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:30,240
for others

131
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,320
maybe they're even just half thoughts

132
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:46,559
in a way that opens you up your heart opens you to a

133
00:28:46,559 --> 00:28:59,840
care a tender care respect and valuing of others

134
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,440
and may a soft quiet tender

135
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:12,480
kind regard for others be something that you touch into

136
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,720
throughout the day today it doesn't have to be dramatic

137
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:26,080
it doesn't have to be obvious to others

138
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:31,360
but in a sense from the quiet place within

139
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:37,679
simple quiet thoughts of well-wishing for others

140
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:43,120
and may it be that

141
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:51,520
the benefits of this 30 minutes together meditating

142
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,440
may those benefits be shared with others either directly or indirectly knowingly or

143
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,158
unknowingly

144
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:11,440
and may it be that this meditation supports the possibility of others being

145
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:18,640
happy may all beings be happy

146
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,398
may all beings be safe

147
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,799
may all beings be peaceful

148
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,840
may all beings be free

149
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:09,360
so continuing these talks on anapanasati mindfulness of breathing

150
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:21,200
we've entered into the domain of mental activity and the

151
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:29,440
pali word is um chitta sankara so it's

152
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,600
usually translated as mind and sankara is formations or calling it to this week

153
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:42,879
activities of the mind and um so

154
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,840
activities of the mind it turns out that the mind is not the

155
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,960
container for activities or the organ for activities like

156
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,360
the brain that's maybe the organ for you know what many of us the modern

157
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:08,240
world think of as mental activities the cheetah is itself an activity

158
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:13,360
or it's the sum total of all the activities

159
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:18,480
of the of what we might call the mind

160
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:25,760
it's the um or the cheetah is all the activities of the mind as we

161
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:33,200
experience them as we can know them and so this idea that the mind itself is

162
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,320
an activity is an encouragement not to take the mind as a particular thing

163
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,120
not to kind of reify it or treat it as a almost like a foreign

164
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:56,080
object but rather uh all we have as human beings really in

165
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:04,399
buddhist point of view is uh the activities that are all operating together

166
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:11,519
to to make make us alive it's when the activities of life are no longer here

167
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:18,480
that we're no longer alive and one of those activities is the activities of the mind the mental

168
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,000
activities and to start becoming aware of the mind

169
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,120
appreciating it is the task now in the middle stages

170
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:35,120
of anapanasati and it's very important to appreciate it that it's

171
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:41,200
it's uh it's kind of in the middle here so that there's been a lot of emphasis

172
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,279
on breathing for sure embodied breathing and but also being rooted in the body

173
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,480
really feeling the whole body and then also starting feeling a real sense of

174
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:58,960
well-being a contentment in the body joy in the body and and spreading that contentment

175
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,880
throughout the body and so there's a movement towards becoming whole

176
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:12,638
or the classic language is becoming unified where everything is included and

177
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,398
and and so as we move through panasoti it's not so much that we're now starting

178
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:24,638
to emphasize more the mind but we're opening up wider and wider to more

179
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,800
and more inclusive of this whole but if we're very s

180
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,358
quiet and still centered and in the body the body begins to because it's taken

181
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:42,800
care of so well because it's no longer the challenging place to be

182
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:50,638
uh in deeper meditation that the body begins to recede from

183
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,158
the central focus of awareness the breathing tends to change its quality

184
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,599
and it's fascinating to watch as we go through meditation the different stages that breathing will

185
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:07,200
take and sometimes breathing will go very quiet and subtle and still

186
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:13,040
sometimes it's so quiet the breathing it seems like we've stopped breathing the first time that happened to me in

187
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:19,040
meditation i was very content and a lot of well-being and just

188
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,040
sitting there very still and and nope no trouble at all and then

189
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:31,839
i know i noticed i hadn't breathed for a while and i immediately gasped for breath with fear and i had

190
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:38,960
this thought i'm going to die and um but you know there was no danger of that to just that i'd never

191
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:44,160
you know you know you're supposed to be breathing all the time and uh so this idea that the breathing

192
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:50,800
had seemingly seemingly stopped was you know a little bit jarring for me and then eventually i learned that

193
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:58,160
it seems like there's plenty enough oxygen getting into the bloodstream some way or other even when seemingly

194
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,320
the experience of breathing has gotten so still that it's kind of stopped and so the body and the breathing

195
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:09,920
sometimes recede and so then this sense of wholeness and inclusion

196
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,119
begins to include the mental activity the mind itself

197
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:21,520
and and one of the things we begin appreciating in this path this journey

198
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:28,480
is at some point it's possible to understand that the body itself

199
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:35,200
not the physical body but the body that we experience how we experience the body

200
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,000
is a byproduct or contingent upon the mental activities we have so

201
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,560
uh if the mind is um really quiet and still

202
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:55,119
the construction of the body the the making of the body experiences and interpreting the body and focusing the

203
00:36:55,119 --> 00:37:01,839
body begins to recede as well and the experienced body begins to become more porous

204
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:08,320
more transparent more translucent until it also sometimes kind of disappears

205
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:14,480
so this activity of the mind is part of this his incense all in

206
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:20,800
some forms of buddhism they say them it's all we have all there is um consciousness is all

207
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,240
there is they're saying but i don't think that the buddha would say that

208
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:32,000
but he would say that most of what we experience the experience of life is very much

209
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,480
conditioned and affected by the quality and the activity and the of the mind itself of this cheetah so

210
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,520
this cheetah activity the activity of the mind is actually a very important part of our

211
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,920
hugely important part of our life and it's how we construct ourselves

212
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:56,400
construct our world in the way that we live in it and experience it so to start becoming aware not of this

213
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:03,760
complicated idea that we're constructing our own experience in some way or influencing it greatly but to begin

214
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:12,000
appreciating that as the that we can it's actually possible to quiet the mind still the mind soften the mind

215
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:19,920
not so much by necessarily doing it too intentionally but it tends to happen as we start

216
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,400
getting more and more settled and unified less in conflict with things thus in conflict with the mind or the heart or

217
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:32,000
the world and there's kind of a lesbian for and against things

218
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,880
the mind tends to become quieter and the activity slows down and

219
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:46,480
and but slowing down doesn't mean it doesn't mean we could be we become slow-witted it it's like i

220
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:54,560
said the last few days um the mind actually operates so much better clear more creatively more intelligently

221
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:00,240
more wisely uh when they're less

222
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:07,920
active energy or less applied energy goes into our thinking into the mental

223
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:14,640
activity and the mental activity is kind of like it's begins coasting or it comes into a harmony where there's

224
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:20,640
no resistance to anything there's no and so it just kind of

225
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:28,800
begins to operate in a very harmonious deep way and almost effortlessly so this movement

226
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:34,800
of quieting the mental activity so part of this is then

227
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:42,880
to recognize what it feels like the mental activity the experience of it

228
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,960
and and that's how we can start becoming aware of how energetic it is how tense it is

229
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:56,800
how much pressure there's in it contraction um how much resistance there is how much

230
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:03,440
agitation there is in the mental activity and then to hold that in awareness

231
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:09,520
breathe with that just be aware of that and then when it's easy to uh relax

232
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:15,839
calm the mental activities not to do that too much not to make it a big project in

233
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:23,119
fact the bigger project than calming the mental activities is just to get to know it step seven

234
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:31,280
we can't under i can't underestimate how important it is for people who do be faster practice to really just learn the art of just

235
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:36,319
knowing the experience really well and knowing how to be with it

236
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:42,400
without being for and against it without being actively engaged trying to do something with it and when

237
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:47,920
that's learned well then it's a really good time to

238
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:54,319
actively quiet and soften the mind the mental activity to let go of our

239
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:03,119
thoughts to let go of our preoccupations too and but not to do it because we have to

240
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:09,599
but because it's wise to do it nothing and not do it because we're expecting to be successful

241
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:15,040
but just because you know we're so quiet and peaceful and calm

242
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:21,838
enough that why not why not let the mind become even stiller and quieter

243
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:30,640
and so appreciating the mind as an activity activities

244
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:37,440
and and relaxing and calming it and then also beginning to appreciate

245
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,440
and recognize the ways in which the mental activity has become calm

246
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:50,640
has become quieter and that's a relative degree if you're super agitated it's really

247
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:57,599
good to appreciate that you've now you're half agitated and before you're 100 agitated rather

248
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,119
than feeling upset about the 50 agitation celebrate it

249
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:09,599
any movement in the right direction in meditation just be celebrated rather than to be

250
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:16,400
give yourself more material for why you're not far enough along and not doing better

251
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,160
and but then to appreciate the calmness of the mind the tranquility of the mind

252
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:29,040
and for the buddha tranquility uh begets tranquility extreme

253
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,880
tranquility you actually use the word food tranquility is the food or the nourishment

254
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,119
for more tranquility so as we uh relax calm the mind as the mind

255
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:47,839
becomes calmer um nourish yourself with that calm

256
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:54,000
take it in enjoy it let it spread let it let it be more part

257
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:00,720
of who you are and appreciate it i've had situations where i got calm enough

258
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,079
but the authority of my thoughts and my things i my sense of responsibility were

259
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:13,440
strong enough that i felt like i had to think about things and not sit and appreciate the calm

260
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:20,400
but tranquility is the food for more tranquility so you're allowed

261
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:28,559
to take in that food you're allowed to be nourished by it when it's there when it comes

262
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:36,400
so step seven is breathing in one experiences mental activity

263
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,680
breathing out one experiences mental activity step eight is breathing in

264
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,200
one calms the mental activity breathing out one calms the mental

265
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:56,720
activity and so i hope that you enjoy that

266
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,480
and and also i hope that you don't set up

267
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:08,160
an excited mind in opposition to a calm mind because there are times in life where

268
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,400
it's quite wonderful to be excited and engaged in things and and um and to be able to be fluid

269
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:22,079
and relaxed and fluid in just going back and forth between happily excited minds and

270
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:33,200
happily combines is one of the joys of practice so enjoy your day thank you
