00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:14,179
welcome to this

2
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,740
community of meditators Gathering

3
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:27,320
for what being California we call the 7 A.M sitting in Dharma talk

4
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:39,320
at the beginning of the pandemic the first months or two of the

5
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:46,200
Sheltering in place it was remarkable how quiet this local

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:52,559
city became and how you could hear sounds that I

7
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,899
normally didn't hear there were sounds of birds that uh

8
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,120
kind of like oh yeah there's so many birds here and normally those sounds are drowned

9
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,220
out and maybe you've been in situations

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:14,640
where you know something became quiet and you

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,340
could hear things maybe it's the quiet that happens when

12
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:28,320
the refrigerator hums stops and and you could somehow hear the quiet

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,520
or hear other things

14
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,579
or there are times when the haze or the smog in the air has

15
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,340
cleared out and here where I live we can sometimes see across the San Francisco Bay

16
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:53,520
and it's surprising how close the Hills are on the other side

17
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:02,118
when there is clear so in meditation

18
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,179
when the noise of the Mind quiet down

19
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:16,980
when the Haze and veils that over our eyes our inner eyes

20
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:24,239
our perception clears it's surprising what we can see and hear

21
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,580
and feel within ourselves

22
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,700
and so part of meditation is to see

23
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,160
the noise the thinking the the

24
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:48,000
attitudes the agitation all these things that make it difficult to see

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,760
but from time to time meditation supports

26
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,420
the humming of the refrigerator turns off

27
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,760
City in within us becomes quiet

28
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,220
and we can feel and hear and send something we normally can't

29
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,819
and what is it that we sense what is it we feel that's normally obscured by the busyness

30
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:22,700
the loudness of our ordinary life

31
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,459
and of course that's an answer for each of us to answer for ourselves

32
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:35,060
so to begin our meditation

33
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,379
to place your body in a posture

34
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:51,319
that might allow the agitation the busyness to settle

35
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:57,620
maybe there's a posture you can take that's relaxed

36
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:07,379
that maybe has some qualities of

37
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:11,480
being peaceful and settled

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,680
and in a peaceful way to lower your gaze

39
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:32,120
and not looking at anything in particular

40
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:40,820
slowly and peacefully letting your eyes close

41
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:00,440
and without doing much else

42
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:09,080
not changing your breathing notice

43
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,940
how it feels to be breathing right now

44
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:31,199
letting your attention roam around the Torso

45
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,759
to feel the movements of breathing

46
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:47,900
the sensations the Rhythm

47
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:58,919
and where in your body can you feel fixed

48
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:06,259
the body breathing in a tranquil and peaceful way

49
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,000
maybe it's not your usual place to notice breathing

50
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:26,000
maybe for a few moments it's to be aware of the movements in your back rib cage

51
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:31,400
or the very subtle movements of your spine

52
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:05,120
maybe there's a little bit of Tranquility or peace

53
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,100
for a moment at the beginning of the exhale

54
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:27,020
or at the end of the exhale

55
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:51,300
and as you sit here as you meditate is their beginning of a little bit of

56
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:58,880
calming calm or tranquility simply sitting here

57
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,800
feeling perceiving a global experience of your

58
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:33,198
body noticing where there's agitation and tension

59
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:52,940
noticing it with some gentleness

60
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:11,240
and letting the body relax as you exhale

61
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:37,380
and with gentle care be aware of any agitation or noise or

62
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:44,100
busyness in the mind gently caringly

63
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:47,540
be aware of it

64
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,839
and now on the exhale perhaps letting the Mind thinking mind

65
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,680
relax

66
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:48,540
and as you would let the mind be thinking mind be quiet to listen to a

67
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:55,980
sound faint sound in the distance but a thinking mind be quiet

68
00:10:55,980 --> 00:11:00,079
so you can feel and sense

69
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:10,040
the dynamic flow and of Sensations in your body

70
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:16,440
maybe the subtle sensation is subtlest sensations of

71
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,680
the body vibrating humming

72
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,300
the deepest feeling of

73
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,740
aliveness

74
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,740
where your body both generates

75
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,240
sensations of

76
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:22,160
the body just being here

77
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:29,399
the background deeper Sensations always hear of

78
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:37,220
just being alive and the energies humming vibrations

79
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:47,339
and the Rises out of the body and is received by the body

80
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:50,839
known in the body

81
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:18,300
and in the middle of all that there's the sensations of the body

82
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,959
breathing

83
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,019
maybe almost as if breathing

84
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,639
arises out of and returns

85
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:54,320
from the subtle sensations of the lived body

86
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:45,839
gently writing the sensations of breathing

87
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:53,240
as if you're being lifted and lowered by swells of water that you're floating in

88
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:23,600
riding the exhale all the way to the last sensation

89
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,560
associated with exhaling

90
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:45,540
and from that last sensation receive the upwelling movement of

91
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:50,720
Sensations of inhaling

92
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,180
with a deeper hum or vibration or flow of Sensations in the body

93
00:16:54,180 --> 00:17:03,980
like the current that moves through the river of the body

94
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:17,839
and the breathing his gentle swells

95
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:24,860
waves coming and going in that current

96
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,260
okay

97
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:04,520
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

98
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:12,259
to let something within you become quiet

99
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:23,940
so that you can remember some experience in your life of care

100
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:31,320
someone caring for you in a peaceful way for you caring for someone or for some

101
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,559
animal

102
00:27:39,179 --> 00:27:45,480
and what is care like what is love like

103
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:51,799
if it arises from the place inside that's quiet and peaceful

104
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:57,360
that maybe is only felt when

105
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:00,919
the mind is quiet

106
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:10,740
nothing flashy maybe love and

107
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:17,539
care that is free of Desire

108
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:31,860
a tender appreciation

109
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:54,120
and from the place inside where Maybe love or cares most innate or quiet

110
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:57,120
peaceful

111
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:12,860
to let your good will flow out of there out into the world

112
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,460
as if it radiates

113
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:25,080
and that it carries the words

114
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:33,000
out with it into the world may all beings

115
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:40,620
be happy may all beings

116
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:46,740
be safe male beings

117
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:52,559
be peaceful and may all beings

118
00:29:52,559 --> 00:30:10,319
be free [Music]

119
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,600
thank you

120
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,279
so this will be the second talk on the Buddha's use of similes

121
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:39,860
for providing meditation instruction

122
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:46,740
and I think that these beautiful similes the Buddha uses for his instructions

123
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:52,080
might not at first seem like instructions and in fact for me I think

124
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:57,480
in my early years of reading these early texts I was somewhat dismissive of that

125
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:02,520
similes and kind of maybe glossed over them

126
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:08,340
but now I linger with them and they seem to be quite enriching

127
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:15,120
and the mind the human mind often works well with images metaphors simile

128
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:21,240
some people say that human life is we understand ourselves and the world

129
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:27,240
around us is very much through the filter of similes

130
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:36,080
or metaphors and that sometimes we can understand things in new ways through metaphor

131
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,740
someone might be repeatingly

132
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:52,020
kind of angrily aggressively

133
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:58,500
um trying to fix themselves get rid of some

134
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:04,820
kind of trait or something that they have that is a you know causing suffering

135
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:11,360
and then they hear kind of a metaphor that

136
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:17,039
their approach to try to stop or

137
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:25,039
this tendency they have the approach they have is kind of like picking at a scab

138
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:32,120
and if you pick at a scab it doesn't heal so that metaphor

139
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:39,299
might penetrate more deeply be evocative suggestive have some truth to it that was scapped

140
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:45,240
it's true that um that might penetrate much deeper into

141
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:50,820
the psyche than simply saying you know just you know leave yourself alone

142
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,860
don't try keep you know you know getting rid of something that

143
00:32:55,860 --> 00:33:02,039
you don't like and um so that you know so the metaphor there kind of somehow speaks to

144
00:33:02,039 --> 00:33:07,440
something when my son was young

145
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,080
very young I uh he didn't fall asleep very easily

146
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:20,779
though he had a high sleep need and um so I would when I took him to bed

147
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:27,120
I would do guided meditations with him but I wouldn't sit next to him and say

148
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:34,100
you know be aware of your in-breath be aware of your out breath what I would do was uh paint a picture

149
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:39,120
of some animal in the natural world that was sleeping

150
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,460
and one of the most common ones was a sea otter

151
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:50,460
uh resting on the surface of the ocean with surrounded by underneath and around

152
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:56,039
all this kelp that kept the sea otter quite safe

153
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:02,340
in this in the image I was creating and that uh the CO2 just lay on its back

154
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:08,339
and gently feel the rising and falling of the swells as the the ocean

155
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:13,919
and those swells I would say you know very peaceful and gentle and quiet and

156
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:21,060
as you feel you're breathing maybe put your hand on your chest I would tell him or and just feel that rising and falling

157
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:27,300
of the swell and the otter kind of falling asleep you know resting there safely

158
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:32,878
and and with that he would stay with his breath he would feel the movement of his

159
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:39,540
breathing and he would gently fall asleep and I had a whole repertoire of animals

160
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:46,200
that I would use and one of them was a you know like a gorilla or a monkey that

161
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:51,658
had a little newborn baby that would rest on the chest of the

162
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:58,020
parent and and would feel the rising and falling of the parents chest as the

163
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:03,420
parent was breathing and that the baby would just feel that movement and and

164
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:09,300
then again I maybe have him put his hand on his chest and feel his movement and then you know and this worked very

165
00:35:09,300 --> 00:35:15,839
well for quite a while and helped him fall asleep so this idea of kind of painting an

166
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:22,140
image a story something kind of allows the mind's imagination allows it's kind

167
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:28,140
of an emotional connection you know a little uh you know a little baby monkey

168
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:36,000
with its parent um the safety of being surrounded by kelp it was in in the story I made

169
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:43,099
um it kind of kind of touched some different aspects of Who We Are that allowed something deeper to connect to

170
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:48,720
you know the movements of breathing in doing this kind of meditation

171
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:53,940
and um and so the Buddha also used these similes and these similes then tap into

172
00:35:53,940 --> 00:36:01,140
our imagination tap into how the imagination and the picture that's created reaches out and touches

173
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:06,420
different parts of our emotional being but different parts of our Concepts and

174
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,240
ideas and our ability to ability to visualize the way that supports what

175
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:18,180
we're doing and um and I didn't know that this was could be

176
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:25,200
part of meditation partly because both in Zen and they're in vipassana practiced started in Asia

177
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:31,140
it was clearly uh opposed to doing anything like that it was just kind of

178
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:36,599
sitting here present with the truth not doing anything trying to make anything

179
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:42,240
happen just a direct penetration of the truth of emptiness or something

180
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:50,460
and with the personal practice it was just directly seeing things as they are without the overlay of Concepts and

181
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:56,940
stories and images and similes there's something very profound about the way I was taught to end the way I

182
00:36:56,940 --> 00:37:04,440
was taught to be possible but it's also was kind of an advanced practice and kind of assumed that people could

183
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,660
were already able to settle quite well and in fact in when I started Zen I

184
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:15,180
wasn't Envy Personnel I wasn't and so it took a while to kind of find myself

185
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:20,579
settled enough to do the instructions that they were teaching

186
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:27,800
and the Buddha but the Buddha when he gave his meditation instruction he made some very simple technical

187
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,720
explanation of what to do or what goes on but then he provided similes that filled

188
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:40,460
in the picture they gave a richer sense of what was going to happen within it's almost like similes and metaphors

189
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:46,859
sometimes evoke or touch or explain describe what

190
00:37:46,859 --> 00:37:52,920
can go on inside better than just a simple statement and um

191
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:59,579
you know if someone someone could say to me you know I'm feeling pretty sad today

192
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:05,599
I would kind of care for them and wonder what's going on but I've heard sad songs

193
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:12,480
that made me cry there was one actually one children's song from my son that I don't think he

194
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,820
ever was moved by it but whenever it was uh by the singer called Rafi

195
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:26,940
um who made children's songs and uh and now to hear the song and now it'd get kind of teary and it was such a sad song

196
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:33,599
so there's there's something there's things that touch us and evoke us so similes so the simile I want to

197
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:39,000
describe today is the beginning stages of really

198
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:45,540
getting quiet and settled so that uh all the noises of the Mind

199
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:51,420
the business of the mind is no longer there and we're beginning to kind of settle into the present moment but

200
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:58,500
there's still a kind of dynamism there's still a kind of kind of the flow of energy that of life is kind of flowing

201
00:38:58,500 --> 00:39:04,740
through us in a very nice way and um and so the simile is that of a

202
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:11,880
mountain lake that is uh deep deep Mountain Lake

203
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:18,420
and there's no uh Rivers flowing into the river into the lake so it's not

204
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,300
being replenished by Rivers coming in and there's no rain that falls in the

205
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:30,359
river so it's not being replenished from above instead this this particular lake is

206
00:39:30,359 --> 00:39:35,820
being reply replenished by an underwater spring that's at the center of the lake

207
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:43,619
basin where it's uh flowing Waters coming out of the spring

208
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:50,099
into the water itself and Fanning out in all directions through the lake

209
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:55,440
and this water is explained as being cool and fresh

210
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,740
and in a hot climate like India cool and fresh water was very comforting very

211
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:09,240
wonderful for people and have very positive connotations and and so the city of cool refreshing

212
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:17,400
water I would say it would come out of the spring and spread throughout the lake so no part of the lake was not

213
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:25,740
touched by the this cool current of water in the same way as a person gets settled

214
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:31,760
and starts getting quiet and able to hear and listen more deeply what's going on

215
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:37,500
partly because they're starting to get focused on the breathing and the

216
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:43,020
thinking mind the distracted mind the discursive mind starts getting quiet and

217
00:40:43,020 --> 00:40:48,980
quiet then the it starts to kind of be a

218
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:56,220
unification Gathering Together harmonizing of the energies of the sensations of

219
00:40:56,220 --> 00:41:02,099
what goes on inside of us that there's kind of something as touch something uh

220
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:09,180
you know you can almost say something almost emotional something that uh something gets kind of

221
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:16,980
freed up and there's a flow of energy of delightful sense of well-being that

222
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:22,020
can flow through the body in the same way that the the water from the spring

223
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:28,140
flows through the lake this delightful kind of Uh current

224
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:33,599
flows through the body so that no part of the body is not touched by this

225
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:40,140
delightful sense of current sometimes this current is called joy and

226
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:46,980
kind of a joy and happiness I like to think of it as just kind of you know it's also all kinds of intensities of it

227
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:53,160
it can be um but essential well-being a sense of unification

228
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:58,200
that might be comparable to a craftsperson really happily absorbed in

229
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:04,920
the work they do uh or a someone reading a book or playing music or doing some activity

230
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:11,460
where the doing of it fully completely involved in it where there's we're not

231
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:18,420
fragmented all the energy is there kind of gathered to kind of in a peaceful way to kind of be involved in it some

232
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:23,460
delightful happy sense of concentration absorption has this welling up feeling

233
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:33,020
that spreads throughout the body and um and so uh that's the simile and so

234
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:38,880
as it gives a sense that as we can get concentrated as we get settled and

235
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,099
present here with a quiet mind there is something deeper that Wells up

236
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:50,220
that feels quite healthy and delightful and wonderful that that we can trust

237
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:56,700
that is supportive and that so the simile kind of gives a sense of feeling

238
00:42:56,700 --> 00:43:04,619
that there's a current there's a flow there's a it arises maybe out of some place Source within us

239
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:11,400
the important part of the simile is that um the the source of the sensations of

240
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:17,940
delight and well-being that they're going on arise from inside out they rise

241
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:25,920
from within the body and they're not dependent on any of the rivers coming from outside any of the scent stores

242
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,700
being stimulated by sounds smells touch

243
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:38,220
sites they're not dependent of anything in the world and because there's no rain falling in

244
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:44,220
and the metaphor the rain is all our thoughts stories we make living in the kind of conceptual world

245
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:50,400
and none of that is influencing us we're not being impacted by the world or the

246
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:57,060
world of our thoughts uh this source of this well-being is not dependent on

247
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:04,500
anything in the world and that's a phenomenal pointing the story this kind of assembly pointing

248
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:10,800
that possibility can give a lot of inspiration oh I don't have to fix the

249
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:16,680
world I don't have to line up the world to be just the right way there is a place

250
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,319
of quietude or peacefulness where something begins some happiness can

251
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:28,859
arise and swell Love From the Inside Out and it can feel like it has no cause or

252
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:35,400
no reason though the cause kind of is being settled and focused and present in a

253
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:40,859
more continuous way that's kind of the cause but it kind of

254
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:48,060
like has no worldly cause and to begin having a sense of this that we carry with us this possibility

255
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:53,700
can free us from the idea that my

256
00:44:53,700 --> 00:45:00,060
happiness is dependent on what goes on in the world and I have to fix the world get everyone to behave

257
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:05,940
properly then I'll be happy rather there is this

258
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:14,220
beautiful Deep Mountain Lake inside of you in which there is a bottom there's a

259
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:21,540
spring of freshing energy coming up and can flow throughout the whole body

260
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:27,000
the treasure is in you not outside

261
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:33,300
so thank you and um and um

262
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:39,000
and I feel a little bit apologetic that the guided meditations this week are a little bit long a lot of words but

263
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:45,359
hopefully uh it it uh conveys little but what I'm teaching here with these

264
00:45:45,359 --> 00:45:52,640
similes and we'll continue again tomorrow thank you
