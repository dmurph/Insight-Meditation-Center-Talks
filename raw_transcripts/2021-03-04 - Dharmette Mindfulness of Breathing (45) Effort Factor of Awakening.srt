1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,840
so the

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,799
topic now is the third factor of

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:09,358
awakening

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:14,480
the effort factor of awakening

5
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,560
or the effort lim the word anga

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,480
can mean lim or part

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,840
and and so it's a

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,000
it's a part of the whole

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,680
and uh so the seven limbs of awakening

10
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:34,320
the seven

11
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,760
factors of electing parts of awakening

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,280
can be seen as part of four

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,320
seven different qualities or practices

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,600
or states of one

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,839
whole one whole way of being

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,280
and one of those ways of being is to

17
00:00:55,280 --> 00:01:00,480
engage to to make efforts to do things

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,520
so it's not just the passivity of just

19
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,000
how we are but there's also an

20
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,600
engagement

21
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,280
in our practice in our world

22
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,720
and the word viria

23
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,799
that's a v-i-r-a-y-a

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,720
v-i-r-yeah a-y-a

25
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,799
is comes from the word hero

26
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,439
and so a kind of heroic effort

27
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:34,159
but all these words like effort and

28
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,079
heroic effort

29
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,479
can lend itself to being exhausted as

30
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,799
soon as you hear them like oh no

31
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,720
i have to do all this work now and

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
tiring work

33
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,640
some translators to translate this word

34
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,280
for

35
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,000
effort and effort factor of awakening as

36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,680
endeavor

37
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,360
and i don't know if some of us if the

38
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:02,320
word endeavoring has a little bit more

39
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,520
nicer feeling than the word effort

40
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,280
we endeavor to do something it's what we

41
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,720
are engaged in trying to do

42
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:16,400
to make it really maybe feeling closer

43
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,720
in

44
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,520
and more less the energetics of effort

45
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,560
i relate this right effort with the word

46
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,599
choice that

47
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,280
it's the choices we make as we practice

48
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:33,280
and as we live our life

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,599
and choice you know a choice doesn't

50
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:37,519
necessarily imply that there's a lot of

51
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:39,120
effort or strain or work

52
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,680
a lot of work it's just a choice the

53
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,440
choice and what we're going to endeavor

54
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,280
in

55
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:48,400
and this uh the usual this definition or

56
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,959
description of these of

57
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:53,680
the effort factor of awakening is the

58
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,599
same description as the

59
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,319
effort factor of the eightfold path

60
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,080
and so if you take it as endeavoring

61
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,200
the buddha is here is teaching us what

62
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,000
what in this wonderful precious life

63
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,440
that we have

64
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:15,200
what endeavors are worthwhile to do

65
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,120
you know what's what should we do with

66
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,280
our life

67
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,040
what endeavors and rather than giving an

68
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,680
answer

69
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,120
for a particular project you know

70
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,440
particular work to do a career to do or

71
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,280
something

72
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,519
the answer is it has to do with

73
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,959
the consequences of what we do of how we

74
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,239
do it

75
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,599
and so those things that lead to

76
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,680
what is skillful or wholesome

77
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,440
those things choose choose those things

78
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,400
those things that

79
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,840
lead to what's unskillful to what's

80
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,159
unwholesome

81
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:03,120
don't do those things don't choose those

82
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
things to do

83
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,120
and what's most skillful in the

84
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,239
in the teachings of the buddha are those

85
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,680
things that

86
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,479
avoid we're avoiding things that cause

87
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,560
suffering

88
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,359
and suffering comes along with a feeling

89
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:22,079
of being

90
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,199
caught or trapped or constricted or

91
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:29,520
clinging to something craving the

92
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,880
world's gotten smaller

93
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,440
narrower

94
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,360
and we choose to do those things that

95
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
are skillful which is those things that

96
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,080
lead away from suffering

97
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,520
lead to a kind of wonderful happiness

98
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,360
and peace that goes along with feelings

99
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,040
of freedom

100
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,960
of openness of tranquility

101
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,240
of of goodness of happiness

102
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,600
and so it isn't just any old

103
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,639
happiness that we're looking for

104
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,320
because some happiness is like the

105
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,759
happiness of winning

106
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,840
the lottery is not really a

107
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,320
deep nourishing kind of wellspring of

108
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,400
goodness of warmth of peace of

109
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,080
kind of real intimacy with the

110
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,440
warmth and juiciness of life it's more

111
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:30,960
of a surface joy and more

112
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,919
exuberance and

113
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,160
i don't know what promise of all kinds

114
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:38,320
of exciting things

115
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,320
and they say that most people who win

116
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,240
big lotteries a year later

117
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,759
are less happy than they were before

118
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,240
they won it

119
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,720
so what is it that's lasting happiness

120
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,600
what is it that lives

121
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,880
lasting well-being and so begin having a

122
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,919
sense

123
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,560
of what that is not in the big picture

124
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,120
like

125
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,720
way in the future but to to recognize

126
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,120
this

127
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,039
in ourselves to recognize moment by

128
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,479
moment

129
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,400
that if i'm driving my car

130
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,639
and there's a light up ahead that's

131
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:15,440
green but i don't know if i'll make it

132
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,000
and then get contracted and focused and

133
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:18,560
tight

134
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,600
like you know i better get it you know i

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,600
i'll be late for my appointment of where

136
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,199
my life will

137
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,720
you know be so much more difficult if i

138
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,560
don't make that green light and

139
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,080
and then we're kind of you know getting

140
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,639
contracted and tight

141
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,440
and the feeling in the body and the mind

142
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,639
and the heart

143
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,120
maybe it's subtle but is not a very good

144
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,720
one it's not a nourishing one it's not

145
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,160
one that

146
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,520
inculcates goodness or warmth or

147
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,639
peace or love or care for others

148
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,039
but another choice in driving would be

149
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:54,080
you know

150
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,080
i see the light up there it's green

151
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,120
right now but

152
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,919
probably i can't reach it i'm not sure

153
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,680
rather than racing to see if i can get

154
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,479
it

155
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,880
what if i actually there's no one behind

156
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,240
me right in the moment

157
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,759
what if i actually go a little bit

158
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,880
slower and just kind of take it easy and

159
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,080
give the light a chance to turn red

160
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,160
and then i can kind of be connected

161
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,160
myself to myself in a different kind of

162
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,039
way and

163
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,800
i can kind of relax a little bit be more

164
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,120
open it can be more receptive to the

165
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,240
traffic around me

166
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,000
and to the environment and not so

167
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,599
narrowly focused

168
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,080
and you get it turns red and you stop

169
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,639
and

170
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,240
you sit there and turns out then you're

171
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,240
kind of quite contented you did a nice

172
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,000
thing for yourself

173
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,720
and and so this much some of you might

174
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,440
think this example is ridiculous

175
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,560
but we have ten thousands of these small

176
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,759
little

177
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,120
choices that we make throughout the day

178
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,080
and to begin endeavoring the right

179
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,199
effort

180
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,080
is to make wise choices around these ten

181
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,520
thousand little things we do throughout

182
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,199
the day

183
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,440
including the big choices we make the

184
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,360
big things we do

185
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,800
and this this is how we bring

186
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,120
mindfulness into daily life

187
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,599
is we bring mindfulness to all the what

188
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,639
we're doing

189
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,639
and we have not just aware of what we're

190
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,840
doing

191
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,400
we're aware of the choices we make as we

192
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,479
do them

193
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,800
and we we're aware of the options we

194
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,680
have

195
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,879
of which direction we go in the skillful

196
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,840
or the unskillful

197
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,240
and so the investigation factor of

198
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,199
awakening the

199
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,200
fact awakening that makes the sees

200
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,080
clearly and sees distinctions

201
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,640
includes seeing this distinction between

202
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,360
as

203
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,360
healthy and unhealthy skillful and

204
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,800
unskillful

205
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:47,120
beneficial and not beneficial leading to

206
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,040
entrapment or leading to freedom

207
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,959
and so right effort is to you know in

208
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:55,519
the

209
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:58,320
effort factor of awakening is that

210
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,839
factor of awakening that's

211
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,279
constantly turning towards the healthy

212
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,600
choice

213
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,040
but not because it's a lot of work

214
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,200
in fact as we get the hang of it it

215
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,880
feels the opposite

216
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,640
that's where the least work is

217
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,200
in some ways choosing the unskillful

218
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,240
thing

219
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,880
there can't if you're lazy or if you're

220
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,600
kind of

221
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,200
it's easier just to go along with

222
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,240
impulses it can feel like it's the easy

223
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,600
way

224
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,880
but generally the consequences are

225
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,279
require much more work later much more

226
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:36,080
repair

227
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,040
and stress and all that choose the

228
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,080
healthy approach

229
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,120
the skillful and it tends to be

230
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,279
just the consequences tend to be good in

231
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:46,399
the future and

232
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,880
no repair is needed no you don't have to

233
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:49,600
de-stress

234
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,800
afterwards recover from it

235
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,519
and so getting getting the habit and the

236
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,040
ongoingness of

237
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,680
being present and making these wise

238
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,040
choices to what's skillful and

239
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,560
beneficial

240
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,800
tends to start creating a life which has

241
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,360
less and less stress in it

242
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,920
less and less uh needing to recover from

243
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,959
the stress

244
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,320
the tensions of the life and so there's

245
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,959
more energy it's more vitality

246
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,160
for this life of ours then if we choose

247
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,920
the unskillful repeatedly repeatedly

248
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,560
and so this effort factor of awakening

249
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,000
uh is um is certainly the individual

250
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,560
practices and choices we make along this

251
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,760
line

252
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,160
but it's more of a state or a

253
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,040
generalized

254
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,200
attitude or orientation for how we live

255
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,120
where we're just naturally oriented

256
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,399
towards the skillful

257
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,040
naturally oriented towards these choices

258
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,959
which lead to our betterment to

259
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:55,360
ease to peace to ongoing well-being

260
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,079
and there's a kind of a momentum in that

261
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,600
direction there's a kind of a strength

262
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,959
to that

263
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,160
that follows in the wake of the second

264
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,480
factor of awakening becoming strong

265
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,560
this really seeing clearly so first

266
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:10,079
there's mindfulness that

267
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:13,200
places us in the present moment then

268
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,560
there's

269
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,880
investigation in a sense or exploration

270
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,399
or discovery

271
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,800
that helps us to see all the choices we

272
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,440
have

273
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,160
in the moment when we when you see the

274
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,760
red light green light or the red light

275
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,000
ahead as you drive

276
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,720
you see oh there's a choice here and

277
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,079
then there's the

278
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,800
effort factor of awakening which no

279
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,079
something inside of you

280
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:37,839
with time almost doesn't have to be a

281
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:40,399
lot of reflection and planning

282
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,279
and calculating and bringing up the

283
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:44,640
calculus of stress

284
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,839
and freedom but it's uh

285
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,880
just it just feels like oh that's the

286
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,639
natural thing to do that's the

287
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:54,639
easeful way that's where the doors are

288
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,680
open

289
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,959
that's where the freedom is found

290
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,600
of course we choose that and so the

291
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,360
choice becomes more and more effortless

292
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,480
more and more

293
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,000
delight and joyful and and

294
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,680
my hope for all of you is that

295
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:16,959
if you do this a day will come

296
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,680
that the word effort just brings you a

297
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,760
big smile oh i am so lucky to be able to

298
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,800
make effort

299
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:29,920
wow this effort thing is fantastic

300
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,600
wouldn't that be great and along the way

301
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,800
what's happening is you're beginning

302
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,040
to manifest your freedom your ability to

303
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:42,560
be free

304
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,600
to simply choose to be mindful is an

305
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,680
expression of freedom

306
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,839
to choose to discover to look more

307
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,839
carefully to investigate

308
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,279
is an engagement of your freedom

309
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,399
to make your choice is an engagement

310
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:01,760
enactment of freedom

311
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,120
and and so uh

312
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,519
um and that's very different than being

313
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,079
the victim of our experience or being

314
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,560
under carry the burden of the weight of

315
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,120
the

316
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,240
world on our shoulders and everything so

317
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,000
hard and uphill

318
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,200
we're being impacted we're being piled

319
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:23,680
up

320
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:26,480
piles and piles of responsibility where

321
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,760
there's no freedom but

322
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,800
to choose freedom over and over again is

323
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,519
not a second nature for many people

324
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,360
but this is what we're working with and

325
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,839
what how we're setting ourselves free

326
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,480
in the big sense as well by all these

327
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,199
small

328
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,720
movements of manifesting our freedom

329
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,079
in mindfulness investigation and choices

330
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:50,320
we make

331
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,839
so thank you and

332
00:13:53,839 --> 00:14:02,480
i look forward to continuing this series
