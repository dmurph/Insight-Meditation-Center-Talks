1
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:08,960
so i'd like to make a couple of

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,719
announcements before giving the talk

3
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,520
i mentioned some time ago that uh i'd

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,439
like to offer you

5
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,560
a chance to have some longer meditations

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,800
in the morning like we're doing here

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,480
we've been doing this for a long time

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,599
and

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,080
some of us together and some of you are

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,840
ready for sitting for more than 30

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,600
minutes

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,480
some of you are yeah you're ready and

13
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,200
it'll be actually

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,239
helpful to have a little longer sit and

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:42,480
also for this topic of vanapanasati

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,039
i think that mindfulness of breathing

17
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:45,840
having a little more

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,680
more practice with it and a little

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,559
longer sitting would be good as well

20
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,960
and so what i like to do is in two weeks

21
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,079
i think i believe it's the 15th

22
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,120
of february on the 14th i begin a

23
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,399
retreat

24
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,240
and and so i'd like to

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,920
integrate the morning sitting with the

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,000
retreat and the retreat with the morning

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,040
sitting and have our sitting start at

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,159
6 45 california time so 15 minutes

29
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:18,960
earlier than

30
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,520
we usually do so we can have 45 minutes

31
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,960
together and

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,640
and and i still still do the guided part

33
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,040
but

34
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,640
there'll be more time for silence we're

35
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,320
settling in

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,000
and i think this will also be very good

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,640
because of the topics we're coming to

38
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,000
um the uh by then i think we'll be

39
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,520
uh maybe at steps um

40
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,360
nine and ten which has to do with um

41
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,399
uh aspects of really really experiencing

42
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,280
the mind

43
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,399
the cheetah and um

44
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,240
so anyway so that's coming up and you

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,159
can certainly join us at seven there's

46
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,000
no problem with that i think

47
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,640
um but um if that's what your schedule

48
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,240
allows but

49
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,600
that's the plan we'll do that for one

50
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,280
week and

51
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,360
um and so i'll announce that a few times

52
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,720
or so make sure people

53
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,599
know about the change and the other is

54
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:15,040
that

55
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,280
the retreat that i'm doing at that time

56
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,280
and the following retreat at insight

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,840
retreat center

58
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:25,360
um the um we've kind of arranged to have

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,319
uh it's full the retreats but for but we

60
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,840
have arranging to have

61
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,480
spots for auditors and if some of you

62
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,080
would like to participate in a retreat

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,360
and happy especially if you've been on a

64
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,160
retreat before

65
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,480
and know the you know the basic routine

66
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,400
of how to practice that way

67
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,000
you're welcome to sign up to be an

68
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,599
auditor and

69
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,640
and uh in doing so you might um we have

70
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,400
auditor teachers we have a teacher

71
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,599
for it that is available to have uh

72
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,760
drop-in group discussions with it with

73
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,120
the um

74
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,480
the auditor so they feel a little bit

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,040
supported and um but that auditor

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,480
teacher won't give any teachings they'll

77
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,519
just be there to support the auditors

78
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,760
um

79
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,159
so anyway so some of you might want to

80
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,800
do that and participate and i think that

81
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,200
the

82
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,200
theme for that retweet starting on the

83
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,560
14th of february

84
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,120
is refuge and so we'll go through the

85
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,480
idea of refuge

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,599
as a as a wonderful topic itself but

87
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,239
also as a

88
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,440
support for the deepening practice of

89
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:33,840
meditation on retreat

90
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,720
so

91
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,400
so last week for anapanasati

92
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,000
talked about the steps

93
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,319
five and six five is

94
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,360
breathing in experiencing joy breathing

95
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:57,680
out

96
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,760
experiencing joy and then

97
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,080
six is breathing in breathing in

98
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,439
experiencing happiness

99
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,560
breathing out experiencing happiness

100
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,159
and the movement from joy to happiness

101
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,200
is a move towards tranquility

102
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,840
the mind the body becoming more tranquil

103
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,359
where the joy factor

104
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,320
is a little more energetic and the and

105
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,360
the happiness

106
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,479
quality is more subtle more peaceful

107
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,680
tranquil kind of sense of well-being

108
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,840
and that movement from something that's

109
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,120
a little more energetic

110
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,560
to this more tranquil is characterizes

111
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,080
the whole process of deepening

112
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,840
meditation and buddhism

113
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,000
that we're going from coarser states to

114
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,960
more refined subtler states of being

115
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,880
we're going for more active ways of

116
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,639
engaging and as the mind settles down

117
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:54,000
we're moving towards a clarity and an

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,120
alertness and a

119
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,919
peacefulness that where there's things

120
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:00,240
become

121
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,160
the mind becomes less active more

122
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,080
peaceful more softer

123
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,160
and so the quieting of the mind the

124
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,160
requiring the activity

125
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,560
settling and settling is kind of the

126
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,639
movement we're going here

127
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:14,320
and um and that's kind of like so the

128
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,080
principle of going from coarse to

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,520
refined or

130
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,280
more active to more tranquil states

131
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:22,880
and tranquil doesn't mean that we go

132
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,400
sleep or that we

133
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,720
become dull the movement is to a

134
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,320
tranquility that's quite

135
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,520
alert or has a lot of clarity to it

136
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:34,160
um but there's less activity and it's

137
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,320
fascinating process to

138
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,919
see this and one of the things we start

139
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,600
seeing is this relationship between the

140
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
mind and the body

141
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,280
and um and

142
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,000
so the first tetrad steps one to four

143
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,680
are kind of about the body and

144
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,840
and but it's not the physical body in

145
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,280
and of itself

146
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,080
it's more the body that um that we

147
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,560
experience

148
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,680
with experience is very much

149
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,600
influenced by what's going on in the

150
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,880
mind

151
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,120
and there's a reciprocal relationship

152
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,240
that as

153
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,520
the mind as the body settles down we get

154
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,440
more focus on the body and it relaxes

155
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,240
more

156
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,800
the fourth step is to relax the body

157
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,000
that also has a

158
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,960
relaxing effect on the mind and other

159
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,639
effects beneficial effects in the minds

160
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,560
it's reassuring for the mind it

161
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,560
brings a sense of safety to the mind

162
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,800
peacefulness to the mind

163
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,039
subtleness and focus to the mind it's

164
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,680
easier to be in the present moment

165
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,160
and and then we go into the second

166
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,360
tetrads now with

167
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,240
steps six seven eight uh five six seven

168
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,240
and eight

169
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,800
that um now we're beginning to enter

170
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,880
into the world of the mind

171
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:54,080
uh that is not separated from the body

172
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,120
these two are

173
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,599
inter interlinked but we're moving into

174
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,120
the area of the mind

175
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,680
and the qualities of joy and happiness

176
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,919
are a bridge between this

177
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,479
because the joy and happiness is felt in

178
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,800
an embodied way

179
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,599
and and but it's very much influenced by

180
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:14,000
the concentration level of the mind

181
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,919
the focus of the mind the peacefulness

182
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,280
of the mind

183
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,039
and um and then there's a reciprocal

184
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,639
relationship as there's more joy and

185
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,680
happiness that

186
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,080
courses through the body then that

187
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,479
reassures the mind more and allah and

188
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,520
and reassure a reassured mind will feel

189
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,039
like it doesn't need to think so much

190
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,840
and ruminate so much and can get quieter

191
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,319
so kind of this bridge with joy and

192
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:39,520
happiness between the

193
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,160
kind of the body and the mind is really

194
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,000
worth lingering with and developing

195
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,960
and and uh and i know it's a little hard

196
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:47,360
for

197
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,400
from oftentimes to feel joy and

198
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,960
happiness and short notice and just will

199
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,520
it up

200
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,599
like that but even if it you don't feel

201
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,520
this during this time when this section

202
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,560
of the

203
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,680
of the practice um is maybe just

204
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:06,000
imagine it or not imagine you're having

205
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,720
it but

206
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,599
but uh develop a kind of a intuitive

207
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,000
sense of it or learn these teachings and

208
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,440
sooner and later hopefully you'll

209
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,120
recognize a little bit this

210
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,919
meditative embodied joy happiness

211
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,759
well-being that can happen as we

212
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,400
as we practice and some people are

213
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,440
surprised

214
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,520
or delighted that they're given

215
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,199
permission to feel pleasure in

216
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:27,919
meditation

217
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,680
permission to feel joy and happiness

218
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,279
and and definitely this is really the

219
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,959
considered to be very important

220
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,880
foundation for moving forward

221
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,680
in many many places in sutas the buddha

222
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,839
actually describes a process

223
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,040
of steepening practice that is called

224
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,360
the

225
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,399
gladness the gladness sequence

226
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,320
or the gladness pentad because those are

227
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,680
five steps

228
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:01,120
and these are acquiring gladness

229
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,760
in meditation and then it the

230
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,640
description is

231
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,040
is very um kind of intransitive or

232
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,080
passive it's like

233
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,040
from we're not doing the next steps they

234
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,240
just flow

235
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,680
as one becomes mature it flows into the

236
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,440
next flows into the next

237
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,000
we do our practice and the practice

238
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,040
begins practicing

239
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,959
us something begins shifting and

240
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,720
changing and we don't have to be so

241
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,880
responsible except to be really present

242
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,959
for the experience

243
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,320
so with the gladness there arises joy

244
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,800
with the joy when it's mature there

245
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:40,640
arises a tranquility of the body

246
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,880
with the tranquility of the body there

247
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,279
arises happiness

248
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,320
and with the arising of happiness uh

249
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,720
they're they're with the maturity of

250
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,839
happiness

251
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,600
there rises uh concentration unification

252
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,360
being really unified and sitting and

253
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,040
feeling very whole

254
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,200
here in the present moment and this

255
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,200
wonderful kind of pattern the gladness

256
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,240
sequence

257
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,040
gladness joy tranquility happiness and

258
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,399
concentration

259
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,920
samadhi now what's interesting and what

260
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,600
i want to emphasize today is

261
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,839
the the first step is feeling a sense of

262
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,200
gladness

263
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,360
and the gladness comes from being

264
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,000
inspired by something

265
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,160
and this the buddha really understands

266
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,480
the value of becoming inspired being

267
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,600
gladdened being

268
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,480
delighted by some aspects of what's

269
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,000
happening in our practice or in our

270
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,120
lives

271
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,519
so that it kind of that certain kind of

272
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:39,519
gladness that we don't get lost in our

273
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,519
thoughts and stories and imagining over

274
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:43,440
and over again what happened

275
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,640
but we use our imagination just enough

276
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,160
to have that gladness begin settling us

277
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,160
into the present moment more and more

278
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,200
settling us into them into the body

279
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,399
and this use of the imagination to help

280
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,279
us to not make us go wandering away

281
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,920
but using the imagination to allow us to

282
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,760
be inspired

283
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,399
is one of the supports for meditation

284
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,640
practice

285
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:14,399
and uh and how that inspiration can be

286
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,920
not forced not imaginary not

287
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,160
an avoidance of the present moment but

288
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,240
really a support for really connecting

289
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
in a deeper and deeper way

290
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,920
in an honest way with what's really

291
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,360
happening in our lives what's really

292
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,160
present

293
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:31,120
is one of the great benefits of dharma

294
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,160
practice

295
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,480
to be able to be present even for

296
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:36,000
difficult things

297
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,680
with some form of well-being

298
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,800
some form of may sometimes joy delight

299
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,839
gladness

300
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:47,360
that holds it all not to be removed from

301
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,519
the challenges and suffering of the life

302
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,399
of life

303
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,360
but to really in some sense be receptive

304
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,360
to it in a really deep way

305
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,519
and not be a victim of it not be

306
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,959
oppressed by it

307
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,440
but to have compassion and love as a

308
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,160
possible response

309
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,680
so what i'd like to do for the next

310
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,360
maybe a couple of days and we'll see how

311
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,720
far we go

312
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,480
is talk a little bit more about the

313
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,079
buddha's emphasis or use of imagination

314
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,720
focus on teachings on imagination both

315
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,399
as what gets in our way

316
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,200
for meditation interferes with it but

317
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:21,760
also

318
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,200
in ways in which it supports meditation

319
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,399
and and and

320
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,160
this seems like a very nice bridge

321
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,720
between the mind and the body

322
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,320
this part we're talking about joy and

323
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,160
happiness but because this imagination

324
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,000
is very much to do with this happiness

325
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,680
and joy qualities and um

326
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:45,519
and to how to uh evoke

327
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:48,480
joy and happiness gladness with uh what

328
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,839
inspires us through

329
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,800
by thinking about it or something so

330
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,920
that's a topic and

331
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,560
and uh and hopefully you'll get a sense

332
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,240
as we go through these teachings

333
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,519
that how it's useful and connecting you

334
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,040
to uh this steps five and six joy and

335
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,160
happiness

336
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,279
and creates a very good foundation

337
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:13,040
for the continued settling

338
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,519
becoming more tranquil the mind becoming

339
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,519
more peaceful

340
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,920
it's a preparation for that so we can

341
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,680
look and start looking more deeply at

342
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,120
the mind itself

343
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,079
and the and the quieting settling

344
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,120
pacifying

345
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,360
of the mind so that it becomes an

346
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,560
instrument of awakening

347
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,079
so um that's the introduction for

348
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:39,360
this week and i look forward to our time

349
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,040
tomorrow and

350
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,759
and um delighted to um

351
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,839
to share this time with you thank you
