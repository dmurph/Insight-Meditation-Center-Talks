00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,919
hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:17,920
i'll begin with a little story having to do with our theme for the week

3
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,000
something appears to our senses

4
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:31,920
we might see an object i might see the bell that's here

5
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:38,160
so i see the object and i feel the pleasantness of it

6
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,360
i feel the smoothness of it and the temperature of it is nice

7
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,320
and then i recognize it as something or cognize it i

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:02,000
in this case i recognize it as a bell in other circumstance i might recognize it as something else

9
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:08,000
and then once i have that bell

10
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,760
idea then i can begin creating a story

11
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,880
and the story is that this bell will sit next to me here

12
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,840
during the meditation and at the end of the sitting i'll ring the bell to mark the

13
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,400
end and that could be as simple as the story goes

14
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:35,439
or the story can go yes i'll

15
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:42,320
ring it at the end of the sitting and there's a lot of people listening and so i better ring it well

16
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:49,360
loud enough but not too loud with the night residence and to the story might end there

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,119
the story might continue if i don't ring it well people will not like me

18
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,600
if i don't ring the bell well my reputation will be sullied and then tomorrow i'm coming i'll be

19
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,000
quite self-conscious and it'll be difficult and and maybe i wonder if maybe i shouldn't even ring the bell maybe i should just

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:13,840
kind of announce the sitting's over and so the story begins spinning and going

21
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,080
but it all began with a very simple something appeared to the census seeing

22
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,720
of the bell it was pleasant in and of itself there was a recognition

23
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,840
not necessarily what it is but the recognition of what it is for me

24
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,720
here now it's a bell and then there's beginning to be stories

25
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,040
part of what we're doing in meditation is to stay simple with our experience

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,120
with the immediacy of what's happening now what's appearing now knowing whether it's pleasant or

27
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:57,599
unpleasant allowing yourself to have the simple recognition of what it is for us now

28
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:04,239
a recognition which is maybe empty of ultimate truth about the object just

29
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:12,800
this is how it's being seen now recognize now and then it once the stories begin

30
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:20,159
we come back to the breathing we come back to the simplicity of this moment maybe by first recognizing that i'm

31
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,519
beginning to construct and make stories beginning to elaborate

32
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,040
on on the simplicity of it all many people live in the elaboration they

33
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,159
live in their stories that's where the center of gravity is in meditation the center of gravity is

34
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,920
in this earlier steps in the process the appearance the feeling tones the simple recognition

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,120
of the experience and and it means that this

36
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,319
we don't need to get involved in complicated stories that involve judging or commentary or

37
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:02,159
predictions memories uh the things the mind becomes

38
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,760
simpler and easier when it's in meditation when it starts going at earlier steps in that process

39
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,599
earlier and step from the process doesn't mean that it's i don't know more primitive or less

40
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:20,799
important it actually gives us a vantage point to understand how we're getting

41
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,400
caught and how to let go or how not to be caught and then not being caught can simply

42
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:32,960
becoming as simple as just coming back to the breathing or come back to the direct sensation of the moment

43
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,560
with no elaboration so

44
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,919
assuming a meditation posture

45
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,240
and gently closing your eyes

46
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,759
and as you are right now how does your physical experience appear

47
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,880
how does it occur how does it show up for you

48
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:11,160
in the simplest version of sensations of the body

49
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,840
and is it pleasant unpleasant or neither

50
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:37,440
do you have simple ideas recognitions concepts for what's happening in your

51
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,840
body

52
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:53,440
not so much big processes but simple ideas of what is appearing what

53
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,918
is the thing what is the experience in the simplicity of the moment

54
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,720
and do you have elaborations do you have stories interpretations concerns

55
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,639
sentences that you tell yourself about what's happening in your body

56
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,840
bigger perspectives the meaning of it

57
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,800
that it's good or bad or right or wrong or

58
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,000
it could be better or worse

59
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,080
and if you take those and begin to elaborate that elaboration is going to continue and spiral out to more and more

60
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:48,199
complicated stories and we can sometimes live in the constructed stories

61
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,759
and so settling into your breathing

62
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:12,000
as you inhale feeling your body directly and simply

63
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,198
as you exhale relax the body

64
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,639
as you exhale relax into the contact of your body bottom to the

65
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,720
chair your cushion your bed

66
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,960
the floor

67
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:05,440
relaxing the belly softening in the belly

68
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:13,720
yielding to the pull of gravity

69
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,879
in the belly

70
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:36,039
softening in the shoulders relaxing the shoulders

71
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,040
relaxing in the face

72
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:19,920
and then relaxing the thinking mind relaxing the pressure and tension

73
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:27,199
of the thinking that makes the elaborated stories that constructs ideas and

74
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:37,839
predicts futures or remembers the past or makes meaning out of things

75
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:44,120
relax the thinking mind

76
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:02,480
and then settle into the rhythm of breathing

77
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:08,480
the bodies experience of breathing and see if you can

78
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:16,640
gently maybe lovingly and kindly stay with your breathing

79
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,399
as if your awareness your attention

80
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,279
is going hand in hand with the body's experience of breathing

81
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,880
awareness accompanies breathing and breathing a company's awareness

82
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:53,279
and if you get pulled into the world of thoughts ideas elaborations

83
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,600
recognize it as constructions

84
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:07,440
constructing stories constructing meaning

85
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,760
constructions and then begin again with your breathing

86
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:08,640
are you more connected to your stories and constructions

87
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:15,159
or more connected to the direct experience of breathing

88
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:27,280
if you're involved in the world of stories and collaborations

89
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:33,520
memories and future imagine

90
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:37,840
that all that are like clouds

91
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,440
and that you allow yourself to drop through the clouds and land back on the ground

92
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:54,440
of the body breathing here is a place to be grounded

93
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:36,840
one of the pleasures of meditation is being

94
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:43,519
content to rest in the direct experience of the body breathing

95
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,679
we arrest in the direct experience of what arises in awareness

96
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:58,000
either case do not be pulled into the world of stories and constructions

97
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:04,880
even though some can be pleasant wonderful some can be difficult

98
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:11,679
something profound about connecting to this lived life of ours

99
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:19,120
without the stories and there's something profound

100
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,799
about the safety and the directness and the simplicity

101
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,760
that can then also occur in how we are present for other people

102
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:40,720
we're present not through the filter of the stories the meanings the history

103
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:51,200
the projected future we're able to put that aside

104
00:27:52,399 --> 00:28:00,799
to be present for the directness of seeing another human being and

105
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,520
letting them feel the safety the contentment

106
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:16,440
the ease of just being present with each other in the simplicity of the moment

107
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:24,720
and may it be that what we learn about being content to be

108
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:31,320
in the present moment unburdened by our stories

109
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,440
may it be a vehicle for supporting the happiness and safety and

110
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,200
peace freedom of others as it is

111
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,120
supporting our own happiness

112
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,080
safety peace and freedom

113
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:03,760
may this practice that we do express itself in this world

114
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,919
bringing happiness to all beings

115
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,278
bringing safety to all beings

116
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:20,880
bringing peacefulness to all beings

117
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:30,320
bringing freedom to all beings may we do this practice

118
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:38,840
for the welfare and happiness of all beings everywhere yourself included

119
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:56,050
[Music]

120
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,398
thank you

121
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,679
so we're talking about this important

122
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,120
uh topic which appears importantly in the teachings of the buddha prepares all appears often

123
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:26,159
sometimes it is presented in ways that it's hard for modern people to identify with or

124
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:32,320
appreciate but i think that this teachings on the five aggregates

125
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:39,039
the five groupings or the five divisions of our human experience

126
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:46,559
it might be easier to appreciate through presenting them as a story

127
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:54,000
and which is a little bit paradoxical since part of the purpose of of this teaching is to help us

128
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,679
kind of come to the end of stories or appreciate it's a different way of being

129
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:05,159
and the

130
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,360
um so that it begins these five aggregates

131
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:19,360
five groupings with uh with uh the direct experiences of things there's a sensory experience

132
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,919
and the poly word can mean appearance appearances

133
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:31,600
but it's just like in english the word appearance means what comes into view

134
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:36,880
but it also can be extended to be any sensation that comes into

135
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:43,200
experience with anything anything we sense and so it's kind of the raw sense data

136
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:49,600
from which we build our world from their understanding of the world and um

137
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,559
and then when there's a in the buddhist psychology and then the understanding is once a sensation has come since data has

138
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:02,720
come the first uh detail of that that becomes then

139
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:08,240
apparent is the pleasant unpleasant or neither pleasant or unpleasant of it

140
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,960
there's some idea that this kind of amoeba-like being you know for against or pleasant unpleasant is very basic

141
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:20,000
and occurs almost immediately after just taking in a sensation

142
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:25,039
before we necessarily necessarily even recognize what it is

143
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:32,320
and then but so then and we often react to the pleasant unpleasant toy

144
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:39,600
it might be that the recognition knows this is terrible this is uncomfortable or this is wonderful and that's a simple

145
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:46,000
act of recognition the third step but it could be recognizing what the object is

146
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:55,120
you know like i was talking earlier about the meditation bell we have here so it i see it it's a pleasant sight

147
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,600
i and i recognize it as a bell but we have to really appreciate that the recognition

148
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,640
is not that uh doesn't live in the object

149
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:11,919
the recognition is a often a construct a very simple

150
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,760
application or projection onto the thing in this case by its function

151
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,240
it's operating as a bell so we call it a bell

152
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:29,279
the uh many years ago in san francisco i saw someone who was um

153
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,360
a homeless person who was kind of asking for money but he had a beautiful

154
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:41,760
japanese bell surprised how beautiful it was kind of like this one here that i have and he's

155
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,480
going around and asking for donations and i said oh it's now the bell is a begging ball

156
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,440
and um so um the um

157
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:04,080
so the recognition so those are the first three of the aggregates the appearance of sensations

158
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,440
experiencing it either pleasant unpleasant or not neutral and building on that

159
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:17,280
uh there's the wrecking a recognition and the recognition is usually just one word you know just a simple label idea

160
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,839
of what it is concept and then once we have a simple concept then

161
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:30,158
there's an elaboration that goes on and that elaboration can be a story or

162
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,320
some construct that's that's more than just the object itself that we're recognizing

163
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,638
and so i see the bell here and i recognize it as being imc's bell

164
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:48,000
and i remember the person who gave it to us many years ago and that where the person gave it to us

165
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:54,638
or what inspired the person to give to us remember the person's name and uh my appreciation for that person

166
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:59,920
and wondering what's happened to that person and and um feeling this warmth for this

167
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:06,000
person as i think this spell think about the spell and so there's all this construction

168
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:12,320
this elaboration this uh that it rises in the wake of having recognized this is a bell

169
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,480
and that's innocent enough it kind of adds to the richness of life to have stories and histories and things like

170
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:24,400
that but it also is a place where life can get unnecessarily complicated

171
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,680
and a lot of human suffering gets born in this elaborations that happen the

172
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:37,760
constructions that happen after um the uh the basic recognition

173
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:45,280
once there's all these things together there's the appearance the pleasant unpleasant the recognition and

174
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:52,000
the constructions of stories and ideas around it and then there is the

175
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,680
fifth aggregate which we'll talk about tomorrow which usually in english is called consciousness

176
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:03,280
and in the way the story i'm talking about consciousness is not

177
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:09,440
prior to all the rest of it it's actually arises in the wake of all

178
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:14,720
of this so we'll talk about that tomorrow but so for today

179
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:20,720
it's so the fourth aggregate the fourth grouping which is usually

180
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:29,960
translated into english as mental formations the holy word sankara s-a-n-k-a-r-a

181
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:38,880
the sun means like with and kara is like related to karma to make or to do

182
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:46,480
and so to form something so that's why people say formations i like the word constructions

183
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:53,119
it doesn't say mental in it but that's by implication it has to do with the mind the mental constructions the mental

184
00:36:53,119 --> 00:37:00,480
elaborations that go on in the mind the stories and um and how we build

185
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:06,880
our or the world we kind of live in some of it's built collectively and some

186
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:12,480
of it is built by our own projections onto people and things and ideas

187
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:19,280
and this world of constructions has has some to do with our inclinations our

188
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:26,160
bias our our preferences our motivations our presence of purpose

189
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:31,599
our fears as it's a kind of it's a huge uh world

190
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:38,400
uh that um just that is this part of the mental landscape that we

191
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:43,599
live in often we don't recognize it as such and we not only do we think that the

192
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:49,440
recognition the object we recognize the third aggregate is really what that's what it is and

193
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:55,440
we're attached to the idea we have of it i can attach to this being a bell

194
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:00,480
here at imc if someone wanted to use it as a

195
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,520
trash can i'd feel a little bit like what i'm not so sure about that

196
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:10,560
i kind of like to keep it as a bell and keep it clean and things like that

197
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:16,960
um because that but uh and then there's stories around it

198
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,400
constructs around it you know imc bell keeping it clean what it means for a meditation center to have

199
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,000
a clean bell and and some of that's normal but some of it can be

200
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,280
that's the world not only of constructs but that's also the world of constructions

201
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,800
now of of of clinging

202
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:44,240
now what's fascinating around these teachings of the buddha

203
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:50,400
is that this constructing aspect of the mind is

204
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,400
what constructs the other groupings that the appearance of things

205
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,839
is partly born not innocently because something comes

206
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:06,960
partly because we have an apparatus that selects that out of the environment

207
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:14,079
uh of all the things we could pay attention to where there's a selective process that this is important

208
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,520
and we're selecting this or we're selecting the feelings

209
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,280
feeling tones we're selecting the ideas the recognition more often we're selecting the

210
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,320
constructions themselves but for the buddha each of the five aggregates

211
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,359
is a construct made by the constructing activity of the mind

212
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:42,800
and and so many times people in the west will said the teachers will say that the

213
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:48,960
buddha said there's no self what there is are these five aggregates these five heaps and the buddha didn't actually

214
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:55,280
didn't say that he actually saw the five heaps more as the problem

215
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:01,359
and there he called them actually all five of them a burden and how i understand that is that the

216
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:08,400
constructing activity of the mind selects out of the suchness of experience the simplicity of the

217
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,839
experience certain things to prioritize and uh

218
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:19,920
and it's kind of in some ways necessary to do it but there's a kind of extra

219
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,400
extraness in it that comes with it that creates a lot of clinging a lot of suffering a lot of

220
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:33,040
burden in this world that's very different if we rest in the suchness of things we

221
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:39,760
allow things to be as they are almost as if we don't need to get involved

222
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:46,560
in the appearance or the feelings or the ideas or the stories around it

223
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,960
we're just very we're there in a very very simple way so um

224
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,400
so these five there's a story then going you can say like i did appearance

225
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:04,480
feeling tones simple recognition elaboration and stories

226
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,319
what's interesting for mindfulness practitioners is it's possible to go backwards

227
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:16,319
to recognize that we're involved in storytelling and the elaborations of the mind

228
00:41:16,319 --> 00:41:21,680
and then be curious with with can i just recognize that that's

229
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:28,160
happening in this simple possible recognition thinking story making

230
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,400
and then step back further uh is that pleasant or unpleasant to be thinking and

231
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,400
telling these stories and then we take one step back and what are the actual sensations that come

232
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,560
along with it maybe there's pressure a tightness maybe there's some kind of pleasantness and

233
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:53,599
warmth and thinking about it and what we're doing is we're going back to the what's primary or foundational to

234
00:41:53,599 --> 00:42:00,000
get grounded there so it's taking a stand on the simplicity of the experience we're less likely to

235
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:06,000
be swept away in the in the um

236
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:13,200
you know in the currents of of these elaborate thinking so sometimes we can watch from

237
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:20,800
appearances as things get more complicated into stories and sometimes we can trace it backwards

238
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:27,520
into the basic simple sensations that are there and uh and that's fascinating to kind of

239
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:34,000
be able to go play the scales mindfulness scales back and forth up this and find in doing that

240
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:41,119
that you start appreciating that the each of these five these four so far are experiences that

241
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:47,359
have a genesis they arise they appear and they disappear they come and they go

242
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:53,839
they appear and they cease and and so it's possible to begin in

243
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:59,839
being in the flow the current of these things which is much closer to the suchness of

244
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:05,760
them than it is to select them out and hold on to anyone

245
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:13,599
out of the general flow of the river so i hope that made sense and

246
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:19,520
then tomorrow's topic the last aggregate um i think is

247
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:26,240
very interesting for many people um when we call it consciousness so we'll take a look at what this is for

248
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:34,280
the buddha so thank you and i look forward tomorrow
