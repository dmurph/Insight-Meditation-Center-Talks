nolitha is a student of kitasaro and tanisara who are students of ajahn chau

9
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:58,800
growing up in a culture underpinned by the principle of ubuntu which means i am

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,400
because we are and where the power of generosity is

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,680
greatly appreciated and being introduced to buddhism and living in a place where there aren't

12
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:16,479
many buddhists felt like coming home for her nolitha is also a single parent to a 23 year old

13
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,600
son in a culture where villages help to raise their children

14
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,840
so thank you very much for joining us molita

15
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:40,400
thank you kevin i'm delighted to be here

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:48,078
the theme i've chosen for reflection is generosity

17
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,920
so under the theme of generosity i'm going to talk about giving

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:03,680
sharing a key practice and buddhism

19
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:10,720
in all buddhist traditions called donna that's the pali word

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:17,360
for giving i'll also talk about training in

21
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:25,680
ethics buddha referred to training in precepts as the great

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,800
donor it's another form of giving

23
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,840
i'll also speak about relinquishment

24
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:45,760
letting go kali word for relinquishment is kaga

25
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:53,440
letting go is also a form of giving and lastly i will

26
00:02:53,440 --> 00:03:00,159
talk about forgiveness forgiveness is a form of giving

27
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:06,159
where we give each other fearlessness

28
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,360
when we forgive

29
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:21,360
so the cultivation of generosity is really the foundation

30
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,000
for training of the mind

31
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:35,760
it is the foundation for mindfulness and wisdom for liberation

32
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:47,840
so i noticed the words i'm using

33
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:56,480
giving and sharing precepts relinquishment forgiveness

34
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:05,040
these words can bring up interesting experiences in the heart

35
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:14,720
can bring up discomfort i know for a

36
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,720
long time for me the words precepts and relinquishment

37
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,960
would bring a sense of terror to my heart

38
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:35,120
i don't know how it is like for you these words maybe you're well ahead in

39
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,919
this path these words bring joy to your heart

40
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:47,680
that's what they are aimed for actually to bring joy

41
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:58,560
so i'm going to start off with a story that for me highlights the beauty and

42
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,680
the grace of generosity

43
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:13,039
a friend of mine i teach with here in south africa moira shares a story about being in zambia

44
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:22,000
zambia in south africa share border so she says here she is in some village

45
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,759
in zambia driving on a dutch road

46
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,039
the car starts to give her problems

47
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,800
she drives on and suddenly notices that there's this homestead near the

48
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,560
roadside and there are scrap

49
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,039
cars old cars in the yard and she decides to stop here thinking

50
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:02,319
this would be the kind of place that can give her help in fixing her car

51
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:10,800
at the homestead she's welcomed by an old man

52
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,840
she notices children playing in the sand

53
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:25,120
and also notices signs of great poverty in this household

54
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:34,479
she mentions seeing a few chickens without any feathers so

55
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:41,600
she explains hannah hanid and um the old man organizes all the boys

56
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:48,160
they look at the car kai is fixed and then about to leave moira offers

57
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,840
this old man some money he says no

58
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:02,720
he then offers some fruits in the car he says no and she says but it's for the

59
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:09,360
children he says no and then he says

60
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,080
if we can't help each other that would be really sad if we just cannot

61
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:19,039
just give how

62
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:30,080
for moira this was a new experience

63
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,440
and receiving this experience foreign is white person old man is black

64
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:43,680
and i'm mentioning the race here because i'm joining you from south africa

65
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:50,638
and uh issues of race uh are still a big issue

66
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:59,599
moira shares that from this experience she felt deeply connected

67
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:06,240
and she also mentions that she felt like she didn't deserve that connection

68
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:15,759
so acts of generosity allows for these benevolent connections

69
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,560
with each other

70
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,840
hmm

71
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:38,240
generosity acts of kindness giving sharing this is what the buddha

72
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,279
has to say about sharing

73
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:48,800
if beings knew as i know the results of giving and sharing

74
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:55,519
they would not eat without having given nor would the stain of selfishness

75
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:02,560
overcome their minds even if it were their lust bites

76
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:09,600
their last mouth full they would not eat without having shared

77
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,959
if there was someone to receive their gift

78
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:30,399
so when growing up practice of generosity was truly a way of life

79
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:37,040
i remember that growing up in a more rural countryside part of

80
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,160
south africa always there would be an extra plate of

81
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,839
food set aside in case there's a visitor

82
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:59,440
or someone passing by who can be offered a meal

83
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:08,160
i also remember that there was no time that we ever were a nuclear family

84
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:14,800
only our home was always a home to many cousins aunts

85
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:20,320
uncles sometimes i didn't i wouldn't even know how we are related to that

86
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,519
person who was there to share our home for as much time as she needed or he

87
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,720
needed to be there

88
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:37,760
my parents were doing what their own parents did so i don't know a lot about this kind of

89
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,959
giving i must admit though moving to the city

90
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:50,240
getting ebonized plus less and less of this kind of generosity

91
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,200
so i know generosity personally but i also know generosity

92
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,399
at a country level

93
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:14,320
the world often wonders how did south africa manage a bloodless transition

94
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:22,240
from apartheid south africa to a black led government

95
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,519
many think it was because of nelson mandela

96
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,880
rightly so he did play a critical role

97
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:43,839
in um what the world thought of as the miracle

98
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:51,920
a miracle that gave hope to the whole world

99
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,600
to us it wasn't a miracle to what to us it was this was

100
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,240
so because the african culture is underpinned by the principle

101
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:11,839
of ubuntu i am because we are

102
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,720
if i cause you harm i'm causing harm to

103
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,079
myself steve biko was the leader was the leader

104
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:35,200
of black consciousness movement a hero a struggle hero who died in the

105
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,839
hands of apartheid south africa

106
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:48,000
is speaking to this principle when he says our contribution to the world would not

107
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,639
be in technology our contribution in africa to the world

108
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,000
will be to give the world a humane face

109
00:13:03,519 --> 00:13:07,839
the face of humanness

110
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:20,160
so to be fully human is about being generous giving sharing and forgiving

111
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:27,120
so in the country i also noticed that we're really great at coming together at times of crisis

112
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:35,839
and this has been the case during this crisis of covet 19.

113
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:47,519
i have a few stories to share with you about these acts of kindness shown

114
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,600
by people not only here but really everywhere this is what people have done

115
00:13:53,600 --> 00:14:00,839
they've remembered what it is to be fully human by giving support in any way that they

116
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:06,000
can we know medical care and related

117
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:14,320
professions would even risk their lives to save lives so i have a friend who's

118
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:19,839
an academic so she had a task of collating these

119
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,880
stories local stories of kindness during this period of covet and

120
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:34,399
she's actually in the process of compiling a book titled archives of kindness so i am going to

121
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:43,120
read to you two of these stories actually what she did was to ask a number of us to

122
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:50,320
choose your five top stories so this is this is the two of the five

123
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,000
that i'm going to read to you

124
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:02,480
candace in cape town in french mooc rights

125
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:09,440
i've been living in friendship now for 12 years we are a small village but as with most

126
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:14,959
places in south africa we have a polarized society

127
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:20,720
of the wealthy and the poor some of whom live in the township

128
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,000
setting for a small village we also have a hugely

129
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,160
successful and vibrant hospitality sector which means we have many hardworking

130
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:37,600
people in all levels of an industry that with some of the hardest hits

131
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,800
during this lockdown over the years i've been amazed at how many people have done

132
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:50,240
extraordinary things in their private capacity because it's the right thing to do like

133
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:55,279
building schools and sports centers for poorer communities

134
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:02,240
but during this crisis we reached a whole new level so many people contributed and did

135
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:09,680
awesome things coordinating relief turning restaurants into food kitchens checking it out that

136
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:16,000
everyone was okay in all different parts of the town

137
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:24,959
a lady from the township dip club here in johannesburg right

138
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:32,160
my lane lady is an angel she has given us a free stay for two months all

139
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,600
five of her tenants she's unemployed and depends on her rant

140
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,759
but she's seen how we're all struggling in the yard she says we will share

141
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:50,000
whatever food we find she is now trying to find someone to donate nepalese for my son

142
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:56,000
i'm embarrassed she's an old lady during this time she has the strength

143
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,199
i'm lacking she is my hero and a mom to all of us

144
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:07,438
may god give me strength to pay it forward one day these are joyful stories

145
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,160
this is what happens to the heart when there is generosity

146
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:21,839
so the buddha in teaching when teaching to new people to the

147
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:30,880
practices he would always or mostly start off by teaching about generosity

148
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:37,360
he would then proceed and teach about precepts

149
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:47,200
only then when he has the sense that these teachings of generosity and training in ethics

150
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:53,840
have landed will he then introduce meditation

151
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,760
ajahn chah and shah teacher of my teachers the thai forest

152
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:09,760
master when this theme says with virtue as a basis for everything you do your mind

153
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:14,880
will become kind clear and quiet meditation will

154
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,400
grow easily in this environment

155
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:30,400
so through the practice of generosity virtue we can recover the connection with ourselves with each other

156
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,720
and with mother nature through generosity we recover the

157
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:44,720
heart's potential for sensitivity

158
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:49,760
the parts potential for opening

159
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,400
lava mendez who lives in zimbabwe also zimbabwe shares a border with south

160
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:05,679
africa baba is known as an international

161
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:11,600
peacemaker he is a guardian to our center here

162
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:16,720
founded by kitsaran tamizara zamagiri

163
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,120
when they speak about baba kittisara and tenisera talk of him as a contemporary of agent

164
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:31,760
chair baba says

165
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,240
we have been disconnected to ourselves disconnected from each other because we

166
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,160
are disconnected from nature

167
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,840
and because we are disconnected from nature

168
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,440
we take whatever

169
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,320
we want from nature without giving back

170
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,520
as the world we are in an ecological crisis because we do not see ourselves as part

171
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:14,320
of nature we abuse nature for our greed

172
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,759
and our great is endless

173
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:28,320
through this we lose this heart sensitivity the intuitive intelligence

174
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:36,159
it is said that we are the only species that destroys its own habitat

175
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:49,840
with lost connection with the goodness of the heart

176
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:55,600
and i think we're paying a price for this

177
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:07,200
disconnected from each other disconnects it from ourselves we feel separate

178
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:15,360
we create us and them [Music] in mutton bubba's language

179
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:22,320
we create i it relationships it is through the cultivation of these

180
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:30,799
practices of generosity that we can recover what

181
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:39,440
matin bubba calls the i and thou relationship the i and we

182
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:47,919
relationship with the we identity we can remember the

183
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:53,280
truth that we all suffer and we all want happiness

184
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:59,840
our sense of conscience and concern can be reawakened

185
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:18,320
i'm going to talk about generosity as relinquishment

186
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:27,840
relinquishment is a form of letting go in letting go

187
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:38,159
we let go of greed craving which the buddha

188
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:46,000
has identified as the cause of our suffering the second noble truth that we suffer

189
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:55,840
because of craving and the task in this path of freedom for liberation

190
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:03,679
is to let go of the craving as practices of giving

191
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:22,400
can support us help us to let go

192
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:28,640
craving has no end it feeds itself

193
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:35,280
it is true understanding it is through these practices

194
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,240
that we can release craving

195
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:48,080
what underpins cravings ignorance confusion

196
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:57,440
see how we can look for what is this heart's longing in wrong places

197
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:06,080
when we follow sense objects to satisfy our craving that has no

198
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:15,760
end desire feeds itself will look for fulfillment

199
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,120
and sense experience since experience changes

200
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:25,520
what is pleasant becomes unpleasant

201
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:36,159
there's a story i delight at in buddhism about this

202
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:41,679
confusion of looking for fulfillment in the wrong places

203
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:48,400
it's the story of nasruddin nasruddin is a sufi mystic

204
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:56,960
he's sitting outside in a ruby and spice shop and he's eating these hot chilies

205
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:06,320
his eyes a watering a friend comes by and says what are you doing

206
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:15,120
eating these hotels with your eyes watering and you're sweating

207
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,240
astradin says i'm looking for the sweet one

208
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,760
this is what we do you and i right

209
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:32,720
we look for the freedom which is the longing of the heart

210
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:43,760
heart lungs

211
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:57,840
freedom freedom from creates hatred and delusion

212
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:04,559
lastly i'm going to talk about

213
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:11,279
forgiveness as a form of giving

214
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:18,000
how is forgiveness a form of giving when we forgive we

215
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:24,720
give fearlessness

216
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:34,559
when people know that we hold no grudges we hold no ill will when we have been

217
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:41,760
the victims it gives relief it gives happiness

218
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:55,039
i know personally about this kind of relief that comes from

219
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:03,120
one who i have harmed holds no ill will

220
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,840
towards him

221
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,000
i can't remember what year it was but it was the year that uh nelson mandela died i'm not sure

222
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,840
whether that was 2011.

223
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:34,559
i leave home and i notice the feeling of anxiety

224
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:40,720
and between leaving home and um

225
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:47,520
maybe it kind of mean even 10 minutes after i left home

226
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:54,159
my phone rings i'm driving and i answered the phone within no time

227
00:27:54,159 --> 00:28:00,080
between that moment of answering the phone whilst driving

228
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,398
i drove into a biker

229
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:13,039
get out of the car in shock

230
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,720
and this man is on the floor

231
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,200
he's on the ground

232
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:31,840
i can tell he's in great pain

233
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:40,000
i go near him he is screaming at me

234
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:45,840
you wear it on your phone

235
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,640
and then in no time you know other people

236
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:59,039
who stopped to check what was going on

237
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:05,360
and i remember just at one point i had a feeling that was running across

238
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:12,240
my heart of fear in that moment i was thinking oh this is

239
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:19,600
going to become ratio i look around people here

240
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,559
are black it's me and the security guard

241
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:33,919
i offer to take the man to the hospital he refuses he's still screaming at me

242
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:42,880
an older white couple decides to take him to the nearest hospital

243
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:47,200
i wait for the police

244
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:57,200
wait and wait then i'll be so i decide to go to the

245
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:02,640
hospital i get to casualty

246
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:08,640
he's with medical staff

247
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:16,640
i sit across him he's laying down on a bed i take a chain and sit right across him

248
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:23,760
when i maintain eye contact ignores me and then at some point he

249
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:30,240
says you don't need to be here you can go where you need to go

250
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:37,279
my response to him is i want to be here and i'm really

251
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:50,799
sorry um so i continue to just sit here

252
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:58,640
and then at some point i decide i have to go and report this to the police

253
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:05,840
as i'm about to leave he says to me tell them that you own a cell phone

254
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,720
i'm thinking oh interesting i go and report the case i come back to

255
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:19,840
the hospital and he has been discharged

256
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:31,919
and apparently he suffered really serious injuries a broken collar bone and a crushed ankle

257
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:39,440
now what do i do i decide to go to a grocery store

258
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:47,840
i buy food i buy flowers i buy bottle of red wine

259
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:54,480
i organize a script for strong pain killers go to the pharmacy

260
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:02,080
i get the medication oh only at that point that i realized oh

261
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:09,679
i must have decided that i'm going to visit him at his house he had given me an idea

262
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:17,440
where he lives so i drive there and then i get to the boom gates

263
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:21,679
and um

264
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:29,360
they call him lolita is here

265
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,919
allows me in and as i'm parking my car he comes out

266
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:41,279
one of his arms is on a sling

267
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:48,720
and with his free um he hugs me and places a kiss on my cheek and then i

268
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:56,799
smile at me now say are we good he smiles

269
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:03,919
people come and visit and he introduces me as the one who drove into him people are not sure how

270
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:11,360
to respond to this cut lord long story short

271
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,919
about two weeks after that incident it was mr mandela's funeral

272
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:23,120
so i i invited him i've been checking on him daily just to find out how he

273
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:29,200
is most of that first week he was in terrible pain

274
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,880
couldn't even work and this is a man who works for himself

275
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:44,320
so with mr mandela's funeral and uh we're watching it um i'm watching

276
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,600
it with him from my home over a meal we talk about south africa

277
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:53,840
we talk about racism

278
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,320
and from that experience

279
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:11,358
i had an experience of what is it to

280
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:21,919
be forgiven i know what it is to be offered

281
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:38,079
fearlessness at a country level we know the power of

282
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:44,720
forgiveness through the truth and reconciliation

283
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:51,279
commission where

284
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,220
people would committed serious atrocities of harm

285
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:05,920
[Music] police soldiers

286
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:13,680
the law enforcement officials had during the

287
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:23,080
period just before the first elections in south africa 1994

288
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:26,170
[Music]

289
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:35,599
post the elections trc was instituted and

290
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,359
those perpetrators

291
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:45,839
were brought together with their victims

292
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:53,200
had to tell the victims

293
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:01,839
all they had done under the apartheid government

294
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,880
intense intense experience

295
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:18,000
where the victim and the perpetrator are given an opportunity to find

296
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:27,839
each other through forgiveness

297
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:38,800
i think that particular practices gave hope not only

298
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,119
to us as south africans but to the world

299
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:54,000
i mean our problems are not over as a country by any long short much as we are led by

300
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:02,480
black government we are stuck in material structures

301
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:08,640
of white supremacy

302
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,519
the poor in south africa has a black face

303
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,838
and there is corruption ongoing corruption

304
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:33,520
but i know myself africans we do come together during times of

305
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:37,839
crisis

306
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:51,440
so generosity is a foundation for practice of mindfulness and wisdom

307
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,560
for liberation i think we all have opportunities

308
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:05,760
especially in these times the world is on fire

309
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:19,839
in many ways we have opportunity to cultivate generosity

310
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:29,200
i'm going to end this um reflection with words from arjun shah

311
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:36,800
on virtue and mortality virtue and morality morality are the

312
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:45,359
mother and father of the dharma growing within us

313
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,560
they provide it with the proper nourishment

314
00:38:50,560 --> 00:39:01,520
and guidance

315
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:09,520
so sustaining deepening our cultivation of generosity

316
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:17,359
is the way that we can ourselves each other

317
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:23,599
in this quest for freedom freeing the heart

318
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,839
from hate creed and delusion

319
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:40,079
thank you grateful for this opportunity

320
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:56,640
to see these beautiful [Music] teachings of the buddha

321
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:05,599
so uh kevin and mark i am happy to take some questions

322
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:10,720
based on this reflection on generosity

327
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:44,000
jerry quigan in toronto uh a bit away from south africa but uh a country i do want

328
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:49,440
to visit so thank you very much and i guess uh i was interested in your

329
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,200
last words about virtue and morality and the interrelationship with that with

330
00:40:56,200 --> 00:41:01,359
generosity so recently

331
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:07,359
i was in a situation where

332
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:13,119
i'm a physician here and the group that was negotiating a lease with the landlord

333
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:19,920
some of them had their income had gone down and they wanted and another problem was one of the people

334
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,119
were leaving and of course there's a covet epidemic uh going on here as there is in the

335
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,880
world and it's difficult to find replacements so they proceeded to write a letter to the

336
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:38,880
landlord initially in a general way wanting to um get a reduction in the rent

337
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,119
and um asking the landlord you know out of generosity and the landlord wrote

338
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,440
back uh saying that well because they had said that the one person isn't renewing and

339
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,599
they're going to find it difficult to find a replacement for them and that

340
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:03,920
people were working at home albeit at a reduced capacity well some it applied to but it really didn't apply

341
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,680
to others and it resented because i was signing the letter that i didn't speak out that it didn't apply to

342
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:15,920
everyone so i felt that misrepresented to some degree what had been said and then the landlord wrote back and

343
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:21,280
said well tell me how bad it is and give me a global estimate so the letter never got to be written

344
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:26,800
but i was then pressured to uh indicate that uh

345
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:32,960
you know they said well we'll put the specific numbers in about how much people had increases or decreases

346
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,280
and they then proposed a letter which was not uh accurate and i said look i can't

347
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,040
participate in this letter go ahead and send the letter on your own and then they will

348
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,480
they called me said listen uh you know and i was

349
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:56,720
disgusted that they hadn't uh indicated the specific amounts having said that they would about how

350
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:03,040
incomes went up and down in the letter and so uh i had just listened to a dharma talk

351
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:10,160
here in fact at uh uh at redwood city and california via the wonders of the of

352
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:16,560
the internet and um the person had said you know sometime why do we do mindfulness we do

353
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:25,280
mindfulness to uh uh develop an ethic so that uh we will speak the truth and

354
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:32,720
avoid the defilements of greed um and uh delusion

355
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:38,800
and hate and uh so anyway they wanted to speak with me

356
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:44,640
and they started the conversation after some niceties saying look uh

357
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:50,400
you know about the letter and i i said look i said i didn't want to participate

358
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,319
and then they said come on you don't we can put the specific amounts but you actually have to put this amount and then i said

359
00:43:56,319 --> 00:44:04,160
listen you've lost your moral compass this is disgust me and it uh

360
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:10,720
is uh um the letter as originally composed was uh

361
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:17,440
dissembling and uh so this of course i was speaking the truth but i guess in

362
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,520
retrospect uh the letter never did get written and the group disbanded and were moving

363
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:30,400
apart to with the peoples that were there's a group of six and now

364
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:35,440
there's four and two which is fine but i guess i wondered whether i should have

365
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:43,040
related it more toward in a generous way look i feel uh that it's um

366
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:49,839
i would be immoral to sign the letter i feel that this is dissembling instead i projected it on to the other

367
00:44:49,839 --> 00:44:54,880
person and i just wondered whether or not that is uh would have been a more generous

368
00:44:54,880 --> 00:45:00,319
approach so i realize it's very specific and detailed but it's the issue about

369
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:05,839
um in trying to be generous and also at the same time trying to be moral

370
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:11,839
getting caught in the approach that one might take to try to be generous

371
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:18,240
kind but also hardened and courageous when you feel that

372
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:21,680
a group is going awry

373
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:32,079
sorry for the launch what's the actual question summarize it for me make it specific so

374
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:38,160
the specific question would be would you just speak to yourself and not sell someone else that you've lost your

375
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:46,560
moral compass even though you feel that they did

376
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:55,280
are you saying is the feeling that you acted in ways that were not ethical

377
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:00,319
i felt that they did oh they did

378
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:06,480
by not representing what they said they would by putting the specific amounts in the letter and then calling me to now

379
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:13,760
ask me to sign the letter which i said i wouldn't and then i i basically very specifically

380
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:20,319
named them i said this you've lost your moral compass this letter is dissembling and uh

381
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:26,079
i'm disgusted with you so another way that can help me to understand your

382
00:46:26,079 --> 00:46:31,520
question how does it relate to this buddhist teachings

383
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:37,920
on training in morality well in the sense that the mindfulness

384
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:44,160
helps you identify not getting caught up in greed

385
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,160
and so i did it i felt that this was greed

386
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:59,280
misrepresenting results that would of course not be helpful for them to say that well one person's income went up

387
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:06,240
i don't have a wise response to this

388
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:13,200
because it is not necessarily about your own experience of

389
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:19,520
acting unethically so i'm not sure i'm a bit lost i i

390
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:24,960
really don't have a wise wise answer to you because i'm not even sure

391
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:31,359
that i'm understanding the question well i guess the question i'm trying to ask is should you just direct it to

392
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:36,800
yourself or when you see an ethical behavior in a group should you identify that unethical

393
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:43,599
behavior and not and and name it or just say listen for me to participate in this it's unethical

394
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:48,960
rather than tell them that they are unethical to proceed with this approach

395
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:55,599
even if you believe it socially do you appreciate that in the buddhist teachings

396
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:05,200
this is training so it is it is not about

397
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:13,359
shoots or shouldn't sin that way it's not very helpful

398
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:21,280
so if it's training it means all of us are going to fail

399
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:29,119
and we do fail to act ethically and yes you are right the practice of

400
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:34,400
mindfulness allows you to see that it's hard to

401
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:40,400
not see with a trained mind when you act in ways that are not

402
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,079
ethical and also in this

403
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:52,880
practice you can only start again it's not about punishment

404
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:58,000
it is about developing it is about

405
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:07,280
training so let's leave it there let's leave it to that jewelry

406
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:13,200
thank you very much but it's helpful thank you thank you okay okay so i guess we have time for

407
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,559
one more so i think miriam is next so miriam if you want to go ahead and unmute yourself

408
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:26,000
kevin is okay i see there are two if oh okay okay yeah okay okay here i am you're next so

409
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:33,680
go ahead oh okay um i am i'm rooted now yes okay well um

410
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:39,599
so nolita i want to thank you for your generosity for sharing all that um i'm from the

411
00:49:39,599 --> 00:49:45,680
congo and i live in california but um i'm really emotional because this is the first time

412
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:50,720
for me to hear someone from africa doing buddhist teaching so i

413
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:58,559
don't feel like alone but um and for me my struggle about generosity

414
00:49:58,559 --> 00:50:05,520
sometimes i feel like i'm not kind to myself when i'm not generous to other person like when

415
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:12,079
i'm specifically like i'm um like i know some people like who are gay

416
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:20,800
in my community but i know in african culture that's not acceptable and i really feel um sometimes not

417
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:26,960
generous when other people have strong idea like against that but i don't accept

418
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:33,040
them not being open-minded and that's the struggle that i have

419
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:40,319
um yeah and i don't know how to deal with that

420
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:46,720
what is great miriam is that you see what is going on that you are

421
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:53,119
struggling so the encouragement would be

422
00:50:53,119 --> 00:51:03,280
to turn towards that experience of pain with kindness

423
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:10,400
with an attitude of openness and allowing

424
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:16,800
because this practice of mindfulness is exactly about that it is also about opening the heart

425
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,720
towards ourselves and what we struggle with

426
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:27,838
that is what i would encourage you to do

427
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:36,960
because rightly so we are products of our cultures

428
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:45,760
some of these beliefs are part of our psychology

429
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:52,400
what mindfulness can help us is to see which of these beliefs

430
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:58,800
are beneficial and wholesome and which are of these

431
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:05,839
that are harmful not only to others but also to ourselves

432
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:19,839
i would encourage you to really be gentle and kind to yourself in meeting with that pain

433
00:52:20,559 --> 00:52:27,760
okay next is jill uh joe you can go ahead and

434
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:35,119
unmute yourself um thank you very much for taking the

435
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:43,200
question um i i need to share that that for a very long time uh the concept

436
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:51,680
of forgiveness there seems to be a very strong divine element to it something

437
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:57,280
something outside of just myself and that if i had the power to forgive

438
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:03,920
someone for a great harm that it seems very very bold and outside of

439
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:11,280
my own entity so my question is can am i misunderstanding the definition

440
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:17,040
of this word forgiveness or what do you think might be coming from my

441
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:29,839
sense that it's the ability to forgive is outside of my power

442
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:37,280
jill when you say it's outside of your power what does that mean

443
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:45,839
that it when true harm is done i i would not understand the motivation

444
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:53,680
of that other person or the deep reasons that it it is beyond my

445
00:53:53,680 --> 00:53:58,800
um not capacity but that and perhaps this is just because it's

446
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:06,400
it's a leftover from training of another religion which was very rooted in the concepts of guilt and only

447
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:14,000
god has power to do things so maybe that's a part of it but even in my best of buddhist

448
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:20,480
moments and my best efforts to feel generosity i know i can change my feelings in my

449
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,680
heart about this person who has caused great harm but i feel

450
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:31,359
that the the true washing away or something so maybe it is

451
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:37,520
a leftover religious thing belongs to a power greater than mine

452
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:42,160
so it sounds like you've answered your question then

453
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:50,319
so i'd encourage you to notice the experience of unforgiveness

454
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:58,079
and open to that allow that

455
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:07,520
be with the actual experience of unforgiveness [Music]

456
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:12,880
not making it right or wrong but just meeting it

457
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:20,559
with openness

458
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:29,760
with the sensations of the experience not so much the thoughts the stories

459
00:55:30,319 --> 00:55:36,960
stay with the false sense of unforgiveness

460
00:55:37,920 --> 00:55:45,040
so that's what i would advise as a practice and really being gentle with yourself with

461
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:52,640
that as well very helpful thank you okay okay

462
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:58,160
thank you thank you no letha there's a question in chat i don't know if you have time for one more

463
00:55:58,160 --> 00:56:03,359
oh okay yeah let me take it kevin yeah so uh cindy asks nolitha how do you practice

464
00:56:03,359 --> 00:56:10,400
generosity in an environment of racism white supremacy it has been present in this country the

465
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:30,240
u.s since its beginning and it is very difficult and it is a very difficult thing to forgive and understand

466
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:33,599
just notice that

467
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:44,319
in a moment it isn't um

468
00:56:44,319 --> 00:56:51,119
wisdom that's present for me in responding to that

469
00:56:53,280 --> 00:57:00,079
but the fact that um this person is is thinking about forgiveness and

470
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:08,160
just not knowing how is already a generous place

471
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:15,760
to be that there is
