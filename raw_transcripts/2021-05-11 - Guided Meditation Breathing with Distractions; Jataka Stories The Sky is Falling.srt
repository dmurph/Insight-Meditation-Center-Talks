1
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:08,319
so

2
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,680
it's a fortunate thing for all of you to be here and

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,080
with me i feel very grateful and happy to have this time to share the

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,840
practice a bit and the dharma so one of the

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,520
ancient ways of meditating is to meditate with the breathing and some of us have done the whole

6
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:47,360
series now and began since beginning the year on mindfulness of and one of the options with mindfulness

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,160
of breathing is to uh keep a constant like the beat of a song that's the beats always going

8
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,079
along and and uh and um so the

9
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,920
uh just stay with the rhythm of breathing and but then not exclude other things but if

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,920
something else is uh strong and compelling is to um breathe with that uh strong thing that

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,200
other thing that's happening so that we don't get caught up or

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,560
entangled thinking about and involved in too much with what's happening we're able to be

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,680
aware of it and present but stay a little bit free of it without being entangled and

14
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,360
being loose and easy with it and so the breathing with it keeping a focus on the breathing and

15
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:42,880
the breathing and keep us limber and loose from keep prevent us a little bit from seizing up or tightening up or around

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,840
whatever's going on and this ability to stay loose and easy by staying with the rhythm of breathing

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,280
is quite helpful so what i'd like to suggest for today is a one variation of this

18
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,320
is that whatever happens during this meditation

19
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,440
that makes it difficult for you to stay present in the present moment

20
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:16,480
whatever uh ways in which your mind gets pulled off into thoughts or you get pulled into

21
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,800
your emotions and concerns with your emotional life or or if there's strong physical sensations

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,959
in your body in the way in which that just really triggers some reactivity inside of you and you're

23
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:35,920
more involved in the reactivity than you are being present whatever is making difficult for you

24
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,200
breathe with that just breathe through it breathe with it

25
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:47,680
and um and see what happens if the massage of breathing the rhythm of breathing the way it was

26
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:55,680
breathing is kind of uh maybe maybe is a guard against getting caught in the reactivity

27
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:01,840
caught in the preoccupations the wandering thoughts so if you're having a lot of thinking and

28
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,879
that you've got pulled into your thoughts all the time you don't necessarily have to let go of

29
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:14,080
it but breathe with it just breathe through it maybe you know 60 of your attention is

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,800
on the breathing and 40 on the thinking and and uh and then what happens to your

31
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:26,319
thoughts when you're not when you're lost in thought then 100 percent of your attention is

32
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,000
kind of going into your thinking but if sixty percent is just with the breathing and you know you're

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,200
thinking but you're breathing with the thoughts thinking or breathing through it what shifts for you what happens

34
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,480
so the best of your ability stay with your breathing and of course you'll lose it don't worry

35
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:53,360
about that then in a funny way that task is to breathe with having lost it

36
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:58,720
so and so you're right back with the breathing again rather than

37
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:05,200
being preoccupied or upset that you've lost touch with the breathing just breathe with that phenomena

38
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,840
and then you're right back with the breathing and um so i hope that this way you can enjoy

39
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,919
your breathing and it helps if you enjoy a little bit in a very modest way and breathe with

40
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,199
whatever makes it difficult for you to meditate and if it's easy to meditate

41
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:32,000
then it should be easy to just stay with your breathing and and get settled and focused and

42
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:40,320
um entering the entering into that beautiful world of um of being settled on the breathing

43
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:49,040
so assuming a posture that is suitable for

44
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,160
you for this meditation session and the idea is to take in an

45
00:04:55,160 --> 00:05:01,840
intentional posture that posture that it expresses a little bit of intentionality

46
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:09,680
and like yes this is the posture i'm in and adjusting the arms

47
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,759
so that they are participating in this intentional posture

48
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:24,160
adjusting little bit the spine in the back so it too is

49
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:31,280
intentional in the way the spine participates or

50
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:39,120
supports attention

51
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:43,199
and gently close the eyes

52
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:52,479
and especially with breathing now at the center of this meditation

53
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:59,520
gently take a few full deep breaths three quarters full

54
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:06,960
and gently exhale as much air as you can without it being

55
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:21,840
a stress or a strain

56
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:35,840
deep breath in and then relaxing the body as you exhale

57
00:06:43,680 --> 00:07:03,840
maybe especially as you long exhale releasing the shoulders

58
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:17,840
breathing in and breathing out letting your breathing return to normal

59
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:31,360
and then scan through your body and breathe with whatever

60
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,560
tension or holding you'll find in the body

61
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:45,840
maybe without immediately relaxing it but just breathing with it

62
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,960
and then continuing to breathe normally on the exhale now relax

63
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,160
the different places of holding and tension in the body

64
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:36,000
soften attuning yourself to a softening of the

65
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
body

66
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:55,839
partly by recognizing where the body does feel soft or gentle or quiet

67
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:43,680
and then more fully centering yourself on the body

68
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,040
breathing centering yourself on the experience of

69
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,839
breathing

70
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:05,839
and gently quieting your mind

71
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:15,200
perhaps allowing the mind to become softer

72
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:19,839
calmer

73
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:37,279
breathing in and breathing out

74
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:46,000
and then as we sit here this morning if anything takes you away from

75
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,600
fully being with your breathing

76
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:59,519
continue being with the breath but breathe with what wants to take you

77
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,640
away breathe through it

78
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:11,920
almost as if breathing is a way of better recognizing or acknowledging

79
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:17,040
the forces of distraction and preoccupation

80
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:26,560
nothing is wrong nothing is a problem it's just something else to

81
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:33,600
breathe through to breathe with as

82
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:43,839
as it's all held in in awareness

83
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:13,918
you don't have to let go of anything just make sure that 60

84
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,839
or so of your attention is on the breathing

85
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,880
not on what pulls you into its orbit

86
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:34,400
your thoughts your feelings sixty percent on the breathing breathing

87
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:41,120
with whatever is distracting you preoccupying

88
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:47,840
you

89
00:23:55,440 --> 00:24:03,520
no need to struggle with anything instead breathe with it

90
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,880
breathe through it sixty percent of the attention on

91
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:19,840
breathing and forty on what's happening

92
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
so

93
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,840
so

94
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:07,840
so

95
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:37,039
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

96
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:50,799
to say that it's also possible to breathe with others in the presence of others

97
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:59,760
and to keep good part of our attention staying with the massage of breathing

98
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:05,600
it's a protection from getting caught in the conversation or caught in

99
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,640
the reactivity or self-consciousness

100
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,360
when with when we're with someone and when we're not caught in reactivity

101
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:24,320
and thoughts it might be easier to access

102
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,000
kindness and care and generosity

103
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:38,240
it might be easier to be attentive to the other person attentive in a way

104
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:44,320
that doesn't box them in or limit them or

105
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,759
diminish them somehow in in our own eyes

106
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:59,200
but keeps them open keeps them available makes room for them

107
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,759
and may it be that as we go through the day

108
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:12,960
that our breathing returning to our breathing can also be a returning

109
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:18,080
to a place of calm or peace or ease

110
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:26,159
from which we can reconnect to our goodwill

111
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,000
well-wishing for others our care our love our compassion

112
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:44,000
may it be that mindfulness or breathing supports warm-heartedness

113
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:50,640
in our encounters with others may it be that this meditation practice

114
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,760
that we do

115
00:29:55,760 --> 00:30:04,720
is applied to improving the life of all beings

116
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:10,720
may it be that we this practice we've done this morning

117
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:16,158
may it be for the happiness and the welfare of others

118
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:23,039
may it be for their safety and peace

119
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:29,039
may it be for their non-oppression their freedom

120
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,559
and may it be that even in the smallest ways

121
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:42,240
that we contribute to make this possible

122
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:50,080
may our care and good will be present

123
00:30:50,080 --> 00:31:05,840
our encounters with other people may all beings be happy

124

125
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,840
foreign

126
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:15,760
so good day everyone and so this week for these little dharma

127
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:23,760
talks i'm telling stories buddhist stories and some of these stories contain

128
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:30,559
wonderful teachings and wonderful messages some of them are like aesop's fables

129
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:37,440
with uh kind of wisdom fables and there's one that i'm fond of

130
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,440
and partly because i've taught it a lot to children and sometimes i've had children and

131
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:50,960
telling the story to them i've had them acted out and there's a lot of running around and

132
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:57,039
sometimes yelling around that goes along with it so i'll tell you this story but please

133
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,240
don't take it just as a children's story some of these stories are have

134
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:09,440
tremendously great value and this one in particular i think applies to a lot that's happening in the

135
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:17,039
united states with um fake news and fear and anger and things like that

136
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:23,200
so um um so it's one of the jataka tales is

137
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,320
one of the classic canonical kind of stories

138
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:35,120
that kind of like fables that purport to be the past life stories of the buddha when

139
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,519
he was an animal and he's the wise animal in these stories

140
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,600
and so in this story uh there's a rabbit the rabbit's not the

141
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:54,799
buddha the buddha is coming and there's a rabbit

142
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:00,399
and the rabbit decides it's a nice day comfortable day middle of the day and

143
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:07,760
decides to take a nap underneath the tree and

144
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:14,079
falls asleep is contentedly sleeping napping everything is fine in the universe and

145
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,200
then suddenly there's a large something large falls on the ground

146
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:27,520
right next to the rabbit clunk boom bang and the rabbit wakes up with the jolt

147
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:35,760
and concludes that the sky is falling so he the rabbit jumps up and runs along

148
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,280
yelling the sky is falling the sky is falling and comes across other

149
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,320
rabbits and uh and they say their other rob said while you're running

150
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,800
it says run run because the sky is falling so the other rabbits join him and they

151
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:57,920
run into more rabbits and same story and more rabbits are running and then falling they're all yelling out

152
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,320
the sky is falling the sky is falling and then they come across

153
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:09,520
a group of deer and and the deer say what are you doing and

154
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:15,200
the rabbits say the sky is falling run run and first one deer runs then a whole

155
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,560
herd of deer runs and they're all yelling the sky is falling the sky is falling

156
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:26,640
and they go along further and they come across rhinoceroses and

157
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:34,560
the rhinoceroses say what are you doing well the sky is falling you have to run run for safety and and uh so first one

158
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:40,480
runoff is then many rhinoceroses are running and uh and by this time this ground is shaking

159
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,960
because there's you know so much weight and so many animals are running afraid of this falling sky

160
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,040
and then they come across elephants pretty soon there's a huge herd of elephants pounding against the

161
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:59,920
ground shaking the ground everyone yelling and frantically the sky

162
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:05,920
is falling the sky is falling and they're heading to a big cliff and if there's another

163
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,440
they're kind of besides themselves in their fear they don't even know where they're going and it's just a hitting sprint's cliff

164
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,200
they're all going to kind of fall right off but uh towering above this cliff on a

165
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,880
another cliff on a kind of mountaintop is a great lion the lion the story is

166
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:28,560
the buddha and the lion looks down and sees what's going on going on sees the danger that

167
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:35,200
all these animals are in so the giant leap the lion leaps down

168
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,400
in front of the charging animals and

169
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:46,560
roars stop and all the animals screech to a halt in

170
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:52,079
front of the lion and the lion says to them calmly what is

171
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:57,760
going on here and the elephant says well the sky is falling the sky is

172
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:03,520
falling and the buddha the lion says well who told you that

173
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,359
well the rhinoceros has told me that so the lion asked the rhinoceros well

174
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:14,560
who told you that well the deer told me that

175
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:20,720
asking the deer the deer said brother rabbits asking the rabbits the rabbits all then

176
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:28,160
turn around and pointed to the first rabbit that's the one who told me told us

177
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,160
and the buddha said to that rabbit where did you get the idea that the sky

178
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:40,560
is falling and the rabbit said well there was this loud bang something

179
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:46,320
falling right next to me and the buddha said well take us there

180
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:54,160
the buddha the lion said take us there and and so with some trepidation the

181
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:00,079
rabbit led the whole large gathering of animals and the lion back

182
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,599
to underneath the tree it happened to be a mango tree

183
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:12,400
and laying on the ground right next to where the rabbit had napped was a mango it was a mango that had

184
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:17,440
fallen off the tree and landed right next to the head of the rabbit

185
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:25,520
so the buddha pointed that out and said there's no sky falling it's just a mango and

186
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:30,000
and so everyone relaxed and went back to their

187
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:38,640
different activities that these animals had so the story of uh not running

188
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:44,000
from what we're afraid of but taking a good look to investigate what's

189
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,560
really happening here and to ask ourselves this ques very important question from where did i

190
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:56,560
learn some rumors some idea and where did that

191
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:03,359
what's the source of that then what's the source of that the idea of understanding the source

192
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:10,160
for our information is it just our opinion like it was for the rabbit i guess a

193
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,920
wild guess is it rumor is it what we've heard from someone else we don't really know for

194
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:21,680
ourselves but we've heard oh i've heard a story this you know this is how it is out

195
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:26,720
there and and then if fear is triggered if anger

196
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,838
is triggered

197
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,839
if it's something we've seen and seeing directly maybe it's reasonable but if it's many

198
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:46,320
steps removed from the original aren't we becoming like the herds of

199
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,760
animals running towards the cliff aren't we start creating realities creating world

200
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:56,960
views and understandings and enemies and

201
00:39:56,960 --> 00:40:02,240
scenarios and doomsday ideas that we're running from that we're preoccupied with

202
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,800
that where we lose our sensibilities and how are we going to who's going to

203
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,760
be the lion that stops us that says stop

204
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:20,640
let's go back and look really take a good look or investigate what's really happening here let's follow the steps

205
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:26,800
back and probably there's not going to be a

206
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:33,920
lion or a buddha that's going to jump in front of us but the buddha for us these days

207
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:40,800
represents our own capacity to say stop ah real healthy stopping

208
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:49,119
stopping or running away stopping running in circles stopping our spinning out really stop

209
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:55,760
and turn and look at what is happening turn and look towards the

210
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,960
danger if it's appropriate to look at it to look towards our fear

211
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,520
and there is a kind of courage that's needed in buddhist practice to stop and look at what we're afraid of

212
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:12,640
to stop and look at what we're angry at to really look what's really going on

213
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:19,280
here what's the real source of my reactivity my reaction

214
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:25,359
and um i know in my for me recently i was somewhat angry with someone maybe mildly

215
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:32,880
but it was kind of a maybe annoyance or irritated or something and i stopped to take a look at it and i

216
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:39,520
realized very quickly that um a huge percentage of how it was irritated

217
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:45,440
or annoyed um has to do with the stories that i was making up about the situation

218
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:52,640
not about the actual situation i didn't actually have all the information it was happening i was guessing and then the guest making

219
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,920
a picture of what it was and then i was reacting to my own picture not to

220
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,400
the person and then i realized oh it isn't the other person i have to contend with

221
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:09,760
i have to contend with myself and so so that was i stopped and looked

222
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:16,800
and saw where is it and found it in myself so this so you have the ability to stop

223
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:22,880
you have the ability to then turn and look and see what's really the source of this

224
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:33,440
where is the beginning of this maybe it was just a mango that fell on the ground and and to support this ability to stop

225
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:40,079
and take a good look you have your breathing to have a habit of coming back and just

226
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:45,760
breathing with the situation breathing not to deny anything or turn away from anything

227
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:51,599
but the breathing consciously that gives us patience gives a little bit room

228
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,599
breathing room space for the mind to look and investigate and see what's really going

229
00:42:57,599 --> 00:43:03,680
on that we don't have if we're caught up in all the animals of our mind

230
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:11,839
uh spreading rumors to each other and spinning out and and the whole you know

231
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:17,359
zoo of her mind is starting to race and run towards the cliff

232
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:26,800
stop take a look so um the sky is falling

233
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:34,079
if you think that's the case stop and take a good look at where that idea came from and maybe

234
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:42,000
you'll find instead maybe just maybe that there's a sweet ripe

235
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,520
mango waiting for you some treasure something some sweetness

236
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:53,839
and something delicious something wonderful that there's a waiting for you for you

237
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:59,599
really look deeply at the situation including yourself

238
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:09,838
so um thank you and we'll continue storytelling tomorrow
