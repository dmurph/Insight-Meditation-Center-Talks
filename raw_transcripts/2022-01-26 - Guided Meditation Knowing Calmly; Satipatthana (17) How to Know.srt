1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,240
so this i'm using the opportunity these days to

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,960
emphasize the knowing quality of attention that our capacity for attention

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,600
awareness has many different faculties many different ways in which it operates they can all come together

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,039
and work in harmony and so there's the more cognitive knowing where we

5
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,078
recognize something for what it is there's also feeling it fully

6
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:37,920
and kind of being with it experientially in the body where the knowing might not be as

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,239
central but just the the embodied feeling is what central

8
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,120
and there's uh observing there is um

9
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,840
kind of a clarity of awareness where things just arise so a variety of

10
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:03,440
things and so we're emphasizing knowing because it's useful to get a sense of the richness and the possibilities

11
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:11,200
potential of this knowing faculty we have and for today i want to say that um

12
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,320
[Music] then it's possible to

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,880
know something with some intentionality with some uh

14
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:30,880
choice to really like let's know this let's be clear about it and to know it and as we know it

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,640
it might be in a word it might feel you know just the in-breath is in

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:43,040
and we know it as an in-breath but uh it might be a word in the mind it might be a little bit an

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,159
image or people think more in images perhaps a nice image to have is the image of itself the chest moving perhaps or the

18
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:55,200
belly moving and so what i want to emphasize today

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,479
because it's a little bit intentional no matter how else you might be feeling

20
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,800
engage in the knowing in a calm way calmly know

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,520
and uh even if you're agitated take a little time to calmly recognize

22
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,040
agitation is here

23
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:26,959
and sometimes what uh you know the mind maybe is is uh racing or is fast or is

24
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,239
is um energized or maybe it's really dull and

25
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:38,480
sinking all kinds of ways in which the mind can be and it's very common for us to

26
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,080
let the mind's mood or state influence than how we are how we use our

27
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:49,519
attention and this is an exercise to kind of take hold

28
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:56,319
of your knowing faculty and use it with a certain kind of

29
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:04,480
clarity intentionality consciously use it and as you use it do it calmly

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,400
so in a certain kind of little gentle lovingly determined knowing the in-breath

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,680
knowing the out-breath knowing a sound that's coming in

32
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,599
knowing a warm tingling in my belly knowing

33
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:29,200
an itch knowing the itch some more back to the in-breath

34
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:36,239
health breath so let the knowing become and so it's a little bit like um

35
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,599
um like the story i like to tell of my son in

36
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:48,000
preschool that um it's a wonderful teacher and and he would uh where the kids were

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,680
playing less preschool kids do in the playroom kind of noisily and happily and

38
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:59,280
running around and when it was time to do something different tell a story so they could

39
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,640
take their nap or something he would stand in the middle of the classroom

40
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:11,760
and start talking softly and as he talked softly and calmly

41
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,320
steps over a few minutes the kids would begin gathering around him and likes like the pied piper and kids

42
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,080
would all gather around him and sit down and look up with great delight and

43
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,120
expectation as he prepared to tell a story

44
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,639
so maybe that kind of a calm knowing

45
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:40,080
that is not trying to fix anything or do anything but it becomes a little bit of

46
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:48,240
a reference point for your psychophysical system to maybe finally relax as well or calm down

47
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:54,960
so beginning with a meditation posture

48
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,880
that for you represents or allows for a combination of

49
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:06,639
being alert and relaxed alert

50
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,280
alert and calm and then to

51
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,520
take a few long slow deep breaths beginning the movement of being calm by

52
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,960
how you calmly breathe maybe three quarters full breath

53
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:32,560
nothing that is a strain and a calm long exhale

54
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,800
as long as it doesn't strain you relaxing as you exhale

55
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:44,320
breathing in breathing out

56
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:55,520
and then to [Music] let your breathing return to normal

57
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,639
and perhaps there's a little margin of adjusting

58
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:12,560
that's natural enough easy enough to breathe a little bit calmer

59
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,400
maybe by relaxing the belly

60
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,160
maybe some there's a softening in the chest that's possible

61
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,800
maybe you're not breathing in deeply but there's this gentle intentionality

62
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:53,840
to breathing in that allows you to breathe in calmly

63
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,960
breathe out calmly

64
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:16,000
and as you exhale calmly without much ambition

65
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,880
soften in the

66
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:36,840
face as you exhale calmly soften the shoulders

67
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,840
as you exhale

68
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,879
softening the belly

69
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:10,840
and then settling yourself more fully on the body's experience of breathing

70
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,800
experiment with knowing

71
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:28,080
inhale calmly experiment with

72
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,518
a clear knowing when you're exhaling

73
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,639
you know you're exhaling

74
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,920
and whatever

75
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:03,199
grabs your attention gets your attention that's different than the breathing

76
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:14,080
explore the possibility of calmly knowing it a calm recognition

77
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:21,880
this is what's happening a sound an itch a thought

78
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,959
a feeling

79
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,760
in a sense things are always changing

80
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,440
so stay in the flow of change

81
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,360
with calm recognition when you're calm you're not going to

82
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:55,760
know it all recognize it all but just be content

83
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,880
with what you can calmly know moment by moment

84
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:11,839
and whatever seems appropriate center yourself in knowing the breathing

85
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:21,839
calmly knowing

86
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,320
the experience of breathing

87
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,680
right now what would you need to know

88
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:02,600
so that you're more in the present moment

89
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:10,399
what experience would you need to recognize

90
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,839
to arrive here with what is happening

91
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,519
calmly know it

92
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,400
so

93
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:35,520
knowing is an essential aspect of being a human

94
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:37,840
being

95
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:50,880
what is your knowing like can you appreciate

96
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:00,960
your capacity to recognize the simplicity of what's happening

97
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:05,759
and to know it recognize it calmly

98
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,320
as if to know it is precious

99
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:16,480
as if to know is a treasure

100
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,200
which it is our human lives our homo sapien lives

101
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,760
would not be possible

102
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:35,559
without our capacity to know

103
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:33,039
taking a few moments to continue

104
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:39,360
knowing calmly whatever is happening in the

105
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:46,880
present moment recognize it calmly

106
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:53,799
and recognize it in what's how it's obvious

107
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:01,120
without searching for the right word or

108
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:09,840
sometimes it's not clear what's happening it's enough to recognize it as

109
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,840
something

110
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:26,960
in the last minute or so here to see if you can get a

111
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:35,480
feeling for [Music] what it's like to calmly know

112
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:51,039
kind of like you're imprinting the memory of

113
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,320
what it's like to know calmly

114
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:33,760
and then

115
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:42,960
bring to mind people in your life

116
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:50,399
strangers you know [Music] neighbors colleagues friends

117
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:56,120
mail carriers store clerks

118
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,200
and what is it like to think of one of them

119
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:11,600
you know with this calm knowing just calmly know like imagining them in

120
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:16,880
front of you calmly recognize

121
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:27,399
and perhaps the calm recognition

122
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,919
can be the channel through which

123
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,320
your good will can travel

124
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:53,279
calmly having good will

125
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:59,520
well wishing kindness

126
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,840
and perhaps your good will can have some the same qualities of

127
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,200
calmness tranquil

128
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:14,960
well wishing

129
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:26,559
and when that well wishing spreads out widely in all directions

130
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:33,039
we might say to ourselves may all beings

131
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,278
be happy

132
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:45,120
may all beings be safe

133
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:52,159
may all beings be peaceful

134
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:59,399
and may all beings be free

135
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,399
and then i'll bow and that bow will be the end of the sitting

136
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:19,320
thank you

137
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,519
um

138
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:23,519
so i think often we take our knowing for granted

139
00:32:23,519 --> 00:32:29,360
throughout the day we're constantly recognizing things but we're doing it at

140
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:35,440
a kind of subconscious level and that's kind of needs to be that way if we were

141
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:41,120
to take the time to recognize each thing that we come across

142
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,159
we would never get anywhere there's so much to recognize but our brain can process things subconsciously and and so that we

143
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,519
take in a lot and know how to find the way to the door and through the

144
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:58,559
door and without having to think about it or

145
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:05,279
but it's still kind of even though it's done so automatic pilot sometimes

146
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,640
so much of it it's still an essential quality of being a human being

147
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:16,640
and [Music] without it our human life would not be possible

148
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:21,919
and but because we're so interested in we have desires to do something and want

149
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:27,039
something to think something we seldom take the time

150
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:32,799
to recognize how special it is to recognize to know

151
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:39,919
for deep mindfulness practice the knowing faculty of the mind becomes increasingly important

152
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:46,559
and now it does so in a natural way so it's not like you have to work at knowing but

153
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:53,760
the deeper the practice goes the more acute the more clarity there is in the knowing in such a way the knowing

154
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:59,440
starts being more and more liberating it it's uh it's kind of like a way of

155
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:04,840
freeing ourselves to greater and greater freedom and

156
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:10,079
um so it's very basic and uh it's

157
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:16,079
when practice is strong when we're meditating is going well and concentrated and quite calm

158
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,280
then um what's interesting is to notice what it's like to come out of meditation

159
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,760
get up for your seat and start walking and if you're really calm and settled

160
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:33,599
there's probably very little tendency to want to rush into the next thing

161
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,079
and then as you walk from your meditation seat there might be a kind of very relaxed almost

162
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:45,358
almost automatic kind of just knowing that you're walking

163
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:51,919
you're so present and in the walking that you just know that you're walking

164
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,599
the um there's a famous zen story that's told sometimes of two zen students who

165
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:03,200
were teaching and talking and they were talking about their respective zen

166
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:08,560
masters and uh one of them said that um

167
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:15,040
my zen master is my teacher so great can

168
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,160
can enter into the deepest states of concentration can walk on water

169
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,280
fly through the air all kinds of miracles kind of things

170
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:33,520
and the second one says well mai's the teacher when she walks she just walks

171
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:41,920
when she eats she just eats when she talks he just talks

172
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:50,400
and the first one said oh bowed down deeply oh you your your teacher is really advanced

173
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:57,440
so the idea that the simplicity of just being in the experience that we're we have while we're doing it

174
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:03,520
is such a pleasure certain times and so when meditation is quite centered and

175
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:10,839
settled that's one of the times it's kind of really a pleasure that as you walk know you're

176
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:17,520
walking because you're inhabiting the walking when you're standing no you're standing

177
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:22,960
when you're sitting no you're sitting and when you're lying down no you're lying down

178
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:30,800
and so this second exercise of sati patana it can also be seen as a way of

179
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,760
continuing the meditation into our daily life and so the first exercise kind of gets

180
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:43,200
us settled and the second one is the encouragement to stay present

181
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,240
stay in the knowing and the calm knowing into our daily life so there's a continuity

182
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:55,839
and and [Music] what can easily happen is that our meditation ends maybe we're

183
00:36:55,839 --> 00:37:02,560
somewhat calmer than we were before but we get up in order to do things take care of the next thing

184
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:07,760
make breakfast go to work you know whatever it might be

185
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,920
and what's interesting is to watch how quickly we

186
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:19,040
lose touch with the simplicity of when walking just know you're walking

187
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:24,400
and instead we're already ahead of ourselves into planning what's for breakfast and what we should put

188
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:29,680
together and and uh you know what kind of ingredients we're going to use and

189
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:36,960
and uh and then thinking about where's my newspaper or my my device my my pad that i'm going to

190
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:42,400
read from and read the news and i wonder if i should what podcast i should listen to while i'm

191
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,960
having breakfast and you know on and on it's we're already in the flow and of all the different things ahead of ourselves

192
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:56,880
thinking ahead and there's nothing inherently wrong with that however it does involve a loss

193
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,280
it can be a loss of some kind of deep inner connection to the present moment and to oneself

194
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:09,200
it certainly has a as can be a pleasure to do some of these other things and i hope you do some of them with joy and

195
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:15,920
delight but if we do if we keep losing ourselves to them throughout the day

196
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:21,119
we're lost many people lose are lost to themselves because of all the things

197
00:38:21,119 --> 00:38:27,040
they're doing and all the things they're thinking about and concerned with

198
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,320
so this simple instructions to when standing know you're standing

199
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:37,359
walking know you're walking is a

200
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,880
especially coming out of meditation is a opportunity

201
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:48,240
to both continue with the calm state you're in and experiment with how it is

202
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:55,200
to live that way and uh and it's it's really cool

203
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,320
the way that if we can get calm and settled and quiet

204
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:07,040
that the knowing of what to do next the knowing of how to do things can happen kind of

205
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:13,280
organically automatically we don't have to be the agent we don't be the one figuring it out and always

206
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:18,800
and this have this kind of arising of a certain knowing and a rising of intention

207
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:24,960
um and then and uh from this place of calm uh tends to bring forth some of the best

208
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,160
qualities of who we are but also what happens is instructions

209
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:38,960
just to pay attention as you leave meditation is to notice how quickly you lose your calm

210
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:46,000
and this became a real important turning point for me in my meditation when i noticed that how quickly i gave

211
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,480
up my calm my subtleness my clarity when i got up from meditation because i was on to the next thing

212
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:59,359
and and so to then stop or slow down and notice what is that next thing

213
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:06,880
where are you rushing off to what are you getting caught in what are the feelings what are the beliefs

214
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:14,000
why why are you sacrificing your calm your clarity your centeredness

215
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,560
why are you why are you sacrificing it with other things is it is it a worthy sacrifice is the

216
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,720
cost-benefit analysis in your favor that you rush off to

217
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,079
look at the news while you're having breakfast

218
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:37,359
is that the best use of your human life what happens with this kind of

219
00:40:37,359 --> 00:40:42,880
deep sense of connectedness that can happen and a life that arises and flows out of

220
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:49,680
that so to know

221
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:55,599
to know simple things

222
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,520
in the moment so simple as your posture and

223
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:08,560
enjoy that and also to do that in such a way that we start becoming more sensitive

224
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:15,280
to how we what we're doing with our minds and our feelings and our life

225
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:20,400
and so to seek more clearly how we rush off or get involved or get

226
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,839
preoccupied and then ask the question

227
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:32,240
is this worthwhile is this the best use of my time and if it is go ahead

228
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:38,160
then you do it consciously and if it's not maybe there are better things to do

229
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:43,680
and i would suggest that for most of us [Music]

230
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,480
being calm some modicum have come even when we're having fun

231
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,920
is being playful some some degree of calm or having calm

232
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,119
close by just enhances everything makes everything richer and fuller and more

233
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,240
embodied it's not a not the kind of calm that would limit

234
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,440
you but allows for a deeper wellspring of engagement with life

235
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:17,800
it's just a great thing and um

236
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:24,720
so when you walk no you're walking when

237
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:30,880
you're standing know you're standing when you're sitting no you're sitting

238
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:37,440
and when you're lying down no you're lying down so thank you

239
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:44,000
and i'm here at irc for a couple of more
