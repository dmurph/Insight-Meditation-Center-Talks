1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:08,480
so warm greetings and welcome to our adventure with

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:16,720
breathing for today and um it's a kind of a lifetime adventure to

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:23,519
practice meditation and life attuned to breathing and in touch with your breathing and

4
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:31,039
aware of how your breathing is going in any given time and it's awareness of breathing

5
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:39,920
helps us to uh avoid spending unnecessary energy

6
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:48,079
in as we go through our life especially the unnecessary energy of tension or anxiety or

7
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:56,000
or ambition over efforting many of the ways

8
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,280
that we because we become stressful has to do with an over

9
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:10,320
exertion of energy in the muscles that they're tight too much and also in the mind and so

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,680
that gets all that gets translated into the breathing the breathing gets shallow gets tight it

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,720
moves up into the chest rather than deeper abdominal breathing behold our

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:30,880
breathing and so being attuned to the breathing and breathing in a easy relaxed way is a way to

13
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:39,040
um to not over effort in our lives

14
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,399
so to assume a meditation posture

15
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,840
and to close your eyes

16
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:59,920
and to feel the weight of your body against the surface

17
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,040
that's keeping you from falling to the center of the earth

18
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,000
your chair your cushion the floor your bed whatever it might be and feel

19
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,120
the contact of your body against this surface

20
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:25,200
and maybe rock side to side sway forward and back

21
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,480
or in some way kind of and then settle in

22
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,519
wiggle in a little bit to really settle into that spot where

23
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,959
there's a surface holding you

24
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:55,280
and then take a few moments to feel the edges of your body

25
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:02,159
your skin both where your skin touches your clothes

26
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,480
where the skin touches

27
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,440
your cushion chair and also wherever the tingling and vibration the warmth and

28
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,920
the coolness the sensations on the skin become apparent as you're

29
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:28,959
sitting here kind of a global wide

30
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:34,159
awareness of sensations along yours all over your body on your

31
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,480
skin

32
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:48,720
maybe it's a flowing sensation a tingling a vibration

33
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,959
maybe there are some sensations that fleet in and out of awareness

34
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,799
spark in and out of awareness as your attention roams around

35
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:12,159
and then notice where the contact of your skin may be against

36
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:18,239
your clothes or if you're lying down against the surface

37
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:26,880
you're lying down on no to feel we're breathing has an impact

38
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:33,280
we're breathing in the inhale the expansion of the chest or the belly

39
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,479
lifting of the shoulders causes more contact

40
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,440
with your clothes or some surface

41
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:57,840
and you can feel the sensations of movement of contact

42
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,440
feeling the rhythm of sensations of the contact of the body breathing

43
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,960
moving as you breathe against your clothes or your

44
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,919
back of your chair

45
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:25,199
maybe even there's this very subtle movement a sensation of all the way down to

46
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,479
the cushion you're sitting on

47
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:40,000
sensations in the front ribcage the back rib cage

48
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,240
the sides of the rib cage

49
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:53,840
maybe even the belly

50
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:02,960
and then bring your attention inside of your body maybe not far from

51
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:08,479
the skin bring your attention a little bit inward

52
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,639
to where you usually experience your

53
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
breathing

54
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:49,840
feeling the movement of sensation the changing sensations with the inhale and exhale

55
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,240
and as you exhale

56
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:17,840
relax deeper into your body soften the shoulders

57
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,520
as you exhale let this the belly become

58
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,840
softer

59
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:46,560
as you relax the holding in the body the tension you're relaxing or the extra energy

60
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,360
you're expending

61
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:58,240
softening relaxing in the face and there's less energy going into

62
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,280
holding the muscles

63
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:15,198
relaxing the shoulders and the arms unless energy is expended

64
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:30,319
in paradoxically with less energy expended in tension

65
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:41,839
more there can be a feeling of vitality or maybe even flowing energy

66
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:56,320
the same thing is true in the mind the thinking mind if there's any tension

67
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,760
or pressure agitation there maybe as you exhale

68
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:09,839
you can relax let go

69
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,920
expend less energy conscious energy

70
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:23,279
in mental activity

71
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:31,600
it turns out the mind works much better more creatively wiser

72
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:51,839
when less anxious or tense energy everything goes into it

73
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:01,199
and then settling in to the body

74
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,839
breathing

75
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:13,120
and here too the art of meditation

76
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:20,720
is to stay committed with breathing without a lot of extra

77
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:26,240
energy without any strain

78
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:36,160
and for some people it can be helpful the notion of being receptive

79
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:47,839
to the inhale

80
00:10:52,240 --> 00:11:01,839
and to allow the exhale

81
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,600
maybe relaxing a teeny bit at the end of the exhale

82
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,480
to have a little pause micropause

83
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:25,519
so that is you're more sensitive to receiving the beginning of the inhale

84
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:31,920
how the inhalers how the inhale

85
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:43,839
now the inhale arises on its own

86
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,680
receptive to the inhales allowing the exhale

87
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,839
as maybe you would floating

88
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:24,399
on the sea gently

89
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:31,200
being lifted and gently lowered by the small waves coming and going

90
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:38,000
allowing yourself to be held

91
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,120
the buoyant water

92
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:53,839
allowing yourself to float on the inhales and exhales

93
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:01,200
some effort is needed to be receptive and allowing

94
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:11,200
while at the same time letting go and

95
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,720
allowing the breathing

96
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,839
to come to awareness

97
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:02,320
letting go of your interest in thinking

98
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:12,720
and letting your interest be

99
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:20,800
in floating on the gentle waves of inhales and exhale

100
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:28,160
like you're floating on your back on a wide peaceful sea

101
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:41,839
gently being lifted and lowered by the peaceful waves

102
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:19,839
relaxing the tension associated with thinking

103
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:24,079
the pressure the contraction

104
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:32,240
allowing the thinking to become quieter

105
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:51,839
so you can trust staying with the breathing more fully

106
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:08,559
and if you can imagine yourself floating on the your back on a peaceful sea

107
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:15,760
imagine that as you're looking up into the sky and a few clouds are drifting by in the

108
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:22,880
blue sky that way stay

109
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:28,240
connected stay floating on your breathing

110
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:34,000
but notice whatever thinking is happening

111
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:42,880
like thinking your clouds drifting by

112
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:52,640
not to be involved with the thinking but to have a kind of a view from a

113
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,840
distance

114
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:05,360
where there's very little energy

115
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:17,120
it used to be thinking letting go of the extra energy to think

116
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:25,840
to be involved to be engaged in thought relax the energy of thinking

117
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:32,000
the efforting of thinking and while you stay with the inhales and

118
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:39,840
exhales without a lot of effort

119
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,000
be aware of the thoughts that flow

120
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,840
through

121
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:30,640
and notice that as you're thinking do you think more in words

122
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:35,840
or more in images

123
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:49,840
or is it kind of equally both

124
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:12,240
and then and in recognizing whether it's more words more images or equal those of both

125
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:18,720
is it easier for you to notice your involvement with thinking the

126
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:31,360
energy expended to think the tension involved in thinking

127
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:36,720
and if so as you exhale

128
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:42,159
can you relax and quiet that energy that effort

129
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,720
and as you do so

130
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:59,840
settle more into your breathing

131
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:37,120
our bodies and our minds

132
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,840
operate more harmoniously

133
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:50,320
when we stop using unnecessary energy

134
00:25:54,840 --> 00:25:57,840
effort

135
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:04,000
the very

136
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,679
effort to try hard at something unnecessary

137
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:19,919
it's counterproductive it interferes with the natural wisdom

138
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:26,880
the natural sensitivity and the natural harmony

139
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:38,080
that's available when we don't apply unnecessary energy

140
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:46,640
and before we learn to not do so it's useful just to recognize

141
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:53,120
when there is unnecessary energy in the form of tension in the body and

142
00:26:53,120 --> 00:27:07,840
the mind in the thinking

143
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:13,840
and then as we come to the end of the

144
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:22,960
sitting perhaps you can intuit or feel

145
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:31,840
oh without without tension

146
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:41,440
without this extra energy of tension and pushing and trying there's more room in us

147
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:49,200
for happiness for well-being

148
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:56,840
or there's more room for us for love for good will

149
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:59,840
compassion

150
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:11,200
and to end this sitting being open to

151
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:16,080
the joys and sufferings of this world

152
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:21,760
and to be open to it without resistance

153
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:27,840
to breathe with it

154
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,960
to be willing to be a companion

155
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,398
to the world's joys and the joy the world's sufferings

156
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:50,240
to breathe with the world and in doing so

157
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:59,120
before needing to do anything more complicated perhaps you can be your kindness

158
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,398
spreads out from you to the world

159
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:14,480
a simple kindness which wishes well for others

160
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:21,600
wishes the best for them may all beings

161
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:31,520
be happy may all beings be safe

162
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:41,760
may all beings be peaceful

163
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,559
may all beings

164
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,840
be free

165
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:01,840
this

166
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:19,200
so i'm going to today i'm going to discuss

167
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,480
the seventh step of anapanasati

168
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:31,919
seven steps of breathing in and breathing out the buddha's teachings on breath meditation

169
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:40,158
and the way it's worded it says one trains oneself breathing in one experiences

170
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,120
the activity of mind the mental formations the construct

171
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:52,960
construction constructing activity of the mind and in the simple ways is called the

172
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,399
activity of the mind breathing out one experiences the

173
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:05,679
activity of the mind and now this is a really rich topic what the mind is the poly word is chitta

174
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:13,519
ci tta and it's um you know a rich and wonderful topic

175
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:19,360
and i'll touch on some of it as we go along here but in simple terms in english we might

176
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:26,240
call it the mind and um but one of the

177
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:33,440
main activities of the mind for many of us is thinking and um

178
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,200
and to uh so to become aware of thinking and there's two different

179
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:45,600
ways to become aware that i'm emphasizing here one is to become uh to observe it

180
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,840
just to know what's happening and the other is to really experience it

181
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:58,880
feel the experience and feel what it's like to be thinking and both are important and to learn to

182
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:05,200
recognize and know and observe thinking is many times a stepping stone to feeling it and experiencing it more

183
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:10,480
fully so as always with this mindfulness of breathing

184
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,760
there's always this rhythm the background beat or the foreground beat

185
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,638
of breathing that's we're getting centered on and focused on and and

186
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:29,358
settling in on and uh and the breathing protects us a little bit

187
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:35,599
from getting caught up in the world of thinking to be resting or focusing or

188
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:41,839
stable on the breathing then as we're more stable the more awareness can begin

189
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:47,520
to open up and be more expensive more inclusive to be able to take in more and more

190
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:55,440
what's going on and and with a stable attack stable present presence attention

191
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,119
to breathing it's possible to be aware of thinking

192
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:07,200
without being bothered by thinking uh without making it into a problem or

193
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:14,960
think it said you know it's wrong to think in meditation or to be upset about it or to call it even a distraction and the

194
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:20,000
reason why we can why it's easier not to be bothered is because

195
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:25,839
there's not a very strong pull into that world we don't get lost in it very much

196
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:31,280
but it's also true that even if we do get lost in it we're better off not being bothered by

197
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:39,280
it being upset being agitated because we think is a recipe for perpetuating the

198
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,560
thinking the more agitated we are the more the mind tends to want to produce

199
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:51,440
thoughts and ideas stories and so the art of not being bothered not

200
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:58,000
being upset not being attached to thinking but also not being aversive to thinking

201
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:03,520
not making your thinking your very best friend and not making thinking your enemy

202
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:09,680
either it's just thinking is happening and to be aware of thinking going by

203
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:17,920
and the classic image in buddhism is having thoughts drift by like clouds and an endless sky

204
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:25,599
just clouds and i love the metaphor of clouds for thinking because you know you if you put your

205
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:32,720
hand into a cloud you don't get anything maybe you get a little bit moist but you know there's no solidity there

206
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,160
just like you can put your hand right through and it turns out that thinking is not is

207
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,800
actually less solid than a cloud and uh there's no you know it's it's a

208
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:51,200
it's kind of a virtual reality thing their thoughts but it's the

209
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,359
what we invest in our thinking the attachment the engagement the all the energy we put into it

210
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:02,480
that makes thinking sometimes actually more solid and more real and more

211
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,760
important than almost anything else in our lives we can get so wrapped up in our stories and our ideas and our thoughts

212
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,280
and and the paradox here is that the more energy we put into thinking the

213
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:20,720
more we're trying hard to you know anxiously think or be attached to it

214
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:27,920
we actually think less effectively um the most creative the most innovative

215
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,520
the most wise the most loving the most beneficial way of thinking

216
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:40,480
tends to be without a lot of extra energy there can be a choice to focus on some

217
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:45,839
things to think about in daily life but to do it with an easy relaxed mind

218
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:52,160
and that ability to stay focused and very relaxed allows a thinking mind to be most

219
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:58,880
productive most creative maybe there are exceptions but

220
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:07,680
for many people it's the exception to ever approach this idea of a you know a creative mind that's relaxed

221
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:15,440
thinking relax thinking and so to learn not to be bothered by

222
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:22,720
our thinking is very important one of the useful skills to learn in meditation to have this wisdom not to be caught up

223
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,839
in it or for against it to have a certain equanimity and to be patient

224
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:35,119
with the mind wonders often thought to keep coming back keep coming back starting over again starting over again but at some point

225
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:40,960
now it was at the seventh step of anapanasati with the idea that seven step now there's some stability there

226
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:46,640
some centering on the breath ability to stay with the breathing more continuously and of course

227
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:52,720
that comes and goes that ability and many of us will start at step one of anapanasati

228
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,720
um regularly and like i'm just beginning and that's completely fine but at some

229
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:06,400
point as we settle in maybe the end of a long sit meditation or maybe you know conditions come together where

230
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:13,280
there's enough stability here that we can becoming aware of thinking

231
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:19,599
and um in a way that uh it's like clouds in the endless sky we just there's a kind of almost we don't get

232
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:25,280
too caught in it we don't get focused on it but we are aware and there's a few things that are

233
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:30,480
interesting to notice when we can do this one is to notice whether we think more

234
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,560
in words or more in images and some people it's one or the other

235
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:42,160
and some people come some combination of both and um but you know maybe one

236
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:47,680
predominates over the other and um because once you recognize uh

237
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:54,880
what your primary quality of thinking is you can investigate something more and that is

238
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,280
uh where does that operate so where is the if it's avoid inner voice which is speaking

239
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,800
where's the loudspeaker or where's the inner mouth that's doing the speaking the vocal cord or something

240
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,560
um sometimes and people generally feel it's behind their forehead it's kind of somewhere in

241
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:18,000
the area what we call the brain for many modern people uh in the ancient world it

242
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:25,200
seems still to the modern world in in places in buddhist asia and if uh people associate the heart

243
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:31,599
center with where they're where they're where they are thinking um and maybe some of you do as well but

244
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:36,960
i think a tendency in the in the modern west at least is the point to the head and partly

245
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:43,440
because you know the brain has such a big role in thinking that you know we gravitate towards there and

246
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,839
associated with air but you know the word the words might be spoken somewhere inside

247
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:55,520
and or if you see if you're thinking in images it might be like a scene just in front

248
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:01,839
of you with the eyes closed it might be like a projection screen or or a scenery that's in front of you

249
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:09,200
there's kind of some directionality it's there there were since are watching it and that sense of location for the

250
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:16,960
inner voice if you can find it or the directionality of seeing an image is a

251
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:22,240
is a is a means by which to know or start noticing the extra energy

252
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:28,480
that goes into thinking uh if it's an inner voice there's often a kind of contraction and tightness and

253
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:34,480
pressure if there's a lot of extra energy that goes into thinking if it's a lot of imagery there might

254
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:40,720
also be a contraction or a tightness but it might be in a different location for some people it might actually be

255
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:46,720
around their physical eyes even with the eyes closed because they're seeing of an image

256
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:52,880
there's a kind of habit maybe of engaging the eyes to kind of focus on the image

257
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,520
and so there might be tension in the eye area

258
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,880
but by noticing the location where thinking seems to be occurring it's also possible to notice how much

259
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,520
energy is being expended for this and the and the emotions that might be

260
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,920
connected to the energy and so um to um

261
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:24,960
you start start seeing there's more to thinking than just the thoughts more to thinking

262
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:30,640
just the images there's the energy that's involved the tensions that are involved

263
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:38,880
the pressure there is the interest that's involved with thinking the curiosity the the being glued or

264
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:46,319
lobbed you know locked onto it sometimes it can be the feeling there can be some emotionality connected

265
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:52,319
to thinking um that's may sometimes the emotions are the fuel for it or the source for what

266
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:58,560
we're thinking about and so it's possible to to step back

267
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:04,640
in a sense settle back and just observe thinking and without necessarily

268
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:11,760
observing the content of the thought the content is often not so important

269
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:17,520
for the purpose of meditation but the associated aspects of thinking

270
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:24,319
the energy the tension the directionality the location the emotionality to it the interest we

271
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:30,480
have to it all those not to study them and get too active but all those

272
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:37,040
you can step back and kind of observe and and that all gives you access

273
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:45,280
to the instructions to experience the the mental activity so in this case

274
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:52,079
to experi to experience what it's like to be thinking or to say it differently to really feel

275
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:58,560
it feel it somatically physically almost even though it's mental there might be

276
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,480
some the sensations of thinking and

277
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:10,000
and this and this allows us to not be so and the more we kind of disinvest

278
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:15,680
ourselves from the story and the ideas and but without dismissing the thinking

279
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:20,720
and experiencing different parts of thinking thinking that by itself tends to become

280
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,000
quieter and stiller and and as thinking becomes quieter and

281
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:33,599
stiller then that's then we may be able to better more fully stay with the in-breath and

282
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:40,880
the out breath focusing on the body breathing and um and do so maybe with more sense of

283
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:46,720
ease more sense of uh well-being that comes along just the simplicity the

284
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:51,920
contentment being content just to be present and breathe

285
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:59,440
more often than not the discontent about life and the impatience belongs to the realm of thinking and

286
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:05,838
uh or fueled by thinking so

287
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:13,040
this is not an instruction to get really busy to notice and focus on thinking but

288
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,560
rather to stay with your breathing and and don't be bothered by it don't be

289
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,599
troubled by it but as it becomes uh relevant

290
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:32,079
uh to touch into an extr being an experiencing feeling what's happening as you breathe

291
00:45:32,079 --> 00:45:38,400
and and maybe with the idea that you're breathing through the thinking breathing with your thinking so the

292
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:47,119
breathing supports you're not getting caught in whatever you're thinking about but you can just observe it and feel it

293
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:53,280
so may you develop a new relationship with

294
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:59,359
your thinking don't assume that the way that you think is the way it has to be

295
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:05,520
there might be wonderful delightful relaxing creative and

296
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:13,280
wise ways of thinking that take a very different form than how you're thinking these days usually

297
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:21,920
so thank you very very much and i look forward to seeing you tomorrow
