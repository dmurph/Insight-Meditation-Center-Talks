1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,799
well tonight we have a surprised guest speaker I was surprised when I got a call at 5

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,900
30 that our regular guest speaker wasn't able to be here tonight so

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:18,139
Hillary asked me if I would fill in

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,039
so I started putting a few thoughts together about what to talk about tonight

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:33,180
um and not only what I want to talk about tonight but I'd like I'm hoping that

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,300
I'll be able to hear from at least some of you tonight as well

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:47,120
as you know in a couple of days it'll be Thanksgiving it's a national holiday

8
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:54,660
we're obviously not the only nation that engages in Thanksgiving

9
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:01,399
um and

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,900
I've thought about Thanksgiving a lot in my life

11
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:17,820
um I think I I was I started out thinking

12
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:25,680
that Thanksgiving was giving thanks to other people was sort of a social nicety like you know kind of

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,479
an obligation that I'd have when I would get clothes for Christmas instead of toys

14
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:39,180
or uh or tools both both of which I really liked

15
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:46,020
um so there was I started out with a certain sense of Thanksgiving as being a little bit

16
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:50,840
artificial you know and something that you had to kind of

17
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:59,640
social ritual or something but I think particularly when I when I

18
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:08,280
came to the Dharma I started to recognize the

19
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:15,980
the ways in which I'm supported by so many people

20
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:22,800
um living and and no longer living and that

21
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,160
Thanksgiving in a way is a a recognition of that connection

22
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,640
with all of the people primarily people that support me in my

23
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:43,620
life so if I go sort of quasiqua

24
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,920
chronologically um

25
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:57,019
I give thanks for my parents they both

26
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:06,620
took care of me in many ways that I didn't really appreciate or feel grateful for at the time

27
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:14,099
necessarily but um they kept me fed they kept me

28
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:22,200
house that kept me clothed and they kept me educated I I was in

29
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,920
school from the age of three I was in preschool all the way through graduate school and

30
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,700
when I was 29 so I got a lot of years of education and through that all my parents

31
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:42,659
supported me um some financially some

32
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:49,140
um I think mostly just by encouraging me they they knew that this was something

33
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:56,459
worth pursuing even though as a chemistry graduate student I'm sure they

34
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:03,920
didn't understand what it was that I was learning but they they knew that it was something valuable

35
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:09,319
so they encouraged me that way

36
00:04:10,019 --> 00:04:12,200
um

37
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:26,040
and then and then as I said they they made sure that I was stayed healthy and fed and

38
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:31,680
um and also looked out for my spiritual

39
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,199
well-being not just my physical and intellectual well-being but they took me to church

40
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:45,360
which as a young child I didn't feel particularly thankful for uh

41
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,740
I could think of a lot funner things to do on a Sunday morning than you know put on a sports coat and

42
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:58,080
get all dressed up with a tie and these uncomfortable clothes and have to

43
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:05,340
sit still for an hour but you know but they did

44
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:14,460
um instill in me a lot of qualities of heart and mind of ethics

45
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,199
of um

46
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:26,100
you know if I go through what the Buddha considered were the foundations for practice you know even

47
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:31,940
before you start meditating uh things like generosity

48
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:36,960
my parents were very generous

49
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,440
um virtuous you know that sense of ethics

50
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:49,080
of treating other people uh fairly and

51
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:55,199
kindly uh Simplicity renunciation

52
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,080
um we didn't have a

53
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:08,360
lavishly appointed house it was fairly simple but um

54
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:16,100
but it was supportive and enjoyable um

55
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,960
the need for paying attention the need for

56
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:29,060
exerting energy you know getting

57
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:36,240
um uh strongly encouraged to get out of bed

58
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,520
in the morning and face the the what the day had to offer

59
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:48,419
patience truthfulness honesty

60
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:56,340
determination Goodwill towards others

61
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:02,699
and Equanimity so those are the the 10 paramies that the Buddha

62
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:09,419
um says the Earth encourage people to

63
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:14,580
develop before they even started to meditate

64
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,819
I realized that as I looked at that list those were all qualities that my parents

65
00:07:19,819 --> 00:07:27,479
encouraged in me and also modeled for me so I feel I feel real thankful I I

66
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:36,000
didn't know that they were preparing me to be a Buddhist um not that those qualities are by any

67
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,759
means uh strictly owned by the Buddhists I think their qualities that are

68
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,380
probably valued in in many if if not all traditions

69
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:59,099
and I'm thankful for the larger family that I had my grandparents

70
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:04,819
um you know we'd spend every Sunday night with them

71
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:14,280
um gave us many um books and experiences

72
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,740
my brother and sisters my aunt

73
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:26,000
I I realized that I I really had a

74
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,979
I'd say a I don't know exactly how to say

75
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:37,279
a non-dysfunctional family uh

76
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,240
they're quite functional

77
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:53,940
uh the friends that I had you know I've had a whole series of friends starting from you know before I

78
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:59,760
started school from kindergarten through grade school and

79
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,779
high school College brought me a whole another set of friends graduate school brought

80
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:12,180
another set getting married brought me another set

81
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:18,420
getting divorced brought me another set going to work

82
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:23,459
and then coming here coming to IMC is has brought me in contact with a whole

83
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:29,940
nother set of friends and people who

84
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:35,779
um have supported me have given me a sense of

85
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:40,440
being appreciated heard

86
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:48,959
um and many friends have come and gone and

87
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:55,380
I've seen changes in the to a certain extent in the people that

88
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:02,600
are around me but I still have a friend from kindergarten that I I've

89
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:12,560
remained friends with for I don't know 65 years now

90
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:22,440
uh I'm thankful for my health I've been fairly health healthful healthy

91
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,880
uh and what haven't been I've I've had the resources to get the the needed

92
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:36,600
procedures and surgeries for uh detached retina and

93
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:42,600
stents in my heart things like that

94
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,560
ah

95
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:55,920
so those are some of you know some of the I'll say almost ordinary things of life

96
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:03,680
that I feel thankful for that I think everyone has had some experience with

97
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:12,660
uh but the and in addition to all of those

98
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:19,200
things I feel real grateful for this practice

99
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,680
is this uh practice that the Buddha

100
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:31,220
uncovered or realized and passed down

101
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:40,220
for approximately a hundred Generations I went through a

102
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:47,279
What's called the um The Refuge class that's offered here

103
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:55,140
every couple of years and at the end of it there's a ceremony where Gill would hand each one of us a

104
00:11:55,140 --> 00:12:01,860
little parchment that had a list of I don't know if it was an entire list

105
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,899
of every single teacher but kind of represented all of the teachers

106
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:12,480
going back up approximately 100 generations to the

107
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,500
Buddha and

108
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:25,940
so I can say that I'm thankful that first of all that the Buddha decided after

109
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:32,040
he saw what was possible what was possible for a human being

110
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:38,160
to realize and what level of Freedom could be experienced

111
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,620
he had to make a choice whether he was I think at first he didn't even believe

112
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:49,019
that anybody could learn this he figured you know this is this isn't even

113
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:56,959
teachable but he did The Story Goes have a discussion with a

114
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:03,240
enlightened being I think a God or a Deva that he should teach

115
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:10,860
and because of that you know he taught you know his his students and that got passed down

116
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:19,320
and passed down and passed down and ended up with people like Gill and

117
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:24,959
Andrea Joseph Goldstein

118
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,300
Jack cornfield uh and many other teachers

119
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:38,399
and uh about well I guess it was almost 25

120
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:45,320
years ago that I came to IMC I was 45 at the time

121
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,620
and even though I had quite a good life I mean I as all of the things that I had

122
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:56,700
described I had been well supported I had been well educated

123
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:04,279
I was in good health I had a good job with NASA

124
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:11,480
and yet I recognized there was just some uh

125
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:18,480
some lingering dissatisfaction you know something that I couldn't quite

126
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:25,320
put my finger on it I couldn't quite tell you why I was dissatisfied

127
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:30,480
uh you know all of the all the indicators were that

128
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:34,940
you know you've got it together

129
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:43,500
um but I knew that I knew that there was something off there just was this was

130
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:46,639
you know this wasn't

131
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,519
there was some restlessness some lack of peace or uh contentment

132
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:03,060
and so when I walked into I am the IMC meetings which at the time were in Palo Alto

133
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:08,880
um the first talk I heard was Gil talking about the four normal truths and talking

134
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:16,440
about the truth of suffering and it was that night that I recognized I've

135
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:23,579
come to the right place this is the place to be this guy is talking about exactly what I'm experiencing this

136
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:29,279
suffering and not only that it's worth paying attention to

137
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:34,560
but that there's a cause for it there's the possibility of the ending of

138
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,740
it and that there's this Eightfold Path there's this there are things to be done

139
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:47,220
to be cultivated to be um pursued in some ways

140
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:54,440
um to bring an end to this suffering and

141
00:15:54,959 --> 00:16:03,600
I don't I can't tell you exactly how I I came to IMC almost

142
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:09,240
on a whim you know it's just I somebody had told me about Spirit Rock and from

143
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:15,779
looking at their website I found a link to IMC IMC happen to be 10 minutes from my

144
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:20,820
house and so I came and I sat and I listened

145
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:27,180
to Gil and I reckon you know and I saw oh this this is this is the practice is this is

146
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,579
what I'm looking for this is the kind of practice the

147
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:38,399
um potentiality that I wanna I wanna spend

148
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:45,380
my the rest of my life pursuing

149
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:55,800
so I so I it's hard for me to just Express

150
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:02,100
how much gratitude I have that that not only for Gill who's a

151
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:07,558
wonderful teacher and has really helped me a long ways but then all the

152
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:13,500
other teachers that he exposed me to I'd say maybe 50 percent of the about

153
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:20,699
half the time he would give a talk on a Monday night and about half the time it would be somebody from Zen Center somebody from

154
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:28,020
uh Spirit Rock um lay people monastics

155
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:35,000
people from a wide range of backgrounds and experiences

156
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:43,020
that um presented the dharm in ways that seemed very different and sometimes almost at

157
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:48,140
odds with what I had heard the week before but yet

158
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:53,760
uh gave me a sense of just what

159
00:17:53,760 --> 00:18:01,159
the breadth of what practice can encompass

160
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:12,620
so in some ways coming to IMC 25 years ago um

161
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:23,520
brought an awareness to me of the first Refuge the Buddha

162
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:28,860
not that I had the same had developed anywhere near the the level that the

163
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,380
Buddha had to be as free as he was able to become but that that was a

164
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:40,280
potentiality um

165
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:48,600
the years and years of talks like this the Monday night talks

166
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:54,480
um that I've been attending well really for almost 25 years

167
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,020
except when I'm out of town uh

168
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:06,440
books um

169
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:12,600
you know suit to studies residential Retreats there's just so

170
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:20,039
many ways in which the the practices of

171
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:26,580
that the Buddha taught have been presented to me and I've been

172
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:32,460
mentored in I'm grateful for all of those teachers

173
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:41,280
and mentors the the third Refuge is the Sangha

174
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:48,299
and really at first I didn't really recognize what

175
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:55,440
I thought the the real important thing was the teacher having a good teacher

176
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:03,360
and I think after about the first six months that I was at IMC I came up to Gill and

177
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:09,480
I said you know I really want to you know get ahead in this practice I

178
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:18,360
I want to meet with you at least you know like once a week or once every two weeks and he didn't he didn't laugh

179
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:25,860
like you all are um I think he took me seriously

180
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:32,220
but he but also it was clear that he has so much that he does that that wasn't

181
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:39,120
really a possibility but what he told me was that one of his teachers

182
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:44,400
at Zen Center had told him many years ago when he I think sort of said the

183
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:51,240
same thing to his teacher uh it might have been Mel Weitzman

184
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:57,179
um that some large fraction of what you're going to learn

185
00:20:57,179 --> 00:21:02,700
you're going to learn from your peers you're going to learn from

186
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:08,940
sitting with other people Like We Are Tonight

187
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:14,580
um and talking about practice what you know what are you seeing you know what

188
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:21,320
insights are you having what struggles are you having um

189
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:32,100
it was one of the things that was said to me over and over early in my practice when

190
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:37,559
I was doing a lot of Retreats was that we don't do this practice for

191
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:44,580
ourselves alone so there's some way in which

192
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,679
hello nobody but us can

193
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:57,840
sit and close our eyes and pay attention I mean there are things that we have to do only we can do

194
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:03,480
that the benefit of it and the result of it isn't limited to

195
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:10,980
this being I call me that there's very much a interaction

196
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:18,900
between me and the other people that um are part of my Sangha

197
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:25,559
so at this point in time there's three groups that I'm part of there's one that

198
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:33,539
meets once a month one that meets every two weeks and one that meets every week

199
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:40,679
and in both the talking and the listening in

200
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:45,780
those uh kalyanamita groups is where a

201
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:53,940
lot of the insight and the strengthening of qualities can occur and

202
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:58,280
a lot of the encouragement a lot of the inspiration

203
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:07,980
yeah so that's so that's Sangha so I'm

204
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,080
you know on this Thanksgiving week

205
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:19,440
uh I don't

206
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:26,159
I don't know whether it's karma or dumb luck that I was able to come across IMC

207
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:31,620
when I did right right when I uh was looking for

208
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:38,520
what it had to offer but I'm really thankful for

209
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:45,179
um the teachers the Sangha and the

210
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:51,140
hand the the teachers going all the way back to the Buddha

211
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:04,980
the other thought that came to me this evening around Thanksgiving and

212
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:12,059
around um recognizing and expressing gratitude is

213
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:17,940
that it isn't that that it's

214
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:25,020
a little bit like a form of mindfulness it's it's remembering

215
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:30,659
those things that happened that support us

216
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:37,020
you know that have supported us maybe today or yesterday or earlier this week

217
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:43,220
or this month this year this lifetime

218
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:53,760
it's not necessarily a Feeling

219
00:24:53,760 --> 00:25:00,659
or just a feeling but gratitude I think is also an ability and ability to

220
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:07,620
to wreck to remember and recognize those things that support us

221
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,600
and connect us with other people

222
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:19,679
one of the practices that I've heard about in regards to gratitude is

223
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:25,080
some people will keep a gratitude Journal so they'll have a journal

224
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:31,260
oftentimes next to their bed and either just before they go to bed at night or maybe when they wake up in the morning

225
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:36,299
is writing down things that you remembered

226
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:42,419
that that you're grateful for that supported you you know it could be something like

227
00:25:42,419 --> 00:25:52,260
just the way somebody smiled at you today you know some or you know some small

228
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:57,779
um gesture of Goodwill or um

229
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:03,059
you know whatever it is that that's one particular way that that that this

230
00:26:03,059 --> 00:26:10,500
quality this strength of this muscle of gratitude can be um

231
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:17,000
developed I think it's also helpful

232
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:24,659
to not just recognize it internally but also

233
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:32,760
to express it verbally I mean maybe not all the time but I've had this practice for about the

234
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:37,460
last 15 years of um

235
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:46,140
when I when I get food or get drinks from Starbucks or something like that

236
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:54,360
I always like to thank the person that's made the made whatever it was for me you know

237
00:26:54,360 --> 00:27:01,620
and also give them some tip but um I'm often surprised at how

238
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:06,900
surprised some people are when you just you just thank them for making you hot

239
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:13,200
chocolate um you know just that recognition that

240
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:20,240
um that there's that there's some connection there

241
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:28,559
so uh that's as much as I've prepared for

242
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:34,140
tonight but I would like to offer each one of you the opportunity

243
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:39,960
to express what you might be grateful for

244
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:47,940
so this isn't a you're not obligated to say anything but um this is your opportunity to uh

245
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:53,840
you know just Express you know share with us

246
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,880
some thing or some things that

247
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,760
um you can remember from today or

248
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:12,000
you know the last couple of days or whatever length of time it is

249
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:18,659
um that you've been uh

250
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:24,240
gifted so I don't know it's about that if you

251
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:32,059
couldn't if you feel moved raise your hand and sveta will bring the microphone

252
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:37,500
foreign

253
00:28:46,620 --> 00:28:52,980
thank you Jim first of all I am

254
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:59,039

256
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:11,700
and I think you're a great model for Equanimity and thank you for filling in

257
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:17,640
for tonight I did also want to say um

258
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:25,380
that I am grateful for my relationship with uh indigenous people who

259
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:31,799
this particular um holiday is problematic for

260
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:39,000
and I extend my love and respect to them and for the conflict it presents for

261
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,580
them uh and I just want to recognize that on their behalf

262
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:51,200
thank you Nancy

263
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:08,520
yes well thank you also for the the surprise to talk um

264
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:15,840
but yeah so I'm just this is the fourth time I've been here to IMC on a on a Monday evening and I'm happy I I found

265
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:21,419
it I used to sit a long time ago at cannondough for a few years but then I

266
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:27,539
was looking for a place I could get to that was on the Caltrain this was a that this was perfect so I'm really

267
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:35,000
enjoying it so far thank you

268
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:43,799
I'm grateful to be

269
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:50,220
to hear your talk and recognize the Heritage that we've inherited

270
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:57,299
why the lineage and the relationships that that you've built

271
00:30:57,299 --> 00:31:03,480
and that are available um as I look at

272
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:09,779
um wanting to feel connected with friends and see the ones that are there for me

273
00:31:09,779 --> 00:31:17,399
because there's been a death in the family and I really do have that need for people

274
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:23,820
reaching out and those relationships and I I know in this community that's the

275
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:32,779
priority you know is relationships and um growing together so to me that's

276
00:31:32,779 --> 00:31:38,419
that's heartening that it's a priority

277
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:50,399
thank you for your share um I have come on and off to IMC and uh I

278
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:57,299
happen to come Sunday and both your share and that one were very uh connecting for me

279
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:04,260
um particularly the concept of change came up and I think

280
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:11,340
The Fall season is really one where we really see visually change

281
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,500
and I I got a lot out of the realization that

282
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:22,140
that's one thing that will always be happening and

283
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:27,720
gave me the insight to realize that there's a little struggle for me a lot

284
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:35,460
of the time about change and that if I can remain compassionate with my resistance but then be aware of

285
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:41,299
it that I can let it be exactly what it is

286
00:32:41,299 --> 00:32:46,440
and so uh thank you again very very nice of you

287
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,200
thank you thank you

288
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:06,919
thank you for uh a great session and also sharing your experiences

289
00:33:06,919 --> 00:33:13,620
I'm very grateful to be here to be part of this group

290
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,659
um in particular um

291
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:24,360
when I see you you remind me of

292
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:30,259
Gregory Peck of Indian theaters

293
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:38,580
um wearing a red top and you know the black trousers

294
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:45,019
um and uh Johnny Johnny Mirana

295
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:50,419
guide guide is one movie with a Polish

296
00:33:50,419 --> 00:33:56,760
novel based on polish no guide from 1966.

297
00:33:57,059 --> 00:34:03,659
um and I grew up in a rather modest setting

298
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:10,858
where access to TV or entertainment was limited

299
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:18,060
but today I am grateful that just with the click of a button on the internet any child

300
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:24,599
throughout the world through the invention of internet and

301
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:30,358
cell phone Technologies they can see watch movies and musicals and songs

302
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:36,240
featuring individuals like you and whatnot and

303
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:42,960
and you know in one that is another movie where he goes on

304
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:52,138
to talk about you know Buddha's preaching ahinsa parama Dharma

305
00:34:52,139 --> 00:35:00,060
um and there also he is wearing this red top so what I am grateful for is

306
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:06,359
for all the people around the world all the children

307
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:11,820
that they have access to Internet and access to

308
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:19,500
you know the entertainment or music or movies or theater whatever or news or

309
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:27,540
Whatever by the invention of Internet and also keeping the cost down so it's it's

310
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:32,700
affordable for most people but if it is

311
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:39,000
even more affordable and accessible I will be even more grateful and being able to share that

312
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:47,720
with other people so that Joy thank you yeah thank you

313
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:56,160
by the way Gregory Peck is my favorite actor so that was quite a compliment for

314
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,338

Jamie thank you

316
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:17,160
um yeah and the meditation before this I

317
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:22,760
was sitting here and um

318
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:29,339
I I have a lot of difficulty keeping on the object of meditation my mind is

319
00:36:29,339 --> 00:36:35,160
often going off somewhere and I guess lately I've

320
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:43,200
um become a little bit more equanimous about that and uh so I just sort of um

321
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:50,040
when it when awareness comes back I I just note what's going on and uh in

322
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:56,220
the meditation before this when I when awareness came back I was often thinking

323
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:02,640
about how warm and cozy I felt not just

324
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:10,140
because I'm bundled up and wearing gloves but also just feeling very secure in this

325
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:16,740
place and um with these people around me

326
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:22,619
um uh so I'm very grateful for

327
00:37:22,619 --> 00:37:29,940
this place of all the volunteers that that help maintain it and uh

328
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:35,780

329
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:44,160

340
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:13,260
Buddha's teaching because each one of you shared

341
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:19,380
it's really touching and we each of us

342
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:25,560
take what we can nourish us

343
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,599
and help us to go

344
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:42,320
to move forward in our life and to me seems like

345
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:49,820
takes layers I have to get on a certain level to see

346
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:56,880
there's additional teaching that I can comprehend

347
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:04,800
and um and this environment this IMC is so

348
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:10,740
precious is

349
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:17,640
there's no pressure it's very relaxed it's whatever

350
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:24,839
that we can be nourished and learned

351
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:30,540
and I just so appreciate it

352
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:36,960
and thank you Jim for giving us this opportunity to reflect

353
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:45,800
you know what what is Sangha offer to each of us

354
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,780
and everybody's different and that's what great about Buddha

355
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:57,060
you know we learn we practice and

356
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:03,359
um learn based on our own experiences

357
00:41:03,359 --> 00:41:10,020
not uh it's a inside out it's not an outside in

358
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:15,078
practice thank you

359
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:19,579
thank you Lydia

360
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:40,579
we have a couple more minutes is there anyone else that would just like to

361
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,780
say anything

362
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:27,359
um at the risk of being a little bit of a buzz kale I wanted to say that I'm grateful for the folks here and out on

363
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:33,480
YouTube um you find it very difficult to go through the holidays like both

364
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:38,760
Thanksgiving and for the rest of the season um

365
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:45,300
those who find it uh difficult to remember when the last time

366
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:51,720
they had something to be grateful about was I just wanted to say that I'm grateful for you

367
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:59,339
and in the rinse I Zen tradition there's a practice of

368
00:42:59,339 --> 00:43:05,700
looking at cohens which are like sort of inscrutable puzzle questions

369
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:12,180
um and for a lot of us these times kind of present themselves

370
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:17,700
as a co-op to work through um

371
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:22,980
yeah and I hope you keep pushing to figure out what the

372
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:25,760
answer is

373
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:35,520
Thank You Sage there's something that uh there's a

374
00:43:35,520 --> 00:43:42,060
Tibetan teacher that I listen to every other Sunday unumtube chin and the last

375
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:46,280
talk from about two weeks ago was about

376
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,880
um welcoming what challenges us so there's always the possibility of

377
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:59,040
being thankful for the challenges I think they're

378
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,220
we don't always welcome them but uh

379
00:44:04,859 --> 00:44:08,539
they hold potential

380
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:24,380
okay well thank you all I've really enjoyed hearing uh what you had to say and um

381
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:33,900
and yeah have a

382
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:36,740
have a good week
