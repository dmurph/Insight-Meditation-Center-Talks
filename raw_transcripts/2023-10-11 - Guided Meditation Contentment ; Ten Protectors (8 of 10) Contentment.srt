1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,720
hello and good morning for those of you here

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:14,679
on who living in places where it's Dawn and uh or

3
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,880
morning and good day for everyone

4
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:25,599
else and there is a dangerous teaching in

5
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,599
Buddhism so dangerous that um I've been told that in one Buddhist country in

6
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,280
South Asia that um the government forbade Buddhist monks from teaching it

7
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:45,800
it's so dangerous and uh and that's the danger that I'll be offering you today so I

8
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,320
want to contextualize a little bit but first I'll tell you what the danger is

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,000
and that is practicing contentment and the reason why

10
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,800
governments don't like it business corporations capitalism doesn't like it

11
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:10,400
is that then people if they're too content they won't consume more if they're too content content um they

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:18,360
won't uh push themselves to work harder and and um build more make more make

13
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:25,920
more money and uh in a certain way maybe many economies are based on

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,000
discontent so they can keep going imagine the

15
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,880
headlines the world became content and economies failed

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,960
everywhere so it's a dangerous teaching and maybe is not always appropriate so

17
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,119
one of the ways of beginning a meditation practice is to settle down a

18
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:58,520
little bit and then check in with oneself and discern how you

19
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,960
are some sometimes what's needed is just simple basic

20
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:11,520
mindfulness sometimes what's needed is a little bit of more focus on concentration to overcome a distracted

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,920
mind sometimes what's needed is uh truth-telling to really admit to oneself

22
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:22,239
what's happening and then we can settle sometimes what's needed is a lot

23
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,720
of compassion a lot of care and kindness

24
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:33,120
forgiveness sometimes what's needed is

25
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,440
um what's useful at least is

26
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:45,360
gratitude sometimes what's needed is um

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:52,040
patience and sometimes what's helpful is contentment and primarily when there's a

28
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:58,239
lot of discontent sometimes there can be a contentment that just comes along where

29
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,840
we're not really driven by desires driven by an aversion to how things

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,640
are and we're just very content just to sit and meditate to have a certain contentment

31
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,480
to meditate it helps to distinguish between the actions we take in our

32
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,879
life some things need to change in life and and we're not supposed to simply be

33
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:30,360
content with how things are and not change things but when we're sitting to meditate we don't have to act

34
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:37,239
and now we're trying to orient ourselves in a very different way and if there's a lot of difficulties

35
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:44,080
a lot of emotional difficulties challenges that we have then maybe contentment is not the

36
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:50,200
right way of honoring and respecting that or it might be the contentment to

37
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:55,920
just be with it to be content this is what's true now and so I'll be present

38
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:01,280
I'll practice my mindfulness with this difficulty

39
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,879
so to check in at the beginning and deciding what is appropriate so for this today's

40
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,920
meditation on contentment if this is not appropriate for you you're welcome

41
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:18,199
to take what is useful or ignore what I

42
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:24,280
say so to assume a meditation

43
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:31,560
posture lower the Gaze

44
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:37,280
maybe with the eyes slightly open something different way of

45
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:43,240
connecting to oneself if one now takes some long slow deep

46
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:49,680
breaths breathing in breathing

47
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,800
out relaxing as we

48
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,639
exhale and if if as you exhale it feels good to close your

49
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:09,080
eyes feel the goodness of that clo of closing

50
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,479
them and letting your breathing return to normal on the

51
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:34,240
exhale gently relaxing the

52
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,120
face on the inhale feeling the any tension in the

53
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:52,360
shoulders and when you exhale relax the

54
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
shoulders

55
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:17,880
on the inhale feeling the belly as you exhale relax

56
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
soften

57
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:43,280
and the inhale feeling whatever emotions or state of heart you

58
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,360
have on the exhale a softening around

59
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
it

60
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,440
on the inhale feeling the state of your thinking

61
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:16,440
mind and on the exhale relaxing the thinking

62
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
mind

63
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
for

64
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,840
and then is there any place in your

65
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:30,400
body where you feel contentment either now or

66
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:36,518
at other times when you feel content where is it living

67
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:53,360
you when you have had contentment in your life feeling deeply content in the

68
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:01,200
moment what has it felt like in your body

69
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,600
what has it felt like in your

70
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,880
heart and in your

71
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
mind

72
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:42,720
and here we are meditating a remarkable

73
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:51,160
event for some of you it's a daily event it's still an amazing thing that

74
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:58,720
we have the ability time and circumstances to be able to sit down

75
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:06,480
to make meditate a Time free of our

76
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,839
responsibilities tasks of Life busyness of

77
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:19,839
Life maybe even free of some of the challenges of our

78
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:29,640
mind and to sit quietly to find something some way to

79
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:32,040
feel

80
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:43,760
content it's easy to be discontented which is always kind of

81
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:51,920
particular and overlooks the vast number of things right

82
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,240
now that we can be content

83
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
about

84
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:21,320
when people practice a mindfulness there's something very

85
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:26,720
important very an opportunity that's really

86
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:34,920
phenomenal the opportunity to be content with being

87
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:42,000
mindful content with a power of being aware without fixing

88
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:48,480
acting having it different just aware just

89
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:57,279

mindfully breathing surrounded by an

91
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,720
attitude of content with this moment

discontentment can you find a contentment where you're not focusing on

for and as we come to the end of this

124
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:09,799
sitting to appreciate that contentment is one of the great states

125
00:27:09,799 --> 00:27:16,200
of being it's a healthy

126
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:24,720
state that represents many things but it represents or as an

127
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:32,360
expression of a mind which is not

128
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:39,480
discontented not struggling or fighting or resisting or afraid or caught in

129
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,398
desires and

130
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:53,679
conceits contentment allows this psychophysical system of ours to operate

131
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:59,518
without agitation without

132
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,799
something activated contentment allows us to feel

133
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,960
the

134
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:19,720
whole and to whatever degree that we appreciate contentment is a valuable

135
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:25,880
healthy state may we wish it for

136
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:34,159
Others May our contentment be a nourishment for

137
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:40,559
Others May our contentment help bring calm and

138
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:50,039
peace May our contentment help us to be more generous

139
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:57,000
and loving for Others May our contentment protect us

140
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:00,360
from being caught up in

141
00:29:04,519 --> 00:29:12,279
ourselves May the benefit of practicing meditation be for the benefits of all

142
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:18,080
all people everywhere may all

143
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,640
people be happy

144
00:29:23,399 --> 00:29:31,679
contented may all people everywhere be safe and

145
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:39,398
protected may all people everywhere be

146
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:48,919
peaceful able to rest at ease may all people

147
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:56,320
everywhere be free free of Oppression and

148
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:01,919
violence free of hostility and

149
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:13,240
fear and maybe this these possibilities for others be something that our practice

150
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:16,519
supports

151
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:26,080
implicitly unintentionally and intentionally may we contribute to the

152
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,600
welfare and happiness of this

153
00:30:39,810 --> 00:30:43,030
[Music]

154
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,960
world thank

155
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,240
you

156
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:53,600
I'll be back in a

157
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,159
moment

158
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:52,159
so hello everyone and welcome to this series on the 10

159
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:59,000
protectors and so today's uh protection is as to do with

160
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:04,559
contentment uh and it's a particular form of contentment but before I talk

161
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:10,600
about the particularity of it I'll say a few things repeating myself from the guided

162
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:16,039
meditation that uh there are people who consider contentment to be a dangerous

163
00:33:16,039 --> 00:33:21,919
State because it undermines uh the

164
00:33:21,919 --> 00:33:28,399
motivation that people get from being discontented that uh uh if we want to if

165
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:34,559
we're discontented with the State of Affairs as we they are then uh we won't

166
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:41,000
fight we don't work to change them and uh and certainly there are

167
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:48,080
things we should not be content with and there are things that maybe are

168
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,720
not healthy to be discontented with the there are people who have

169
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:59,480
plenty of money who are discontented with uh what they have and want to be

170
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:06,440
richer than that there are people who have uh plenty of Pleasures but always

171
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:13,200
want more there are people who uh have plenty

172
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:18,480
of stuff but they always want more

173
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:26,320
better um and so to be driven by discontent is what supports you know

174
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:33,040
many e eies in the world and so there's there's a vested interest in people

175
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:40,240
who many people to keep us discontented so we keep buying or so we keep working

176
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:48,679
long hours to try to get ahead and uh and to kind of uh be

177
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:58,680
feeding or encouraging discontent is I think part of what advertisements do and and um

178
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,720
so to in some ways to be content in in

179
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:09,680
uh in certain ways is a radical act it's a disrupting

180
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:16,079
act um from the Buddhist point of view the benefit of

181
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:21,920
contentment is that then it's easier to focus on the practice to focus on what's

182
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:27,880
Happening Here and Now and uh if uh

183
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,480
there and then are is a two-dimensional reality and if fantasy is a

184
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:39,280
one-dimensional reality then uh being really rooted and grounded here in

185
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:45,720
ourselves um is uh entering into a three-dimensional reality it's more Rich

186
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:53,920
it's more multicolors like going from black and white to multicolor and um and this being this

187
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,560
three-dimensional reality of Now does not mean that we don't think about the past and the future or that we don't in

188
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:06,520
some ways let the creative mind fantasize but we do it rooted here we

189
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:13,079
don't lose touch with this place here and contentment is one of the great uh

190
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:20,319
states that helps us to be rooted and and able to stay here and the teachings on these 10

191
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:25,440
protectors the Buddha was giving the teachings to monastics and for them he

192
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:31,480
said that they should be content with the basic necessities of life and what

193
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:36,839
is not often recognized is the monastic lifestyle designed by the Buddha might

194
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:45,280
look like a deprived life from the point of view of how many people in the modern West might be living um but uh it was

195
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,640
meant in Ancient India to be the middle way where just enough uh basic

196
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:56,720
necessities are provided to live well but not more than that but not was not

197
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,359
not ancient India understood to be a life of deprivation it wasn't considered to be an aesthetic life because there

198
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:09,160
were people who uh were more extreme in that direction uh for the Buddha we were not

199
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,440
supposed to harm ourselves so there was no aesthetic uh you know flagellations

200
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:20,319
that was going on but rather uh this uh enter into this meditation that was

201
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:25,640
understood to be a pleasant abiding an enjoyable place to be provided that we

202
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:31,319
had the basic necessity ities and so what monks and nuns are you know content

203
00:37:31,319 --> 00:37:37,880
with is um the food the food that comes in their arms bow the clothes they have

204
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:44,359
the shelters that are given to them and the basic medicine uh to uh for their

205
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:50,000
for their health so those are the four uh basic

206
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,560
necessities and to be content with that and how many of us maybe are not so

207
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:01,280
content with just having the having the basic necessities uh we have more the clothes

208
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:07,200
than we need and we are not buying clothes for the sake of just staying

209
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:15,319
warm and and protected from you know uh insects and such things dirt um but

210
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:23,319
we're getting clothes and paying a lot of money sometimes for um for other reasons and then to how many of us are

211
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:32,240
not content with having a simple roof over our house but we want a bigger house nicer house uh home or something

212
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:38,000
how many of us uh are not content with the basic necessity of food that we have

213
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:44,040
but we're you know buying food that's expensive and um we don't really need it

214
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:52,040
but it's so nice it's so pleasant it's so enjoyable and so for a monastic uh to be content with

215
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:59,359
the basic necessities then gives them it's easier to live ER radically simp simple lifestyle a lifestyle that allows

216
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:06,520
them to stay connected to the Dharma the Dharma that they love uh the the Dharma practice which they like to engage in

217
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:11,760
without having a lot of other things to take care of that um can make it harder

218
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:17,800
for this uh you know U Love Affair that monastics will have with the Dharma they

219
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:24,560
want to stay close to their lover uh it's so important to stay close and attend to it and let that relationship

220
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:30,480
grow and develop and flower um all day all moments of the life of of the

221
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:37,560
day so to be content with the basic necessities is the core thing here and

222
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:44,440
um for those of us living a l life it might be a little bit uh different what do we consider the basic

223
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:49,480
necessities uh the ancient Buddha didn't consider uh the emotional needs or the

224
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:56,000
interpersonal needs as as much as maybe is needed for people in modern cultures

225
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:03,720
and so we have a we have a richer kind of domain of basic necessities that we have to take care of um but

226
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:12,240
still uh can we find how much we need so we can be content and um and what is the nature of

227
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,480
our discontentment um if you feel discontented what is that why what's

228
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:25,599
driving the discontent uh is there some feeling of lack is there some feeling of insecurity

229
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:34,480
is there a strong sense of Desire what's that feeling of not enough like what's really happening here and is

230
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:40,839
there another way to address not having enough another way of addressing that

231
00:40:40,839 --> 00:40:47,359
something has to happen have to do something I have to be busy and really to settle something here to relax the

232
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:53,079
belly to relax the shoulders relax the mind and the heart to really sit sit sit

233
00:40:53,079 --> 00:40:59,599
down and learn how to be content even if that contentment is just for the period of the meditation

234
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,880
practice um the uh there are things we should be discontented about there's

235
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:11,560
healthy contentment and unhealthy discontentment uh there's

236
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:16,920
unhealthy there's healthy discontent and there's unhealthy discontent so both

237
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:22,800
both have their place and both can be unhealthy and so uh to be

238
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:29,960
discontented with our suffering to be discontented with a suff uffing of the world that might that's not necessarily

239
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:37,640
a bad thing that can be motivating for sure but uh and so we should act on that

240
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:43,240
one of the ways to act on that is to really sit and meditate and settle our

241
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,680
discontent um so that we don't add our suffering on top of suffering and be

242
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:55,680
contented enough to sit and be present for what's happening with us us and find the way through our Suffering From the

243
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,119
Inside Out out than trying to change the world around us so we don't

244
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:09,839
suffer and um and if we need to change the world around us because it is suffering then um to distinguish acting

245
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:16,240
in the world from the activity of meditating meditating meditating is not

246
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:24,119
the time to act this is a time for some other process to deepen and unfold and

247
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:31,480
to learn how to be content with a moment we're meditating so that we're not kind of still spinning and driven by the

248
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:37,720
desires to change the world or to get what we want or avoid what we don't want

249
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:43,200
uh to be content with our lives at at least for the period of meditation maybe

250
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:48,440
we have a time my Necessities are taken care of I have enough food for those of

251
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:56,160
us who do uh we have enough us we've had enough shelter for those of us who do we

252
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:02,680
we have enough clothing for those of us who do and we have enough medicine for now at

253
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:09,839
least for this moment for those of us who do and um and so to feel that

254
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:15,359
contentment that uh least for these minutes uh it's okay this is special

255
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:22,240
this is unusual for human beings to have the time the ability the wherewithal the

256
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:30,480
understanding the dedication to sit down and meditate meditation is a phenomenally useful and

257
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,559
important act and um it's a phenomenal gift to the world that the inner

258
00:43:36,559 --> 00:43:43,800
transformation that can happen through meditation um where we don't continue life with business as usual with greed

259
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:49,680
hate and delusion but we settle all that's all that's unresolved un

260
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,280
unsettled in us so that in that settle State some of the most beautiful

261
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:00,440
qualities of our being can come forth and represented by things like

262
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:06,960
generosity love and wisdom and then coming out of

263
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:14,400
meditation we have maybe a better way of knowing how to act and if there we are

264
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:19,680
discontented with the State of Affairs then um we know how to act and what to

265
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:27,040
do if we are discontented with all the dirty dishes in our kitchen then we go

266
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:32,440
and wash the dishes in a meditative way in a contemplative way in a respectful

267
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:38,400
present moment engaged way that feels like we're bringing meditation with us into our life and it's an enjoyable

268
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:45,119
thing we're not rushing off and multitasking if what we feel is uh the suffering of the world

269
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,359
elsewhere uh whether it's you know anywhere right now Israel is huge the

270
00:44:50,359 --> 00:44:56,680
suffering there the whole nation is traumatized or deep pain

271
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:03,200
uh Ukraine deep pain and um this goes on

272
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,839
if this really troubles us when we come out of meditation and we're discontented with those States then maybe we have the

273
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:18,520
generosity of the wherewithal to do something about them and even the smallest little act um may be offering u

274
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:24,920
a donation to Charities or to uh someone who's uh helping the sick and the

275
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:30,520
wounded or doing something we don't want to uh meditation

276
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:38,960
is not how how to be calm and uninterested in the world it's to be deeply

277
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:45,640
contented with ourselves with the moment in a certain way so that the what

278
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:51,040
motivates us to act in the World to Change the World comes from a place of

279
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:57,240
tremendous well-being comes from a place of generosity comes from the Wellsprings

280
00:45:57,240 --> 00:46:03,920
within of our goodness not from the agitation of our fear and distress and

281
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:12,559
our anger this is the possibility that contentment can bring so I would encourage you today to

282
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:20,200
explore this the your contentment and your discontentment do you would you care as

283
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:27,480
you go through the day maybe once an hour check in with yourself and would you characterize how you are as more on

284
00:46:27,480 --> 00:46:35,680
the discontented side of the spectrum or more on the contented side if you're

285
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:43,680
discontented what's happening what is that about can you settle it can you be present for it can you investigate it if

286
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:51,480
you're more on the contented side of the spectrum feel that enjoy that take that in be nourished by it and if it's just a

287
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:58,079
little bit on that Spectrum uh by recognizing the small amount of cont contentment you have is there some way

288
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:04,040
that's appropriate way to settle into it more fully so it becomes a resource that

289
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:12,440
supports and guides your day so thank you very much and

290
00:47:12,440 --> 00:47:17,880
um we have two more of these 10 protectors thank

291
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,880
