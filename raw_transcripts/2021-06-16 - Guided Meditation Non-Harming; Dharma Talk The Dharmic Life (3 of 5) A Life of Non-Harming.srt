1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,520
so warm hello to everyone and welcome

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,920
and one of the

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,000
simplest ways of talking about

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,199
the path of buddhism buddhist practice meditation buddhist meditation

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:38,960
the direction that buddhism is going is to avoid

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:44,000
causing harm everything about buddhism is somehow

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:50,879
encapsulated in this intention and it's a little bit unsatisfying and that would be nice to

8
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:58,320
have some grand positive statement but uh it's phenomenal

9
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,359
to live a life that doesn't cause harm

10
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:10,840
and in meditation that is not this means primarily

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,720
or not causing either not causing harm to oneself

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:24,079
or not having any thoughts that could be considered harmful for others

13
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,000
if they knew what you were thinking they would feel hurt

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:36,799
and and then in meditation part of the advantage of it it allows us

15
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:44,479
to see is that when we have thoughts that are hurtful harmful for others if they

16
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,840
knew what we were thinking or if we enacted them the very having those

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:57,520
thoughts chances are that they're also harming ourselves

18
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,719
and when we harm ourselves we set up the conditions the stresses the tensions within us

19
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,840
where it's easier than to harm others

20
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,520
so it's a quite a profound thing it's kind of like the and if you don't think it's enough for

21
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,680
you then think of it as the entry entry door to what is

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,480
greater or more profound it's the foundation not causing harm

23
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:34,080
so here we are and maybe this can be on the back of your mind the front of

24
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,760
your mind this beautiful thing this wonderful marvelous thing

25
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,239
that may be to sit here and be attentive enough to track your thoughts track what you're

26
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:52,319
doing to see if you can meditate for these minutes

27
00:02:52,319 --> 00:03:00,720
uh putting aside any letting go of any ways in which you are

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,840
causing harm even the subtlest kind of harm with thoughts

29
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:13,360
as you meditate there could be subtle aversion towards hostility towards

30
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,200
your thoughts or your feelings or even a kind of uh certain kinds of

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,680
impatience a certain kind of uh tensing up around

32
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,080
something certain kind of tensing up around thoughts even

33
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,280
or a compulsion or pressure to think there's a kind of subtle subtle kind of

34
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,599
harming going on in attachment to what we're thinking about

35
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:53,040
so you don't have to be ahead of yourself but as you become sensitive to ways in which you're adding stress

36
00:03:53,040 --> 00:04:01,519
suffering pain harm to yourself and meditation see if you can let go of it

37
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:08,239
stop doing that and if you can't do that which sometimes is difficult to let go

38
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:14,080
of it can you then hold that and hold yourself in compassion

39
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:20,000
it with care and kindness with a deep appreciation of how difficult it is to

40
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:28,080
human life and in that sense of appreciation of difficulty that to hold yourself kindly

41
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,880
breathe with it so to take a comfortable

42
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,000
meditation posture

43
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:45,520
and in your comfortable posture to

44
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,159
adjust yourself so that your body can feel a little bit more alert

45
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,040
maybe a little lengthening of the spine

46
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:11,840
maybe as there's a way of opening the chest a bit

47
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:20,159
maybe your hands can be in a position that supports confidence

48
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,000
being present here confidently

49
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,840
gently closing your eyes

50
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:07,840
and then taking a few gentle but deeper breaths three quarters full

51
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:17,520
and as you exhale release tensions and holdings

52
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:35,840
tightening in your body that might be easy to relax

53
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,039
and then letting your breathing return to normal

54
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,440
part of the value of relaxing the muscles the body as you begin meditating

55
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,840
is to support a condition where you're

56
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,960
sensitive to the subtle ways in which we think and

57
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,919
feel and want which cause subtle harm to ourselves

58
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:21,280
subtle even subtle stress while we meditate

59
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:31,840
as you exhale perhaps relaxing the muscles of the face

60
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,160
muscles that maybe get overused in the course of everyday

61
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:50,000
life they have a chance to soften and relax

62
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:59,840
no need to try so much

63
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:13,840
softening relaxing the shoulders

64
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:27,840
and maybe even the area of your shoulder blades can soften a bit

65
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:41,839
relaxing softening in the chest

66
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:55,839
and softening in the belly

67
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:18,000
and then to awaken awareness of breathing

68
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:26,160
as if you could awaken within the body within your breathing

69
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,959
without force force

70
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:42,000
without expectation that leads to disappointment

71
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:51,839
without even the need to succeed which can also lead to disappointment

72
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:59,360
but rather than a need to succeed perhaps

73
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:10,240
a dedication to engage to be present

74
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:19,279
to the best that you can whatever that might be

75
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,720
so you're generous to yourself and your capacity to be present

76
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,160
when the mind wanders off

77
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:36,000
not to do the subtlest harm to oneself towards being discouraged or upset or

78
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,440
disappointed or critical

79
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,720
instead of old any of those things just begin again

80
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:56,160
simple open relaxed begin again and again and again

81
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,839
perhaps even enjoying or loving

82
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:10,639
the exploration of what it means what it is like to be aware of breathing

83
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:19,760
entering into the world of the body breathing the sensations in the nose or in the

84
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,760
chest or in the belly as you breathe

85
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:43,839
letting that be the center of your universe just here with breathing

86
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:12,320
being sensitive to the slightest ways in which there is harm being made or stress being

87
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:25,840
added tension being created

88
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:31,360
and even the most subtle and slightest you might feel

89
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,200
see if you can let go of it to relax it

90
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,919
see if you can trust that way of being

91
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:53,840
that needs no stress

92
00:25:50,799 --> 00:26:00,080
imagine just imagine what your inner landscape would be like

93
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,640
if there was no harm ever

94
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:16,240
coming out of it no tendency no movement of harm

95
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:25,120
stress criticalness

96
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:30,559
no unwholesome harmful thoughts about others

97
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:39,840
imagine what it would be like in your own mind and heart

98
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:59,679
imagine perhaps the simplicity or the clarity the peacefulness

99
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,840
if we can rest in a place within

100
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:18,559
that doesn't cause harm resting confidently that this is a good

101
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,840
place

102
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,840
and then coming to the end of this sitting

103
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:11,200
turning your attention out into the world

104
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:18,240
and may you offer may each of us offer

105
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,600
non-harming to the world around us

106
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:31,840
whatever ways in which this meditation has supported us

107
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:37,440
do not get pulled into tendencies of harm-making

108
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:45,200
may that be expressed in a wish

109
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:49,519
may all beings be happy

110
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,600
may all beings be safe

111
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,720
may all beings be peaceful

112
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:12,159
may all beings be free

113
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:18,720
may how we live our lives contribute to that possibility for others

114
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:27,840
may we live for the welfare and happiness of this world

115
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
uh

116
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:52,399
so this is the third talk now on living a dharmic life

117
00:30:52,399 --> 00:31:00,240
so if you want to receive some of the benefits that could come from becoming a monastic

118
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:06,080
living in a retreat center being on retreat a lot where the whole life is kind of

119
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:11,120
dedicated to the dharma to practicing if you want those benefits

120
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:16,399
without doing those things just to continue with your ordinary everyday life

121
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,600
so i'm offering different ways that you can maybe get quite a bit of this benefit

122
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,519
and a lot of it depends on how much you dedicate yourself to these simple practices i'm teaching

123
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:35,360
but simple doesn't mean they're not profound or or phenomenally impactful

124
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:42,559
so for this one for today i'd like to offer something that maybe

125
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:50,159
is the only thing you really have to know about buddhism if you really live this idea

126
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:58,399
live this practice live in this approach to life if you do it well and thoroughly that

127
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:04,640
all of buddhism kind of comes along and follows all the insights all the ways of growing spiritually and

128
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,960
personally follow and that is

129
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:17,919
to be dedicated to causing no harm that's it

130
00:32:17,919 --> 00:32:25,519
if you keep that with you if you you know if you had a ring made that was engraved and

131
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:31,039
no harm so you re you remember it all the time you know that this is really the heart

132
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,960
of it the center of it and um you know and that's all you did

133
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:44,559
was to live by that and become more and more refined in how you live that that life more more subtle and no harm

134
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,720
in any direction to towards oneself to other people to the planet to the environment

135
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:57,200
to not cause any harm and if uh it seems like too high a

136
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:05,279
challenge and maybe impossible um then not causing any intentional harm

137
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:13,840
uh you know willful harm and um and at least start there

138
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,279
the um so i'm just not making this up for myself that

139
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,399
there's an ancient teaching that uh the primary characteristic

140
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:32,799
of the dharma is in fact non-harming and the

141
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:39,760
in such a strong association with the dharma this idea of not causing harm and the teachings we i

142
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:47,919
did gave in the last few weeks on wholesomeness and unwholesomeness could be understood as

143
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:54,240
non-harming and harm that what's unwholesome is in some way or other defined by what

144
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:02,000
causes vexation suffering stress um on our system and onto the world

145
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,280
and what is wholesome is that which does the opposite doesn't cause harm it doesn't cause a cause of fixation and

146
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,320
distress and stress and

147
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,560
and the advantage of this one simple little thing causing no harm to use that as a

148
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:26,878
even if you not can't live up to it completely to use that as a reference point as a

149
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:32,638
gauge to really see much more clearly than ever before perhaps

150
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:39,839
that all the ways that you do cause harm now not to harm yourself even more

151
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,520
the way we live and dedicate ourselves to non-harming we do it in a way that's not harming it

152
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,280
doesn't work to dedicate oneself to non-harming and do it in a way that's you know we

153
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:57,839
set up to harm ourselves even more so but to but to use this gauge this

154
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,520
reference point of non-harming so we can see much more clearly

155
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:12,000
you know what we're going off and going wrong i suspect because on on freeways they have all these uh

156
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,880
lines for the lanes on the freeway that um those lines help us

157
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:25,680
navigate and keep straight on the freeway and but if there were no lines i think we'd be you know

158
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:33,200
swerving a little bit more moving back and forth further than we do and uh so the same way the this idea

159
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,480
principle of non-harming is kind of like the lines that uh for our

160
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:44,320
life so in our lane and we notice much more uh carefully then when we're liable to

161
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:49,359
kind of swerve too far in the direction of harming or

162
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:55,839
and i want to underscore again both to ourselves and to others and

163
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:02,079
um the uh so part of the function of this principle of non-harming is becomes a

164
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:08,320
mirror so we see ourselves better and then if we see ourselves really honestly

165
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:14,800
uh uh to have the self-honesty and see ourselves what um

166
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,240
that we were causing harm then what then what do we do then

167
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,720
and i suspect that seeing this clearly

168
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,160
will naturally change what you'll want to do how you want to live your life how you want to

169
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,760
talk or do what you what you want to do it's when we don't see it so clearly

170
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:44,000
that we tend to go ahead and cause harm so for example with speech which is mean

171
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:50,160
speech which is maybe spiteful or critical of someone angry at someone

172
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,720
you we might even know that we're doing it but we might justify it you know they deserve it or this is the way i'm trying to get my way

173
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,040
or something but if we remember that the principle is non-harming

174
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,440
and then well then we can have a explorer this in what way is my

175
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:15,280
statement what i'm going to make to my friend where's the harm here what kind of harm

176
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:22,880
am i causing am i harming myself am i harming our friendship my friend is this something that

177
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,040
i've been doing regularly and what's the impact of it and maybe is there another alternative to

178
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:36,079
take care of myself i think that's what i'm doing can i figure out some way to take care of myself without saying

179
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,400
this harmful thing this spiteful thing or something and so that kind of reflection a

180
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:48,480
reflective life is part of a dharmic life it's not only about just showing up and being

181
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:54,720
mindful and to in all situations it's also being reflective

182
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:00,079
and contemplating considering and some of those considerations sometimes are debates

183
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,160
within ourselves and going back and forth but if you have the the referee the or the principle of

184
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:11,200
non-harming as a reference point for those conversations in yourself and the

185
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:16,800
questioning and wondering um then maybe also you'll come up with a question

186
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,720
what's the alternative to doing something harmful is there some way that i benefit more

187
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,000
some way that others benefit more if um if i

188
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,119
say this in a different way and now what does it take to say it differently maybe

189
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:39,760
i need to learn new skills skills and you know a simple thing to point to these days is for some people

190
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,560
is non-violent communication techniques but there's a whole slew of ways of speaking that

191
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:53,200
that are not making statements about other people so for example that simple principle of

192
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,280
making i statements rather than use your statements talking about what we're feeling

193
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:05,599
which doesn't mean saying i feel that you're wrong it means when you say x i feel hurt or

194
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:11,280
feel afraid and and so to find new ways of being in

195
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,720
the world that are maybe more intelligent more creative more innovative

196
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:23,839
um than uh the ancient primitive simplistic way reptilian way

197
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:32,960
maybe of um of being aggressive or causing harm again towards oneself and others

198
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:41,440
and then as we live by this one simple principle not causing harm to begin to appreciate

199
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,280
what begins to bubble up into surface to appreciate

200
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:55,280
the peace that comes the ease that comes the calm that comes the confidence that comes

201
00:39:55,280 --> 00:40:00,320
with not causing harm the way we start feeling better for ourselves

202
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,520
and start appreciating that there is this i think i would think that in most people

203
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:12,640
there is a strong instinct to not cause harm that's almost an instinct like you know

204
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:19,760
pulling the hand off the hot stove if if we're quiet

205
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:26,000
mindful enough to really be sensitive to where that instinct lives in us and

206
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,800
we're not so sensitive when the unjusta mind that's spinning and angry and afraid

207
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,079
and desirous greedy if that gets the upper hand and we're claustrophobic with

208
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:44,079
these thoughts and ideas and and preoccupations that um

209
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,440
that then there's no space to feel this wonderful place that's i think in

210
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,960
most people this wonderful place that really doesn't want to cause harm

211
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:04,800
and now one of the reference points for this idea also is is the idea that if you have

212
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:11,119
you know for many of us if you have a young child or grandchild or niece or nephew or

213
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:17,839
neighbor or something who's quite young maybe still a baby how much we don't want to cause harm how

214
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:23,280
much care we would do and to not cause any harm there and to

215
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,480
people we love and and if we have it there

216
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:36,240
the idea in buddhist practice is to begin universalizing it is to spread it out to all beings that

217
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:43,200
we see that not exactly that they're family but as if they're family we don't want to cause

218
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,040
harm for them and one of the important family members for this whole enterprise

219
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:57,599
is yourself and i can't underscore how important it is not to cause harm to oneself and

220
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:04,880
so if someone comes and criticizes you for anything at all watch yourself carefully there see what

221
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:10,079
your inner response is and see if there's some way in which you respond

222
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:16,000
that you're actually causing self-harm to yourself if you're too quick to apologize if

223
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,760
you're too quick to be critical of yourself and to uh diminish yourself and and and kind of

224
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:31,760
confess you know like oh how about a terrible person i am um the um uh if i if

225
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:38,079
that's not done wisely and carefully we end up hurting ourselves and sometimes we do it intentionally

226
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:44,400
because um if we show other people that we're hurting ourselves and feeling really bad

227
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:50,000
and then we more likely think that they believe us or that they see that they're having an

228
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:58,000
impact that they want to have on us which is actually to make sure that to put us us in our place but

229
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:06,079
what exactly does it mean to cause harm to oneself and is it necessary can there be a confession of fault

230
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:12,319
can there be admission of yes i did something wrong where we don't diminish ourselves we

231
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:17,839
don't belittle ourselves we don't harm ourselves and in fact maybe

232
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:24,839
we can learn how to confidently say yes i apologize when

233
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:30,400
necessary fully and clearly with with certain kind of strength

234
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:36,640
say i made a mistake and i'm not going to i'm going to try my best not to do that again i'm so sorry

235
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,640
how can i make amends what can i do for you or but do it from a place where we're not

236
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:50,318
diminished or harming ourselves so in all directions non-harm

237
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,760
and i'll repeat what i said at the beginning because i feel it's such an important point that i kind of

238
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,119
i believe that if this if you hold on to this one principle

239
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:08,640
this idea you really don't have to believe anything else that buddhism teaches

240
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,359
you don't have to hold on to anything you don't have to learn all kinds of complicated practices but you but to

241
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,880
really become refined and subtle with it and if you do that in a nice

242
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:27,119
easy chair and close your eyes you'll then begin going through layers and layers of

243
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:32,240
discovering how the you know there's subtle movements of harm in the mind

244
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:38,800
itself quietly within and begin releasing them and releasing them releasing them

245
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,359
and even to the point where the word harm is not quite the right word anymore

246
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:51,839
maybe but rather the word is stress that we're also learning to not add any

247
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,280
stress and in deep meditation practice and we see

248
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,040
the subtle you know in ordinary life insignificant but in meditation quite significant

249
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:10,160
ways in which we self-harm and that are really we see as forms of stress tension and

250
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:17,599
just we can let go of them let go of them let go of them to that place of safety that place of

251
00:45:17,599 --> 00:45:23,680
peace that place where we can live breathing

252
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:30,800
safe and free from all tendencies to harm

253
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:39,920
so thank you
