1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,200
good morning good morning today we'll continue this idea

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,920
of the faculties for fearlessness and there's so many fun alliterations we

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,640
could do with five fabulous fun faculties for fearlessness for freedom

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,000
forever I'm sure there's many fine we somehow slip in that word fine in there

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,960
somewhere but for the titles I'm just saying faculties for fearlessness

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,440
and today we're not so much in the guided meditation but in the little talk

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,280
that I'll give afterwards we're going to talk about a second faculty and it's I'm

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,440
as you may have noticed I'm not going in the usual order of the faculties instead I'm going in an

9
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:57,320
order I think that a way that we can work with them to be with our fear and today's or well maybe I'll save

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:02,480
what it's going to be um during the when I do the little dermit because when I

11
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,560
say the word we bring a lot of um ideas to it and I want to introduce maybe a

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:15,880
little different idea so I'll wait to say it until then but until

13
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,798
then let's settle into a guided

14
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,840
meditation so taking a moment to settle

15
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:37,159
in feeling yourself

16
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,920
sitting like what does it feel like to be in this particular

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:52,000
configuration of body and mind feeling the sensations of sitting

18
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:58,479
the sensation of the touch pressure with the

19
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:05,159
floor or the cushion chair couch

20
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,759
bed wherever you

21
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:15,959
are feeling the pressure of the contact

22
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:21,560
whatever it is the body is contacting at this

23
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:39,439
moment and using this contact as a foundation for our settledness or

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,800
arriving feeling the sense of stability that comes with this Con

25
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:07,280
contact and Foundation we're here

26
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:23,120
here chances are the contact is with your

27
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,120
buttocks maybe the backsides of your

28
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:38,560
legs your

29
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,720
feet and maybe your back leaning against a chair lying

30
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,680
down feel the contact with the

31
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
back

32
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:13,000
then the front of the body isn't necessarily

33
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:18,040
contacting anything but bringing attention to the

34
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:25,639
belly can it be

35
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,600
soft relaxed

36
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:43,240
can we bring an aliveness of attention of

37
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,319
presence the belly to the

38
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:58,919
chest the experience of having a chest maybe there's a way in which it

39
00:04:58,919 --> 00:05:07,080
just opens just a tiny bit by moving the shoulders back just maybe nobody if they

40
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:13,159
were to look at you would notice but just a small

41
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,319
movement bringing this aliveness this presence to the

42
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:51,560
neck resting attention on the

43
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,160
face noticing any tension in the

44
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:13,599
jaw maybe it's okay tension is there but maybe by bringing it into awareness

45
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:21,840
there's some softening and around the

46
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
eyes

47
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,680
we're here

48
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:07,879
now this moment there's nowhere else to

49
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:12,599
be and nothing else to

50
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:23,960
do allowing the attention to gather into the bodily

51
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
experience

52
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:50,280
and setting the direction of our practice to be one of kindness and

53
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:59,560
warmth and Care bringing an attitude of openness in

54
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,360
warmth and care to our

55
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:29,960
practice and letting the attention rest on the sensations as associated

56
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,198
with

57
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:48,399
breathing feeling the stretch and the release of the stretch

58
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,720
in the chest maybe feeling the

59
00:08:53,720 --> 00:09:01,200
movement in and out of the belly Maybe

60
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:10,440
or feeling the different temperatures of air as it goes in and out of the

61
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:24,839
nodes just choosing one of those areas and resting attention

62
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
there

63
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,600
and when the Mind wonders as it's apt to do just very

64
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,600
simply gently begin again with the sensations of

65
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:26,000
breathing doesn't have to be complicated we don't have to make a story about it

66
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:32,880
we just give ourselves over to the sensations of breathing

67
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
again

68
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:00,040
what would it be like to abide

69
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,720
but the sensations of breathing being at the

70
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:12,040
center we're not grasping not pushing or just

71
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:19,079
abiding being present with the sensations of

72
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
breathing

73
00:29:04,030 --> 00:29:08,039
[Music]

74
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:16,849

75
00:29:21,930 --> 00:29:28,439
[Music]

76
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,679
good morning welcome welcome good day good

77
00:29:55,679 --> 00:30:00,278
afternoon lovely to practice

78
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,720
together so today I'd like to continue on this idea of that faculties for

79
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,720
fearlessness and while we were meditating I had this idea like oh yeah there's another meaning to this word

80
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:20,559
faculties so maybe it's a bunch of teachers and Professor professors we want

81
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:26,360
fearlessness I don't I'm just uh sharing with you the things that the Mind does

82
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:34,080
sometimes right so I want to talk a little bit about fear I'll start there Fear Can manifest

83
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:41,559
itself in so many different ways shows up maybe just as restless nights or

84
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:47,080
feeling moody or not expressing our emotions or thoughts you know really

85
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:53,799
holding back and maybe feeling isolated or you know not wanting

86
00:30:53,799 --> 00:30:58,919
to connect with others we could even say like the list

87
00:30:58,919 --> 00:31:04,799
of the ways that fear shows up in our lives is endless and some it depends on the

88
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:10,240
person and the situation but there's so many different ways and it's kind of unique to all of

89
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:18,080
us but regardless of how fear shows up in your life it is a natural part of The

90
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:24,320
Human Experience like humans are vulnerable of course we are we don't

91
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:31,039
like it and we try to pretend that we're not but we are vul vable not only to physical harm but to like emotional harm

92
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:37,279
or some mental harm or something like this but today I really like to

93
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:43,559
emphasize that it's we have fear perfectly normal and we have the

94
00:31:43,559 --> 00:31:49,080
resistance to fear like we don't like to feel fear it's

95
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:55,960
uncomfortable and not only is it uncomfortable but we might have this idea like oh I'm doing something wrong

96
00:31:55,960 --> 00:32:02,799
because I'm feeling the fear here or if I were a different kind of person I wouldn't be afraid or you know

97
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,840
especially like social media often like likes to portray you know only the best

98
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:15,480
signs of people and not everybody watches social media of course but there's a way in which there can be a

99
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:23,720
valorization of this fearlessness and then we start to think like oh if I have fear somehow I'm a

100
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:33,159
failure so we're often conflating this experience of fear and the resistance to

101
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:40,320
that fear and I think for the most part they go together when we have fear often

102
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:47,960
there's a resistance to fear but it can be incredibly powerful and helpful to

103
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:55,000
tease these apart the fear and the resistance to

104
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:01,080
fear like they feel a little bit different in the body maybe sometimes fears like a lump

105
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:08,320
in the throat but the resistance the strong sense of no I don't want to might show

106
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:15,600
up as a some tightness in the chest or some hardness in the belly for example

107
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,880
or maybe there's a sense of like the tension in the shoulders with resistance whereas maybe the fear is a knot in the

108
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:30,200
belly we don't all experience these things the same but in order to like tease them apart it

109
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:37,279
can be enormously helpful to be aware of how they show up in the body there's the

110
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:42,639
fear It's Perfectly Natural normal thing to have about so many different things

111
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:50,760
and then there's this strong sense of no I don't want it how does that no show

112
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:56,120
up so I want to now like kind of introduce one of the faculties that can

113
00:33:56,120 --> 00:34:02,519
help us with this and as I said at the beginning of the guided meditation I'm not doing the

114
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:07,520
faculties in order and I want to emphasize particular aspects of the

115
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:13,599
faculties so before saying the exact name of the faculty I want to introduce this idea of

116
00:34:13,599 --> 00:34:21,280
centeredness like this idea of being centered being collected like not

117
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:27,320
distracted because there's so many different things that we can bring our attention to right it's probably and

118
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:32,878
endless and not only the way that we can bring the objects we can bring our

119
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:40,200
attention to but like the manner in which we do it there can be a way in which there's this striving I have to

120
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,280
focus I have to be connected to this and and anytime we notice any wavering there

121
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,960
can be this you know trying to pounce back onto the object of the

122
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:58,879
focus but there's also a way in which we can just be centered collected

123
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,480
gathered bringing some wholeheartedness to whatever it is we

124
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:12,680
wanting to bring the attention to some of you might recognize this as the faculty of

125
00:35:12,680 --> 00:35:18,280
Samar it often gets translated as concentration but I'd really like to

126
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:25,800
emphasize this sense of gathered collectedness um and some

127
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,599
wholeheartedness because if we just think of it as concentration then for

128
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:38,359
many of us and I know it was for me for many years this idea it was kind of like that dist strain it was kind of like

129
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:47,400
this taxing striving associated with just having the attention be only in one

130
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:56,800
place as opposed to the sense of maybe like just abiding with the what we're bringing

131
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,359
bringing the attention to maybe resting in or bringing attention to standing in

132
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:09,040
the middle of connecting with I want to bring a little bit

133
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:14,640
different flavor of uh than what we often bring when we hear this word

134
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,960
concentration instead I want to highlight this Gathering and

135
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:27,640
collectedness and in particular with working with

136
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:35,000
fear I'd like to offer that we gather the attention around the

137
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:41,000
resistance to the fear not the fear itself but the

138
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:46,640
resistance that strong sense of no I don't want

139
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:53,920
it no make it go away so it's related to aversion but

140
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:01,599
it's a little bit different because sometimes the resistance is so strong or so we don't even like know that we are

141
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:06,720
um resisting it can show up as a voidance as opposed to aversion is often

142
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,280
like this turning away this avoidance this can be kind of like a bouncing off

143
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:17,800
maybe there's a little hint of fear there's a pulling back closing down that

144
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:23,359
might happen it turns out that working with

145
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:30,960
the resistance to fear is a really effective way to be with

146
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:38,680
fear because to be with fear itself is overwhelming not always but it can be

147
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:44,400
and it comes along with so much of U these stories about fear what we're

148
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:54,240
afraid of we shouldn't be afraid of or why is this happening all these types of things so why not just focus on the

149
00:37:54,680 --> 00:38:00,319
resistance this can help us so much in our life not only to be with the

150
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:06,240
fear but resistance shows up in so many different ways in our life every time we

151
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,440
feel uncomfortable there's a feeling of no I don't want to be uncomfortable that

152
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:18,520
sense of resistance and there's a sense of

153
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:24,359
longing like we don't like to long for things that's uncomfortable

154
00:38:24,359 --> 00:38:31,760
too so one way to work with fearlessness is to bring this sense of collectedness

155
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:38,319
this sense of gathering this sense of abiding in standing in the middle of the

156
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:44,520
resistance to fear because I would say that

157
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:51,160
samade this Gathering collectedness centering requires that

158
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:58,280
wholeheartedness this might be one way that we could even think about Sam as a wholehearted

159
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,839
ESS and so often when we come to fear we're not recognizing the resistance to

160
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,599
fear they're getting conflated and then there's this resistance to the resistance to the fear

161
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,280
and it tends it ends up being a big gnarly mess

162
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,760
sometimes but what would it be like to be

163
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:26,520
wholehearted so often we can't be wholehearted with the fear because there's the resistance so there's a

164
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:34,640
peace that's maybe collected around the fear but we're ignoring the the whole resistance so instead let's be collected

165
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:39,839
around the resistance let the fear take care of

166
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:47,319
itself and we'll be bring our attention around the resistance to the

167
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:53,319
fear and this wholeheartedness requires a certain amount of Letting Go we're letting go of the

168
00:39:53,319 --> 00:40:02,760
distractions we're letting go of thinking of the idea that we shouldn't have resistance we're letting go of

169
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:10,040
fragmentation that might happen if we're not noticing the resistance then there's this fragment of us that's resisting but

170
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:16,760
if we just bring our wholeheartedness and letting go of the

171
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:22,400
distractions letting go of the fragmentation letting go of anything

172
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:31,119
that's not a sense of wholeness and there then the Letting Go opens up

173
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:38,920
new possibilities this whole heartedness opens up a new way to be with our

174
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:45,680
experience because what I'm pointing to is to meet the

175
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:49,559
resistance with

176
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:56,319
nonresistance and it turns out that the resistance is supporting the fear the

177
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:01,560
are leaning against one [Music] another if we are bring some

178
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:08,000
nonresistance to the resistance that resistance kind of Falls away turns out

179
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:13,119
the fear Falls away too so

180
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:20,000
Som with the resistance to fear I mean to bring somebody to fear

181
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,560
itself would be great if we could do it but most of us can't do it it's part of our I don't know if is hardwired but it

182
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:35,880
feels hardwired to resist fear so can you be centered and

183
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:43,960
wholehearted on the resistance to fear for you what does this no look

184
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:49,040
like can you bring a not no to the no

185
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,240
can you not resist the

186
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:02,400
resistance so one of the five faculties for fearlessness for freedom forever is

187
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,720
Sam which I'm highlighting this idea of gathered collectedness

188
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:13,760
wholeness for somebody so today if resistance to

189
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:21,400
anything happened to show up in your life maybe you can practice even if it's not with fear just practicing with the

190
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:28,160
resistance and I'll see you tomorrow thank you
