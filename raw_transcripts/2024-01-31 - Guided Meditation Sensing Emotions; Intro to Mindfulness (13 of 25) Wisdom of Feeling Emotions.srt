1
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,000
so hello everyone and

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,559
welcome and now we're continuing this week with mindfulness of

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,640
emotions when I practiced in Burma there was no explicit instructions

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:24,320
on emotions however there was a very strong

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:30,880
emphasis on staying in the body being mindful of the s

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,600
ations that were at play in the body as we were meditating and the consequence of that

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:47,360
was that when we had emotions coursing through us the focus was not the emotion per se

8
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,920
but on the sensations in the body the physical expression of the

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,879
emotion and the and then the consequence of that is that we learned not to judge

10
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:08,040
the emotions not to react to them not to make a story of them or par participate

11
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:14,360
in the story making which sometimes fuels this the emotions but rather in a

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,880
sense to kind of a radical leaving the emotions alone not interfering with them

13
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,040
not getting involved in them and just feeling how they were being experienced in the

14
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:34,439
body so that was what we were taught and now that we're teaching this

15
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:41,439
mindfulness practice in the modern West there seems to be tremendous value

16
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:49,200
in actually naming mindfulness of emotions to make it a subject for mindfulness there's no reason not to the

17
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,360
way I was taught in Burma was in principle was we learn to be mindful of anything and

18
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:02,079
everything it's just they never mentioned emotions there and so here we can learn to be

19
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:10,080
attentive to emotions and there's many ways wise ways of being with emotions you know you can

20
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,879
journal with it you can go for a walk and feel them you can talk with a friend about what's happening for you with

21
00:02:15,879 --> 00:02:22,800
emotions there's uh many things you can do around emotions uh so that are wise

22
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,239
and useful but what we do here in mindfulness is also a very wise approach

23
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:37,200
which is used ful to learn and in some ways it will support other ways if that's what you want to do but it's also

24
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:45,879
very powerful for itself and so what it came to then is that to learn how to be

25
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:53,519
present for emotions without interfering with them to be present without judging them

26
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:59,840
without repressing them without celebrating them or getting involved in

27
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,440
them in any kind of way it's very simple and the consequence of that is a very

28
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:14,760
deep respect for some inner embodied wisdom or process by

29
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:21,440
which our emotional lives have a chance to unfold with in their way just like we

30
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:27,400
allow a cut to heal itself our emotions are

31
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:36,319
not fixed things they are processes in motion and when we're in a sense wounded

32
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:43,159
emotionally something deep inside knows how to care for that when there's wonderful things

33
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:51,959
happening to us there's a way in which trusting the depth of what knows how to be here that can't happen if we are

34
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:58,319
reacting involved uh participating in the emotion it's

35
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,760
nothing it's it's fine to do those things sometimes but to learn the the

36
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:10,519
phenomenal benefit of mindfulness we put aside all the ways we

37
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:20,680
get involved and judge and get entangled with emotions in order to trust some deeper process that is not in our own

38
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:27,400
making and so two things uh that I find very helpful is

39
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:34,520
that when we sit to meditate we are intentionally giving permission for an

40
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:42,440
emotion to be there but the way we allow it to be there the second thing is I the kind of

41
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,680
this metaphor the image that I love for this especially when there's difficult

42
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:53,039
emotions is that we're taking uh doing the equivalent with attention with

43
00:04:53,039 --> 00:05:01,080
awareness as we would be take our two hands to and hands together cup our hands and gently hold

44
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:06,759
something um maybe there's a little you know animal a kitten that's been born

45
00:05:06,759 --> 00:05:13,199
that and you have to maybe carry it someplace and so you gently hold it in your open hand and you feel the

46
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:18,319
tenderness the softness the fragility of that kitten and you just hold it

47
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:25,319
gently and um so to come up underneath anger come up underneath fear come up

48
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:32,199
underneath Joy come up underneath um confidence and just allow it to be there and just

49
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:39,120
hold it and the way to hold it that that works is to feel the emotion as it's

50
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,800
expressed in the body with its Sensations the sensations of the emotion the

51
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:50,520
embodied um uh what is what is activating the body when the emotion is

52
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:58,319
present finding that place and then imagining we're we're giving permission there and just holding that

53
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:05,919
place and and so it's very similar to the exercise we did in the week for mindfulness of the body uh exercise with

54
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:11,880
a hand so we'll start with that exercise and then we'll apply it to

55
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:21,120
emotions so assuming and um a um meditation

56
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,400
posture gently lowering your

57
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:41,439
gaze maybe closing your eyes and let there be

58
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,360
a let your inner

59
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:53,120
attention be gently directed to your

60
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
body

61
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:09,639
and take a few gently gentle but deeper

62
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:15,160
breaths gently deeper just so it feels good for

63
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:21,080
you in a longer exhale letting there be a gentling of

64
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,680
your body a

65
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
settling

66
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,520
for and letting your breathing return to

67
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:12,759
normal just for next few breaths on the exhale relaxing your

68
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:23,319
body maybe feeling holding patterns in your body tensions as you breathe

69
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:31,240
in and softening around those tensions on the exhale

70
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
for

71
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:27,839
and now gently bringing your attention into

72
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:31,760
your D minute

73
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
hand

74
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,560
and then feel the sensations of your

75
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,920
hand and the idea here is to Center yourself on the

76
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,440
sensations without centering yourselves on the judgments the ideas of

77
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:36,160
hand with not centering your yourself on your opinion about doing this exercise

78
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:43,720
or being for or against what's happening without

79
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:50,639
analyzing allow the sensations of the hand to be there as they

80
00:10:50,639 --> 00:10:57,839
are and it isn't so much that you're feeling them as it is you're attuned

81
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:06,120
you're you you know notice you see how the hand experiences

82
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:12,680
itself tingling

83
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:21,199
pulsing vibration warmth and

84
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:30,959
coolness maybe there's something unpleasant maybe there's something pleasant

85
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:42,839
contact of the hand against some other surface pressure

86
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:54,240
weight and allow the hand allow the

87
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:02,320
attention to gently roam around

88
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:10,399
feeling different parts of your hand in some random relaxed flowing

89
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:16,199
way without the attention being fixated

90
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:23,279
or zeroing in on any one place but just gently slowly taking

91
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:31,320
everything in in a gentle Journey around the sensations of

92
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,519
the

93
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:47,079
hand if it helps you to stay present you can imagine your

94
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:52,720
breathing your breathing is accompanying the hand or your breathing in and out

95
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,439
through the

96
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
hand

97
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:22,600
and now

98
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:30,120
notice how you're feeling in terms of your mood your emotional state

99
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,720
mind State the general state of being that

100
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:42,519
you have it might be very subtle it might be

101
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:48,560
strong it might be something not normally called an emotion

102
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:56,440
maybe might be a feeling of being settled or

103
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:06,680
agitated there might be subtle sense of worry or

104
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:12,519
fear or a subtle contentment

105
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:20,519
confidence there might be a sense of inner ease or

106
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:25,880
well-being it might be an inner sense of

107
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:30,680
unease we not feeling so well

108
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:41,160
in whatever way whatever mood emotion that's present for

109
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:52,279
you how is it experienced in the body what part of your body is

110
00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:00,680
activated what Sensations are present related to that emotion

111
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:09,040
that mood that your

112
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:16,600
state it might be very broad

113
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:21,720
feeling maybe it's mostly in the Torso or above the

114
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:27,759
waist maybe it's throughout the body maybe it's mostly the front of the

115
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:34,800
body or the front front of the chest maybe it's very

116
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:40,920
specific in the belly pit of the

117
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:48,279
belly the chest around the heart in the face around the

118
00:15:51,680 --> 00:16:00,600
eyes and once you local localize the sensations connected to the emotion

119
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:07,480
then in that that physical Place see if you can have the same kind of attention

120
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,680
as you had for your hand give permission for the sensations

121
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,199
to be

122
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:24,880
there and let your attention gently roam around that little that

123
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,160
location sensing feeling what's happening

124
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:34,360
physically in relationship to the

125
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:49,680
emotion if your state or emotion Fades away see what replaces

126
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:59,920
it if it gets stronger allow it to do so

127
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:05,079
whatever is happening to it give your emotion

128
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:11,360
permission to be present and permission to change in

129
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,438
whatever way that it it wants to

130
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:33,320
change maybe with a sense of awareness that is like two soft hands

131
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:40,240
coming below the emotion below the sensations to hold

132
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,679
them to allow them to be held and felt as they

133
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:54,640
are independent of your stories reactions

134
00:17:54,640 --> 00:18:00,400
beliefs independent of

135
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:11,400
any story about them just allowing them to be there in their own

136
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:20,720
right and as you hold the emotion that way what

137
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
happens

138
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:51,720
and just gently allow your attention to move around the area of where the

139
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:57,320
sensations are so it mitigates any tendency to get

140
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:05,960
fixated caught reactive to your emotional

141
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:19,159
state for these few minutes trust the body trust the

142
00:19:19,159 --> 00:19:27,240
mindfulness of emotions in this very simple sensory

143
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
way

144
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,360
centering yourself in the physical Sensations not centering yourselves in

145
00:19:52,360 --> 00:20:00,240
the thoughts and attitudes feeling judgments stories predictions

146
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:15,440
and if it proves difficult to do this maybe there's a secondary

147
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:21,279
emotion that has to do with your relationship to the primary

148
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,159
one and maybe that secondary emotion needs the same kind of

149
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
attention

150
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,320
for sometimes it's easier to stay out of the

151
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:08,840
head and out of thoughts if you have your breathing

152
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:18,240
breathing with or breathing through the sensations of the

153
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
emotion

154
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
e

155
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
e

156
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

157
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
e

158
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
e

159
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

160
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:40,960
and then to begin ending this

161
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:46,360
Meditation Center yourself on your

162
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,600
breathing Center yourself on the body's experience of

163
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:06,278
breathing and gently take some little Fuller deeper

164
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:17,440
breaths longer exhale as you relax and let go and settle in

165
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:27,000
more feeling your body more fully more broadly wide panoramic sensations of

166
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:34,679
your body on the inhale and a saddling or grounding on

167
00:25:34,679 --> 00:25:41,399
the exhale grounding in your weight in the surface that holds

168
00:25:41,399 --> 00:25:47,279
up your body chair cushion

169
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:01,840
bed as you exhale is there anything it would be

170
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,080
useful to let go of any

171
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,080
thoughts

172
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:20,240
ideas letting go of whatever is

173
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
useful

174
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:40,120
and then in whatever the way that you feel more settled or open

175
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:47,720
or more tender or more connected to

176
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:52,320
yourself caring of

177
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:00,559
yourself can you turn that outward into the

178
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,398
world that allows for some

179
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:13,240
simple nonassertive [Music] non intrusive

180
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:19,720
way of feeling a connection or feeling a care or feeling

181
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:27,159
a tenderness to the world of people in

182
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:32,799
your life life in your communities and out across

183
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:41,120
the world privately that no one needs to

184
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,960
know wishing them

185
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:56,519
well wishing that your capacity for awareness and

186
00:27:56,519 --> 00:28:03,279
attention is clear and clean so it can be a conduent of your

187
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:11,760
good will your well-wishing may all

188
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:19,278
beings be happy may all

189
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:26,440
beings be safe may all beings be

190
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:33,480
peaceful may all beings be

191
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:39,080
free and if you feel a little

192
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:48,240
more tender vulnerable from this meditation this morning you might

193
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:55,360
repeat out loud or silently to yourself these phrases that I'll repeat

194
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:03,720
of good will may all beings be

195
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:12,559

199
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:47,440
myself so in my my way I can contribute to the welfare of

200
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:09,419
others [Music]

201
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,120
thank

202
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
you

203
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:42,159
so so with this talk today becomes the third talk on mindfulness of emotions in

204
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,279
this 25 part series on introduction to

205
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:52,840
mindfulness and um one of

206
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:58,120
the challenges of developing mindfulness meditation

207
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:05,000
is the degree to which we identify with our experience and what identify means that

208
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:14,039
is we Define ourselves by it in some way or we uh are relating to emotions or

209
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:19,519
whatever is happening uh as if um uh we

210
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,159
are what's happening so if we have an emotion we must be that emotion it

211
00:32:25,159 --> 00:32:31,120
defines who we are it it represents Us in some kind of important way so that

212
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:38,120
who we are as a person can now be judged based on what's

213
00:32:38,120 --> 00:32:44,919
Happening and uh and with emotions this gets very tricky and partly because emotions are

214
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:51,240
so changeable and uh so conditioned and dependent on so many factors outside of

215
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:57,880
our own lives and um some of the emotions we experience are

216
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:04,799
conditioned by our society that we don't even realize how much we've internalized values of our

217
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:11,840
society and that these internalized values then become the basis by which we judge ourselves by which we feel

218
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:17,360
frustrated feel we U we want think things we like certain things we don't

219
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:24,159
like other things and in the wake of liking and not liking wanting and not walking wanting there can be joy and

220
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:31,559
happiness getting what we want there can be anger frustration not getting what we want there can be fear and worry about

221
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:38,080
how we'll be judged if we don't live up to certain societal societal

222
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:45,159
standards is a phenomenal amount of our emotions are not unique to ourselves but

223
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:52,120
are strongly conditioned by the the society the family the the friendships

224
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:58,159
the ideas of people around us and um and it's not necessarily wrong

225
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:05,200
for this to happen but uh to be caught in the net in the web of these societal

226
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:12,919
values in such a way that we are uh um debilitatingly uh caught in our emotions

227
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:18,599
our reactions our identifications around what's going on is one of the things that mindfulness is

228
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:27,118
trying to free us from and and to do this in relationship to emotions is phenomenally useful it's

229
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:33,118
not to dismiss anything but by but by being able to not be identified with our

230
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:38,520
emotions then we can start seeing much more clearly what is actually happening

231
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:45,878
it gives us a phenomenal insight into the cultural way that emotions are have

232
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:52,079
a are conditioned and the the values and beliefs from which they

233
00:34:52,079 --> 00:34:58,880
come uh and we begin questioning not necessarily the emotions but we could connection we can start uh questioning

234
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:04,079
some of the underlying assumptions beliefs values that we don't even know

235
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:11,280
we're carrying that are the seedbed for some of the emotions we have and this is

236
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:18,720
especially true for the difficult emotions I mean certainly there's can be very strong grief that grief is to be

237
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:26,280
deeply respected and has a very important place in the heart and some something to really learn how to hold

238
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:31,839
carefully lovingly and grief can be entangled with

239
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:37,520
identity and how we should be and shouldn't be and and deeper assumptions

240
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:44,920
about who we are and what the good life is and all things that can add to suff

241
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:54,040
to grief so that there's unnecessary suffering connected to it so one of the ways that we then uh

242
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:00,359
practicing mindfulness is looking how to practice mindfulness without the extra layer of

243
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:06,280
identification the extra layer of telling a story about the emotion

244
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:13,920
perpetuating a story and instead not to not to again dismiss identification

245
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:19,240
dismiss storytelling but to put it aside for a while so we have something more

246
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,960
important to do with the emotion and that is to feel it and know it so we can

247
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:30,640
really know it in a deeper way there's there's a depth inside of us that is not

248
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,079
accessible uh easily if we stay in the storytelling mind if we stay in that

249
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:42,720
part of the mind that's uh preoccupied about what this means about me and who I

250
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:50,720
am and what I should do and what other people will think about me uh we have tremendous reservoirs of

251
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:57,200
wisdom of compassion of Love available uh deep inside if we can

252
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,520
drop below the the uh the kind of place we're

253
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,640
involved in navigating negotiating identity in relationship to the emotions

254
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:14,839
we have and so one of the powerful ways of doing that is radically simple and

255
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:21,359
it's not the way not the only way to be with emotions there's a lot of other valuable ways to be with emotions I love

256
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:27,000
the idea that we just go for a walk with a friend and have a chance to talk about what's going on and talk about how we're

257
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:33,480
feeling and uh that can be tremendously useful it can be useful to journal it

258
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:39,079
can be useful to dance the emotions it can be useful to express it in art

259
00:37:39,079 --> 00:37:45,240
there's a many ways to work with emotions and as and one of those ways is

260
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:52,520
mindfulness and mindfulness has its own approach that uh is can be phenomenally

261
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:59,880
useful but it's not the one that's always always useful that you know it's not the be all and end all of how to be

262
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:05,280
with emotions so knowing that maybe it's easier to give oneself over to

263
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,079
mindfulness of emotions because we're not trying to make it the only solution

264
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:17,480
or the solution or the the but it's one way and to know that it's one way maybe

265
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:24,520
we can give ourselves okay for these minutes I'll do it I'm going to do it the mindful way and one of the mindful

266
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:30,000
ways is to um is is meant to be very simple and that

267
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,200
is to Simply find the physical manifestation of the emotion in the

268
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:43,599
body and as we feel it the physical Sensations then um give permission for

269
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:49,240
the emotion to be there if we give permission for the emotion to be there and we're caught up in the stories and

270
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:56,640
our reactivity then we're just you know perpetuating this endless cycle of of

271
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:05,040
feeding the story feeding the identity issues and that we have that can actually make it go on for a lifetime

272
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,359
but if we could drop below that and just feel the physical Sensations physical

273
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:16,280
Sensations are not just physical uh they are deeply connected to

274
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:22,040
the heart to deeper psychology of who we are that there's something profound that

275
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,319
can begin unfolding and working and showing itself when we drop down into

276
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:33,240
the sensation level of the emotion and it's there that we can give permission

277
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,800
for the emotion to be we make room for it by making room for the physical

278
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,040
Sensations and this image that I love is to take two cup hands and let the

279
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:49,119
awareness be like two cup hands that comes underneath a difficult emotion and

280
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:55,319
just holds it in it they're there it's okay I'm just going to be here with you I'll hold you

281
00:39:55,319 --> 00:40:03,599
I'll be with you I'll feel you however long you need you have permission to be here forever it's okay that radical kind

282
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:09,200
of permission and then stay present and make room and allow for whatever needs

283
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:16,040
to happen with the sensations let them move and shift and and um and become

284
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:22,880
stronger become weaker just be with them as we do this we be we come to a

285
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:30,119
vantage point where we can now begin better seeing our relationship to the

286
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:36,160
emotion that in fact we hate it in in fact we love it and we're trying to hold

287
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:41,920
on to it in fact that we're the relationship is when we're not just letting the emotion be there we're

288
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:49,119
telling stories about it we're judging ourselves judging it judging other people we're seeing the the world

289
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:56,640
through the lens of that emotion if we're angry Everything is aversive Everything is wrong so we begin seeing

290
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:03,960
that is not just the emotion but it's also how we're relating to it or how we're caught in it or the stories we

291
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,400
make about it and um and so we're starting to see

292
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:16,480
as we settle down into just being breathing with the sensations breathing with the emotion at some point what

293
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,079
begins standing out in highlight is that we can't do that there's is in fact a

294
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,680
layer of reactivity a layer of judgment a layer of identif medication that goes

295
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,880
on and rather than seeing that's wrong or bad or reacting or being upset

296
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:42,200
because that's there if anything in mindfulness meditation it's more like we relax and say oh I see that's how it is

297
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:48,319
that's what's happening for me and um and so we see it and having

298
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:54,680
seen it and known it then you have the choice to say okay let me put that aside

299
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:59,720
and just stay more simply with the emotion now without that

300
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:07,920
reactivity or and we're still trying to be simple or we see well this reactivity

301
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:14,359
this judgment this identification there's a different emotion that seems to be the basis for

302
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:22,200
that let me kind of now do that simple mindfulness of emotion with the fear or

303
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:28,880
the anxiety that seems to be fueling the ID identity the way I want to identify

304
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:35,839
or disidentify with what's happening or maybe there's uh it seems to be that I

305
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:42,920
have a strong feeling of aversion that seems connected to um the

306
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:50,079
um the the way in which I'm aversive to my my don't like my

307
00:42:50,079 --> 00:42:55,760
emotion maybe that aversion needs the same kind of careful feeling at the

308
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:02,800
sensation level make room for it to be there and um always kind of stepping

309
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:10,000
away from the story stepping away from the interpretation stepping away from from the the ident identification we

310
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:15,480
might have with it and this is a way of me lots of room lots of

311
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:21,319
Simplicity and to do that in the meditation posture where we're not going

312
00:43:21,319 --> 00:43:26,599
to you know punch someone out or grab someone or run away or

313
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:33,359
just kind of just feel it with a guideline keep it simple keep it simple

314
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:39,000
as simple as you can what is a simple way of holding the emotion what's

315
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:44,520
happening trusting it's okay if I feel it in the body I can maybe just allow it

316
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:51,000
to go the exception to this is sometimes some emotions like

317
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:58,680
fear sometimes if we feel it um uh it actually can then reinforce more fear

318
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:04,680
and sometimes there's a loop that we we feel it and every time we feel it we get more afraid we feel it again we get more

319
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:10,640
afraid and and it can get out of hand a little bit so you have to kind of uh

320
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:18,960
same thing with anger same thing with despair or grief you have to have watch yourself monitor yourself to see and if

321
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:25,720
you feel like it's somehow uh there's a loop and it's getting stronger and stronger then you want to find some way

322
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:32,559
to uh switch what you're doing maybe um just go back to your breathing and not

323
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:38,599
focus on the emotion directly maybe it's to do love and kindness meditation maybe

324
00:44:38,599 --> 00:44:44,280
it's to open your eyes so that that breaks the loop cycle and we kind of

325
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:50,240
look around and and just do mindfulness of seeing or mindfulness of hearing that

326
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:55,400
kind of helps us to dis get disentangled from this looping that goes on that can

327
00:44:55,400 --> 00:45:03,040
uh make the things go get out of out of control so um but uh if it's not looping

328
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:08,520
and getting too intense um the possibility

329
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:15,160
exists of uh learning a radical Simplicity around emotions that's deeply

330
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:20,200
respectful of them allows them to do their own thing allows them to be there

331
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:26,599
without interference without analysis without fixing without

332
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:35,200
making it go away just allowing this the the wisdom depth within us to show us

333
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:42,000
away with emotions so uh for this day if you want

334
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:48,359
to explore your emotions further um uh periodically through the

335
00:45:48,359 --> 00:45:53,760
day check in with yourself see what emotions you have and see how you feel

336
00:45:53,760 --> 00:46:02,400
it in your body this with the idea a that just the physicality is a simple direct embodied experience and as you do

337
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:09,040
that um see if that helps you see more clearly what relationship you have with

338
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:16,680
the emotion are you for it or against it are you judging yourself because of it are

339
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:23,160
you telling a story like a prediction of the future or is it are your storytelling and that's what's fueling

340
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:30,440
it just see what the relationship is and once you've seen it relax come back into

341
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:39,838
your body a little bit and then continue with your day so thank you very

342
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,920
much
