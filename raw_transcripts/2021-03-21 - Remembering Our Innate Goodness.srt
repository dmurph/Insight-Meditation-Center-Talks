as we come together today um i'd like to take a moment to acknowledge

13
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,159
the land where we are and the indigenous the indigenous people who live

14
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,960
on this land i acknowledge that i am on traditional

15
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:42,399
unseated land of the first people of oakland the lausanne aloni people both past and

16
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,560
present who speak that your chin your language

17
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,840
i'd also like to offer a lineage acknowledgement of our practice of

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:01,680
buddhism which is an asian heritage and tradition

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,560
a tribute attributed and and and it comes to us through

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,280
500 years of written language

21
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:20,000
of unwritten language and was recorded in sanskrit and pali

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,520
before other language translations

23
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,200
and let it be acknowledged that these practices were preserved nurtured and handed down for millennia

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,120
before reaching western shores and western languages

25
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,840
that in many ways the people and cultures of origin can and in many

26
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:52,560
instances have been erased much the same way that the people who

27
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,400
originally inhabited inhabited these lands have been

28
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,519
erased so let us remember our ancestors and the ancestors of this

29
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:14,800
land who survived pandemics

30
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:21,440
the destruction of their known world and their ways of living

31
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:27,599
may we hold their names dearly in our hearts and minds

32
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,280
and may this acknowledgement serve as a reminder of our inextricable

33
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:40,159
connection to the practices we share and the places we inhabit

34
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:47,360
as well as a reminder of our connection to the earth across species and across

35
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,760
time

36
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:01,920
before i go into the talk i'd like to share with you an excerpt from a public notice sent

37
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,560
from the east bay meditation center in regards to the rash of violence

38
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,840
against asian and american asian pacific islander communities

39
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,800
the east bay meditation center expresses our collective grief

40
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,919
and outrage at the ongoing violent targeting of asian and

41
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:38,960
asian americans and in the wake of the most recent tragic attack

42
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,880
in atlanta we stand in solidarity with asian and

43
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,080
asian americans in beloved community

44
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:55,919
these violent acts of hatred are arising due to the current and

45
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,759
historical oppression of asian americans in the u.s

46
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:09,039
they are the direct result of our nation's deep roots in white supremacy

47
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,360
imperialism and xenophobia

48
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:23,680
i'd like to invite you all to participate in a moment of silence

49
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:32,479
as i recite the names of the beings whose lives have been senselessly taken during the atlanta

50
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:39,840
mass murdering spree which happened just on tuesday

51
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,520
you may choose to place your hand over your heart or slide the eyes closed

52
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,840
or simply just be present

53
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:02,479

dao yul fang and those whose names i do not know

57
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:35,840
names that have not been spoken or names that have been forgotten

58
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:58,160
[Music]

59
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,080
uh and even in the midst of all this it's

60
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:15,360
so important to focus and bring to mind the beautiful

61
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,440
qualities that exist in our lives

62
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:26,720
and it's a pleasure to be here with you today and to share my experience of the dharma

63
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,800
on this first day of spring it's a day of great significance as a

64
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,560
time of birth and rebirth of renewal and awakening

65
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,599
with hope may may it mark the dawning of a new day that follows a difficult period of

66
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:51,039
isolation massive death and deep

67
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:58,639
internal grief we've been living in a difficult time of disease and

68
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,919
hatred living in a triple pandemic really on many levels

69
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,840
the most obvious is the coronavirus that has plagued the earth with a cloak of

70
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:17,919
illness and death the more disguised virus of white

71
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:23,120
supremacy that has infected the infrastructure of systems

72
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:31,199
and institutions all around the world with hatred of difference and the loathing

73
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:39,279
for the natural diversity of life itself and a third pandemic of

74
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:45,760
untruths lacking why speech

75
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,839
a blatant spreading of deceptions that have blinded and wrecked a scourge

76
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:01,680
of mass confusion and metastasized delusion for so very many

77
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:09,839
we've been living in a time of massive individual and communal grief

78
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:18,640
and what is fortunate is that the dharma is immensely vast and far-reaching

79
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,920
that it touches into every aspect of our lives the scene and the unseen acknowledging

80
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,600
the known the unknown and the unknowable

81
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:39,519
there are many paths to enter the dharma some resonate sweetly within our hearts

82
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:44,959
and others present difficult challenges to overcome

83
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,839
the undoing of our harmful conditioning

84
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:00,000
you know life has always been hard to pin down but lately the reality that we are not

85
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,680
in control of our lives our futures

86
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,399
our circumstances has been even more apparent

87
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:20,399
right now we're living in a liminal realm a transitional groundless place

88
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:29,680
here nothing is certain we are at the threshold of an unknown

89
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:39,519
the threshold of an unknown this invisible cloak of delusion

90
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:49,200
the delusion of predictability it's been pulled back to reveal the truth of uncertainty our

91
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,720
lives today have brought into the open the instantaneous

92
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,240
passing of each moment

93
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:06,640
and this truth has been there all along yet these current circumstances have

94
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:12,000
forced an entire world to not only face

95
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,320
but to embody the truth of the moment to moment change

96
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:24,000
in every breath of our unpredictable lives

97
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:33,279
the buddha states that every life is marked by three characteristics

98
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:40,160
of existence impermanence

99
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:50,720
anitcha the pali word suffering or dissatisfaction dukkha

100
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:59,839
and egolessness sometimes referred to as not self anata

101
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:09,440
our intuitive understanding and somewhat forced embodiment

102
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,839
of a nietzsche impermanence is the characteristic that opens the

103
00:12:15,839 --> 00:12:24,320
door to our release from attachments which is the true source of personal

104
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,480
internal liberation from suffering

105
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:34,079
to release to let go

106
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:43,839
to settle to feel into the emptiness

107
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:50,880
of this existence and as the truth of the unreliability

108
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,639
of life continues to unfold we can choose to embrace tremendous

109
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,399
suffering by clinging on to old habits and familiar comforts

110
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:10,480
or we can welcome the stillness within us that holds the power of awakening

111
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:17,680
intellectually we know that nothing in this life in this world

112
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,399
will last forever and that the longer we live we will certainly see everything

113
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:31,040
that we have come to know and love wither die vanish

114
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:38,079
into the intangible however true understanding of

115
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:45,519
impermanence is non-cognizable we can only know the truth of it in the

116
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:54,560
unnamable experiential terrain of our bodies where there is a resonance of memory

117
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:03,839
that is a part of our very being

118
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:08,880
sati to remember

119
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:17,920
to remember it's there within us you know the ancestors are not out there

120
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:26,079
somewhere those who have come before us they live within us

121
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:33,199
they move through our bloodstream they're in the marrow of our bones

122
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:39,839
the chain of dna in our bodies that gets passed on from generation to generation the

123
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:45,839
memories are there

124
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:55,199
not only of experience of loves and hurts and pains and traumas

125
00:14:55,199 --> 00:15:02,639
but the memory of what we are it is there

126
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:10,000
but these these memories are easily forgotten because we live in and are conditioned by a culture of

127
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:19,040
memory loss and dwell in the immediate gratification of short-term memory and distraction

128
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:26,320
we move about barely present to the moment enchanted by a a world of rapid

129
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:34,240
information bites the media technology and corporate

130
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:42,800
marketing schemes that create a culture of attention deficit beings

131
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:48,320
and now that the wheels have all but grinded to a stop

132
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:55,199
we are even more susceptible to the enticements of distraction

133
00:15:55,199 --> 00:16:01,680
being out of our comfort zone being able to move about in the ways

134
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:05,120
that we've always moved

135
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:13,680
the deep insight necessary to cultivate an easeful and fulfilled life in the midst

136
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,720
of chaos and horror and the enchantments of delusion

137
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:27,120
arise when the mind is still silent and unencumbered

138
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:34,720
aware it's quietude that allows us to see the

139
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:39,839
trappings that lead to our own destruction it is stillness that throws

140
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:46,120
open the doors to our discerning internal wisdom a wisdom that is

141
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,839
unempirical and immaterial

142
00:16:52,759 --> 00:17:00,720
unquantifiable when the loud noise of want and desire

143
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:08,319
and dislike have been quieted the unspoken wisdom contained in the deepest recesses

144
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:15,280
of the body arises the wisdom of ancient knowing the wisdom of all that has gone before us

145
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:24,000
the wisdom held in the whispering earth all become available to the conscious mind

146
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:33,280
this is a wisdom that reminds us remembers to us that we are all a web of connection that

147
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:41,039
is unseen and unbroken that there's really no space between us

148
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:51,840
that we are part of the space the air the void that we are the pause

149
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:01,840
this is a time for remembering what it is that we have forgotten

150
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,480
connecting with the memory contained within the body

151
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:16,640
mindfulness of the body is no accident the first door to awakening

152
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:21,440
the first of the foundations of mindfulness

153
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:31,120
our cultural default is wired to do too many things move too fast take on

154
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:37,919
too many projects and juggle too many jobs in our endless efforts to make ends meet

155
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:46,720
or to acquire the things that we have been told and conditioned we need for a fulfilled life

156
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:55,120
and accompanying this normalized way of life are deeply seated feelings of overwhelm

157
00:18:55,120 --> 00:19:01,600
overload fatigue sleep deprivation

158
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:08,559
these are all systems and mental states that keep us from remembering

159
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:16,320
that we are sacred in our very flesh that we are light beings of infinite

160
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:21,679
energy living forth just a brief

161
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:29,520
whisper of a moment on this material plane

162
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:38,799
that we are interconnected to all around us both animate and

163
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:45,840
what is seemingly inanimate i read just the other day that

164
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:53,840
it's been noticed that trees have a heartbeat

165
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:01,679
so spaced out that it's not hardly at all perceptible

166
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,440
everything we touch vibrates with the energetic charge of life the same charge of life

167
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:16,000
that is apparent in our senses when we allow the mind to settle and be

168
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,039
with what is

169
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:26,240
constantly juggling the balls where do we find the time to reflect

170
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:31,280
upon the moment when do we stop to take in the effects

171
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:39,360
of that incident that arose today yesterday on tuesday

172
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:47,120
and before that where do we tuck away the horror story

173
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:52,720
that we witnessed or the daily infractions that got stuffed down

174
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:59,600
packed on top of the other the other the other unresolved stories now

175
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:07,919
absorbed in the body awaiting their time when attention will be turned in that direction

176
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:15,520
you know living like this is to constantly stub the toe and not take the time

177
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:23,520
to attend to it in the rush of getting to the next task

178
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,640
today in the quiet of our homes for those of us who have homes

179
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:42,000
we get to turn over this rock where the slippery lizard of privilege

180
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:48,159
remains hidden from sight you know lately we've heard a lot about

181
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:53,440
white privilege the privilege is not only white

182
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,440
each one of us has a degree of privilege that others do

183
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,520
not have if we are listening the current

184
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:12,000
circumstances can help us tremendously to bring our

185
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,960
awareness to where we fall on that scale

186
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:23,600
where do we stand when placed amongst those who experience these circumstances these dire

187
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:29,679
circumstances as a continuation of the threat of death that has always

188
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:40,640
been there

189
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:49,520
you know before the pandemic hit i said oh good goodness

190
00:22:49,520 --> 00:23:00,000
there are more in larger tint cities everywhere all over the place

191
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:08,960
as i turned the key to come into my home that i've made

192
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:15,919
comfortable and a beautiful refuge safe from the outside world

193
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:25,200
and now on the few times that i leave the house and drive down the street the ten

194
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:37,840
cities are still there but they're much smaller

195
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:51,840
what does that mean

196
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:59,760
i think it means that i've had the privilege of being

197
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:06,240
sheltered away sheltered away from death and disease

198
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,360
for a few moments and that there are many who had no

199
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:21,919
shelter no shelter in place no access to medicine

200
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:37,279
these words that i'm sharing with you are about memory and what it means to remember what it

201
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:43,039
means to turn a kind attention

202
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:52,159
to all about us all around us to wake up to see

203
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:58,159
to remember all that it is that we have forgotten

204
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:05,600
as the vaccines take hold in our lives begin to open up a bit

205
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:13,120
can we can we remember what it was like to stop

206
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:17,679
and bring awareness to our stub toe

207
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:25,279
will we choose to return to the abnormal life of rushing to make plans and cramming as

208
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:31,200
many tasks as possible into the time frame of each moment

209
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:41,919
will we examine the ways in which we ourselves contribute to systems of harm

210
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,360
in the world through our livelihood and our speech

211
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,640
and through our actions

212
00:25:54,559 --> 00:26:02,880
and should we choose to engage in those examinations will we ask ourselves for forgiveness

213
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,000
for the ways we've been complacent and contributing to systems

214
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,440
and institutions and ways of life that are harmful

215
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:20,000
to all beings and to the earth we all have a part in this

216
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:27,200
perhaps as our world reopens little by little we will be we will welcome

217
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:34,080
with open arms the innate compassion that has been

218
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:39,840
waiting to fully emerge from within

219
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,720
have you felt the beautiful qualities knocking at your heart's door

220
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:53,440
qualities that have been waiting to be shared with others

221
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:00,240
even those beings outside of our chosen beloved communities

222
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:11,919
maybe this life experience this trial just maybe has shaken us up

223
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:18,559
just a bit out of our conditioned trance in a way that we

224
00:27:18,559 --> 00:27:25,919
might cherish the pure gold of this breath of this time this very brief

225
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:29,679
time of our lives

226
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:38,559
maybe we will deepen the practices necessary to explore the essential parts of our

227
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:41,039
being

228
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:55,760
the time is now it's always now the time is always now

229
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:02,559
but the time is now to draw upon our deepest most precious resources

230
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:10,000
that we have been practicing and saving up especially for this occasion

231
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,799
what have we been practicing for

232
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:23,360
to re-imagine to draw upon all of our intuitive

233
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:30,159
wisdom to remember the wisdom of the ages that

234
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:37,200
flows through our veins we recognize the truth when we hear it it resonates

235
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:45,600
in our bodies it perks us up because it's there

236
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:51,840
this is the time to re-imagine a new world

237
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:02,240
not a remaking of the old world but something never before seen to envision how we can live

238
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:07,760
in the deepest most beautiful way possible

239
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,600
you know i want to share this quote from clarissa pinkola estes my friends

240
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:22,559
do not lose heart we were made for these times

241
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:31,120
i have heard it from so many recently who are deeply and properly

242
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,640
bewildered they are concerned about the state of

243
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:43,520
affairs in our world now ours is a time of almost

244
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:50,799
daily astonishment and righteous rage over the latest degradations

245
00:29:50,799 --> 00:29:57,520
of what matters most to civilized visionary people

246
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:04,720
and you're right in your assessments the lustre and hubris some have aspired to while

247
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:09,760
endorsing acts so heinous against children

248
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:16,960
elders everyday people the poor the unguarded the health the help the

249
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:25,919
the helpless is breathtaking yet i urge you jen told you

250
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:34,840
to please not spend your spirit dry by bewelling these difficult

251
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:42,960
times especially did not lose hope most particularly because the fact is

252
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:51,840
that we were made for these times

253
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,320
she goes on to say that when a great ship is in harbor and

254
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,840
moored it is safe there is no doubt

255
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,200
but that is not what great ships are built for

256
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:21,200
let us not forget that we are great ships

257
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:28,799
so on this first day of spring

258
00:31:29,519 --> 00:31:35,279
let us join the prayers of many in the northern hemisphere who honor the

259
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:40,320
spring equinox and plant during the time of the growing

260
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,360
moon and set a collective intention to create

261
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,158
to fashion a better world

262
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:58,840
with our words with our actions with our deeds to bring the ethics of the dharma of our

263
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,600
practice into these areas of our lives

264
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:14,320
to create a world free of hatred and the violence of terrorism

265
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:23,039
this starts in here because we are the contents of the world

266
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:43,840
it is an internal as sylvia borstein says it's an inside job

267
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:58,159
thank you for your kind attention i'd like to just take a moment to

268
00:32:58,159 --> 00:33:05,120
let the words fall away to bring your awareness to the resonance

269
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,519
in your body to notice what is activated or what has

270
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:19,200
arisen there to drop the storylines

271
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:28,320
the questioning the judgment the interrogation

272
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:38,159
to free ourselves of any anything that we don't need

273
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:53,840
and simply listen to the wisdom of our bodies

274
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:21,839
[Music] um

275
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:29,598
and as we close

276
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:36,960
i'd like to bring a dedication of merit

277
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:47,280
today we have generated good deeds that entitle us to a spiritual reward

278
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:55,520
as an act of generosity we offer the merit generated from our actions today

279
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:02,160
to radiate outward into the world at large and to land upon and rest with those who are less

280
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:08,960
fortunate than we are may it reach its long tentacles through

281
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,560
the illusion of space between all that there is and defeat the

282
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:20,160
enemy of wrongdoing may it land in the hearts and minds of

283
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,280
those who are steeped in suffering those who are stalked

284
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:31,520
and hunted those who are hungry and imprisoned in the trance of

285
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:37,599
ignorance we offer the fruits of our merit to all

286
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:44,240
living beings who crawl on the earth and swim in the waters of this world

287
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:50,880
all who fly and hop who walk and climb

288
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:57,440
all those who see without eyes and hear without ears we offer the merit

289
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:04,720
of our practice to all creatures above us below us to the right and the left seen in the

290
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,839
unseen the known the unknown and the

291
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:27,839
unknowable may all beings all beings be free

292
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:35,719
[Music]

293
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:45,280
so you
