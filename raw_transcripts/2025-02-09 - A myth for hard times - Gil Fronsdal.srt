1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:08,000
so good morning everyone and welcome to IMC and um I do have an

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,120
announcement and I think of this announcement as part of the talk as May

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:22,240
me a prel pre Prelude to it um for quite a while I've been

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:30,160
wanting our community both in person and online out in the wider world to to be

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,000
involved in a second large fundraising drive that follows the one we did right

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,120
after the invasion of the Ukraine three three years ago where we raised money

7
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:47,480
for save the children and um and uh in order to

8
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,520
support the children affected by the war there and a lot of them were ref became

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:01:00,000
refugees going going out of the country and and the save the children did wonderful work supporting children and

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,479
families and they've been an organization that's been around for decades maybe 100 years or something

11
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,400
doing wonderful work one of the more greater reputable nonprofits

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,320
around and um been wanting to do it for a long time for the last year or so and

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,680
um it took a while for our community to kind of get organized or properly around

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,280
this and so we finally could do it now and uh it's for the save the children

15
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:37,720
emergency fund uh that goes for children and families and really emergency places

16
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,399
around the world and uh and things are pretty dire and risk of starvation all

17
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:51,880
kinds of things and um and uh the primary places now are places like um um

18
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,280
Gaza and Sudan and Syria and different

19
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,520
places Ukraine still may be and um so we started that fundraising

20
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,599
Drive uh maybe officially today and um and and officially it kind

21
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:17,720
of was posted available on I think Friday and um and so last time we did it

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:23,160
we raised $70,000 which I thought was pretty fantastic and so we're now

23
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:30,200
launching it again and this this time and it's a CH opportunity for our community to come together and feel like

24
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:35,599
we're coordinating and sometimes working together we get a kind of bigger impact

25
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,879
in the world than if we just do it individually and uh it just seems very timely that we're doing but it wasn't

26
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,239
wasn't the plan that um that the the federal government should

27
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:59,000
have kind of in a certain kind of negative way cooperated with their efforts that by shutting down the US Aid

28
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:05,959
the agency for instance International Development there's a huge huge a bigger crisis now with international support

29
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:12,120
and so now in our small way we're stepping into that vacuum with our ability to donate to the save the

30
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,120
children and so I think in some ways will'll make more of a difference than we would have been if we done this some

31
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:24,720
months ago so um so this is uh you know an attempt in our community to meet the

32
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,840
need and one of the key people organizing it is ram ram Jo I saw here

33
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,720
somewhere he's standing all the way in the back he has a wonderful little kind of red sweater and a

34
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:46,519
hat cat so if you look for some more a cat you'll um he um if because he's also

35
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:54,680
involved with a lot of wonderful humanitarian efforts kind of connected to the Outreach from the IMC orbit and

36
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,799
um and our orbit is to me it's I'm quite inspired by it I just went down to um

37
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:07,879
IRC this last two days one of the things we were our orbit

38
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:14,480
is involved in is chaplaincy training and we uh so we're training people to be

39
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,799
um spiritual caregivers in the kind of chaplaincy mode and um and so once a

40
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:27,160
year that the the yearlong training we do it at IRC for two days the retreat center and there was something very

41
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:33,800
significant for me of being at the retreat center with the current climate of things the chaos of this world that

42
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:41,600
sitting in the meditation Hall there it felt like it was one of these places of Refuge of that's protecting the good

43
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,039
heart protecting spiritual practice as a as a through line that will stay

44
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:53,320
constant through the ups and downs of civil ups and downs of civilizations that the like I have this

45
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:59,440
idea of my image of monasteries being places deep in the woods or mountains where no matter what goes on society

46
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:05,320
there actually preserving uh spiritual practice spiritual ideals ethical life

47
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:12,080
um in a in a very important way that to make it continue through time and so I felt like we were down

48
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:18,440
there in this place that has that kind of role in our society and uh training people to offer

49
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:23,759
spiritual care out into the wider world and uh I loved it and then I realized

50
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:33,319
that coincidentally that um that last two days the next two days

51
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:38,800
Monday and Tuesday uh I I'm training one of the other chapy programs coming out

52
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:44,120
of our orbit of IMC which is the EAP Buddhist Eco chapy training people

53
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:51,639
wanting to offer spiritual care in the context of the environment environmental crisis and um so that's pretty wonderful

54
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:57,680
wonderful group of 36 people and they all have to do a project for the year and a half program and so last night I

55
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:03,440
read all their project proposals and I was so inspired wow we put we we created

56
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:10,080
this program out of thin air and now these people have out of thin air doing these wonderful projects in the world

57
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:17,560
having to do with Eco Chaplan I like wow that's pretty cool that we have this and

58
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:23,360
then coincidentally Friday and Saturday uh we have the kind of a third kind of

59
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:28,960
spiritual care chapy informed program called anukampa which is bringing some

60
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,479
of those ways for uh that we do in chaplaincy some of the orientations

61
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,880
there for personal growth for people who are not necessarily going to offer spiritual care but want to touch into

62
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:46,880
that world and grow from it and so it just kind of represents how much that

63
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:52,039
this orbit of IMC is doing is doing a lot of things that here and there that are usually not

64
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:59,919
publicized and uh Rah who just announced uh he's connected to a lot of it and so

65
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,360
some of you are interested in learning more of what we do you can talk to him at the tea

66
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:14,479
time so in this world of chaos that we have seemingly and and uh it's quite amazing

67
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:20,599
uh we were planning yesterday met to planning meeting with the faculty of this Eco chapy program which starts

68
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:26,000
which will continuing through a two-day session Monday and Tuesday as I said and

69
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,160
we had planned some weeks ago what we were going to do and we real realize wait a minute the world has changed so

70
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:39,240
much in the last two weeks we have to kind of rethink the whole thing we can't just kind of we didn't know two weeks

71
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:45,120
ago three weeks ago that the world would look like it is now so we've now kind of

72
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:51,199
re reorganized it to try to better meet the circumstance we're in for PE for PE

73
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:57,560
especially for people offering one spiritual care to the world when the world has changed we should and probably

74
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:04,039
a lot of them are dismayed by what's happened and so how do we support them and care for them um sometimes you have

75
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:10,280
to care for the caregivers before you they can go out into the world and

76
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:15,599
um and um I was very moved to know after

77
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:21,000
the fact I wish I'd known while it happened that this week this last week

78
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:27,440
twice um students from the high school which is one m one block away uh March

79
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:35,880
through the streets March down to the the the C the city Courtyard uh and in order to protest the

80
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,440
the way in which the ice the immigration police is uh coming and taking students

81
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:49,040
out of high school coming taking them or maybe here undocumented and uh I don't know if

82
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,720
they've done that in local high schools right here but it's happened in U San Jose and where they've gone into the

83
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:02,800
high school and it's a to me from what I understand of it it's kind of a horrendous thing to do because to take a

84
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,920
student out of high school because they're undocumented as bait to get

85
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:14,720
their parents to come and retrieve you know come and get them means now the parents are also in that mix and to have

86
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,880
that kind of dynamic between that kind of tension and that kind of challenge for a family it must be absolutely

87
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,920
awful there was a movie many years ago called Sophie's choice and I wondered you know wow what what kind of what kind

88
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:34,880
of thing are we doing to families and um and so um and so they

89
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,680
had they had a walk out in that High School in East East San Jose for the students protesting

90
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:46,000
that so we have uh high school students and other students perhaps in this in

91
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:54,360
this country now who are afraid and Afraid for themselves afraid for their fellow students and so we live

92
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:01,240
with a lot of people now afraid maybe some of you are afraid some of you are quite con con ER maybe some of you are

93
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:07,200
in danger because of this some of you are know people who are and

94
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:14,720
um and uh and some of you might know people in the The Wider World whose

95
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:22,320
communities there are now their aid Their Food Supplies have been cut off because Aid has been cut off and and

96
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:29,040
people are and Med medicine supplies have been cut off and Medical Care has been stopped and people are starting to

97
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:36,120
die because of what this the very quick way in which this Administration has decided to make this change without a

98
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:44,440
care planning and consideration for the impact so um so these actions that are

99
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:50,959
happening that are dismaying and frightening alarming for many people certainly we should name it the name

100
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:57,279
that recognized how difficult it is for some people and some people are finding it as

101
00:10:57,279 --> 00:11:04,880
that it's the med medicine they've been waiting for for a long time the change they've been hoping for and and you know

102
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,600
uh that's also happening and so how do we find our way with all these what's happening in our

103
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:20,120
society so that was a long Prelude to my talk it turn so I want to tell you a

104
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,800
Buddhist myth and it might be in the context of all that telling you this

105
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:31,000
amazing you know strange myth uh is um

106
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:37,399
is it would seem like maybe diminishing or underplaying what's going on in the

107
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:42,800
response to it but it's uh how the Buddha responded to similar things

108
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:48,360
happen in his time uh you know we have some of us have this image of the Buddha

109
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:53,600
sitting quietly in the forest peacefully and he probably was just all Serene and

110
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:58,639
wonderful but uh periodically through his lifetime societies fell apart around

111
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,160
him there was war that he was not in the middle of necessarily but the places

112
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:11,040
where he lived and traveled for 40 years 80 years between um there was Warfare

113
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:17,120
and War and famine and all kinds of things Society falling apart the

114
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,519
representative of that is that he died peacefully and we tell this wonderful story of him laying down on the ground

115
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:29,279
between two flowering trees and to and to die very peacefully

116
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:36,000
and serenely in a deep meditation practice and it was nice for

117
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,600
him um and uh around him his societies

118
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:50,040
were were were falling apart and around him Ward drums were being were being uh

119
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:56,760
beat beaten and uh kings were being Thrones were being

120
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,079
usurped and taken over and there was a lot and his uh his some of his followers

121
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,760
is one of his prime his kind of kind of one of his prime disciples had been murdered just a few months before he

122
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:17,560
died and so he was even though he died peacefully the context was one of great

123
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:23,920
upheaval and there was no courts to go to to say you know please stop there was

124
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:30,839
no check and balances for these monarchs who were King who were basically dictators who could just help people to

125
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:36,040
you know offer their head at a moment's notice and there was no check and balance except unless unless the

126
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:42,680
neighboring country attacked you that was a check and balance and um so it was a you know in

127
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:48,399
some ways it was an awful time and the Buddha responded with myth maybe because

128
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,279
that was the safest way it was kind of and there was not a it was oral culture back then so there was you couldn't

129
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:59,639
write a Manifesto and post it on doors or get it you know put it down on the

130
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:05,639
news or something um the way that things traveled was uh Through People speaking

131
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:11,160
and so a good myth a good story uh probably traveled a lot more by some

132
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:19,560
someone standing a soapbox and say you know it's not not not a good idea to have war and um and so the Buddha supposedly

133
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:26,399
composed these these myths and and this particular myth uh is designed in a in a

134
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:33,360
classic literary form if if you know about literature call it kismos and

135
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:40,639
that's a ritual way that that that's done in the Bible and Homer and many places where the the the literature the

136
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:47,560
the writing is done as a journey into a a a a pivotal point and

137
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:54,399
then the journey is going out kind of in in the uh mirror image of going in and

138
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:02,560
so this myth is kind of you know so people in the ancient world they they knew knew this kind of form of

139
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,880
ritual myth telling or mitual ritual storytelling so they kind of knew to

140
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:13,000
kind of be carried Along by it and and dip down into it and then come out of it

141
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:20,360
maybe in an inspired way and I don't think I can tell it that way but um but you know maybe you'll

142
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,759
follow along you'll understand how it is and

143
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:32,720
um so um it it's a you know it's I think it's a myth because it starts off at a

144
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:39,079
time long long ago when people's uh lived for 880,000

145
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:47,399
years that was a lifetime that's a long time and uh it describes how society

146
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:53,199
devolves and as Society devolves it affects how long people live almost

147
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:59,480
biologically people get bored and their lives get shorter and shorter and shorter and uh and so goes through you

148
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:08,319
know from 80 to 40 I think to 20 to 10, years and eventually you get to um 7

149
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:15,600
days and uh that's pretty bad and me think then it's real that's the worst that it evolves to society and the world

150
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:21,720
and people just become uh uh just horrible to each other absolutely

151
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:28,920
terrible and uh and that's when things change and um and then then it come

152
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:34,120
comes out and then life as over the over the centuries I guess or Millennia the

153
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:41,519
lifetimes increase back until the Glorious time when we can live for 80 80,000

154
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:47,360
years and um and the pivot point of the story has

155
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,000
to do with people going into the forest leaving the ordinary constructed world

156
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:59,880
of human beings where we have institutions and government and all these things that we create and to make

157
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,798
sense of our social life they actually leave they go to the forest and there

158
00:17:05,799 --> 00:17:11,160
there's a the the turn what has to happen to turn society around happens

159
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,760
there in the forest and there's other places that Buddha tells kind of a story this is not

160
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:22,678
a myth it's just kind of a metaphor he uses the same thing that when he

161
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:29,600
discovered the path to Awakening he likened it to a person

162
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:36,280
who goes into the woods um someone who works in the woods a woodworker or something goes into the

163
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:42,919
woods and finds an overgrown path but he sees the traces of the path and then he

164
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:48,120
comes back to the monarchs of the of the realm and tells them I found the traces

165
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:54,280
of an ancient path and they say oh okay and they go into the forest and they

166
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:59,679
clear the path and they found the path takes them to some glorious

167
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,799
overgrown Aztec city that's been covered over

168
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:11,799
for you know for a long time and um and so here again the idea is something in

169
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:19,480
the forest so the forest here represents some other dimension of life that is

170
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:25,640
outside of the ordinary constructed imagined synthetic world that we live in

171
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:30,840
of um you know building up our ego building up our concept of self building

172
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:37,080
up our concept of the world that we have the cathedrals and the edifices we have

173
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:43,440
of of abstract constructed engineered society

174
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:52,080
which is both good and challenging to live in and uh you know we have to deal with

175
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:59,280
Twitter now and I was just thinking about how uh it's this imagin constru Ed

176
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:05,840
unnatural world doesn't exist in the natural world whatsoever uh is now the source of the

177
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,720
wealthiest people in the world that is not because they're really good farmers and they produce things

178
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:19,360
people need and that makes them wealthy it's they're making these things that just a few decades didn't exist and it's

179
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:26,520
you know it's a part of a build comes out of this constructed imagined world of uh the human mind and that's kind of

180
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:34,400
the world that's taking over in some ways and D dominating and has the power and so here the Buddha is offering

181
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,919
another way going back into the natural world it's represented by going into the

182
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:48,880
forest so in this myth the um I'm going to tell you it's the myth of the wheel

183
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:55,039
turning monarchs and the wheel turning monarchs are kind of like this Universal monarchs

184
00:19:55,039 --> 00:20:01,080
who own in the Mythic times a huge uh area of the

185
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:07,159
world so they're very powerful and um and for many

186
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:14,400
generations of uh the monarchs uh know how to live and be how

187
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:22,080
to rule ethically and um and this is a description of how they

188
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:29,679
rule rulers honor respect and venerate the truth

189
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:35,200
have truth as their banner and guide they provide

190
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:41,679
just protection protection in a Justice way they provide just protection and

191
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:48,880
security for their Court troops Aristocrats assistants brahin and

192
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:55,480
householders towns people and country people religious practitioners animals

193
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:03,200
and birds they do not let let Injustice Prevail in the country they provide

194
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:08,480
support to the poor this was written 2500 years ago in

195
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:17,720
the Bronze Age I love saying that and um you know this was relevant

196
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:25,000
that long ago for human societies for someone to say that to describe monarchs the ideal Monarch the Mythic

197
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:30,600
Monarch however that went on for about six Generations and Seventh Generation is

198
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:35,919
somehow seven is a good number so that in the Seventh

199
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:47,039
Generation uh uh one of the monarchs stopped doing some of this um and um and it says he uh he

200
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:54,039
governed the country according to his own ideas so governed the country people did

201
00:21:54,039 --> 00:22:01,679
not Prosper like before as they had when former Kings proceeded in the noble duty

202
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:09,320
of a monarch so the noble duty of the what the first one I read and uh but then the ministers came

203
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:16,000
to the person and said wait you know you're not doing it right and the people are suffering now and

204
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:23,080
um and um um and so they said to him they said

205
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,240
people are suffering you should ask us they didn't they weren't going to tell them something maybe you don't tell them

206
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:34,880
on what to do he said you should ask us about the noble duty of a monarch we

207
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:42,840
will answer you and so he asked and uh they explained it to them

208
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:50,600
and after listening to them he provided uh justice and security and for his

209
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:59,600
people but he did but he did not supply uh uh he did not provide support for the

210
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:06,559
penniless in the realm and so poverty grew

211
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:18,080
widespread when poverty was widespread a certain person stole from

212
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:25,559
others makes sense Roger starving with the intention of to commit

213
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:30,840
uh theft so intentionally stole he was

214
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,120
arrested and they presented him to the king saying your majesty this person

215
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:43,880
stole from others with intention to commit theft and the King said to him is it

216
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:49,400
really true you stole and the man said yes it's

217
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:58,278
true remember this is back in the ideal time when everyone was living ethically and honestly yes I still

218
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:07,799
um what was the reason said the king sire I couldn't survive

219
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:14,880
otherwise in um I was born in burgund Norway and they have their still on the

220
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,919
wall of the old castle that was living back there supposedly one of the first

221
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:25,480
rules of the of the land that it says explicitly if someone's starving it's

222
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,200
not a crime to steal

223
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:40,840
um so the so uh so he said I can't survive and so the king um provided him

224
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:49,080
with some uh support material support saying with this

225
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:55,120
support keep yourself alive and provide for your mother and father partners and

226
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,200
children work for a living and provide an inspiring donation for religious

227
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:06,559
practitioners that's conducive to happiness so maybe it's a littleit self-

228
00:25:06,559 --> 00:25:13,039
serving for the Buddha too just to say

229
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:18,679
that and um but still this idea here's support to get started with a career and

230
00:25:18,679 --> 00:25:24,039
support your people and Thrive with it so it's kind of nice and so the guy said

231
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:31,480
yes but then another person stole some something from other people and was

232
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:39,679
arrested present to the king and same thing happened is it true yes why to

233
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:46,039
survive and so the king provided that person with material support and to in

234
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:52,080
order to to build a career and and support the

235
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,880
people and um but then people heard about this and they thought it's seems

236
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,960
the king is providing support to anyone who steals from others it occurred to them why don't we

237
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:12,080
steal from others so then another man stole something from

238
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:19,080
others and that person was arrested presented to the king did you steal

239
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:25,200
yes why because I couldn't survive then the king thought if I

240
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:30,760
provide support to anyone who steals from others it will only increase the

241
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:37,159
stealing I'd better make an end to this person finish him off and chop off his

242
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:43,399
head he's a decisive person strong and decisive and he's going to you

243
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:51,200
know so he ordered his men to do so um but people heard about

244
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:56,919
this it seems the king is chopping the heads off anyone who steals from others

245
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:02,559
so it occurred to them we better have sharp swords made then when we steal

246
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,799
from others we'll make an end of them finish them off and chop off their

247
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:15,840
heads and so they did that and um and

248
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,480
so the Buddha uh points out and so from not

249
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:28,919
providing material support to the penniless poverty became widespread when

250
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:34,000
poverty was widespread theft became widespread when theft was widespread

251
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:41,640
swords became widespread when swords were widespread killing living beings became

252
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,159
widespread and for the sentient beings among whom killing was widespread their

253
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:54,880
lifesty lifespan and Beauty declined these people um lived for 880,000 years

254
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:01,360
but their children lived for only 40,000 years so now we're beginning to see the

255
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:08,720
devolving not just of society but there's a in Buddhism there's kind of a direct kind of correlation between our

256
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:14,360
lived life because of the karma that we live and so the karma affects us in a

257
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:20,480
dramatic way and here it's got being passed on to the next generation and what are we passing on to

258
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,480
our next Generation Um among the people who lived

259
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,760
for 40,000 years a certain purple person stole something from

260
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:39,200
others the person was arrested and presented to the king your majesty this person stole from

261
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:46,919
others the king said is this true no sir he deliberately

262
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:54,360
lied and so from providing from not providing support to the penniless poverty theft

263
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:00,279
swords and killing became widespread when killing was widespread lying became

264
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:06,480
widespread and for the sentient beings among uh whom lying was widespread their

265
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:14,559
lifetime and Beauty declined these people who lived for 40,000 years there had children who lived for 20,000

266
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:20,640
years and then the people who lived 20,000 years they did it got even worse

267
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,720
because not only do they lie but then behind the king's back they disparaged

268
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:32,919
him so kind of back backbiting started to happen and so that reduced lifespan

269
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:39,480
to 10,000 years among the people who lived 10,000 years uh some were beautiful and some

270
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:45,360
were ugly the ugly beings coveting the beautiful ones committed adultery with

271
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:52,679
the partners of others and so from not providing support to the penniless poverty theft swords

272
00:29:52,679 --> 00:29:58,159
killing lying and backbiting became widespread when backbiting is widespread

273
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:04,399
uh sexual misconduct conduct became widespread and so then the LIF span

274
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:09,519
reduced to 5,000 years and this process continued the

275
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:15,240
next thing that happened was harsh speech came into play divisive and hard

276
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:22,000
spe the how people spoke and uh then the lifespan reduced to 20 2,000

277
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:28,559
years oh actually says 2500 years and then those people

278
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:34,360
uh had ill will ill will became widespread and then the lifespan reduced

279
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:41,720
to a thousand and then a wrong view uh the wrong view is the view that

280
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:46,799
you can do whatever you want it has no impact uh and but the right view is that

281
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:54,679
if you do things which are UNH wholesome unethical it'll have a ne ne negative impact on the world on yourself there's

282
00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:02,320
consequences to it and having right the wrong View not believing in that um and more likely people are going

283
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:10,760
to do unethical things because there's no no repercussions anywhere so people had wrong view um

284
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:20,360
they um lifetime declined to 500 years then greed and a harmful culture

285
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:26,159
kind spread into the a culture of just harm and hate and things like that and

286
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:34,159
then it reduced to 2 the years and from that um respect for mother and father

287
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:41,279
religious practitioners um decreased and also for

288
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:48,600
elders and so with lack of respect uh lifespan went down

289
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:55,360
to I think a 50 years and

290
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:00,519
then uh just all this mean all this stuff all the killing and everything's going on at the same time right like

291
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:06,519
it's getting more and more terrible and the next thing is um

292
00:32:06,519 --> 00:32:13,720
um the people who lived I guess anyway 50 I don't know what's going on here but

293
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:18,880
[Music] um they lived for 10 years and among the

294
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:26,279
people who lived for 10 years um I don't know if this you know maybe I should not read this but it says uh girls became

295
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:32,039
marriageable at 5 years maybe that was very significant back then

296
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:37,279
and and the following uh um and then the

297
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:44,200
following flavors disappeared uh butter oil honey molasses

298
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:52,600
and salt things are getting worse and um and then people started

299
00:32:52,600 --> 00:33:00,120
doing more and more UNH wholesome unethical things and and the lifespan went down

300
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:09,440
to um oh and there was no recognition of the status of mother aunts or wives

301
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:17,039
Partners uh Partners tutors students and other respected people the world became

302
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,240
dissolute like goats and sheep chickens and pigs dogs and

303
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:30,240
jackles everyone was full of hostility towards each other with acute ill will Mal avence and thoughts of murder even a

304
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:37,360
mother will feel like this for her child and a child for its mother father for child child for father brother for

305
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,200
Sister Sister for brothers they'll be just like a deare hunter when a de

306
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:50,240
Hunter sees a deer full of hostility ill will malevolence and thoughts of killing among the people who lived for

307
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,399
10 years there was a a a middle period this limbo period this is the turning

308
00:33:57,399 --> 00:34:03,000
point of a turning point of so it's called the inter period

309
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,560
of Swords the lasted for seven days so imagine lifetimes are seven days and

310
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:16,679
also that period of seven days sharp swords will appear in their hands it's

311
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:23,320
kind of like like a science fiction thing like just born with swords or something

312
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:28,878
um which will take each other's lives crying and call calling everybody else

313
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:36,079
it's a beast a beast everyone's called beasts so this is the worst if we come

314
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:44,560
to the end of the worst but then some of those beings

315
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,520
thought let us neither kill nor be killed why don't we hide in thick grass

316
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:58,359
thick jungles thick trees inaccessible riverlands or rugged mountains

317
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:04,040
and survive on Forest Roots Forest roots and fruits so they

318
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:10,520
did what so that's what they did so the idea of surviving on roots and fruits is so they don't have to kill any animal

319
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:18,480
for food so really they were going to live non-violently get away from it all when those seven days were passed

320
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:26,119
having emerged from their hiding places they embraced each other maybe because they're the only ones who

321
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:32,000
survived um uh and they and they come together and

322
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:40,119
cry in one voice fantastic dear enemy you live fantastic dear enemy you live

323
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:46,800
remember in the 7-Day period everyone's enemies they all went away maybe individually when they came out they

324
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:54,079
didn't see them as enemies anymore um they called they were the dear

325
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,599
enemy uh then they thought it's because we undertook undertook UNH wholesome

326
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:06,920
things that we suffered such an extensive loss of our relatives we better do what's

327
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:13,599
wholesome what wholesome thing to do why don't we refrain from killing living

328
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,680
beings and so then they slowly started to lifespan started to increase in

329
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:24,359
reverse order as they each went systematically well let's not kill people let's not steal from them let's

330
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:31,800
not lie let's not involve in sexual misconduct let's have let's have divisive speech and harsh speech Let's

331
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:36,920
respect people and slowly slowly and they came back eventually to live

332
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:42,680
happily happily for quite a while because they lived for 880,000

333
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:50,880
years and um and then it all started over again with the monarchs of the Realms knowing how what to do knowing

334
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,079
that they had to uh rule with Justice protect the Justice protect everyone

335
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:05,079
that they should uh support people provide them with the means for livelihood and let no one be poor and

336
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:12,680
this idea but you know kind of the central focus on poverty and that poverty was really where the the the

337
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,960
source was Society devolving and um and it looks like we're

338
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:24,440
moving in a direction in our society probably for a while of increased poverty don't know what to predict into

339
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:30,119
the future but it looks like there's going to be some people maybe the poorest in our society who are going to

340
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:37,280
suffer the most and um and and what is our

341
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:45,960
role you know in this kind of if if this is how Direction it all goes um I don't know what to say it's

342
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:52,560
kind of a for some of us it's kind of a difficult time to be in a situation like this and not know how to respond in a

343
00:37:52,560 --> 00:37:58,079
sense it's a waiting game to see where it's going and where the response can be

344
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:04,800
but this kind of myth I think is actually extremely important because it says there is

345
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:09,960
something very deeply natural that's not part of that unnatural world that we

346
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:16,640
construct of governance and things that resides in ourselves in the natural

347
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:23,280
world within to go into the forests the natural world we can do that in our own

348
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:30,400
hearts and that's why we practice that's why we have meditation practice and these kind of spiritual

349
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:37,839
teachings and ethical guidelines so that we can live in an ethical way so that

350
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:43,680
our standard of Ethics is really high for ourselves and others we don't kill

351
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,640
we don't steal we don't involve in sexual misconduct we don't um involve in

352
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:55,240
lying we don't involve in greed and hatred we don't involve in involve in

353
00:38:55,240 --> 00:39:01,480
disrespect backbiting we don't involve seeing anyone as beasts anyone as less

354
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:08,760
than human and um and so we really want to care for ourselves and to do all those

355
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:16,720
things is a way of harming ourselves I think that's one of the message of this myth that we harm ourselves and our our

356
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,079
descendants our society uh by how we do

357
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:27,480
things and we also harm in immediate now others who are impacted by those

358
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,839
behaviors of ours and so Buddhism the Buddha put tremendous emphasis on

359
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,920
Behavior like that and calling out the necessity of not behaving the those kind

360
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:45,520
of actions that cause harm and so for me to say at the beginning of this that

361
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:54,760
there were there are children being harmed right down you know potentially right down the street of bla away uh

362
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:03,280
unnecessarily uh is to critique Behavior action activity effect

363
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:11,200
without saying anything about any individual or any groups of people but look that kind of behavior has to

364
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,079
stop and uh I wish that I had known that the students were out on the streets but

365
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:25,079
it wasn't announced anywhere maybe it was spontaneous it was so one block away I would have joined them and uh because

366
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:31,400
I wanted to protest that kind of activity that kind of action and that might be all of us maybe

367
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:38,960
might feel called to say no to killing say no to stealing say no to sexual

368
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,240
misconduct say no to lying say Lo say no to specific ways in

369
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:54,400
which people are being harmed and I hope that we don't we're not silent in speaking up and maybe through

370
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,760
for a while until our LIF spans can grow up a little bit

371
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,319
longer rather than decrease because people will hate

372
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:11,280
us that um maybe we'll do it sometimes by telling

373
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:17,000
myths at least on this Sunday morning we use a myth to say that like the Buddha

374
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:27,000
did long long ago so that's my um my talk trying to be relevant for the

375
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:34,560
current times and hopefully it is enough and so we're it's all a work in

376
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:41,480
progress this practice of ours this life of ours so uh we have this tea today and

377
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:46,880
that's going to start in a few minutes but I think that um it's possible this

378
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,560
topic because it touches current events is a little bit tender for some of you

379
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:59,079
and uh and it might be nice and I I evoked in the beginning that I'm doing this kind of spiritual caregiving

380
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:06,319
trainings three of them in a sense that happens I'm involved in this week and maybe it's maybe we can care

381
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:13,359
for each other just very briefly by turning to a couple of people next to you make sure no one's left alone look

382
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:21,440
around could be four if necessary two or three and um and say hello and just uh

383
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:28,400
offer some care some respect some appreciation some welcome just just and

384
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:35,319
maybe maybe tell each other a little bit uh what it was like to hear this talk and what I evoked and what came out for

385
00:42:35,319 --> 00:42:40,480
you and and listen to the other person with uh you know care and respect don't

386
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:47,680
give them advice and and don't offer your opinion

387
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:54,720
your opinion about what's supposed to happen out there just just be human together in a very simple way and don't

388
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,520
tell long stories about you you know what this talk was like just a few comments just to share who you are and

389
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:08,520
say hello and and break the ice of saying hello especially people here here the first time and then uh in a few

390
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:16,160
minutes there will be that the tea I'll ring a bell so that you know it's really clear time to stop and then if you can

391
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:27,480
continue talking afterwards the Bell but then the tea will be available and you're all welcome to stay so thank you
