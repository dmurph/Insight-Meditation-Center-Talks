1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:07,759
so thank you all for being here on this hot day

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,240
and um i came across a poem today by mary

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:20,640
oliver that i didn't know and it's had a nice impact on me it kind of

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:26,560
inspired me quite a bit it wasn't actually the poem that inspired me

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,000
it was the title of the poem and then i looked at it i liked the poem

6
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,840
well enough but i almost thought that this was probably i kind of assumed

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,640
mary oliver probably thought of the title first that was really the poem and then she

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,718
had to find a poem to go with the title

9
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,879
and it's a title which i think can be adapted in all kinds of significant ways

10
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:03,120
so it uses the word prayer in it some of you might not

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:10,000
have much connection to prayer or might actually not want to hear that word being used

12
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,799
generally the buddhists in our circles don't do much prayer or any prayer

13
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:22,960
so we'll see about the word so the title

14
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:31,520
is the real prayers are not in the words

15
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,880
the real that's half of it their real prayers are not in the words

16
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,240
but in the attention that comes first

17
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:54,960
but in the attention that comes first so here she's associating prayer not to

18
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,960
praying for something but rather a certain kind of attention

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:08,640
that comes first and the question is what kind of attention is that

20
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:15,760
lets you consider attention as a kind of a prayer so now we can adapt it in buddhism

21
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:23,000
buddhist terms perhaps in buddhism we talk about meditation

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,400
and maybe we can say real meditation

23
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:35,200
is not in the technique but in the intent attention that comes

24
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,040
first real meditation is not in the technique

25
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,800
that you're doing but in the attention that comes first

26
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,879
or refuge or buddhist real refuge

27
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:59,280
is not in the words i take refuge in the buddha in the dharma the sangha

28
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,879
but rather in the attention that comes first

29
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:12,400
so what attention is it that comes first what way of atta attending what being in

30
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,800
the world what way of being aware knowing what's happening

31
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,440
so that seems like the obvious question to this title and so maybe the rest of the poem is the

32
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:32,879
answer to that question that you'll maybe the rest of the poem is trying to evoke or describe or point

33
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:38,400
to maybe to evoke the kind of attention that she's

34
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,000
referring to so i'll read the rest of the poem and

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,239
with that background for it and see if this might do it for you maybe this evokes a

36
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,280
certain kind of attention or maybe it raises questions about

37
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,760
what what are you doing when you paying attention when you're bringing attention to whatever it is you're

38
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:09,200
paying attention to what is it that you're doing

39
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,799
when you're aware that can never be called a prayer

40
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:22,400
that it can never be called a refuge that you would never associate this is meditation

41
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:30,160
so the poem goes like this the little hawk

42
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,919
leaned sideways and tilted

43
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,120
rode the wind its eye at

44
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:47,440
its eye at the at this distance looked like green glass

45
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,960
its feet were the color of butter

46
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,960
speed obviously was joy

47
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:07,759
but then so was the sudden slow circle it carved into the slightly silvery air

48
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,880
and the squaring of its shoulder and pulling into itself

49
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,520
the long sharp edge wings and the fall into the grass where it

50
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,039
tussled a moment like a bundle of brown leaves

51
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:32,160
and then again lifted itself into the air

52
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:40,560
that butter colored clenched in order to hold a small still body

53
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,039
and it flew off as my mind sang out oh

54
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,280
all that loose blue rink of sky

55
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,639
where does it go to and why

56
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:09,039
so here she's watching something that some people will find inspiring or

57
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:15,199
beautiful or captivating to watch a hawk soar in the wind it's so

58
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:21,680
sore in the sky it can be quite beautiful to watch and see and sometimes you can feel lucky to

59
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,840
be outdoors and really get a good view of this beautiful majestic bird

60
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:35,600
so here she's watching it then and then she sees watches it as it

61
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:40,400
dives down to catch him i pray

62
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,360
and it does and what's remarkable for me is

63
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,039
she treats the catching of the prey in the same simplicity and almost like

64
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,280
the same kind of awe or something as she does just watching the hawk

65
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,800
circle around and she doesn't seem to miss a beat or

66
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:10,080
doesn't seem to to uh to

67
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:17,199
i don't know to you know somehow shuddered oh my god it's a mouse

68
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:24,960
you know gopher has been just been caught just like it's just nature watching it

69
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,479
so she so she's watching it and all this and then

70
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:36,560
but then the most remarkable part of the poem for me is the the bird lifts up and goes into

71
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,919
the sky and if sometimes you go see a hawk or bird flight this guy it kind of disappears

72
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:47,120
high enough or something and then she has this question first

73
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,360
oh all that loose blue rink of sky

74
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,520
the only place i know that the word rink is used is an ice cage rink

75
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:08,560
so i'm probably just doing that you know this this bird is skating and that's where that's the that's where the

76
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,160
bird skates on he's referring to our sky

77
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,720
that way oh all that loose blue rink of sky

78
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,120
where does it go to and why well you know have you ever asked

79
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:33,279
that question it's kind of a silly question right why did where does the blue sky go to

80
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,279
and why it's not a question that maybe a really rational scientific

81
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:46,080
person would ask in fact the first time i was out in the high

82
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:54,399
mountains when i was i was 15. beautiful high alpine place

83
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:01,680
where i was going to a boarding school it was a reform school

84
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,560
and it was beautiful high up in the mountains and snow capped mountains and

85
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:14,240
stuff and i was walking one of the little country roads with my older friend from school

86
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:20,000
and i was just in awe of what i was seeing and i just in that awe i said

87
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:26,240
why are we why are we here what's this about and he looked at me and said don't be

88
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:34,480
silly then something in my heart closed when he said that it took years for that to open

89
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:42,720
and so here she has this you know this aw and this amazement that she asks a question that don't tell her she's silly

90
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:49,600
something might close that shouldn't close but why this blue sky why is it blue

91
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:56,399
it's not like a question that wants an answer i think it's a question which is just

92
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,839
open to amazement to possibilities to

93
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:08,800
something that may be that we can't understand or don't want to understand or

94
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:16,640
something that maybe what is it associated with is that kind of reference is it kind of respect

95
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:23,120
mystery what is it so she uses this whole example of this

96
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:30,880
hawk and the hawks soaring off and having this question you know where does the sky go and why

97
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,640
has an answer to the title

98
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:42,000
the real prayers are not in the words but the in the attention that comes

99
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:49,360
first so what is it what is it the attention she's referring to

100
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,720
that's being described in the poem why is that before prayer why is that

101
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,240
the prayer why would she call that prayer

102
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:07,760
why would she see it in that kind of religious terms or in value like that

103
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:14,120
i think that's the question this wonderful poem leaves us with

104
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:22,079
so i don't know some of you don't care for poetry i just cared for the title

105
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:28,320
but um what do you think what do you think what kind of attention

106
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,040
do you think she's referring to when she says but it is found in the attention that comes

107
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:43,839
first before the prayer what do you think anybody if you want to yes so if you could use the mic

108
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,440
um can is this working it sounds like it is perhaps the

109
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:58,959
simple awareness you referred to at the end of our meditation i think

110
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:05,760
that's my answer uh-huh thank you yeah that that was kind of what was in the back of my mind when i did that meditation was this poem

111
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,519
kind of maybe maybe even prepare for hearing the poem maybe thank you

112
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:17,519
anything else that occurs to you um

113
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:24,959
i just think sort of grounding in simple awareness

114
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,560
can really open up a lot of space kind of like you described actually was really touched by the quote of

115
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:36,399
when awareness is simple uh leaves space for the heart to participate in the world or something

116
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:42,320
like that i didn't quite get the wording right um but i really find that to be true that

117
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:48,880
when awareness is simple then there's this beauty there's this awe there's this

118
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:55,040
sort of fascination with the world and perhaps that's what she's referring to um thank you

119
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:57,519
very nice

120
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:07,760
what was your what was your name i'm john john sage hi there um

121
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:14,399
i am in fact sage um so the attention that i thought about was

122
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,800
um kind of attention that just belongs to people in general the way they like hack

123
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,079
is i don't know a better word for this but like built to do the thing that it does and to like

124
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:32,000
attack the mouse it might go up i thought it was kind of like juxtaposition like it just did its thing

125
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,079
like the attention is what we do like we've evolved to like

126
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:45,680
i don't know be able to like exert a lot of like power over the world natural world

127
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:54,959
but at the same time like why are we evolved to appreciate like a blue sky like that doesn't seem necessary and um

128
00:13:54,959 --> 00:14:01,120
and to ask a question like where does it go and why of like something that has no utilities

129
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:06,399
the attention that sounds like prayer to me just kind of like

130
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:13,040
fantastic i like that so this idea if i understood you that the hawks doing what it's doing

131
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:20,880
and uh there's something about you doing what we what's what humans can do when we watch kind of an awe at the talk and

132
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:27,760
see what's going on and ask questions that have no utility in a sense

133
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:33,040
but but we have so many things we can do with our wonderful minds

134
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,160
why do we do that when we can go out and make money you know we can work more extra hours

135
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:43,920
and over time you know isn't that more important the question

136
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:48,959
what what evokes for me your your wonderful statement is um

137
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:56,240
you know you have no utility when it's your time to die

138
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,120
say if you're lucky enough that you're dying not really in any pain but you're definitely going

139
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,160
it's like this is the last hour maybe you have

140
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:17,440
would you rather be doing your taxes wait a minute in 1999 i think i paid too much and

141
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:23,760
was all these things that you know or would you rather kind of like look at jobless things to see like i need a

142
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:30,240
promotion what would you do during that last hour and in that last hour

143
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:35,600
with that a question that has no utility would that be really the best way that

144
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:42,720
you spend that time would that be the most amazing wondrous way to be in the last hour just

145
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,920
looking kind of in in a certain kind of reverence in awe

146
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:54,560
because we've learned that it's found in the attention

147
00:15:54,560 --> 00:16:00,399
that we have in our capac natural capacity for attention

148
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:05,920
where attention has been set free of our preoccupations our fears our desires our

149
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:12,160
hates latching on that even laying at our deathbed

150
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:19,519
and looking up in this air and the dust motes are glittering through the sunlight

151
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:26,320
wow where does that light go why is it here

152
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,560
but just just watching it you know what would you do on your last

153
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:39,360
hour which which direction would you go what would you do with your attention do you know something about how to be

154
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:45,519
present that becomes your refuge on your deathbed

155
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,199
that it's so easy in this kind of life that many people live here in silicon valley

156
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:56,320
to say what sage said oh so well i thought but

157
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:03,240
you know to do that some people might say sage and say this but it has no utility

158
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,160
we have this capacity for all reverence for using our attention a certain way

159
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:17,438
discovering a new character that is that may be the most one of the most precious things we have

160
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:22,798
and to put it in the context of one hour to live was just a highlight for you

161
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:28,720
oh oh well in that hour

162
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:35,679
what has utility what does that mean in that hour what's most important

163
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:42,320
and this is a very important part of buddhist training is to consider this

164
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,840
kind of thing like the last hour because it highlights our values

165
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:56,159
highlights what's important highlights a possibility that we don't have to wait for our last hour to live by

166
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:02,320
and people who shy away from any discussion of death

167
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:10,000
any consideration of it sometimes are losing losing that possibility of using that last hour

168
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:16,400
as a wonderful treasure as a reference point as an exercise

169
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,320
how can i how do i want to be now

170
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:29,159
so anyways i talked too long i'd love to hear some of you more about

171
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:39,200
so back to the idea of prayer i i don't see prayer as

172
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:45,840
a different state from meditation i feel like it's an outpouring of your of one's heart

173
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:52,960
whereas i think meditation i'm more in a receiving mode and so

174
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:58,880
one has to do with awareness or like the attention i think it seems to me that it's the

175
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:04,880
prerequisite to open your heart to begin with so it can begin that outpouring

176
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,360
and so when you say you know nice attention is required for prayer

177
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:18,320
to be a real prayer that's sort of how i connect the dots

178
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,679
great yeah so yeah so i like it very much what you said how you started off by saying maybe

179
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:29,360
a prayer meditation doesn't have to be two different things it depends what you mean by prayer of course but i think

180
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:36,000
that there's something profound profound possibility in prayer that is very similar to what we do in

181
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:43,760
meditation depending on how we use our attention

182
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:56,240
any other thoughts about what kind of attention that that this that mary oliver might be

183
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,240
pointing to and maybe not you know trying to explain her but maybe explaining yourself

184
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:07,559
what would you how would you understand this for yourself

185
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:33,840
i'm i'm not sure exactly what to say but

186
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:42,559
there's something about prayer that to me is asking that is what it's an asking

187
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:51,440
a request or and the attention more is appreciation

188
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,720
or an awareness they seem different to me great great

189
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,679
yeah some people associate prayer with asking and uh and this is something very different attention

190
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:08,960
um but not everyone associates prayer with asking and so there's other whole other

191
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:14,919
associations people have with prayer and um

192
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,600
so

193
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:47,600
so i'm thinking about this attention and what comes what comes to my mind is

194
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:53,360
there's no need to interpret anything no need to assign any meaning

195
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:59,840
just watching and it's kind of like no burden of needing

196
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:05,360
to assign meaning or interpretation and

197
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,720
so prayer for me i i think about my grandmother who prayed a lot

198
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:17,120
and when i asked her any questions about what she was doing she didn't have any answers

199
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:24,960
she didn't she didn't know what like i'm just doing it um there was you know specific steps but

200
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,880
it didn't mean like it didn't seem to to have a meaning she was just doing it

201
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:37,039
so no interpretation so this freedom from interpretation freedom of putting something adding anything on top of our

202
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:42,640
experience and um or wanting anything from our experience or

203
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:49,360
avoiding something just being with something in a very simple way and maybe that's what she found

204
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,880
and maybe to put words on it would have maybe she was a great zen master

205
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,919
and she knew that putting any words to explain any explanation or words on it just would ruin it

206
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:07,400
maybe great

207
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:17,720
anybody else yes this could

208
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:32,159
so for me not so much about the poem but for me personally i grew up christian as a child so prayer was like a very um

209
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:38,480
that's just what i learned to do right and and was very much part of my daily routines i would pray at night before

210
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,799
going to bed and you know wishing for well thanking for the things that went well and wishing for things like that i

211
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:50,960
hope would go well like the next day and then certain you know experiences in my life made it such that i couldn't

212
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:57,279
really believe any more in a kind of omnipotent god that i can sort of directly talk to in that kind of way

213
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:02,480
and there was a difficult difficult period in time than for me when that was gone and it wasn't yet

214
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,919
sort of replaced or that the void hadn't been filled and for me then sort of finding you know meditation and

215
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:14,640
meditative practice in some sense then filled filled that void so it was the switch in some sense for me from prayer

216
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:20,240
to this more attentive kind and and then i guess there was one ted talk that i

217
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:25,679
saw some some time ago and i forget exactly who the pastor was but he and i actually

218
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:31,520
also don't know whether that is exactly the meaning of of namaste but he he said um at least in that ted talk that at

219
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:37,200
least part of the meeting with namaste that greeting in in india is that um

220
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:43,840
i greet that part of god that i recognize in you and i found that to be very nice because that sort of combined the two things for

221
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:49,200
me in some sense and saying that okay well if you know god's still everywhere in some sense but now

222
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:56,000
it's the awareness that you practice through meditation that you need to recognize it in others so it's a different way of sort of relating to god

223
00:24:56,000 --> 00:25:01,840
than it is in this sort of more cognitive direct way of asking for things or thanking for things

224
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:07,039
so that was sort of what came to my mind not so much about the poem but yeah very nice thank you

225
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:13,360
and your words reminded me of something that when i was a i did quite a bit of growing up in europe

226
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:19,600
and so i had some kind of contact with catholic monasteries there i don't know

227
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:26,480
how but they were kind of on the edges of my my my life there so at some point when i

228
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:32,720
was a teenager i had this desire to

229
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:40,759
go become a catholic monk and i wondered if they'd take me as an atheist

230
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:48,960
because um and what what attracted me to it was not the religion

231
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:54,400
but exactly but there was something about something up in me resonated or felt something

232
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:00,080
about the lifestyle that brought a kind of uh awoke a kind of

233
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:05,600
embodied attention embodied presence a kind of embodied

234
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:10,960
awareness that felt like kind of a wholeness that things felt complete or felt

235
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:16,720
settled or peaceful or so i felt i had this very rich warm feeling

236
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,760
and and uh and i wanted a place i knew or

237
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:28,080
associated with this feeling that i had was the monastic life that these monks are going around i have no idea if it's

238
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,240
true but but that's uh that that was what the attraction was to the monastic life back

239
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:40,400
when i was the teenager and and um it probably came to kind of a peak

240
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:46,640
um when i was 18

241
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:53,600
and i went to a monastery maybe the cathedral

242
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:59,600
called mont's son michelle i don't know if any of you know of it in france

243
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:06,480
and uh you it's kind of like from a distance it looks like something they'd draw for a disneyland cartoon uh you're

244
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:12,799
going across this flat kind of plains of northwestern france and right down the near the coast

245
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:20,320
and this on this little island off from the coast comes up there rises this huge kind of soaring

246
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:27,200
kind of cathedral with a big spire and when the tide is in there's a kind

247
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:32,240
of a little bridge that goes out to it ties it out it's it's kind of

248
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:39,440
i suppose you could walk all the way without the bridge and so i was there and i had a lovely i

249
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:45,360
i don't know why i went there but i was just traveling around and i found a place to stay the only

250
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:50,799
place to stay apparently for me was at a pax christie

251
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:57,039
hostel a little christian hostel there and it felt like a kind of

252
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:02,880
semi-monastic it was just very lovely i loved it they're very simple and

253
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:08,799
and then in the morning i got up and i went up and had a tour of the church the cathedral and everything and and we went

254
00:28:08,799 --> 00:28:17,600
all the way around you know all kinds of places and we came to the um the the oldest part of the

255
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,720
complex the monastery was a little one room stoned chapel

256
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,919
that had been built on top of the island top of the hill and everything else had built around it

257
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:34,320
and covered it filled it but at the very heart there was a soul and we went in there

258
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:40,640
to this little chapel immediately i felt so much peace

259
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,480
it was like wow and then when everybody in my tour group they all left

260
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:53,200
i kind of stayed back as long as i thought i could have permission to stay back just to feel that peace

261
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:59,600
and um so that was kind of like the peak of it and then i didn't have that kind of peace

262
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:07,360
again until i started meditating and then this whole thing that i kind of intuited as a teenager when i was young

263
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:15,200
was something that then then became accessible to me um in meditation practice and

264
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:23,440
and and then in buddhist monastic life which i did for a while but this beautiful way of being

265
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:29,360
so they said for me this attention that she talks about is something that

266
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,480
is something that is not cerebral it's not like the eyes looking at

267
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:41,679
something only the eyes but something that is um

268
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:47,039
a sense of whole presence and attentiveness that's that's fully here

269
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,159
and always like just here presents

270
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:57,760
and um the seeing the hearing is part of it but it's not it's only part of it so

271
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:05,520
there's a bigger hole here and it comes with a feeling or sense that this is complete

272
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:12,240
that this is this is being fulfilled this is deeply satisfying this is you know this is

273
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:20,640
feeling this fulfilled without having to win the lottery or get a better job or

274
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:28,880
have a better relationship or all kinds of things that in the world we're trying to do to make ourselves feel complete

275
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:34,880
so that's the prayer that's that's the real prayer attention

276
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,000
to that's ability and i think as that has talked about this it's something that's

277
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,080
mostly found by being very simple not filling it with desires and wants

278
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:54,480
and doing and wanting and running away but just here just here a simple way

279
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,320
so um i hope that's be nice for you to consider

280
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:07,919
and to that real prayers are not in the words but in the attention that comes first

281
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:15,039
i think it's a wonderful little thing to consider and it raises questions

282
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:20,399
and maybe this is one of these if it does raise questions for you what is this maybe it's a kind of question that

283
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:23,919
shouldn't be answered too easily
