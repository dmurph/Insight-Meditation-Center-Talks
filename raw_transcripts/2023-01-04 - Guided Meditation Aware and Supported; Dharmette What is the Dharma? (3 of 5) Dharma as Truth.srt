1
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,740
so good morning good day everyone Welcome to our

2
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:23,039
meditation session and

3
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:29,880
we're also considering this week the topic of Dharma dhamma

4
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:38,160
and it's a common uh uh enough uh in the world of etymology

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:45,000
to say that Dharma comes from a root word meaning to hold or to bear or to

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,100
support something sometimes it's said to come from an even kind of earlier etymology of uh

7
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,640
something that is in order and organized coherent

8
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,400
so the idea of Dharma being what holds us up

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:10,799
and what holds us up is maybe the the

10
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:17,760
how reality coordinates cooperates with itself to create all that we have that makes it

11
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:25,439
possible for us to be here and uh kind of a kind of a for us personally

12
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,860
the closest and clearest example of this support this

13
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:39,540
coordination cooperation that supports us allows us to be here is our

14
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:46,020
own body that's the closest at hand for us

15
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:53,640
and to allow the Dharma of the body to support us the coordinated processes

16
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:00,899
the natural order of the body that we interfere with

17
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:08,819
if we are too actively fixing or changing or wanting

18
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:15,540
it to be different than what it is to some there are times where that's a

19
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:22,800
fine thing to do but there are times when we want to be supported and Trust the supports oppress

20
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,520
so trust this coordinated cooperative

21
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:35,040
support that this body gives meaning that the body often knows how to move to

22
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,379
homeostasis move to health move to Healing

23
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:47,099
and a lot of the Dharma practices being very present for our experience

24
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:53,480
and that's really key to emphasize it be very present be aware here

25
00:02:53,640 --> 00:03:00,300
and getting out of the way not interfering

26
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:07,019
and that can be counterintuitive for people who have a habit of always interfering fixing thinking it shouldn't

27
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:13,019
be the way it is and it's a remarkable thing to sit quietly you know

28
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:20,459
in a meditative posture being very present not interfering

29
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:27,599
and watch notice that they'd unfold even something is simple

30
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,900
as sitting quietly and feeling the body begins to relax to settle a little bit

31
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:40,019
the heart begins to be more subtle than relaxed agitation dissipates

32
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:49,019
maybe even the quality of characteristics of your thinking changes become slow or calmer or quieter

33
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:54,019
and this quieter way of being settled

34
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,620
is both uh comes from a little bit of trusting that the body

35
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:08,220
will support us and also comes with making space for

36
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:15,120
the coordinated processes The Cooperative processes of our body to

37
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:24,680
show themselves to be themselves so assuming a meditation posture

38
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,240
and I find Delight in the idea that the body supports the body

39
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:41,000
to all the different parts of the body support what's above it

40
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:48,918
holds the weight holds it together

41
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,979
gently closing the eyes and one of the functions of closing the

42
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:01,680
eyes is to I'll let the other senses we have

43
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:07,020
especially the sense of physical touch and

44
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:13,220
physical Sensations come into greater Focus

45
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:19,560
many people are I focused what they see what they look at

46
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,400
in closing our eyes so we can be body focused

47
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:31,820
feeling the body from the inside out

48
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:47,780
beginning a process of trusting the body trusting being present for it as it is

49
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,600
and gently in a way that's gentling for you

50
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:03,419
relaxing for you take some steeper breaths

51
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:11,840
and as you exhale relax into the support the body provides

52
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,979
letting the breathing return to normal

53
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:04,319
and the inhale let your attention fall or come to

54
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:09,840
different places in your body where there's tension or tightness

55
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,979
and on the exhale soften relax those parts of the body

56
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:26,180
release it from the release it from the tension

57
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,259
foreign

58
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,319
into your breathing

59
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:05,779
and sometimes in the breathing itself we can sense and feel the support

60
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:14,519
the naturalness of breathing and sometimes it's possible to see how

61
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:24,500
we're controlling it there holding it resisting limiting it

62
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:33,540
with this awareness practice we do be okay with all of it

63
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,320
don't try to fix anything even the control

64
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:46,740
make room for it in your awareness non-interfering awareness

65
00:10:46,740 --> 00:10:52,639
and Trust something will find its way

66
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,899
with non-re interfering awareness that stays aware makes a room for what's

67
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:07,820
here as you breathe in and breathe out

68
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:42,320
a good percentage of our thinking probably could be understood

69
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:49,860
as being supported by mistrust

70
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:59,940
who are supported by an absence of real trust and

71
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:07,199
care caring for the Dharma here in US

72
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:15,000
the support the coordinated cooperative

73
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:24,480
amazing world of our body and mind

74
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,040
operating here

75
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:35,660
in this space of awareness

76
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:18,260
and then coming to the end of the meditation

77
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:27,419
the Dharma of support of coordination cooperation

78
00:26:27,779 --> 00:26:34,020
is not just with our body but with in a sense the whole world

79
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:39,360
the Earth plants and the animals of the Earth

80
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:44,179
the oceans the clouds the air

81
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,419
other people

82
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:59,279
our life depends on this wider world our life lives in support and in

83
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:04,279
coordination with this wider world

84
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:13,760
and we live in relationship to this wider world

85
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:28,500
and it's possible for us to be supported by the wider world

86
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:33,960
and at the same time to offer our support for it

87
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:39,419
to care for it to cooperate and coordinate with the

88
00:27:39,419 --> 00:27:41,960
wider world

89
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:51,840
With Attitudes thoughts words and actions

90
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:58,620
of good will wishing of support

91
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:06,200
ing the best for everyone

92
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:15,080
may it be that this meditation supports us

93
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:24,679
supports the goodness of our hearts to flow to the surface

94
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:30,740
may all beings be happy

95
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:36,740
may all beings be safe

96
00:28:38,659 --> 00:28:44,539
may all beings be peaceful

97
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:49,220
may all beings be free

98
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:59,659
and in that freedom that we offer may we may we receive it in return

99
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:05,778
may we live in a Cooperative universe

100
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,440
supporting each other

101
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,600
to be free

102
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:53,220
foreign

103
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:13,260
this is the third talk on the topic of what is the Dharma

104
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:18,419
and um this is a very multivalent word in

105
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:23,460
Buddhism and in India in general in Buddhism there's many different

106
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:29,520
meanings attributed to this word or it's used in all kinds of ways and some of the

107
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:34,620
traditional classical commentaries have long lists of all the different meanings

108
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:41,279
of the word Dharma and but I started this week by talking

109
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:47,520
about how Dharma has to do with our the relatedness between things how things

110
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:52,919
exist dependent or in support of of other

111
00:31:52,919 --> 00:32:00,179
things that things arise in relationship to other things being present

112
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:06,539
and so the Dharma has to do with that relatedness and it's nice to begin that

113
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:12,779
talking about Dharma to really emphasize relatedness relationships

114
00:32:12,779 --> 00:32:18,539
first and foremost as opposed to Me Myself and mine

115
00:32:18,539 --> 00:32:23,820
just you know independent of the world and anything else

116
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:30,600
and then yesterday I talked about how Dharma sometimes one of those many meanings

117
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:37,679
that it has is different variations of the word action conduct and often it refers to Good

118
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:44,580
Conduct but sometimes it refers to bad conduct too like monastics when they

119
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:50,520
during the transgression of their monastic rules is sometimes called the dhamma the Dharma

120
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:55,559
so but the emphasis here is action into the activity

121
00:32:55,559 --> 00:33:00,659
and that in so many different ways this early tradition focuses on the dynamic

122
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:07,620
quality of life and and where maybe activity is a better word than action

123
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:13,620
the activity of Life the activity of of phenomena that everything is in motion

124
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:21,179
everything is moving foreign and then the uh

125
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:26,220
uh today what I'd like to emphasize is the meaning of that's a little more

126
00:33:26,220 --> 00:33:33,059
common meaning for Dharma that's often uh called upon or highlighted

127
00:33:33,059 --> 00:33:38,460
and that is Dharma can mean truth but that requires some explanation of

128
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:43,559
what truth means and and here in this Dharma consequence

129
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:51,179
a context the primary truths that we're looking for like the four noble truths are

130
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:56,640
truths of uh that of what what happens in the relationship

131
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:04,200
what the impact our actions have on other things so we live in

132
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:09,898
relatedness our actions impact are having a part of that

133
00:34:09,899 --> 00:34:17,700
relatedness and so that um and so our actions uh affect the

134
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,858
quality of what transpires in the association

135
00:34:22,859 --> 00:34:28,080
the connection the relatedness the the

136
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:35,220
support the the impact of what comes as a result of the action

137
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:42,419
and so Dharma has uh as truth has very important to begin understanding a few

138
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:51,898
things about um the impact of action the the

139
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:59,099
so the impact on others and impact on ourselves and so so that seeing the truth of that

140
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:05,099
is important because if you understand the impact of your actions then you can

141
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:10,980
adjust your actions so they impact you can take responsibility for it more so

142
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:18,020
if the impact is harmful you would stop doing if it's beneficial you would continue

143
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:23,160
and if it's a combination of both then we have to use our best wisdom to figure

144
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:29,240
out what the wisest way forward is but this care and sensitivity to impact

145
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:36,839
is a very important part of this Dharma as the truth to see oh what I do has

146
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:42,359
consequences and uh this is a very the simplest way

147
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:48,119
of describing the Buddhist principles of karma is that karma is the teaching that or

148
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:55,920
the idea the Insight the truth that some of our actions have consequences or all actions have

149
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:02,820
consequences one way or the other and uh and we have some choice about

150
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:09,660
what consequences we create in this world and the ones that again to simplify it

151
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:16,500
to kind of the core truth around this about this focus on consequence impact

152
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:24,119
of our actions is to really understand uh

153
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:31,680
what is harmful and what is not and to avoid harmful actions

154
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:37,079
to avoid causing harm in the world best we can

155
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:43,440
and avoid causing harm to ourselves

156
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:50,220
and this so this idea the truth Dharma is truth is a truth that we can

157
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:56,640
see and know for ourselves we can know if we're paying attention if

158
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,920
what we're doing is harmful and if we're very attentive we can feel

159
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:09,119
the harm not necessarily in the impact but also not only in the impact but also

160
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:17,460
in the in the activity itself that if we do something with hostility

161
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:23,460
that has a negative consequence maybe for others it has a negative consequence for us in

162
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:30,380
the future perhaps but it also has negative consequences in the moment because hostility itself

163
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:36,660
involves stress involves tension it involves dukkah pain

164
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:42,839
there's pain in the very na in the very activity of of hostility

165
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:48,660
agree the same way that yes greed can cause problems in the world and human

166
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:56,700
greed uh you know that's it's uh it's a Monumental that the

167
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:03,720
impact now on the planet of of the way the greed and desire of certain individuals many individuals all

168
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:10,500
individuals the accumulative effect and but the very Act of having greed

169
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:16,800
there's something very different in greed than just uh open-handed desire greed itself

170
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,440
is painful an activity which has pain within it has dukka within it

171
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,859
and so to begin seeing the truth of consequence

172
00:38:28,859 --> 00:38:36,540
the truth of not only consequence but the then we see better the the

173
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:41,820
um the the where you know how it is

174
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:47,280
that what we're doing what it is that we're doing that has this negative consequence

175
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:53,700
and uh and so the truth of really seeing this here and this is one of the reasons why

176
00:38:53,700 --> 00:39:00,060
mindfulness practice is so effective so important in Buddhism because mindfulness practice is not just

177
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:05,880
to be in the present moment to enjoy your tea and enjoy the sunrise the moment here

178
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:12,680
but more important is so we can see this really carefully in maybe even minutely

179
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:20,220
the impact uh of this relate in this related world that we live in how our actions

180
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:28,020
have impact have consequences and uh and to see that if I cling

181
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:34,980
any craving and clinging brings suffering at a minimum to oneself

182
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:40,560
and and many times to others as well and so

183
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:48,660
to be able to and so when we're doing this we're also entering into this world where Dharma in in the etymological

184
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:54,599
origin of the word means the kind of means that kind of a little bit of a

185
00:39:54,599 --> 00:40:03,359
modern construction based on the etymology of different elements of it but it's the the uh the way in which the

186
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:09,000
coordinated Cooperative nature of reality so either supports us

187
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:15,180
or or doesn't undermines us and the Dharma the word

188
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:22,079
Dharma is often focused on it's often considered a very positive word not always but it's almost synonymous with

189
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,839
like the the um the uh the Dharma is the actions

190
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:34,740
which are healthy and wholesome and supportive and Dharma is the support that that's

191
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:42,060
offered the help that's offered the benefit that that's offered and so when we talk about the Dharma the

192
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:47,700
Buddhist Dharma and the big part of it then is that supportive that helpful and

193
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:53,760
beneficial action that because all action is in

194
00:40:53,760 --> 00:41:00,660
relationship to other things it then has a beneficial consequences

195
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:06,420
for these other things in place whether it's within ourselves psychologically or

196
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:12,980
whether it's uh out in the world Dharma encompasses all of it

197
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:20,339
so um so a simple way of saying what I'm

198
00:41:20,339 --> 00:41:27,480
saying today is that uh uh if car karma is the attention to the consequences of

199
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:35,220
our actions then karma is Dharma Dharma is karma

200
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:41,820
and the two can't be really teased apart so we have

201
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:47,220
um relatedness and to

202
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:53,520
be sensitive to the kind of the invisible relationships invisible and that you know you can't

203
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,760
you know the relatedness often can't be touched or seen literally we can can

204
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:05,460
know it and recognize it in the impact in the that goes on and in the source in

205
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:12,599
ourselves um but uh to start being attuned to that which is the relatedness in all things

206
00:42:12,599 --> 00:42:18,060
to be to go out and look at a tree and and appreciate the relatedness we have

207
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:23,180
to the tree that the tree produces oxygen and takes our carbon

208
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:28,560
dioxide and converts it into oxygen again and we live independence of it

209
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:34,040
that one way or the other we live Independence on the clouds and the rain

210
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:39,960
that brings you know that for the water we we lit we we drink

211
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:45,599
and so to start looking at the at the relatedness and the mutual support and

212
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,420
the back and forth and um and to appreciate that how we

213
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:58,020
live in this world the actions that we do are they beautiful to walk in Beauty as

214
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:03,480
a Native American expression um the word uh good karma in Buddhism

215
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:09,300
literally the word for that is sometimes is beautiful Karma beautiful actions

216
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:14,940
to live in a world where our actions is related world with actions that are

217
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:22,319
beautiful and beautiful focuses also on the what the beauty and wonderfulness of the

218
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:28,140
impact of our actions so I want to review all this because I would like to propose

219
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:34,859
that uh this is a a radically different way of uh understanding the world

220
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:43,800
looking at the world being in the world participating in the world then an excessive focus on oneself

221
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:48,900
as a static thing as it's all about me and what I get for myself or an

222
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:56,900
excessive focus on the world out there but that uh or things that things have to be a certain way and uh

223
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:02,760
but it's uh more important than things is the relatedness

224
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:08,220
and when we have the relatedness then we have the ability to see the truth of how

225
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:17,220
our actions impact that relatedness and and spill over and for the path of Freedom that this is

226
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:23,900
where the domain this is the area of attention to go forward into Freedom

227
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:29,460
excessive focus on the self without how things within us even relate to each

228
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:35,900
other and the relatedness kind of takes it away a little bit from the sense of

229
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:42,180
self-appropriation everything into self um what is it

230
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:48,240
and um so for today if you'd like to have an

231
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:55,140
assignment to kind of carry this forward and explore it for yourself in a quiet way

232
00:44:55,140 --> 00:45:01,560
made many sense you know no one has to know you're doing this um as you go about your day both

233
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:08,460
with the inanimate World The Living World the human world around you as you interact with them

234
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:15,300
um at give attention to the impact that you

235
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:21,300
have the consequences from what you say what you do and what you think

236
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:27,000
then the what you're saying what you do might be impactful for others what you

237
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:34,440
think might be impactful for you and see the truth of that that impact

238
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:41,760
and see if the truth of the value then of finding the way to non-harming

239
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:47,880
maybe being beneficial so Dharma I'm hoping you're beginning to

240
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:57,060
appreciate is this powerful multivalent Rich word that kind of opens up the world

241
00:45:57,060 --> 00:46:02,460
um in in a wonderful way so

242
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:05,180
thank you
