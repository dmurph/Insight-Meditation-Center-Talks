1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:09,160
happy to be here with you so this is the second uh session on basic instructions

2
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:16,360
in mindfulness laying down the foundations for what we do and

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,560
um so yesterday I said that one of the functions of mindfulness of

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:28,760
breathing uh you know a a sincere but relaxed dedication to being present with

5
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:36,600
the breathing is not to succeed at that task but rather to have that task

6
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,719
highlight um how distracted we are how busy the mind is what we're caught up in

7
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:49,280
and one of the advantages of beginning that way is that uh then you succeed

8
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,640
right away uh if you try to stay present on the breathing but there's a lot of

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,559
forces of distraction then you can be frustrated right away

10
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,960
the other reason is that um

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:14,280
um that distraction is

12
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,720
um it's useful to think of distraction the more more that we're distracted more

13
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:28,000
we're ruminating caught up in our thoughts the more we're fixating on something like our emotions or memories

14
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:33,479
or what's happening around us our body experience the more we're caught up in

15
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,840
it the more it represents stress more it represents

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:46,000
tension and there's a feedback loop between tension and stress and more

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:54,520
distractability more uh T more rumination more distract

18
00:01:54,520 --> 00:02:00,960
distraction so a very important part of meditation is really

19
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,560
relaxation reducing the stress that we have and one of the wonderful very

20
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,920
significant applications of Buddhist mindfulness practice in United States or

21
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:18,879
in the world now has been a a protocol a process called

22
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:26,040
mindfulness-based stress reduction and I'm not going to want to diminish the Val tremendous value of

23
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,360
that but from a Buddhist point of view if you study the teachings of the Buddha

24
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,959
they would it would be reversed it would be uh stress reduction based

25
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:46,959
mindfulness stress reduction based awareness so that we We Begin by

26
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:54,440
focusing on relaxing and with the proper kind of

27
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:01,080
softening easing relaxing then rather than a feedback

28
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:07,400
loop with more thinking there's a feedback loop to more awareness more

29
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:15,080
present moment attention so to assume a meditation

30
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:24,400
posture that supports two things supports

31
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,080
relaxation supports some sense of ease in the body

32
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:36,439
and that could be lying down it could be sitting it can be

33
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:44,040
standing and uh it could also be walking there's something called Walking

34
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,239
meditation and to assume a posture that works for

35
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,159
you and if all things are equal I suggest a seated

36
00:03:57,400 --> 00:04:05,439
posture and so a posture that is allows you to be to

37
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:13,200
relax the second thing about the posture is a posture that brings with

38
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:21,280
it some degree of alertness a attentive

39
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:31,000
posture something that has some intentionality in it that we're

40
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:38,440
activating something that we have to be attentive to being present here

41
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,160
with so relaxation and alertness

42
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:54,320
together gently close the eyes or if you don't want to close them which is fine

43
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,560
perhaps lowering the Gaze so you're not looking at it

44
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:06,800
anything in particular just kind of a loose Focus as if you're looking at a mountain far in

45
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,039
the

46
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:20,759
distance and then to if your eyes are

47
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:27,520
closed also notice if you're have engaged your eyes as if you're looking

48
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:35,719
at something using your eyes primarily to be

49
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:45,000
aware and to let your eyes res rest in their

50
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,720
sockets eyes do not have to be

51
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:04,000
activated and often when we're stressed or tense

52
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,720
it affects the breathing breathing becomes sometimes more

53
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:17,080
shallow short sometimes breathing more in the

54
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:24,599
chest often if there's tension breathing is we there's more

55
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:30,840
work asserted in breathing

56
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:38,599
to gently take a

57
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:44,639
few somewhat deeper breaths maybe half as full as you could

58
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,880
if

59
00:06:52,479 --> 00:07:01,400
you and then as you exhale to extend the exhale

60
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:08,400
it's almost as if there's an added relaxation Letting Go softening in the

61
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,840
body that allows a longer

62
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:31,319
exhale and relaxing as you exhale

63
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,000
and then to let your breathing return to

64
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:57,919
normal as you exhale especially at the end of the

65
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:04,319
exhale soof soften the belly relax let

66
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:11,280
go so in a natural way the exhale continues for a few

67
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
moments

68
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,480
as you exhale relax the

69
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,200
chest the rib cug

70
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,680
Letting Go a softening on the

71
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,000
exhale on the exhale softening the

72
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
shoulders

73
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,720
having the shoulders yield to the pull of

74
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
gravity

75
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,839
and as you inhale feel whatever tension there might

76
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:19,800
be in the area of the face and on the exhale soften the

77
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,760
muscles of the

78
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,040
face

79
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:01,040
if you notice that you're distracted distract the

80
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:08,040
chances are there's some place of tension

81
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,600
within pressure

82
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:24,680
contraction it could be in the thinking mind the area maybe in your head where

83
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,959
thinking is congested contracted

84
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:42,760
pressured as you exhale Relax The Thinking

85
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,480
mind relax the forces of

86
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
distraction

87
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
for

88
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:06,160
for and then to drop into your the your

89
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,759
body's experience of

90
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:20,320
breathing wherever in your body the experience of breathing is most

91
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:26,440
pronounced for you or clearest or easiest to

92
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,000
feel on the exhale relax

93
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,519
into that experience of

94
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
breathing

95
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:15,440
and if you find yourself being pulled into your

96
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:22,720
thinking appreciate that you know that that you see

97
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:34,600
that I appreciate the awareness that can know you're distracted and if you know it clearly

98
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:40,120
you are not distracted you're

99
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:50,199
Mindful and then see if there's any tension in your muscles your mind

100
00:14:50,199 --> 00:14:57,680
associated with thinking or

101
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,000
not that you can relax on the

102
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:25,519
exhale and as you relax to

103
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:30,800
appreciate the awareness the

104
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:37,079
mindfulness that results the greater sense of being here

105
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:42,160
with your experience that

106
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:46,040
relaxing

107
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
evokes

108
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
for

109
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
for

110
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
for

111
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:02,158
as your lungs fill with with oxygen on the

112
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:09,840
inhale let your awareness spread out throughout your whole

113
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:17,840
body feeling it and then as you

114
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:22,320
exhale relax the whole

115
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:33,039
body release holding throughout the

116
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:45,480
body and as you relax release soften the

117
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:54,000
body no matter how little you're able to do even if

118
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:02,280
nothing see if there can come a natural natural

119
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:06,880
increase in feeling present

120
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,360
aware here

121
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
now

122
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
e

123
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:56,640
resting with your breathing but when you're

124
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,799
distracted be intent to know

125
00:21:01,799 --> 00:21:06,919
that mindfulness is working to know you're

126
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:19,279
distracted and then see where you can relax

127
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:29,400
soften let go so that there's a heightened

128
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:33,559
sense of being present being

129
00:21:38,279 --> 00:21:46,080
aware and into that awareness invite back the

130
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
breathing

131
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

132
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

133
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

134
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
e

135
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
e

136
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
e

137
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
e

138
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:49,120
and then as we come to the end of this

139
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:59,679
sitting to take a few moments to notice how you are right now

140
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:04,398
how you might be different from the beginning of the

141
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,840
meditation how are you in your

142
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,880
body how are you with your

143
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:29,600
breathing how are you with your mind

144
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,840
and how are you in your

145
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:04,640
heart and for the next three

146
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:16,399
breaths to relax on the exhale to relax as deeply and fully as

147
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:22,480
you can maybe with an extended

148
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
exhale

149
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:55,399
and then to consider going forth from this

150
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:03,880
meditation and after my teach teaching perhaps to encounter the world

151
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,720
people animals plants

152
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,360
neighbors people in the

153
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:22,639
community all places where you find people who have stress and

154
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:29,440
tension who maybe are suffering some way or other

155
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,398
and from whatever calm or subtleness that you

156
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:45,480
have to Aspire that the benefits of this

157
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:53,039
meditation can spread from here to benefit every everyone and everywhere

158
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:58,320
that your attention goes

159
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:03,960
any person any being that you think about meet

160
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,919
see may they be

161
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:15,600
happy may they be

162
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:22,639
safe may they be

163
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,320
peaceful may they be free

164
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:45,640
and may I may each of us contribute to that

165
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:54,440
possibility through being relaxed a relaxed calm peaceful

166
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:59,320
presence for others

167
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:15,079
[Music]

168
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:20,919
so hello and welcome to this second talk on introduction to mindfulness

169
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:27,919
practice and one of the very important principles

170
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:35,880
of mindfulness is Simplicity don't make the practice

171
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:42,440
complicated mindfulness is the capacity to be aware of our present moment

172
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:48,760
experience in a simple way and one of that areas of

173
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:58,159
Simplicity is to notice it um things as they are not as we wish

174
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:04,559
they are so if we're distracted if we're caught up in our

175
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:10,840
thoughts a successful moment practice of mindfulness is to

176
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:19,720
know that and then but to know it in such a way it's possible maybe it's a it's it's

177
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:25,480
sometime in the future for some of you but it's possible that in the knowing

178
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,880
the clear knowing we're distracted so we have to kind of step

179
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:36,120
back from being distracted our thoughts our thought stream just enough step back

180
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:42,519
we can really see it might still be going on so that we can almost as if or maybe

181
00:32:42,519 --> 00:32:49,559
we do in our mind say oh this is distraction this is being

182
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:58,320
caught in thought and uh and uh and to be delighted in that

183
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:05,360
knowing and even no matter how difficult or challenging the thinking or the concern might be to have some deep

184
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:12,039
appreciation for the value of stepping back and seeing it knowing it

185
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:17,240
clearly so that's possible so simply to know that we're

186
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:22,720
distracted and over time come to appreciate that simple

187
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,559
knowing and that most forces of distraction most

188
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:36,760
things when we're caught up in anything the chances are that we're tense in some way something is tense inside of us and

189
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:43,399
the representative kind of example of how this might work is um uh seeing with

190
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:49,360
the eyes if you take your eyes and you find a little spot in front of you um

191
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:54,559
and you hold your eyes on that spot just fixate it on the spot don't let it f

192
00:33:54,559 --> 00:33:59,679
move from that spot the eyes will actually tense up it's actually tiring

193
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:05,320
for the eyes to hold them on a little spot without moving what the eyes want

194
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:11,520
to do when they're relaxed free doing their own thing without our holding on

195
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:19,520
to something is the eyes float the the eyes move and Roam and

196
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:25,040
kind of just float around and we scanning the experience of what's

197
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:32,040
Happening not fixating on it and we might look at some small area but the Eyes by themselves will gently scan

198
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:37,599
and move they're relaxed but as soon as we kind of fixate there's a tension that

199
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:44,158
buildt up so the same thing with our uh distractability there's a tension that

200
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:51,358
builds up so one of the instructions in meditation is the importance of noticing

201
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:56,599
that tension noticing how we're tight in the shoulders in the belly and the chest

202
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:03,040
could be be in the hands in the thighs in the lower back shoulders shoulder

203
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:10,440
blade area it could be in the throat it could be in the jaw the nose the

204
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,560
cheeks around the eyes and the forehead it could be deep inside someplace deep

205
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:24,800
inside the skull there's many places where we can hold tension muscles get

206
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,200
tight and remember that just to know something is

207
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:36,640
the essence of mindfulness and to know it in such a way that it's kind of you really appreciate

208
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:43,079
knowing it which means that you're not caught up in the judging of it or

209
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:51,000
assigning meaning to it but rather you're appreciating stepping back oh I can see it I know it so there look at

210
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:56,960
that look at that tension look at all that uh tightness in my muscles and my

211
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,599
jaw look at that it might be it might feel it might be painful it might be

212
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:09,480
unpleasant and but don't be kind of distracted by the unpleasant don't be

213
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:15,000
caught in its orbit just kind of stepping back and saying oh that's

214
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:22,440
unpleasant but the essence of this then is can you relax can you soften some place in the

215
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:29,359
body soften the shoulders soften the eyes eyes if they're

216
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:34,720
fixated soften the muscles of the

217
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:45,359
face if you have a tension headache it can be really fascinating to scan

218
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:50,440
through the body to see where you can relax where is the tension and then see

219
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:56,000
as you relax especially relaxing the muscul of the of the head the face how

220
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:03,240
does it affect the tension headache the pain soften the

221
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:10,319
belly sometimes the tension in the body the physical tension is a direct

222
00:37:10,319 --> 00:37:19,359
expression of tension in the mind preoccupation fixation in the mind and it's almost as if the mind this

223
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:26,839
is the metaphor that Buddha gave that the mind is a puppeteer and it has all these strings

224
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:33,359
uh from the you know the fingers of the Puppeteer going down to all the different muscles in her body and

225
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:40,440
constantly pulling and tugging on them um to make us tense and um you know it's

226
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:47,520
a and you'll probably notice sometimes that you're sitting maybe minding your own business quiet peaceful and suddenly

227
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:54,839
there's a thought of something terrible something that happened long ago and you get angry or something and the the the

228
00:37:54,839 --> 00:38:00,599
the maybe the stomach tenses up and there's a fear or anger so the Puppeteer

229
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:07,960
has done its work and um but then there uh so certainly the the tension of the mind

230
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:13,480
can affect the body but there's a reverse that as the body

231
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:22,599
relaxes the mind also can relax as the body tenses more then that it fuels more

232
00:38:22,599 --> 00:38:31,119
tense thinking and preoccupation so this movement of relaxing is such a useful One

233
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:37,200
releasing uh quieting and exactly what the activity

234
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:43,800
is for each of us it's a little bit different maybe so I keep using the word relax but it could be that for you a

235
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:49,760
better word is to calm calm the body uh sometimes I like the word gentle

236
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:57,880
gentle the body and um and uh or release the the body

237
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:03,200
another word I like is to ease ease

238
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:10,160
up be easy in the body be easy with how things are ease up on

239
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:17,599
things so whatever you understand this activity that I I I use as a generic

240
00:39:17,599 --> 00:39:25,000
term or general term um relaxing um this is an Avenue a method

241
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:33,000
by which to awaken more awareness as we relax as we're more preoccupied more

242
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:41,520
distracted there's less present moment awareness available as we relax and open notice

243
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:46,960
how that allows for more simple present moment

244
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:55,720
awareness as that present moment becomes more available invite in the breathing some

245
00:39:55,720 --> 00:40:02,640
people tend up when you they are told you know now focus on the breathing concentrate on breathing and then they

246
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:10,960
have the idea they have to concentrate and not be distracted not leave leave it and so they tense up and uh or even just

247
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:16,960
the movement of the mind we say you know bring the Mind back that movement of bringing the Mind back

248
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,400
so-called becomes kind of even that is kind of a tightening up and so the idea

249
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:29,319
is to find a way to be to awaken your mindfulness or allow it to kind of

250
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:35,560
continue so that there is no tensing up and one form of doing this it works for

251
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:41,520
some people is um once we notice we're back to some state of awareness to

252
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:46,960
invite the breathing into that awareness to invite it into a into attention to

253
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:53,079
invite it back into knowing and um and then to maybe rest

254
00:40:53,079 --> 00:41:00,440
with it relax with it flow with it care be be carried by the movements of breathing in and breathing out until we

255
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,960
notice that we are distracted again distractive means that you're it's

256
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:11,599
almost like you know you are tensing up you are kind of getting preoccupied if there's if there's quiet

257
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,560
thoughts in the background uh and you're able to kind of just stay with the breathing uh just let

258
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:24,480
it be in the background don't worry about it but when the thinking comes in the foreground or predominates that's

259
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:32,800
when you want to uh uh let your attention notice your thinking and relax something and in the

260
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:40,520
relaxing maybe invite back your breathing so in this way hopefully

261
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:47,160
there's a developing of mindfulness meditation where you're learning not to be in conflict with any experience that

262
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:54,560
you're mindful of it's that's maybe a tall order but uh when you learn to do

263
00:41:54,560 --> 00:42:00,880
it it actually keeps things much simple simpler conflict is is

264
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:10,000
complicated so um as you go about your day today um you could try noticing when

265
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:16,160
you're fixated on something preoccupied by something when you're zeroed in

266
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,480
because you have a lot of concerns or fear or anger annoyance or desires or

267
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:27,680
ambition or something and notice um the tension in your body

268
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:34,839
tension in your mind notice the tightening the narrowing and then see if you can relax

269
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:40,160
relax the body and for this day I'd encourage you to look for lots of

270
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:45,800
opportunities to keep coming back to your body to relax it relax as you drive

271
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:52,400
when you sit down in your car to drive relax before you start driving when you sit down to a meal don't just start

272
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:58,599
eating right away take you know some 10 15 seconds just to relax there and

273
00:42:58,599 --> 00:43:05,319
soften um maybe occasionally between bites or you whatever look look for all

274
00:43:05,319 --> 00:43:11,680
kinds of EX possibilities and see what that does in bringing a mindfulness

275
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:21,280
attention more fully into this day of yours so it's um stress reduction based

276
00:43:21,280 --> 00:43:27,079
mindfulness as we reduce our stress mindfulness surfaces

277
00:43:27,079 --> 00:43:32,520
so um thank you very much and I'll continue

278
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:40,160
with this tomorrow
