1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,359
welcome everyone so

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,400
today we'll continue where we left off yesterday and uh I want to give thanks

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:19,720
to Julie and Kevin the wonderful other wonderful people who support these

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,320
morning morning Community Gatherings uh from behind the scenes and they tell me

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:32,398
it's not too late to sort of change the the name of this week's

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:41,600
teaching to the Buddhist smile and I'm going to double down on that today I I'll even show some

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,199
images of the Buddha smiling in

8
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:52,440
meditation and it's interesting uh for some time I've noticed the Buddhist

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,840
smile and meditation and I've wondered to

10
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:08,400
myself what's he smiling about what does he know what um what contentment is being

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:17,119
experienced and because in our practice and in these teachings that come down to us uh things are never

12
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,720
one-dimensional I've also understood that these representations and I'll show a few over the next few

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:31,079
days I mean almost any Buddha you look at in meditation is smiling I've also come to understand

14
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,280
that this is an instruction it's a meditation

15
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:42,439
instruction to smile when we meditate inwardly perhaps

16
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,520
uh or I should say outwardly perhaps but inwardly most certainly there's contentment to be

17
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:54,200
found in the meditation and as we explored yesterday the pleasant of the meditation the pleasure of the

18
00:01:54,200 --> 00:02:01,280
meditation can be leaned into can be supported can be cultivated as part of the path and

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,600
uh the Buddha's smile and meditation I take to be an instruction that points

20
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,000
that direction so let's continue with that today

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,440
today's the the second knowledge that arises in the meditation that may give rise to this sort of smile and

22
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,560
meditation inward possibly outward is the

23
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:29,519
following this meditation this meditation practice is noble and onward

24
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:37,120
leading is the way I'm going to characterize it so let's let's bring our uh attention

25
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:43,239
inward I like to think as I close the eyes close invitation to close the eyes if that's a

26
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:49,879
comfortable part of the meditation for you um I like to think of bringing the

27
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:55,239
attention both Inward and downward sort of

28
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:01,200
inward in a in a gesture towards seclusion

29
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:07,480
downward into the body to sort of at least initially bring our attention into

30
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,879
the embodied aspect of the experience of

31
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:20,480
meditation the settl of the body the weight of the body the um slow pace of

32
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:25,920
the body the Simplicity of the body's experience can be places where we can

33
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:34,000
first rest our attention in a way that opens up to Greater ease in the

34
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:42,000
mind and as we settle in today maybe we

35
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:48,560
can think about letting a smile play over our features this can be internal

36
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:55,439
or external but it can be quite um instructive actually

37
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,480
to give a little give a little smile to the features

38
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,599
if you ever do this in a mirror with your eyes open you'll notice that frequently when

39
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:12,640
we smile inwardly and we bring that smile to our features it actually

40
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:20,239
doesn't register on our features before we crack a a wide grin

41
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:27,040
there's a very gentle a very gentle uplifting in the

42
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,520
features that for our meditation today can be an expression of any greater ease

43
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:40,400
that comes with the meditation so settling in with the

44
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,759
breath settling in with the body settling in with the simple

45
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:52,039
knowing of experience that's available in the

46
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:58,758
meditation we can bring our attention to Greater ease

47
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:08,720
and the profound message of today's teaching is that as we do so as ease and body and

48
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:14,919
mind begin to arise in the meditation we notice about the

49
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:20,560
meditation that it's in the words of the suta from which I quoted Noble and

50
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:31,560
onward leading the meditation itself generates

51
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,039
a knowing that the

52
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:42,919
Mind likes to be oriented toward

53
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:51,840
freedom and we don't have to create anything make anything up in the meditation a knowledge that arises all

54
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,919
by itself in the words of the sutta arises inwardly as

55
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:04,080
a a beneficial side effect of the meditation itself is a knowing that the

56
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,919
Mind wants to be free and here too we can lean into this

57
00:06:10,919 --> 00:06:16,960
wholesome wanting to be free as a way to deepen and strengthen

58
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,240
our

59
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:29,360
practice we can do this in the meditation and we have this wonderful technology of the meditation that goes

60
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,919
like this we're all familiar with this oh who knows maybe one or two of us not

61
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:40,599
so much but the mind gets entangled it gets caught up in things it tightens up

62
00:06:40,599 --> 00:06:46,199
around oh thoughts of the future thoughts of the past thoughts of other people thoughts of

63
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:53,199
ourselves and in the meditation practice we when we notice this when we wake up to this we bring our attention back to

64
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:59,599
Center we open back up if the mind's becoming tight to here to now just know

65
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:05,080
knowing what's going on without adding anything without

66
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:10,720
judging just being here just knowing this

67
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:18,400
now every time this happens far from being uh a source of frustration or

68
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,720
agitation this can be an opportunity to notice that with that return home the

69
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:30,919
return to Center the return to here now we can touch space with the mind's

70
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:38,440
desire to be free this wholesome orientation toward

71
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:46,520
free this is what's meant in this second knowledge touching in with this knowing

72
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:52,000
that this meditation experience points towards

73
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
freedom

74
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440

e e

110
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,679
so as we start to come to the end of this set

111
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:03,520
let's reorient our attention again

112
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,640
to what we might call the Finer

113
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:15,760
Things the way the meditation suggests that the

114
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:24,000
Mind wants to be free and the way it for that

115
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:31,200
reason brings our attention to subtler and

116
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:39,039
subtler ways of meeting experience ways of knowing ways of

117
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,120
being ways of meeting our

118
00:27:53,159 --> 00:27:59,720
experience the Finer Things of Life The Meditation

119
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:03,158
suggests aren't

120
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:18,000
things and we can keep tuning into this direction that the meditation presents

121
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:23,519
us with an orientation

122
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:28,519
toward peace towards ease

123
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:41,559
towards a presence in our lives that's unmediated by projection

124
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:00,600
clinging and this too this orientation

125
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:06,480
toward freedom is something that we can bring

126
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:14,799
with us into the world of interaction the world of our daily

127
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:23,600
round sort of keep it always in mind yesterday talked about just meeting

128
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:28,960
experience with some of that greater ease that the meditation provides

129
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:36,080
es today we can also think about meeting the world with an

130
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,080
orientation toward Freedom that the meditation

131
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:47,559
suggests who knows what that means when we meet a particular

132
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:54,519
situation that's to be discovered meditation provides a

133
00:29:54,519 --> 00:30:02,760
potential uh a prop intensity a momentum

134
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:20,679
[Music]

135
00:30:23,490 --> 00:30:29,309
[Music]

136
00:30:31,820 --> 00:30:37,179
[Music]

137
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,559
so welcome back or welcome if you're just joining

138
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:58,080
now as I said it as we began the meditation

139
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:03,720
I want to keep going in this vein of exploring the Buddha Smile by way of by

140
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:11,039
way of bringing forward from the teachings from the texts these five so-called knowledges or

141
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:18,159
understandings that emerge in the meditation as a product of the deepening of the meditation without

142
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,960
our having to exert effort uh except the effort of

143
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:32,559
paying attention to our experience of the meditation and uh I promised that I would share

144
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:37,639
some pictures of the Buddhist smile this is an interesting book called Lost

145
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:45,360
kingdoms Hindu Buddhist sculpture of early southeast Asia it was a period of time where there's sort of a combination

146
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:52,399
of Buddhist and Hindu issues uh sorry images imagery

147
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:57,440
iconography but throughout here from the little buddha on the top

148
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:03,320
of the big Buddha's head you can see this lovely little

149
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:13,519
smile that plays over the Buddha's features in meditation and uh almost in every image

150
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,000
of the Buddha meditation in this book you can see

151
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,000
this and I encourage you to seek out Buddha

152
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:33,880
images trying to get this in focus and good Lu come on nonetheless you can see the

153
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:42,000
smile uh and perhaps one more I encourage you to look

154
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:52,880
around here's a couple lovely ones there's a nice image of it or this

155
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:58,440
one look around and notice that Buddha images have

156
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:06,799
frequently not always this subtle Mona Lisa smile and I think it's a it can be

157
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,000
useful to um and supportive of practice when we see that smile to sort of take

158
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:19,880
it take it in maybe recall this 5-day session on the knowledges the

159
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:26,080
understandings the knowings that come up in the meditation and that maybe uh bring a

160
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,799
smile forward in internally perhaps a smile that can be seen externally as

161
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:40,240
well and as I suggested at the outset when we see those

162
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,919
images we can uh take it as

163
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:53,240
instruction um that is like all things in these teachings there's multiple ways

164
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:58,639
in which the iconography the images the texts can be read

165
00:33:58,639 --> 00:34:05,760
and here too we can uh we can take this smile that we see in the Buddhist face

166
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:12,679
as instruction bring a smile into our meditation this is as I said yesterday

167
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:20,320
this meditation experience and the pleasantness of it is to be enjoyed when we enjoy it we cultivate it we make it

168
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:26,320
stronger we um enhance the propensity that we will move forward with that

169
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,799
internal contentment and E that's so useful when we meet the

170
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:43,839
world so the understanding that arises today again being creative with

171
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,878
the translation and again I'm going to read

172
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:56,040
sort of the whole thing that the Buddha says cultivate the meditation

173
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,640
practice we could say strive to the extent they're striving in

174
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:07,800
this practice exert appropriate effort I'm going to say to deepen the meditation

175
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:15,200
practice and as one does so five knowledges arise for us the

176
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:22,440
first one yesterday is that the pleasure in the meditation is to be cultivated not to be feared that it's part of the

177
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,839
path and today that this meditation experience is Noble

178
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:33,839
onward leading and the technical term which I'm going to unpack in a moment is

179
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:39,599
that it's not of the flesh but it's not of the world we could

180
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:47,320
say I like to think of this maybe as an

181
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:54,440
awareness that the Mind seeks profound relief profound ease profound

182
00:35:54,440 --> 00:36:00,400
release and as I tried to bring bring our attention to in the guided

183
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:07,640
meditation being aware of this being noticing that knowing that comes up in the meditation is really useful in

184
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:15,680
deepening our practice the meditation suggests that the Mind wants to be free and when we

185
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:24,319
notice that wholesome desire to be free uh it strengthens it makes it a

186
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:31,440
momentum creates Direction in our

187
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,599
practice so um in the

188
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:46,040
teachings this um what I'm sort of describing here

189
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:51,240
as a something that happens over time not a noun but a

190
00:36:51,240 --> 00:37:00,119
verb a creating of momentum a uh uh or an adjective or

191
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:08,079
adverb instead of again a noun on something in the meditation that's onward leading that orients us toward

192
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:13,280
Freedom again and again each time we return to the breath each time we return

193
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,319
to a meditation object There's an opportunity to notice that that ease the

194
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:25,880
Simplicity of experience the pace the slower pace of the body's experience in

195
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:32,480
the meditation are hints um that the practice of the

196
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:39,800
meditation leads toward peace and that there's a desire in the mind for

197
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:47,319
peace I'm realizing that yesterday I introduced possibly sort of radical

198
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:54,359
notion that the pleasure of the meditation is to be cultivated not not I but the Buddha

199
00:37:54,359 --> 00:37:59,720
recommends this but I I've taken it deeply at the bip practice today I find

200
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:05,880
myself using language of desire a wholesome desire this too is there in

201
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,560
the teachings at the um wanting the

202
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:20,319
mind's um seeking of Freedom we may feel come up as a wanting

203
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:25,480
or a desire and we can recognize oh this is a wholesome one and sometimes when

204
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:33,359
that happens because we have this idea that desire wanting or to be um let go

205
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:40,319
in the practice it can be helpful to think of this orientation toward Freedom as an

206
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:44,960
aspiration an aspiration in our

207
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:55,119
practice so I'll substitute that word but it's okay to lean into that that that wholesome knowing that the Mind

208
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:02,599
wants to be free um that the mind can be

209
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:09,359
free so in the teachings there is uh and and Gil draws attention to this in some

210
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:16,160
of his teachings on the uh sort of the fundamental texts

211
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:23,760
that uh teach us how how and where to establish mindfulness and many of you

212
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:29,720
are familiar I think with the Sati patana suta and the establishing of

213
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:36,359
mindfulness sometimes we characterize the atti patan suta as the four foundations of mindfulness I like to

214
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:43,200
avoid nouns so I'm going to say the establishing of mindfulness in four

215
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,960
different Arenas or spheres of experience throughout these teachings

216
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:55,240
there's this same distinction between things that are noble and onward leading

217
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,920
and things that tie us more to the the

218
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:07,160
um I think we could even say the physical uh aspects of of

219
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:13,359
experiences it's a turning from some of that concern with the world

220
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:21,839
and our engagement and entanglement with the world and the things of the world and an orientation more to the

221
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,640
mind uh and to the knowing that is uh an

222
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:35,040
effortless part of our experience sometimes this distinction

223
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:42,280
it's a tricky one and I I'm gonna I don't know how much how frequently Gil does this but I'm GNA mention the poly

224
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:49,440
terms sisa Anda because they're frequently translated in

225
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:55,160
ways that are that are can be challenging sometimes this contrast

226
00:40:55,160 --> 00:41:00,760
is um presented as one between of the Flesh

227
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:06,079
and not of the flesh other times worldly and

228
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:12,119
unworldly Gil has sometimes talked about the distinction between body body and

229
00:41:12,119 --> 00:41:20,838
mind or between objective and subjective as we refine our establishing of

230
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:28,160
mindfulness and in each of the mindfulness practices there's this

231
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,520
movement from entanglement with the world to a

232
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:39,599
free knowing of the phenomena of

233
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:46,640
experience a movement from entanglement with the with objects with the signs

234
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:55,838
things in the world the appearances of things toward the knowing of

235
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:02,240
experience and in the meditation we have this opportunity to rest in this

236
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:09,160
knowing to return again and again to the here now of experience and notice that

237
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:17,119
the um the mind can with with repeated

238
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:24,559
returning the mind can become increasingly comfortable resting at ease

239
00:42:24,559 --> 00:42:31,160
in the the sort of flow of experience without grasping without entanglement

240
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:37,640
without projection and as we notice that we we

241
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:44,000
we we develop a momentum and we receive in the from the meditation in the

242
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,240
meditation this orientation toward toward Freedom sort of natural

243
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:57,200
urge and as I said a moment ago aspiration toward being more free more

244
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:04,880
are awake in in the world and as I speak of these things and

245
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:12,680
with some awareness that um they may they may

246
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:21,839
seem esoteric or um abstract I want to return to the very uh

247
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:27,440
to the very visceral knowing that emerges in the meditation and that even

248
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:34,240
now as I speak about these things brings a smile to my features this

249
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:40,640
smile which I'm using as a theme for the week of this one particularly but the Buddhist smile the smile that comes in

250
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:48,119
the meditation when we talk about when we recognize when we rest in when we

251
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:55,480
acknowledge when we become aware of the desire of the mind to be

252
00:43:55,480 --> 00:44:02,040
free is is something that can bring bring great joy to our practice and to our

253
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:07,319
lives and uh because I neglected to at the end of

254
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:14,000
The Meditation I'll I'll take this opportunity to dedicate the Merit of our

255
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:22,079
practice today in this way to um feel in the meditation these

256
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:28,000
knowledges arising all by themselves we just pay attention we bring our attention again again back to the here

257
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:33,079
and now and as we do so over time we get rid of the frustration it's like oh dang

258
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:40,480
I lost track of the breath whatever we just notice that here's an opportunity when we return to here and now it feels

259
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:46,200
good as we said yesterday feels good to be here and it points

260
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:52,000
onward and maybe we can bring some of that momentum forward forward momentum

261
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:57,920
toward Freedom into our actions and interactions today

262
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:06,680
in a way that benefits others so this is a sweet thing for ourselves generates maybe an internal

263
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:12,200
smile um and it benefits others to

264
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:17,880
smile inwardly or outwardly but to bring that momentum toward Freedom into our

265
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:26,040
actions and interactions freedom is possible meditation makes that clear freedom is a

266
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:32,920
direction the mind if we allow it to if we encourage it to

267
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:38,280
if we provide the conditions for that and that momentum can be shared

268
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,880
with others so in closing let's bring bring a smile to the practice when you

269
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:51,599
look at when you see Buddhist today tomorrow this week going forward notice that smile take it as an instruction

270
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:57,400
bring it into your practice and then share it with the idea that it benefits

271
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:03,400
it's not just ourselves but all beings may all beings know this

272
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:09,280
contentment may all beings find this path to Freedom may all

273
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:16,480
beings know happiness be free of suffering be

274
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:25,559
free so thank you very much looking forward to tomorrow already where we'll continue exploring

275
00:46:25,559 --> 00:46:30,160
the Buddha smile thank you
