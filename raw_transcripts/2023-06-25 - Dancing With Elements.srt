1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:07,220

and so welcome welcome joining us together here physically in IMC and also on

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,939
YouTube so knowing that we have a broader Sangha all around

4
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:27,980
and I also uh mentioned that the potluck welcomes everyone

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:34,020
um because it's us getting together to celebrate the significant occasion

6
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:42,480
and so you have value can stay around and join us afterwards

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:51,000
so today the topic I brought with me is the Buddhist teachings on the four Great

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:57,600
elements or five and sometimes there's six and so I'm just gonna say elements

9
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,378
okay and this is uh in some way it wasn't

10
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:12,240
planned but I was kind of just happened to follow on Kim Allen's 7 A.M this last

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,479
week's meditation and the elements as well

12
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,380
and so for those who didn't get the chance to participate on the 7 A.M and I

13
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,560
just offer a little background on this teachings of

14
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,799
the element and the four or five or six

15
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:42,900
elements are often known as the earth water

16
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:48,780
Fire and Air and then sometimes the fifth would be the space

17
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:55,939
and sometimes the six is the Consciousness and today we're just mostly in the four and five territory

18
00:01:55,939 --> 00:02:01,680
first of four and five and that the fire element sometimes is

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:08,099
translated as a heat element so you see those words as well and the error

20
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:13,200
element sometimes is translated as a wind winter element so you may hear

21
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,280
those interchangeably and these are the basic elements that

22
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:26,700
make up the world we live in and the planet we're living the Earth underneath

23
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:35,780
of us and as well as this body his body is made of this set of elements

24
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,019
and the different Are Spiritual and religious Traditions often relate to the

25
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:49,440
set of elements in quite significant ways you probably know this and that the

26
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:56,340
indigenous people are often called the stores of the Earth they protect the Earth

27
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:01,560
the land like protecting our own bodies

28
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,860
our own lives and so 2600 years ago in the Buddhist

29
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,959
times people also knew about this elements and

30
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,560
there are some significance in the culture as well

31
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:24,720
and so I wanted to share some teachings specifically from the Buddha about the

32
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:32,040
elements and I'd like to start with the teaching that the Buddha offered to his son

33
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:39,080
rahula and for those who are interesting studying sutas and as a story is

34
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:46,459
documented in number 62 and the rahula

35
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,299
and we decided that this teaching was offered to rahula when he was kind of a

36
00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:00,000
young adult maybe late things or early 20s

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:07,799
and one day and the Buddha got up in the morning and ready to go for armstrand

38
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,379
and then so when he got up and then bahula got up as well and Then followed

39
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:20,699
the Buddha and to go for arms round and so here they are you know the Buddha on

40
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:27,900
the front rahula on the back following him and this is the one rahula has been in

41
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:34,199
the monastic community for more than probably a decades now and

42
00:04:34,199 --> 00:04:39,479
so it was said that he was ordained as a young boy seven-year-old boy

43
00:04:39,479 --> 00:04:45,840
and kind of the you know the father brought him into the monastic Sangha a

44
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,840
monastic community and um

45
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:59,040
so here they are and the Buddha walking the front and the leader of the community the

46
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,979
enlightened the awakened being and rahula the

47
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:10,440
um young maybe handsome young men following the Buddha

48
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:16,500
and I get a sense that there may be a certain attitude and

49
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:24,300
rahula was talking with behind the Buddha as the Buddha had a little sense

50
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:33,419
and maybe rahula has some something you know going on so the Buddha looked back and said to

51
00:05:33,419 --> 00:05:40,259
rahula rahula you should truly see any kind of

52
00:05:40,259 --> 00:05:49,160
a form at all past future or present internal or external course or fine

53
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:56,400
inferior or Superior far or near all form with wise

54
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:05,900
understanding this is not mine I am not this this is not myself

55
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:12,240
and so I want to just pause and say a few words that I wasn't going to offer this teaching this is a kind of a

56
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:19,199
separate teaching altogether but here the form refers to the material aspects

57
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,580
of our beings that you know material body and the bones the Flesh and

58
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:33,479
uh physicality of our bodies and so the Buddha said I can you should

59
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:39,300
see all this and that is not from the perspective of I mean mine

60
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:45,000
and I get the sense that um rahula might have heard this teachings before

61
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,819
he asked only form the Buddha went on told the rahula that

62
00:06:50,819 --> 00:07:00,300
well also don't take your feelings or your perceptions your mental Fabrications or

63
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:06,960
even Consciousness to be I Me Mine and so this is known to be the five

64
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,400
cleaning Aggregates it's not self-teaching which I will not do today

65
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:19,199
if you're interested some other time or you can look at look it up and

66
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,800
but this is the bridge of this story um

67
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:33,419
the Buddha may have had the sense that the rahula is and was caught up a little bit by who he

68
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:40,259
was and how he was related to the Buddha and who knows you know we don't really know but the Buddha might have sensed to

69
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:46,919
something going on here and what happened next as rahula decided

70
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:55,139
I am not going to go to the village for obstract so so he thought who would go to the

71
00:07:55,139 --> 00:08:01,620
village for arms today after being advised directly by the Buddha so I'm so

72
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:07,460
human so you know you're a teenager you got a

73
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:12,660
advised by your parents what are you gonna do and I still couldn't follow

74
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:18,860
them around nope no way so I turned the bag

75
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:24,180
sat down and started meditating instead of going for

76
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,419
the food I smell protest

77
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,659
and so right then and there and

78
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:44,420
and there's a great disciple of the Buddha sarepota Sarah hula and

79
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:53,000
he told the rahula that you should do mindfulness a breathing is this practice offers a lot of benefit

80
00:08:53,640 --> 00:09:00,000
and later in the evening came out from the meditation and went to see the

81
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Buddha I guess he's got a question to ask and

82
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,760
you know he knew the Buddha would have Buddha would have the answer for him

83
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:21,920
and so he wasn't holding The Grudge so much and so he got up I went to see the Buddha

84
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:28,500
and he asked the Buddha how is it to that mindfulness of

85
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:35,399
breathing when you practice it there will be a lot of benefit but the interesting thing about this the

86
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:42,959
Buddha didn't answer this question right away instead the Buddha offered him the instructions

87
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,440
on how to practice with the elements first

88
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:55,680
so nabuda pointed out that in this body there are Earth elements so we can feel

89
00:09:55,680 --> 00:10:01,740
the Earth Earth elements that are solid hard the bones you know our bones our

90
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:08,640
teeth and hair and it's our Earth element right here in our bodies

91
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:16,080
and there's water element you can feel the moisture or the oil and the on the

92
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:23,459
hands and a fluid in the body as I talk I feel the saliva in the mouth

93
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:29,700
in the mouth this is a water element and there is

94
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,100
Air element we breathe in and out the movements

95
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:40,200
and there's a fire element and so the Buddha offered the teaching

96
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,920
and in quite a lot of detail with all the examples of what this is in your

97
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:54,480
experience in the body in the elemental nature and the Buddha and each of the

98
00:10:54,480 --> 00:11:01,200
instruction with a statement Earth element is just Earth element

99
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,459
the water element is just a water element and the fire element is justifier

100
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:14,040
element Air element just Earth adjust air

101
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:21,019
element a space element just a space element

102
00:11:21,779 --> 00:11:27,500
so what is the Buddha pointing to with this teaching

103
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:36,920
and seeing our meditation we offered this briefly and kind of really feeling and sensing

104
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:45,360
into our experience in this Elemental way the Buddha is teasing this kind of

105
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,760
and the concept of the body with all this Elemental aspect of our

106
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:56,839
being which we can experience it directly Here and Now

107
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,519
and also the reason that the Buddha offered this teaching

108
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:09,480
is that the Buddha knows our mind very well and those how our mind works

109
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:17,360
so often when we experience something that are quite immediate raw Elemental

110
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,459
oftentimes our mind immediately will follow along

111
00:12:23,459 --> 00:12:29,160
with a different kind of reality virtual reality

112
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:36,920
and we may have a little moment that we feel some dryness and a skin

113
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,200
it's just a water element just the dryness the Earth element just Earth element the

114
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:48,240
water element just water element oh we don't stop there you know what

115
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,399
happens right away oh I really should drink more water

116
00:12:53,399 --> 00:13:00,180
I haven't been drinking so much water as I'm aging that's not good for me

117
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:07,380
and I have been using this moisturizer for a while it probably hasn't been working for a while

118
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:12,899
maybe it's time to search around and see a better brand there's a lot more

119
00:13:12,899 --> 00:13:19,920
you know I don't know new ingredients and new technologies that are working and next thing you know wearing the

120
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,740
Amazon land so

121
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:34,200
that's how our mind works you know kind of we slip off from this raw direct

122
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:42,060
experience and and I lump into

123
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:47,519
and as stories of our experience about our experiences sometimes it's not even

124
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:53,720
about our experience anymore but about something totally different

125
00:13:53,820 --> 00:14:00,779
and that may be filled with desires identifications aversions

126
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:14,040
and so that's the and that's the thing that Buddha already knew very well how our mind works

127
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,500
and so um and often and you know what I'm telling

128
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:26,760
in this particular example is quite a mild and benign version you know and

129
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:33,180
then sometimes I can see that in my own mind the stories can be much more

130
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:40,079
dramatic much more exciting or disappointing and and what's more is

131
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:46,019
that often there can be a kind of a storyline underneath of it

132
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:52,019
that I'm never good enough I should be who somebody else I should

133
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:58,560
be something other than who I am how I am is that there can be this kind of a

134
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:06,199
storyline running through this and so by offering uh this instruction

135
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:14,820
and to practice over the elements the Buddha is offering us an opportunity to

136
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:20,699
live more in line with the reality of our lived experience

137
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:27,860
and rather that in the virtual realities that we're constructing our mind and heart

138
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:36,440
and so the Earth element just as Earth element not more complicated than that

139
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:44,279
maybe that's what the young rahula needed before he get to the instructions on

140
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:50,100
mindfulness of breathing maybe got caught up a little bit you

141
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:56,639
know by who he was and how he looked and his identities

142
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:02,579
and so he needed some instruction to kind of drop out and those

143
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:07,680
um beliefs and ideas in the head and then drop more directly into the

144
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:13,100
embodied experience foreign

145
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:22,440
that the Buddha also offered in satipatana suta which is one of the

146
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:29,360
seminal texts in the Pali Canon that spoke about how the practitioners

147
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:35,279
to how the practitioner practitioners with the practice in order to become

148
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:41,160
free from suffering and many of the theravada meditative

149
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:48,660
practices are taught based on on this text nasati patana

150
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:54,480
and as a one of the mindfulness of the body instructions

151
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,600
um that is this and the practice of what the the elements

152
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:08,220
so it's not just rahula where you know we may get caught by the stories of our

153
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,438
experience and it's common that when our mind and

154
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:22,438
heart are not trained we tend to go into our stories and beliefs

155
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:28,199
so when we are in touch with the realities of our bodies at the

156
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:36,679
elementary level we can begin to see our experience just as they are

157
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:42,480
and so some years ago I had an experience in working with this

158
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:48,120
particular practice and so it's a period at the time that I

159
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:55,919
was practicing on the Society of Elemental element practice and some Associated

160
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:04,820
practice rather continuously for a few weeks and so one day I was dropping my son off

161
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:10,919
at his swim practice and it just right around the swimming

162
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:16,559
pool I saw all those little kids running around and and all of a sudden there was thoughts

163
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:24,780
came to my mind I was a little girl is so cute this one is a little clumsy and I just

164
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:31,020
you know all of a sudden I thought wow this thoughts is here

165
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:36,660
and maybe just because there was some continuity of the practice and and all

166
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,940
of a sudden what I saw was all the kids turned into

167
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:47,960
skeletons the little skeletons running around the swimming pool

168
00:18:48,059 --> 00:18:54,539
and immediately I noticed a contrast in my mind

169
00:18:54,539 --> 00:19:03,019
that is all those little preferences likes and dislikes faded away

170
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:12,720
and that what that moment was a powerful moment I just realized wow this practice has a function

171
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:20,039
it has a potent function it can kind of pull us out of the

172
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:27,600
stories the likes and dislikes and the Habit mind and highlight

173
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:35,220
for us their presence in the absence as it was really a powerful moment for

174
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:41,820
me now recognizing wow this practice really has some strong

175
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:50,720
potency for us that was also quite humble to buy it

176
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:58,700
and so I and the other thing I wanted to say is

177
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:06,299
when there's a highlight on is becomes available what also becomes available is

178
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:13,679
a sense of a choice and that's the moment that we can choose can choose to follow the storyline

179
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:20,520
probably usually not go that well or we could choose to drop into our

180
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:28,679
immediate experience and so that's another form of empowerment that this practice can offer

181
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:34,440
that when we pause when we see things directly in the Raw

182
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:42,799
Elemental way we also began to have choices we can make wise choices

183
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:52,760
it may seem quite innocent sometimes that we have this kind of thoughts and

184
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:58,860
and some may even seem harmless after all I just kind of you know a few

185
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:06,740
fleeting thoughts in the mind yet when we reflect deeper

186
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:15,960
our ideas our beliefs about good and bad inferior Superior

187
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:24,780
beautiful ugly when those Harden into beliefs

188
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:30,679
they've been such dividing forces in our societies

189
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:39,919
and so this practice um offers something

190
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:47,760
to take us out of that divide that can really separate ourselves from

191
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:53,520
others and so um

192
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,940
by practicing with this it has a direct impact in our own our well-being and

193
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,658
also the World At Large the well-being of the World At Large

194
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:15,419
and also I want to say that this example doesn't mean that we should flatten the life just by only seeing elements

195
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,820
uh after all there is richness in life

196
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:26,340
in fact I would like to say that by practicing with elements

197
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:32,880
there is much life aliveness and the richness that can come forth

198
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:40,860
through experiencing um the ever-changing dynamic of the

199
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:48,500
elements there is a dance of the elements right here in our being

200
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,960
can you imagine that we don't have Earth element hearing the body it'll be all floating

201
00:22:54,960 --> 00:23:01,860
around I know or without air element who can't even

202
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:10,260
live and the air element animates us that's how we can move we can walk we can run

203
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:16,559
even just lift our hand that's Air element in the body

204
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,799
and the water elements is a cohesive cohesiveness brings all of those

205
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:29,460
elements together like you know the the water sprinkle on the flower to need

206
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:37,620
need the doll kind of brings it together into something that we actually sit here with a sitting posture that's a water

207
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:45,360
element holding us together otherwise they'll just be dust sand here

208
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:51,780
and so there is all this dance and that elements are working through us that

209
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:58,740
bring a liveness and richness in our being so through this practice we can really

210
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:07,220
get a deep in touch with this and this is also to see that when we're

211
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:13,500
experiencing uh in this Elemental way we can also come

212
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:19,200
to realize that this is nature this is a nature of the nature just like

213
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:26,039
the mountain the trees the flowers the Earth were on

214
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:32,159
those are nature this is the Earth element resting on

215
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:39,360
Earth and so there is a nature within us there

216
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:44,400
is a nature without right around us

217
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:52,380
so when we have this kind of a realization um our relationships with ourselves

218
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:58,320
and that is all around us can begin to shift and change

219
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:03,900
if we care about this body this being

220
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:12,320
we care about the beings all around we care about the Earth we stand on

221
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:19,980
said this the Earth is you

222
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:27,720
you are the Earth when you realize there is no separation

223
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,360
you fall completely in love with this beautiful planet

224
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:38,640
at this very moment the Earth is above you

225
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:46,760
below you all around you and even inside you

226
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:55,559
I'm just gonna pause for a moment what's the feeling in your heart when

227
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:58,158
you hear that

228
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:14,840
in the Love Letter tikna Han wrote to Earth he says this

229
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:22,559
we often forget that the planet we're living on has given us all the elements

230
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:29,100
that make up our bodies the water in our flesh our bones

231
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:36,000
and all the microscopic cells inside our bodies all come from the Earth

232
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,480
and are part of the Earth the Earth is not just the environment we

233
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:51,380
live in we are the Earth and we're always carrying her within us

234
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:59,520
realizing this we can see that the Earth is truly alive

235
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:08,400
we are a living breathing manifestations of this beautiful and generous planet

236
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:15,840
knowing this we can begin to transform our relationship to the Earth

237
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:23,899
we can begin to walk differently and to care for her differently

238
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:35,480
and I would like to extend this even further

239
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:42,740
besides the Earth underneath of us all of us

240
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:48,600
other beings ourselves our nature

241
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:53,820
animals animated inanimated

242
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:03,840
all beings all things we live in a network of connectedness

243
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:12,059
we can't live without them just as how we may transform our

244
00:28:12,059 --> 00:28:21,000
relationship with the planet maybe this practice offers a potential and a possibility and

245
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:27,500
how we relate to each other related to ourselves

246
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:31,580
related to all beings

247
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:40,080
in this way we can go beyond the self-centeredness

248
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,100
and this is what the Buddha offered to rahula

249
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:53,340
and thus should be seen where the wise understanding that this is not mine I am

250
00:28:53,340 --> 00:29:03,539
not this this is not myself and instead we extend our heart to mind

251
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:09,140
where the botanists boundless love compassion

252
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:16,140
sympathetic Joy and equanimity and that's what the Buddha instructed

253
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:21,419
the rahula Maybe by dropping away in a sense of I

254
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:28,679
mean mine the heart can open and so following the element instruction

255
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,740
the Buddha taught rahula to meditate with love

256
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:42,360
meditate with compassion meditate with joy

257
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:49,559
and meditate with equanimity and so the heart is ready

258
00:29:49,559 --> 00:29:56,220
the element practice sets a stage for our heart to open

259
00:29:56,220 --> 00:30:00,860
and to welcome all beings everywhere

260
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,960
so may this teaching offer this possibility to all of us

261
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:15,360
and to live with the reality of our own nature

262
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:20,580
and to love and care for all beings everywhere

263
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,778
so thank you everyone

264
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:37,100
so we have a few minutes if there are any questions comments

265
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:42,980
Reflections that you may have you're welcome

266
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:00,899
um I can't remember if I read middle length discourse number 62 before

267
00:31:00,899 --> 00:31:06,360
or not so uh but now I want to read it

268
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:12,480
or go back and read it as soon as I have an opportunity at the time

269
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:17,940
uh I also uh wanted to say that like I think everyone here I was really divided

270
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:25,880
by the image you brought up of looking around and seeing everyone as skeletons

271
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:33,740
whenever and I don't know if I can be detached enough whenever I'm

272
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:39,600
noticing I have a preference or you know a like or dislike towards someone

273
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,440
to look at them that way I don't know if I can be that detached but so what I do instead if I remember to is to look on

274
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:54,000
other people especially if I'm noticing a preference or dispreference and seeing a fellow

275
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,720
sufferer that's what works for me beautiful beautiful so there are ways that we can

276
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:05,820
shift our Perceptions in a way that is supportive

277
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:11,760
for cultivation of a wholesome in wholesomeness in our mind and heart so

278
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:20,899
there are many ways that we can see that can be supportive great thank you yeah

279
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,679
someone in the back

280
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:35,960
okay um yeah so thank you for sharing your story there's a camera right behind you

281
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:42,360
um so you share that uh before you went to the swimming pool with your son you

282
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:50,220
saw the skeletons and before that you had weeks of um practice I'm just curious about what

283
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:58,380
kind of practice you were doing for a week was it just like meditation like all day every day or yeah so so it was

284
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:05,279
as part of a course I was taking and that and this said of element practices

285
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:11,120
were part of and seeing things in this different ways are part of the practice

286
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,860
and so I was quite consciously kind of practicing just

287
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:22,980
um wherever I was around and doing things and in this

288
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,740
particular moment I think it was just natural momentum of the practice came

289
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:35,159
live I wasn't intentionally trying to do anything but just came alive it's like oh wow

290
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:41,340
there is this way of seeing and then I highlighted something and so um it could

291
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:50,159
be sometimes uh people do and you know seeing something as skeleton as explicit

292
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:55,740
practice um but I think for me it was really working with the elements somehow that

293
00:33:55,740 --> 00:34:01,039
just arose yeah thank you

294
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:13,460
any other questions or comments

295
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,720
there well we do for the YouTube for okay

296
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:28,200
excuse me all right hello YouTube um I really enjoyed what you had to share

297
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:35,220
today and I wanted to share uh an experience that I'm having

298
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:43,580
that is related just because it so reflects the importance of our honoring

299
00:34:43,580 --> 00:34:49,560
Mother Earth each other the elements I I feel minimizing to say

300
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,700
elements but even so um I have begun working with a beautiful

301
00:34:55,700 --> 00:35:02,099
team of women who are doing something called surf therapy at some point I will

302
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:09,540
be posting something here and the focus of it is being in the ocean being near the water

303
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:15,480
and that connection the ways that it heals us the ways that it lightens us

304
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:22,500
all the magic that goes on there and so the timeliness of connecting this to my

305
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:28,020
practice I appreciate very very much and just the reminder to all of us that

306
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:34,260
we can live it yes go out and live it and feed it and nourish it and I think

307
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:40,380
that that's one way to sustain and ride the waves of life too yes thank you very

308
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:46,320
