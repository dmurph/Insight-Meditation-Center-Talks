1
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,120
into the last week of uh the year

2
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:16,500
welcome and it's quite something to have gone through all the challenges of this year

3
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:22,860
since March and um perhaps we're wiser

4
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:30,300
perhaps we are more equanimous about things that a year ago we would not have been wise and not had some healthy

5
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:35,700
Equanimity about and so it happens to be that the last

6
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:43,680
topic of the year is equanimity and right up until the first day of 2021

7
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:49,220
for on Friday and uh

8
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:56,459
thinking about equanimity I think of it as maybe a mind at rest or

9
00:10:56,459 --> 00:11:03,140
very similar to a mind at rest with the following analogy the Buddha gave

10
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:08,820
a cow herder in ancient India

11
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:15,120
when the growing season for the rice was happening it was very important for

12
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:21,660
the cowherder to stay close to the cows chewing them away from the rice paddies and directing him and where they had to

13
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:27,720
go and and had to be very attentive because there wasn't a lot of space maybe between the rice paddies to where

14
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:33,959
the cows could graze and so a lot of effort and a lot of attention

15
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:41,700
but once the rice had been harvested and and uh there was no longer any need to

16
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,519
uh shoe the cows around

17
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:54,899
and and rather the cow the cowherder now could lean against a tree in the shade

18
00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:01,800
and just keep a equanimous broad gaze out across

19
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:09,899
the fields and just kind of generally track and be aware of where the cows are but no longer a need to before or

20
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:18,779
against them going in this direction or that direction and so a mind at rests the same way

21
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:25,680
that has done its work there's nothing that has to be done the mind is at ease

22
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:32,760
and there's no longer a need to kind of follow every little movement of the mind to move in this direction back to the

23
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:38,459
breath the hear avoid those kinds of fantasies which

24
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:43,740
maybe you've done 10 000 times but the mind can sit back and just not

25
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:49,980
before or against anything but watch it all in a spacious equanimous mind and

26
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:57,300
and this idea of not being for or against not needing to shoe things this way in that way from a mind that's

27
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:05,040
settled and economist non-reactive is one of the great gifts

28
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:12,720
of this Buddhist practice and we'll talk about more about that this week so for now to

29
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:20,120
take a meditation posture assume a meditation posture

30
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:24,920
and gently close your eyes

31
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:33,480
and without much more notice the quality of your mind

32
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:39,899
is your mind jumping around is it strongly concerned with certain thoughts

33
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:47,880
and ideas is it agitated energized

34
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,940
or is lethargic

35
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,540
is it hesitant and reluctant

36
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,639
notice how your mind is and see if you can notice it with

37
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:19,040
equanimity with not being for or against how the mind is

38
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,139
but just to notice this is how it is for you

39
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:43,019
and then noticing the knowing in and of itself in the Simplicity of

40
00:14:43,019 --> 00:14:48,839
knowing something there are qualities of equanimity

41
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:55,579
qualities of not being for or against just to know

42
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,720
and so you might as you're sitting here now

43
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:09,500
bring that knowing to experiencing your body

44
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:16,339
how's your how's your body at this time

45
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:26,899
and for a few moments just know as if nothing needs to change you don't need to be for or against

46
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:34,560
because if you're for or against something harder to know it clearly

47
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:38,300
to really see what's happening

48
00:15:54,660 --> 00:16:00,120
but if there's some ways in which you can adjust your posture so that you're a little bit more

49
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:08,360
comfortable at ease maybe relaxing parts of your body

50
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:20,339
there is a subtle way which in the movement of the Mind as it relaxes the body

51
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:28,320
there can be a feeling of equanimity the feeling of also letting go of

52
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:36,379
for or against needing to do anything even though you are relaxing

53
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:42,079
softening the shoulders

54
00:16:49,139 --> 00:16:52,699
softening the belly

55
00:17:05,179 --> 00:17:10,039
softening the arms the elbows

56
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:24,079
maybe you can soften the whole waist area around to the small of the back

57
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,799
Maybe by relaxing the tops of the thighs

58
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:41,720
and maybe relaxing the muscles of the face

59
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:56,779
and then if it's possible letting your mind be at rest

60
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:04,740
as if there's for this time there's no more work

61
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:12,919
there's no more anything to be afraid of or to prove

62
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:18,799
or to avoid

63
00:18:22,679 --> 00:18:29,460
trusting that the mind is Broad enough wide enough

64
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:36,260
to hold all things to make space for all things that are

65
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:45,260
and because there's so much space in the mind and the Heart

66
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:52,400
it's it's possible also to be equanimous

67
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,960
to not be for or against

68
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:06,020
but to be at rest in the awareness of what's Happening

69
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:22,140
and then within your body as part of your bodily experience

70
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:27,660
allow there to be room in your mind and awareness

71
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:33,780
for breathing Let There Be room

72
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:40,700
for the bodies experience of breathing to occur within

73
00:19:42,539 --> 00:19:45,440
the awareness

74
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:49,140
and to experiment a little bit with your mind your awareness

75
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:57,120
to see if you can find a way to really feel and sense the inhales and

76
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:04,700
exhales without it needing to be any different than the way it is

77
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:10,460
whether it's comfortable or uncomfortable to breathe

78
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:20,840
whether your attention on the breath is clear and continuous or not

79
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:35,600
whether you're controlling your breath or not whatever way it is

80
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:41,220
can you kind of experiment or

81
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:45,799
look for that way of being with the breathing

82
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:52,399
that is spacious and equanimous

83
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:59,460
balanced and even allowing it to be just the way it is

84
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:04,100
and the mind at ease with that

85
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,780
thank you

86
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:53,720
as you exhale relaxing the thinking mind

87
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:07,399
as you exhale quiet your thinking

88
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:22,399
as you exhale let go of your thinking

89
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:37,380
thinking is often part of an agitated mind

90
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:46,200
a mind that's for or against things as thinking becomes quieter

91
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,500
you might look for The increased equanimity

92
00:25:52,500 --> 00:26:00,200
or the way in which the mind is more at rest at ease

93
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:25,278
and you might find or see ways in which the mind is not equanimous

94
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:31,860
and you step back with awareness and really notice how your mind is

95
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:37,380
you might find that it's very much involved in wanting or not

96
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:44,820
wanting being disturbed or being

97
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,380
depressed in some way

98
00:30:55,500 --> 00:31:02,279
can you experiment with knowing that knowing how the mind is

99
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:09,919
so the knowing itself is relaxed at ease

100
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:16,580
The Knowing itself is equanimous

101
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:25,520
and with some modicum of equanimity

102
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:30,799
in recognizing how you are

103
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:40,440
open up again to your breathing letting breathing be at the center of it

104
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,620
all

105
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:19,460
ever so gently breathe a little bit deeper

106
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:24,140
exhaling a little bit more fully

107
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:32,460
gently enough so that the mind is restful as you do so

108
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:38,119
the mind is curious present

109
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:54,540
let go as you exhale let go of all things

110
00:35:54,540 --> 00:36:02,359
while you let go into the breathing just breathing

111
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:50,880
taking a few moments now to notice whatever degree your mind is

112
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,700
equanimous or at rest

113
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:03,000
or at ease or perhaps your heart

114
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:09,060
at ease at rest equanimous with

115
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:14,119
here in the present moment with how things are

116
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:20,119
breathing in and out

117
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:39,380
and to whatever degree that the mind is not agitated the heart is at ease

118
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:46,619
can you now feel your good will or your love

119
00:38:46,619 --> 00:38:54,660
your capacity for care and warmth kindness

120
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:07,220
to almost as if equanimity clears the ear air

121
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:15,240
clears the agitation that allows the capacity for love

122
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:19,220
for kindness and friendliness

123
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:26,960
to be more clear more available

124
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:40,320
and perhaps there's a way in which there can be love compassion good will

125
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:48,240
that is itself at rest or is that itself easy or

126
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:55,380
equanimous not really involved in for or against

127
00:39:55,380 --> 00:40:05,180
anything just gazing upon all things kindly

128
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:19,800
and allowing whatever sense of kindness you have

129
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:28,040
to Now open up and take in the people in your life

130
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:35,180
the peoples in your neighborhood communities

131
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:45,740
as if you're opening the doors of your heart wide open to take in all beings everywhere

132
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:59,700
and with equanimity with non-agitation

133
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:10,880
sending your well-wishing out into the world

134
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:17,780
may all beings be happy

135
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:24,500
may all beings be safe

136
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:30,078
may all beings be free

137
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:35,660
and may you

138
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:45,359
bring in equanimous care and love in your communication with other people

139
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:51,599
today experiment

140
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:56,539
with a heart that's at ease and equanimous

141
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:04,320
as you express your generosity and care and kindness for the welfare and happiness of the

142
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:09,540
people around you may all beings

143
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:12,320
be happy

144
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:19,369
[Music]

145
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:43,079
so I want to welcome you to the land of equanimity

146
00:42:43,079 --> 00:42:49,920
the time of equanimity that this is the topic for this week's

147
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:57,000
five talks and in particular it's the Equanimity Brahma vihara

148
00:42:57,000 --> 00:43:05,940
it's a form of love which is characterized by upeka which is

149
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:15,260
the poly word for equanimity and um it is um

150
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:20,540
maybe a counter-intuitive for many people to think of love as being

151
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:25,800
synonymous or connected to equanimity

152
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:31,560
because love seems to be something that's more proactive engaged going

153
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:38,460
towards people doing something it's being expressed many things

154
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:43,500
but in fact I think it's not too difficult to analyze love

155
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:49,859
the way that that's often practiced and in the world around us

156
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:56,460
is that it's often mixed up with other attitudes and needs and desires

157
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:03,000
that sometimes love is mixed up with what we need if we need company we need

158
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:09,900
security we need sometimes people feel like they need admiration

159
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:15,660
uh sometimes love is mixed up with fear and

160
00:44:15,660 --> 00:44:25,020
uh sometimes makes love is mixed up with lust sometimes it's mixed up with um Power

161
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:30,839
and sometimes it mixed up with status and all kinds of things that comes along

162
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:36,560
with love and sometimes it's very hard to see the difference between some of these other

163
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:41,579
elements that come along with love and love itself

164
00:44:41,579 --> 00:44:49,020
I like to think of the practice of mindfulness as well as the practices of loving

165
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:57,300
kindness compassion sympathetic joy and equanimity as being practices that purify love

166
00:44:57,300 --> 00:45:03,540
that uh simplify it like you would simplify gold down to its beautiful

167
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:08,640
Essence and take out the dross take out the impurities that are there

168
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:13,800
so that as we simplify our love or clarify the love so it's not mixed up

169
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:20,400
with these other needs and other things going on it becomes more and more a wonderful treasure

170
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:28,140
a wonderful Jewel inside of us that um a source of

171
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:35,460
nourishment support and um so to purify our love to clarify our

172
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:41,660
love and so for example that they for loving kindness

173
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:46,740
what gets what gets purified from is any

174
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:53,280
form of ill will and any form of love that has to do with

175
00:45:53,280 --> 00:46:01,079
our self-centeredness self-preoccupation what's in it for me

176
00:46:01,079 --> 00:46:08,220
as we practice or connect to compassion compassion is freed certainly from any

177
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:15,000
tendency for cruelty to harm people and it's also purified from any sense of

178
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:22,140
distress any sense of uh of dismay horror that might be there

179
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:28,280
that sometimes is confused with it appreciative Joy

180
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:35,640
gets purified of envy and jealousy sometimes that's a very strong motivator

181
00:46:35,640 --> 00:46:41,220
for insisting on love or holding on to love or protecting our love with someone

182
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:49,319
else when there's jealousy and envy going on and also it's uh also purified from any

183
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:55,819
kind of self-centered focus on oneself around feeling

184
00:46:55,819 --> 00:47:02,099
discontented feeling or feeling kind of feeling giddy or

185
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:07,740
feeling like you know that I'm the one who's now enjoying or delighting in the

186
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:13,380
light of someone else and so it's kind of a carious way of living where the focus is really on oneself rather than

187
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:18,480
just being open to the the joy of others

188
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:26,099
and so Equanimity also is a purification it's a purification from they say from

189
00:47:26,099 --> 00:47:31,579
two things from repulsion and pursuing

190
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:38,400
sometimes it's translated as this word is attraction sometimes as greed but the word the poly

191
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:46,500
word has the connotation of pursuing following after something and so love that is neither pursuing nor

192
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:51,900
has any kind of repulsion towards anything as a result of of it or part of

193
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:59,160
it and so uh part of the one way to appreciate this quality of equanimity is

194
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:04,800
that is in fact not so much to try to understand it directly but to understand

195
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:11,460
its alternatives that the mind that doesn't have centered in this restful easeful place of

196
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:17,339
equanimity is a mind that is either for or against things in some kind of way

197
00:48:17,339 --> 00:48:24,480
that has qualities of pursuing or or of repulsing or pushing away in a way

198
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,579
that's not so healthy that's not really a place of freedom

199
00:48:29,579 --> 00:48:34,680
and so to begin Discerning and noticing the small ways or the big ways which

200
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:41,400
we're pursuing with love wanting and getting than some of us who may be in especially

201
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:49,339
when we were younger maybe teenagers the drive to pursue can be quite strong

202
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:57,359
the um and so to find a Equanimity to find a place where love is not pursuing

203
00:48:57,359 --> 00:49:03,540
is not repulsing anything pushing anything away but is able to stay open

204
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:09,540
and clear and in that openness and Clarity the purity of equanimity that

205
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:17,460
the love can radiate and shine quite broadly so the purification of Love is the task

206
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:24,140
here and it's closely connected to Freedom that love these different forms of Love

207
00:49:24,140 --> 00:49:29,480
Are freeing and freedom

208
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:35,520
is a means for loving it's a opening to loving and there's a wonderful

209
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:40,740
reciprocal mutuality between the greater and greater degrees of freedom that the

210
00:49:40,740 --> 00:49:46,260
practice brings and our greater and love and the greater love we have supports

211
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:51,800
the freedom we have the the

212
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:58,800
Buddhist the terravan tradition provides an analogy for these four kinds of love

213
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:04,020
and it has to do with parenting a certain you know maybe excuse maybe

214
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:10,560
ideal parent situation is that um if maybe parents have four

215
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:15,780
children one who is recently born and everything's healthy with a kid and

216
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:22,560
there's a enthusiasm and happiness and kind of lots of loving kindness lots of well-wishing and good will for their

217
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:27,720
future and delight and and that's very simple and clear

218
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:35,040
and just that just just all around kind of uh lots of delightful uh Goodwill and

219
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:42,420
loving kindness and then there is uh compassion as that

220
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:49,500
child grows up or one of the children maybe um has a an illness and so the second

221
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:55,020
child has an illness and or has some disadvantage that the parents feel a lot

222
00:50:55,020 --> 00:51:02,339
of care and compassion and support that child in a different kind of way than others because the sickness they have

223
00:51:02,339 --> 00:51:08,640
and and so there's kind of compassion someone else is in the flesh of Youth

224
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:14,940
and life is just opening up for them brilliantly and wonderfully and and there's just a lot of joy and

225
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:21,480
appreciation that things are working out so well and that the world is opening up for them and the opportunities are there

226
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:28,740
and then the fourth one is um well established in their life there may

227
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:36,240
be in their 40s or something and well established in career and family or

228
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:42,839
activities whatever their life is going to be about it's well established and it's going along just fine and the

229
00:51:42,839 --> 00:51:50,880
parents don't have to think about them so much not be concerned with their welfare and so there's a kind of equanimity towards those uh those

230
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:57,960
children that child so so this idea of whether this is kind of a good analogy or not is not exactly

231
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:03,000
the point here we have to kind of shape these analogies for ourselves

232
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:09,180
but the um the idea being that uh it's association with kind of Ideal parental

233
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:16,559
love and a parental love is uh generally not doesn't have the complexities that

234
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:23,579
romantic love have for example can have its own complexities but the

235
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:30,780
idea is maybe it's easier with parental love to maybe feel a kind of a Simplicity and Purity there and

236
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:36,720
sometimes parental love is not about the parent this is especially true when when

237
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:43,619
I think for many parents when the baby's just born that just so directed towards the baby

238
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:50,339
that there's sometimes a self-forgetting that goes on for the parents because it's just caring for the for the babies

239
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:56,780
everything we need so this um

240
00:52:56,780 --> 00:53:03,800
ability to love without it being

241
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:11,280
self-preoccupied love without it being For Me Myself and mine what's in it for me and what I need and

242
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:18,000
what I have to get there's nothing wrong with having needs and inappropriate needs nothing wrong

243
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:23,280
with pursuing what we you need to be safe and happy and content

244
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,619
but it's useful to separate that from our capacity for love

245
00:53:28,619 --> 00:53:34,859
so that our capacity of love can be Simple Pure just a wonderful opening and

246
00:53:34,859 --> 00:53:41,520
clear clarity and one of the ways that uh I've

247
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:49,559
experienced this in my life that kind of the door to really appreciate this in a deep way was or is through meditation

248
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:56,700
that uh through my first years 10 years of meditation practice where I'd had a lot

249
00:53:56,700 --> 00:54:02,460
of suffering and sat with a lot of suffering unexpectedly it opened to a lot of

250
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:09,240
compassion and I learned to appreciate this beautiful capacity for just

251
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:14,880
compassion without any need compassion without any being for or against even

252
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:21,359
though there's movement towards you know certainly a movement towards help and to do things but the movement towards

253
00:54:21,359 --> 00:54:27,300
supporting others are helping or uh caring for others can be done without

254
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:33,119
this kind of self-centered being for or against anything

255
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:40,440
and then my next year is a practice especially when I when I practice vipassana I discovered this wonderful

256
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:46,319
capacity of good will and uh of uh friendliness of kindness

257
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:52,140
and also the Simplicity of it and the purity of it and without it needing to

258
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:58,140
receive anything in return and then sympathetic Joy a lot of that

259
00:54:58,140 --> 00:55:03,660
I've really come to appreciate a lot in my time as a teacher just feeling so

260
00:55:03,660 --> 00:55:09,780
much appreciation so much delight and other people and other practitioners and

261
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:18,800
and learning there also a way in which that coming out of meditation that delight and joy can be so simple and so

262
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:26,940
without any needs or needing to do anything really just a delight in joy

263
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:33,900
and then equanimity and the love of equanimity has a lot also to do with meditation and the way

264
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:40,020
in which I've discovered freedom and meditation freedom from attachments and clinging and just kind of feeling

265
00:55:40,020 --> 00:55:48,420
sometimes this real tender warmth and care and kindness that extends to people

266
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:54,119
who I don't really like or have trouble with or disturb by what they do

267
00:55:54,119 --> 00:56:00,599
and to have the this ability to have love and Equanimity to suffer so widely

268
00:56:00,599 --> 00:56:06,000
my love and Equanimity to spread out in such a clean way is also one of the

269
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,000
great Treasures so um

270
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:20,280
so this topic for this week is equanimity and it's one of the great important topics it has a lot to do more

271
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:25,500
than the others maybe with wisdom and we'll see that the wisdom comes into

272
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:31,500
play and and how the practice really comes to play and to really cultivate and develop

273
00:56:31,500 --> 00:56:37,500
this Equanimity Factor and how it is also leads to Freedom

274
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:44,579
so uh um that's the topic for the week and we'll end it uh on Friday with the new

275
00:56:44,579 --> 00:56:50,460
year and um on the first and for those of you who are up and early enough when the first

276
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:56,780
will begin the year with um an evocation of this quality of equanimity

277
00:56:56,780 --> 00:57:03,780
and who knows maybe it'll be a great resource for 2021

278
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:10,160
so thank you so much and um look forward to tomorrow
