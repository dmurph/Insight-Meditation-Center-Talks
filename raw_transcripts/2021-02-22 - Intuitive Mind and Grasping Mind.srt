00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:09,200
thank you for uh being with us everybody um and thank you to ere for joining us today uh sitting with our

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:16,800
sangha uh so tuarius salah is a guiding teacher at the seattle meditation society and she's

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,800
the founding teacher of the capitol hill meditation group she's a retired prosecuting attorney who

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:29,279
has practiced the possible meditation for over 30 years tuareg believes that urban meditation is

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,880
the foundation for today's practitioner's path to liberation she's inspired by

6
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:41,200
bringing the dharma to non-traditional places and is a strong advocate for practitioners living with high stress

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:47,520
past trauma and difficulty sitting still tuareg has been teaching since 2010 and

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,079
will be completing the four-year teacher training program through the insight meditation society

9
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:01,520
uh this may thank you terry thank you kevin

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,920
kind of strange coming here giving this talk to you when it's some

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,720
in some respects i've been at the center so many times through the teacher training process so i feel at

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,400
home and then it's there's also this uniqueness that i don't really know

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,200
most of you you may have seen me on a retreat or something but i don't really know most of you so there's a trust here

14
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:36,159
that happens in the dhamma that is very very touching to me

15
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:43,600
and so i i think that's what it is that i want to talk a little bit about i want to talk a little bit about as

16
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,720
practitioners how why it's so

17
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,880
important that we practice taking the time to come to this present

18
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,079
moment here and now why do we even bother with all this meditation

19
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:07,280
i mean we can do all kinds of things to settle ourselves down some of us run some of us do you know

20
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,400
martial arts some of us do crafts like the woodworking and

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:20,080
uh reading and all kinds of things that we do to kind of settle ourselves down so

22
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,160
why why the meditation why what is it that we're trying to do

23
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:33,599
here with meditation and from my perspective what are urban practitioners trying to

24
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,319
do with meditation you know we can look at monastics and think oh they're they're headed right towards enlightenment

25
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,040
and awakening and but not us right we're just meditating um for some

26
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:52,959
other reason and i'd like to share a little bit about why i think

27
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,680
we should meditate and why we should take it um treated with respect

28
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,840
and a level of sincerity because of what it can ultimately help

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:10,959
us see and maybe i'll introduce myself a little

30
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:17,280
bit to you so you know a little bit about where i've come from so i grew up

31
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:23,840
in the uh where a housing project in seattle and

32
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:32,000
i did not grow up in a buddhist content context at all my parents were

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,840
conservative christians and very strict one might even go so far as to

34
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,120
point out all the abuse that i went through when i was a child with that strictness but um

35
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,560
it was just a very dysfunctional family but my parents were very rigid on

36
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,959
education and so i went all the way to law school

37
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:08,080
and it was in law school after law school really that i failed the bar twice when i

38
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:13,599
failed it the first time i thought there was something wrong with the bar but when i felt it the second

39
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:18,720
time i thought there was something wrong with me and i did not

40
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,960
have that as abusive or dysfunction as our lives can be when we're growing up

41
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,160
you don't know that dysfunctionality exists so i did not

42
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,800
know of the dysfunction until i felt that bar the second time

43
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:43,680
somehow the whole world dropped out somehow um everything i thought i was

44
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,638
walking towards uh got disrupted

45
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:55,120
and i found the dhamma well i should say i think the dhamma found me because i think it was probably looking for me

46
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:01,199
for a while and i finally connected

47
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,240
to this nine kind of nagging thing in the back of my mind

48
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,280
was it cannot just be about this there's got to be something more than just

49
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,039
this this working hard striving striving getting to one thing we talk about this

50
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:24,960
all the time but no matter how much we talk about it it still seems like we are still

51
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,759
doing and living in the same pattern even though we talk about it a lot

52
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,000
and what i've come to understand over the years i mean finding the dhamma i did ultimately pass

53
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,000
the bar became a prosecutor spent my life as a prosecutor

54
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:53,840
but over the years of practice

55
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,560
i i cannot tell you that my practice ultimately came to where i was pointing

56
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:06,000
it towards because i didn't point it this way that it ultimately came but there's a

57
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,440
way in which practice is doing something to us and that's what

58
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,440
i really want to point to is what is it that it's doing to us what is it that it's

59
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:24,400
allowing in us that if we give way to it we um

60
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:32,000
allow the practice to do what the practice is intended to do

61
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,120
you know how our bodies are intended to eat food and digest food

62
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:44,240
so we could eat cardboard and it would digest the cardboard but it wouldn't

63
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:50,479
really get the point babies don't know the difference between

64
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,759
food and non-food so it just eats anything and so you we sort of have to learn what

65
00:06:55,759 --> 00:07:01,759
food is but when you learn what food is you can eat bad food you can eat good food you can eat

66
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:07,599
healthy food unhealthy food i know plenty of people that are old folks in my family

67
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,919
that they know i don't think they ate any vegetables but or if they did eat vegetables had so

68
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,759
much meat in it that you know i don't know if you could call it vegetable you might have to call it a

69
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:26,240
vegetable meat mix but even with that they can live long long

70
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:34,000
time and then some people can eat very healthy food and then they don't live very long at all

71
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:41,440
there's a way in which our bodies does what it does because it is the nature of

72
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,360
the body to do what it does and it doesn't have anything to do with you or me

73
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:55,360
and there is a thing that's happening with meditation that if we allow it to happen

74
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:03,919
um we can really see some uh we can see

75
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:09,039
a flock of blackbirds taking a wide turn

76
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:17,280
and be astonished by it so here's a couple of things

77
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:25,280
just a framing we live in a we live in a closed circuit

78
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:31,199
mind we don't live in a mind that's wide open and fluid we live in a closed circuit

79
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:39,360
mine so we live in a mind that's pretty much guarded by our grasping

80
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:45,920
mind that says this is right and this is wrong this is good and this is bad this is

81
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:53,040
pleasant this is unpleasant it has very strict rules and associations and things come together in our mind and

82
00:08:53,040 --> 00:09:01,760
everything makes sense and we feel comfortable because actually the stability that we feel in

83
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:10,240
life isn't coming from life it's coming from habit it's coming from our habitual way

84
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:18,000
of doing so i feel still because i wake up in my own house and i have the habit of

85
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:25,680
seeing that door that wall that kitchen everything looks the same

86
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:32,880
so i feel solid and secure and steady it's the habit of it and then as soon as

87
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:38,080
something outside of that habit happens i've lost

88
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,120
my stability which is why this pandemic was so unnerving

89
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:49,519
i remember when it first happened i didn't really believe i was going to be stuck in the house for

90
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:56,560
a year okay a few weeks okay okay i can do a month

91
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,920
i can tell i can't believe a couple of months i realize it's gonna take a little bit

92
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:09,279
longer for this to clear out but then you know a couple of months and then months after months after

93
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:16,399
months and now i have found i have the habit

94
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:21,600
of staying here so now their mind is like well i don't know if i want to go out so

95
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:27,120
much i don't i mean i want to go out but there's all this apprehension

96
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:32,800
about going out even if i could go out because we

97
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:40,320
we have a mind that is built on habit and that habit becomes our stability

98
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:48,240
but that habit is not real it is

99
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,440
how do i say it it is built on sand

100
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:06,880
it's like i like that the buddha would use examples of how

101
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:16,399
insubstantial it is so he said like bubbles that rise when

102
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:23,360
water is falling the bubbles in the pond a puddle that we don't think of those bubbles as

103
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,800
being i'm gonna put my faith in those bubbles holding true it's insubstantial it makes sense

104
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:37,200
or foam that comes off of the ocean i've never seen that foam before

105
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,519
the example that he uses this seafoam i've never seen that kind of foam before

106
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:51,040
but once when we were at irc the first time and went down to the beach area

107
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,279
i saw this phone and i really did think it was substantial until you get up on

108
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:05,360
it and then it's nothing it's it disappears you can see that it's insubstantial

109
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:11,920
a mirage on a hot road you can see you know it's not real

110
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,959
that's not really water or a magician we kind of know these

111
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:25,360
things but yet we believe in our habit as if it is substantial

112
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:30,880
as if this is reality and this is the truth

113
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:37,040
it's very difficult if not impossible

114
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:46,160
to see this to see this insubstantiation to see how untrue it is

115
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:54,480
it takes a steady mind it takes

116
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:04,160
a level of curiosity and interest and it takes a soft heart

117
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:11,200
you know the non-judging acceptance soft heart steadiness

118
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,639
and this um interest

119
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:23,120
that's what you're cultivating when we meditate that's what we're cultivating when we

120
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,240
meditate we're cultivating a level

121
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,120
of seed that allows us to steady the gaze

122
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,880
that allows us to soften into a level of kindness

123
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:49,600
and that creates an interest in whatever is happening so in l less of the doing to

124
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,560
fix the meditation and more of a watching

125
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:02,320
and i i i probably i'm gonna take a stab at this but i'm

126
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:11,680
pretty much i'm pretty sure that all of us on this call in hearing this talk

127
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,600
could say oftentimes when you're sitting there i

128
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:26,240
don't know what i'm doing i don't know what i'm looking at i don't know what it is because we're

129
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:35,120
we're taking a mind that is used to setting its understanding in habit

130
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:43,320
that's used to having labels and associations and knowing things as it knows and we are

131
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:51,519
exposing it to a vast constantly moving dharma

132
00:14:51,519 --> 00:15:00,000
the dhamma is moving and our grasping mind

133
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:06,639
is permanent so the world is impermanent it's moving all the time and we're

134
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,560
taking us a mind that's used to labeling things and knowing

135
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,880
things and we're putting it in a place where we want things to just move and

136
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,160
flow it's not going to make any sense

137
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:32,480
well i should say it's not going to make any sense to the grasping part of our mind but it makes

138
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:40,320
total sense to the embodied part of our mind because the embodied

139
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,079
part of our mind is present it's in the present moment it

140
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:54,240
knows things are in stem it knows things are insubstantial it knows and understands the three characteristics

141
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:02,399
of impermanence subject to change which is gonna bring dig duga and that's not personal it

142
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:09,279
knows this so we are spending time

143
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:15,600
learning how to let go of that grasping mind

144
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:23,040
and relax into get to know begin to trust this more

145
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:29,680
intuitive embodied mind and the intuitive embodied mind

146
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:37,839
allows us to see things like the black birds turning

147
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:57,360
just a little bit more here

148
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:09,038
it's not easy to tap into this intuitive mind you know this because when we sit

149
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:15,760
the grasping mind pretty much gets in the way with all of its talking and talking

150
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:22,400
and talking and rehearsing and planning and thinking thinking thinking it's got

151
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,918
plenty of stuff to say and it waits until we're still to say it

152
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,840
all of it

153
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:41,600
so in order for us to access this intuitive mind

154
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:51,280
we need to be kind to the grasping mind i used to have this so so because i grew

155
00:17:51,280 --> 00:18:00,000
up with a lot of trauma i also grew up with a lot of dysfunction and a lot of i had a very i would say aggressive

156
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:08,080
angry mind it was pretty anxious this whole meditation

157
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:16,080
thing and it's way too fluid for for my mind i grew up in a

158
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:22,400
house full of chaos so it wanted everything to be non-chaotic and of course sitting in

159
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:27,520
meditation can raise a lot of chaos in the beginning

160
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:36,559
so i used to have this habit of being nice to my

161
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:43,200
sort of uh dysfunctional what i would call my

162
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,440
trauma mind because it was always thinking this is the end this is the

163
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,880
end this is the end and so i would the way that i would help soothe it is

164
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:00,640
the way it would help soothe my kids and i would thank it for whatever it said i would just say

165
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:07,600
thank you and then i would ask into the moment again so i began to use

166
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:14,880
what i would call uh asking questions like there are all kinds of practices that

167
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,280
you know you can learn to do this professionally i mean or or

168
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:28,720
you can get trained in it i just made this up for myself but it does do wonders

169
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:34,559
i would pick something that seems hard to see

170
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:41,039
like soft it's hard to see soft when you have a

171
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:49,039
mind that is pretty rigid it really doesn't believe soft is around maybe some pillow but it

172
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:54,400
has even complaints about the pillow softness level

173
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:01,120
so i would ask my mind where soft

174
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,360
and it would say you know there's no soft we meet so often here because it's just

175
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:13,600
too hard but there's no soft and i would say thank you and i'd ask again where's up in seattle

176
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:19,919
inside rodney smith my teacher used to do this in little discussion groups and so i started doing

177
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:25,840
it with myself where is it and i just say thank you and then ask it again

178
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:35,840
but i learned something from doing this that has helped my practice immensely

179
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:43,120
if you if you if you if you begin to consider that what we're trying to see in this

180
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:50,400
awakening what we're trying to see in the idea of seeing that if you're trying to see the four noble truths

181
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,919
that that there is suffering that there is a cause for that suffering and that

182
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:01,520
there is a cause to the way leading out of that suffering

183
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:07,919
and the eightfold path itself all of these list things that we've

184
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:14,720
learned they're all very difficult to see to experience because we have a mind

185
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:22,000
that's set in habit and set in stone of the way it thinks

186
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:29,600
so when i would start asking a question some theoretical rhetorical

187
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:38,320
you know there's no real answer to it i'd ask and and began to have the mind

188
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:44,000
stumble over trying to find that a hardened answer

189
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:51,760
i learned something that if our grasping mind the part of us

190
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:59,120
that needs to know if it is not

191
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:04,640
shoved pushed if you're kind to it

192
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:11,679
but you keep asking a question eventually it will ask

193
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:16,080
the intuitive mind the answer

194
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:21,840
this is a strange phenomenon which is why i think some practices have you with these

195
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:28,320
asking pointed questions over and over and over because what ends up happening is i

196
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:35,039
this is the best way i can describe it so when we're sitting in meditation

197
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:42,720
and if you in your kindness keep coming back to the same anchor

198
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:48,960
not forcing the mind to come back but just in a kind way like thank you

199
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,559
for that planning but we're going to come back to this moment thank you for that

200
00:22:54,559 --> 00:23:01,600
come back i think what the mind this

201
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:09,360
i'm gonna tell you what i think is happening i think the mind is going

202
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:18,080
in the back to the intuitive body and saying hey what is going on there

203
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:24,640
what is she asking for what do they want i keep telling them there's no soft

204
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:30,480
around why did you keep asking me do you know what soft is

205
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:37,840
because if you keep asking what is saw is there software is it

206
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:44,080
and you don't you don't get mad at what the mind says

207
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:51,200
just say thank you and you ask again what you end up experiencing

208
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:58,480
is the felt sense of soft and all of a sudden you feel softness

209
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:05,360
everywhere because softness is not something you can intellectually

210
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:11,600
know it's something that we feel so a lot of the dhamma that we are

211
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:19,600
talking about is a felt sense experience not an intellectual concept

212
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:26,159
and if you try to force your mind to understand it it doesn't make any sense

213
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:32,799
it will keep trying to create an image of what it is that you want

214
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:39,039
in your mind like when we're trying to get still and we we've been still before so we're

215
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:46,159
trying to get to that and the mind will try to recreate it but it'll constantly tell you

216
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:53,440
well we can't get still because you need to solve that problem you need to fix this if you would get this done then we could

217
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:00,960
get still and it's constantly planning preparing rehearsing doing all these

218
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:08,080
things in service of one day we are going to get to that moment when

219
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:15,120
you were still and that's what it's trying to get to but you got all this mess in the way

220
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:22,880
so instead you're trying to question into is stillness here

221
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,679
now and you say no it's not here look we got to get through this oh thank you for all that is stillness here

222
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:38,880
now no it's not i'm saying i'm not still okay i'll say it again

223
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:43,840
there is stillness here

224
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:51,279
the best example i can give this for those of us that are older is karate

225
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:56,640
kid what mr miyagi did with karate kid is what we're doing with the mind

226
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:02,159
it's the best example so if you haven't seen karate kid or if it's been a long time you gotta

227
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:08,840
look at it and you get a it's a dollar talk this is not some hollywood movie just ignore all the you

228
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:17,039
know kerfuffle but what what you are learning to do

229
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:24,640
is to embody the moment not kind of

230
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:32,000
know what's going on you don't need to know and over the years of my practice i've

231
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:40,080
learned to shift my awareness from this kind of knowing where i'm

232
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:46,960
at controlling what i see knowing knowing knowing to this

233
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:54,000
more intuitive knowing that is much more trusting

234
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:00,720
so even though the mind didn't understand the pandemic when i

235
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,159
came into it and doesn't understand what we're going to do now that it's

236
00:27:06,159 --> 00:27:11,520
we're gonna start having vaccinations and am i really gonna leave and what does that mean am i gonna go back to

237
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:20,480
flying what does that mean airplane i don't even know really

238
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:28,080
even though all of that's happening inside is kind

239
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:36,399
it's still and it's curious about the whole thing all of it

240
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:42,320
it's not that i to where i am like that i still have the trauma mind from my

241
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:48,159
childhood but i just have a relationship

242
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:57,679
with the intuitive body i was born with and that aspect of me is very strong

243
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,840
very kind and very um

244
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:08,880
it's just interested curious about everything

245
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:16,240
it's in all of us it's not like it's in me because i got some special gift if i had some special gift i missed

246
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,960
it when i was growing up it's not that it's in all of us but what

247
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:30,640
we're doing is we have to sit and learn to access it because we have a grasping

248
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:37,039
mind that is hell bent on running the show

249
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:44,559
and so gradually gradually gradually we keep introducing the grasping mind

250
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:50,399
to this intuitive knowing my intuitive embodied mind

251
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:56,080
and that mind is stronger more courageous it's not afraid of

252
00:28:56,080 --> 00:29:02,240
mystery you know take on anything what mystery in fact it probably is less interested

253
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:09,120
in the same old same old same old it's like come on let's go do something different let's go see

254
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:13,840
let's notice sounds that we've never heard before

255
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,080
so i'm gonna end here on a poem another one

256
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:27,840
um to show you uh i think where

257
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:32,320
i think this poem um

258
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:39,919
it points to how we do this how we live with both this grasping mind that set in

259
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:46,399
stone that controls everything and this what uh buddha dasa would call

260
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:53,360
dhamma wisdom donald mine that's very uh open and vast and can see

261
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:57,120
and penetrate through

262
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:06,840
this is how we do it this is called the second music by annie

263
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,799
lightheart and he says now i

264
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:20,640
understand that there are two melodies playing one below the other one

265
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:28,240
easier to hear the other lower steady perhaps more faithful for being

266
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:36,880
less heard yet always present when all other things seem lively and real

267
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:44,640
this one fades yet the notes of it touch as gently as fingertips

268
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:52,720
as the sound of the names laid over each child at birth i want to stay in

269
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:57,760
that music without striving cover

270
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,799
if the truth of our lives is what it is playing the telling is so soft that this

271
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:12,320
mortal time this irrevocable change becomes beautiful i

272
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:20,320
stop and stop again to hear the second music i hear the children in the yard a train

273
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:28,320
bin birds all this is in it and will be gone i set my ear to it

274
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:33,760
as i would to a heart

275
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:47,840
so let's just sit quietly for a moment

276
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:17,589
[Music]

277
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,919
thank you so much for your practice and your

278
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:33,919
of patience you're all on zoom and you're all muted so you seem so quiet but

279
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:42,720
so we'll take a little time for some questions in case people have some

280
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,360
okay so if you have a question and uh you can go ahead and use the reactions button to raise your hand and we'll

281
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:57,840
call on you or you can post your question in chat

282
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:10,320
i'm getting all these thank yous

283
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,039
hi laura

284
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,840
so i see one question here

285
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:36,640
um capitol hill's in seattle washington so it's just capitol hill

286
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,159
meditation group if you look online and then i see carrie has her henna but

287
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:50,399
i'm going to answer this one question here how do i stay consistent with practice

288
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:58,080
that's a great question because um it might seem like

289
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,600
uh that i think the question might be asking how do i stay

290
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:10,158
consistent with sitting on the cushion that kind of practice but one way i've learned to stay

291
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:15,679
consistent with practice is i think practice is constant i'm never

292
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:22,240
not practicing so if i am cooking dinner i'm always using that

293
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:27,520
as a meditation i tell people on retreat and it works really well on these online

294
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:34,720
retreats is everything you do is a meditation so i just put the word meditation if i'm

295
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:42,638
going to the grocery store i'm doing my going to the grocery store meditation i learned that at retreats because

296
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:49,280
the only difference between going on a residential retreat and coming uh being in your house

297
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,800
before we actually started meditating in the house was that when you would go on a residential retreat all the work you did

298
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:02,880
were called yogi jobs i mean you're still really just chopping vegetables or cleaning toilets but yet

299
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:09,280
it had some kind of honorable integrity to it because on a retreat it's a yoga job so

300
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,520
when i would come home that's when i started calling everything i did like a yogi job and

301
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:20,640
somehow as an urban practitioner we have to

302
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:28,160
bring practice into our everyday existence because

303
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:36,160
something that you can note is when when we go on retreat for those of

304
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:42,480
you that have gone on residential retreats on the land you're kind of tucked in you get tucked

305
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,160
into this little cocoon and it takes a couple of days to get the mind to let go

306
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,079
of the flow of your life and then you're tucked into this safe space and you can

307
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:59,599
cultivate this really really strong kind of internal

308
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:06,880
connection with this intuitive this kind of embodied mind that's where that samadhi is

309
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,720
that sense of groundedness we get and then we take that and we go out in the world

310
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:18,000
and basically we let it get spent out until we can't take it anymore we come

311
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:23,119
back to a retreat we generate some kind of a samadhi again and we go

312
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:30,400
we use that to go out in the world and i i like that i mean we definitely need to come tucked in and cultivate that

313
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,720
samadhi i'll be so glad we can go back to going on the land and get that sense of tucked away

314
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:42,079
experience but as urban practitioners

315
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:49,119
we got to bring that tucked in experience into our everyday

316
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:56,800
world and probably the greatest thing that's happened to western practice is this pandemic

317
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,599
where we all had to have these retreats online if you have not done a retreat online you got to do one

318
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:10,880
you got to know how easy it is to begin to actually allow

319
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:16,000
your household to be a sanctuary for practice

320
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,839
when that happens you're practicing all the time so it's not let me get this done so i

321
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,880
can do something else you can begin to feel the sense of

322
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:34,839
curiosity kindness and this um steady of mind no matter what you're

323
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:41,920
doing all the time that's how i have consistent practice

324
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:49,920
is i stopped thinking that i was only practicing when i'm sitting on the cushion and

325
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:57,760
something happened when the grasping mind learns that it's okay

326
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:05,040
to stand at the sink and wash dishes and you're practicing it also won't mind doing it when you sit

327
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,839
on the cushion in fact it will want to sit on the cushion let's sit on the cushion and try

328
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:16,880
this well we don't have to do anything so my sitting on the cushion

329
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:24,079
increased because i was willing to get still all over the house doing whatever i was

330
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,760
doing so don't limit your practice to just sitting on the cushion

331
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,599
trust that if i bring this stillness this willingness to have a steadiness of

332
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:41,839
mind to the here and now a level of kindness about whatever's arising

333
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:46,960
and this curiosity in it then i am going to

334
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,480
i'm that that sitting on the cushion part is going to come

335
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:59,599
our our problem is that we keep losing it because we only think we're practicing

336
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:05,839
on the cushion and if you have dishwashers there is no better meditation than

337
00:39:05,839 --> 00:39:12,480
standing at the sink and washing dishes we gotta let that dishwasher go and you gotta take some time

338
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:19,440
to wash the dishes and do nothing else but stand there and wash the shoes maybe it's the warm water i don't know

339
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:28,400
what it is but there's something about the sound or the the simplicity of washing

340
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,079
dishes so you can that can be your meditation that

341
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:42,880
ultimately you are creating like in retreat where we cultivate

342
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:49,119
continuity between the sitting the walking the getting up in between that and the

343
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:54,160
eating and going to bed we create this continuity

344
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:01,039
you're doing the same thing when you create that kind of continuity at home

345
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:08,800
so i thought carrie had her hand up but i don't see it now so let's see there's a couple

346
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:16,640
of questions from youtube tourey so so one of them comes from paul

347
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:21,440
he said how best to access that second music

348
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:30,480
this is what i was pointing to about the karate kid movie so you gotta watch the movie so you can see

349
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,280
that the what mr miyagi was showing this kid is that he already

350
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:44,720
had access to this karate wisdom

351
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:52,079
we already have access to that music it's already there we have to learn to turn towards it and

352
00:40:52,079 --> 00:40:58,480
notice it and so take into consideration that the grasping mind

353
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:06,560
doesn't isn't necessarily going to trust it so i used the

354
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:13,359
repeated questions rhetorical questions to look for it so even if you like the

355
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:20,160
poem the second music you could ask because you know what is the second music that's just a phrase

356
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:28,000
that the poet wrote right so you could ask where is my second music where is that of course

357
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,040
your grasping mind's gonna say it's it's i don't know i can't access it's not here

358
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:38,720
because there's too much stuff going on right now you just thank the mind for that and ask

359
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:46,960
again where is that second music listen forward where is it and eventually your mind will ask your

360
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,040
intuitive mind where is it i don't understand where is it and that's when you begin to access

361
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:58,560
it so that you're accessing it not from the grasping mind

362
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:05,200
you actually have to give the second music layer permission to show itself or

363
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:13,280
reveal itself and that permission has to be granted almost by the grasping mind that's why

364
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,520
you have to be kind to this grasping mind so that it doesn't overpower

365
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:26,880
your wisdom and that's what we do on retreats we learn how to give permission for that

366
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:33,760
intuitive mind to be present so you're doing this in in your

367
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:44,880
everyday urban life just have patience with it just be very nice very kind

368
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,760
sort of like uh nilla reba once said there's a quote by

369
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:58,720
miller but let me see if i can remember it be more like a lion

370
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,400
than a dog chasing after your thoughts right because dogs

371
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:11,280
chase after sticks sticks he says soaked into the effect so one

372
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:18,720
only throws a stick and a lion once it's like you're not gonna be

373
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,480
throwing a stick at it so that if you treat your mind

374
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:31,359
like a lion you're gonna approach it with a level of kindness and care you're not gonna just be like

375
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:38,800
treating it like go get it go get it so that's what it's pointing to is to treat the mind with care but

376
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:46,240
thank it and ask again keep asking and you'll find that second reason

377
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:53,599
what's the other question uh so there's a couple people asking about like the names and authors of the two poems

378
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:58,000
you read today oh it was uh

379
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:04,640
blackbirds by julie cadwadler c-a-d-w-a-l-l-a

380
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:10,880
d-e-r her last name is staubs s-t-a-u-b

381
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:22,319
and the other one is the second music by annie lightheart l-i-g-h-t-h-a-r-t

382
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:27,520
and uh eric our last question he said uh what helps you to calm the

383
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:32,560
judgments we have of ourselves and others yeah there's a couple of um there's a

384
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,720
couple of things here about busy mind and and it's along the same line so this is

385
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:45,680
this is this is what i'm pointing to this is the crust of what i'm pointing to

386
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:54,000
judgment is part of grasping mind everybody on this call has a grasping

387
00:44:54,000 --> 00:45:01,040
mind comparing is part of the grasping mind everybody here that this is the mind that we have um

388
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:08,319
the busyness the overwhelm all of that energy is part of a grasping line

389
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:15,280
it's the same anxiety i had for so long all of that is part of that mind that's

390
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:22,078
trying to control everything and keep things safe and protected

391
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:31,040
that aspect of mind is not designed to harm us it's actually designed to

392
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:37,680
help us to remember when things hurt us and keep it in line to remember what's good and

393
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:43,280
remember what's bad and keep it keep it tight know where to go know how to do it

394
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:50,400
it's based on surety and the sense of control and and it's it's not very mysterious at

395
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:58,640
all it knows the problem is that we live in that mind we live in that mind

396
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:06,760
as if that is the mind that's gonna keep us safe and we're very much afraid of the intuitive

397
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:13,760
spontaneous kind of mysterious i don't know what's gonna go on let's just take it as we take it

398
00:46:13,760 --> 00:46:21,119
but that is the nature of the world we live in we live in a world that's very

399
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:28,400
fluid and mysterious with a mind that's set in stone and that is where

400
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:34,160
our conflict lies so we can't just dish this this a

401
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:40,559
judging comparing like rigid fixing mind

402
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:47,680
we think more of it's not getting rid of that mind it's adding

403
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:54,319
in the other mind that we do have an aspect of us that's

404
00:46:54,319 --> 00:47:01,119
just aligned with the way things are it's trusting its nature is to be intuitive

405
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:09,200
its nature is to live in mystery that aspect of us is existing simultaneously

406
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:17,680
so what we're learning to do is how do i not disrespect this mind

407
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:24,000
as uh in the hood we'd say throw shade on this mind in order

408
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:29,280
to say i'm in this my hook because we won't stay very long we'll be in it and

409
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:35,200
then you know this might all mess it all up so instead we want to give respect and honor to

410
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:40,559
this mind but know that there is a completely

411
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:47,119
different world a different way of existing in the moment and we are

412
00:47:47,119 --> 00:47:54,480
going to learn how to touch into that you do it at home you do it when you're sitting you do it

413
00:47:54,480 --> 00:48:02,160
when you go retreat you just do it as often as you can you listen for the second music you listen

414
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,520
for the intuitive mind in any given moment and you never

415
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:15,599
disrespect or get mean to this grasping mind because it's not designed to see it

416
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:22,880
it's designed to keep us steady and safe but that other mind is there

417
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:28,480
and gradually i think enlightened beings walk around in the world knowing both of

418
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:33,599
those minds and their intuitive mind is far superior

419
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:40,559
instead of its flip for us our grasping mind is more superior and so we're just learning to balance

420
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:45,440
this out so that it's steadier

421
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:53,200
all right well do you have time for one more question yeah uh so carrie i think who had her

422
00:48:53,200 --> 00:49:00,000
hand raised oh yes she did uh so she asked have you experienced a shift in the trauma mind

423
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:05,599
over time yes this is what i'm pointing to trauma mind

424
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:12,000
grasping mine it did not know how to manage the world that i was

425
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:18,559
living in when i was a kid so it came up with all these structures and systems and thoughts and mechanisms

426
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:25,359
to try to help me and i lived through that and when i failed the bar what i thought

427
00:49:25,359 --> 00:49:32,079
was a perfect understanding of the world came crashing in on me because it didn't work so i mean i had

428
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:37,599
to do 20 years of therapy to get rid of trauma mind don't get it twisted

429
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:43,760
adama is not therapy it's not gonna it's not gonna do the therapeutic thing

430
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:51,280
because it's not at one respect dumber doesn't care if there's trauma in the space

431
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:56,400
it's more like do you know there's trauma in the space but most of us when we get trauma we get

432
00:49:56,400 --> 00:50:03,359
triggered in trauma we don't even know we're in that trigger so this is more about do you know

433
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:12,160
where dhamma helps in trauma assuming that you have worked through

434
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:18,160
the the the the therapeutic side of it it's like a

435
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:24,079
psychological side of it where trauma really helped where duma helps

436
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:30,240
is it is the aspect that allows us to bring a degree of softening and

437
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:35,440
kindness and curiosity around whatever's happening

438
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:41,599
so what i found was i became less and less uh

439
00:50:41,599 --> 00:50:47,760
panicky about the anxiety or the fact that i just got triggered or i

440
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:56,160
just had more capacity to be with unpleasantness to be with anxiety and see it for more

441
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:03,520
what it is and i the grasping mind cannot do that it cannot be with anxiety with any

442
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:11,280
degree of trust because it's too um it's too judgmental basically anxiety is

443
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:18,720
bad there's just no way around it nobody wants it but we have an intuitive side of us

444
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:27,520
that knows anxiety is here it's not caught in the anxiety and it can steady us and say well this

445
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:34,079
is this oh what's that white weight not actually having a heart attack

446
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:40,240
nobody's actually hitting us hold on just a moment that aspect is an

447
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,520
intuitive mind and so practice is about learning how

448
00:51:45,520 --> 00:51:52,319
to rest in that intuitive mind and not letting our grasping mind basically

449
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:58,079
tell us what to do that's why when you're there sitting you're going to feel

450
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:03,520
unpleasantness practice being with that unpleasantness a little bit what it may be

451
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:09,200
wait only gonna sit here for five minutes can i just be with this unpleasantness

452
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,400
the mind is all talking talking talking not gonna try to get rid of that just

453
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:21,359
wait just okay do what you gotta do talk talk talk let me just see if i can settle in

454
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:27,359
the body and notice that i'm doing all that talking and not caught up in it that is

455
00:52:27,359 --> 00:52:34,480
something we learn how to do it's not something that just happens so you're going to practice and

456
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:41,040
sometimes you're not going to be able to get out of the the uh i couldn't get out of that anxiety

457
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:47,440
you know violent kind of thinking and i just have to get up but sometimes i could like oh wait i see

458
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:53,760
something and then it's all gone again and then you know back i'm stuck in it

459
00:52:53,760 --> 00:53:00,160
our practice sangha is really what helps us just keep doing it just keep trying and

460
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,280
keep trying and keep trying and over time you don't have to fix it

461
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:09,359
the mind will do it on its own

462
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:15,920
i see one more hand here gary jerry let me go ahead and sorry unmute

463
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:21,200
him um first of all thank you very much uh for uh

464
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:28,319
an excellent uh talk i really appreciate it so um i just wondered in terms of uh

465
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:33,359
i'm a psychiatrist and i help try to help a lot of people in toronto and of course a lot of people are

466
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:40,160
frightened about covid and so anyhow you spoke about the grasping mind about keeping us safe and the intuitive

467
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:46,720
mind so i i might take am i to take that both are necessary but perhaps in our

468
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:52,640
society that the intuitive mind has been unnecessarily suppressed and that it needs to be brought into balance with

469
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:58,079
the grasping minor do i get that's what i think that's the right thing i'm going to give you an example i gave

470
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:04,079
to my thursday night capitol hill group this is the perfect the best way i could explain it so

471
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:10,800
um i have a outlet in my house that uh was connected to uh a fan

472
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,720
and i didn't think it worked i mean that's how i bought the house and it didn't work and so we took it off the

473
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:24,800
price and so it didn't work 20 years i've been in this apartment never used that stupid outlet so so that somebody asked

474
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:32,240
me well why don't we put a i've always wanted an outlet over there but i don't have one because you know it doesn't work so my friend

475
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:37,920
who does electro like you know electric things said why don't we put an outlet there i said

476
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:43,520
it doesn't work guess what i mean it doesn't have wires

477
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:49,280
it's like oh yeah but it doesn't work it goes well can we see it opens it up and of course

478
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:57,200
it works like i had it 20 years ago okay it works so he puts an outlet there

479
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:03,599
and plugs in an extension cord not even anything of power just an extension cord

480
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:10,880
to show me it work i'm like oh it works

481
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:18,720
and then maybe i don't know maybe about an hour later the power goes

482
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:25,359
off and it goes off in the house and of course i think i should have never did that outlet

483
00:55:25,359 --> 00:55:31,839
that's what did it it was the outlet he goes to work there's nothing plugged in it would've if it were too much power it

484
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:38,720
would have happened immediately like no it was it was me and then i went to the door and i looked

485
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:44,400
down the hall and i'm like oh i'm taking out the power of the whole block

486
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:50,240
and then it turns out i've been my whole neighborhood the power's out

487
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:55,599
all because of me the grasping mind it

488
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:02,720
it associates this is what you would know jerry it's like it associates things and connects things

489
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:09,599
together and it creates stories based on that the intuitive mind

490
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,640
is much more connected to just what is arising in this moment

491
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:21,119
so the biggest problem with code was and is our fears is what we think

492
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:27,040
is going to happen it's the the extrapolated stories that get

493
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:33,359
drawn out and dhamma is about here and now this moment this

494
00:56:33,359 --> 00:56:38,960
moment this moment and the more we learn to acknowledge

495
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:46,799
that this moment even though the story as much dumb as i had i still had this mind that was growing

496
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:54,319
ever big of trauma that was about to happen and what saved me was a friend of mine

497
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:59,440
sent me an email that said oh did you are you stuck in a power outage i heard

498
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:07,440
capitol hill had this uh you know some the snow it was snow at the time the snow broke

499
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,920
some power line and are you stuck in you know no electricity and i was like

500
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:22,319
oh that's where it comes from but you can see that how easily the grasping mind

501
00:57:22,319 --> 00:57:30,319
it doesn't it didn't have anything to do with me it's what i'm saying the mind just envelops and goes on its own

502
00:57:30,319 --> 00:57:38,880
and we kind of go with it unless you have some ability to kind of stay so the old me

503
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:44,880
would have pretty much panicked i would have shut down i would have been in anxiety i wouldn't

504
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:51,599
even have been able to hear if someone did tell me that it was from a power line i would have insisted

505
00:57:51,599 --> 00:57:58,000
that this is what it was from me i would have closed that outlet off and i would never use it again

506
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:05,119
but this uh what what what dhamma has taught me is to be in the hearing now and in the

507
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:13,760
here and now i can tell oh that is a trauma mind that is not reality reality it happens

508
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:20,640
it comes it doesn't have to rock me forever you know i don't have to shut

509
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:26,079
off that whole side of the house sort of like i did in the beginning or it doesn't work i

510
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:33,760
can actually allow the present moment to have influence on you you see that that

511
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:40,799
that is what it is that i think damma can help people

512
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:46,799
begin to do what you could consider a double check you can double check the

513
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:55,119
present moment to see if it's in line or in keeping with the mind's story it's creating

514
00:58:55,119 --> 00:59:03,359
and double checking that story against reality it begins to help us

515
00:59:03,359 --> 00:59:10,079
learn to see the difference between the stories that our minds are creating and the truth of what's actually going

516
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:17,200
on so what could have been a really long lasting problem ended up only

517
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:23,520
lasting about an hour see the difference yes that's very helpful thank you so

518
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:29,760
much i really appreciate that thank you yeah too area actually dunder actually

519
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:36,559
had a question i don't know if you still have time okay take that so he asks or they ask where do these two minds

520
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:43,920
come from grasping mind and the intuitive mind and then he has a follow-up is there an evolutionary background for these two

521
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:51,520
minds i don't think that there are i don't think of it as i don't know about the it's it's

522
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:57,359
evolutionary nature of it i guess what i would say is the two

523
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:02,400
minds i'm speaking of is like digestion it's like uh

524
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:09,680
our respiratory system it comes with the package so grasping that

525
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:17,040
i guess you could call it reptilian brain but i think i've heard from a couple of uh uh

526
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:23,200
dhamma teachers that are scientists also that it doesn't really line up with the reptilian brain like we try to say it

527
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:28,799
but there is an aspect of mind that compares and judges

528
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:34,880
it's the name and form aspect of uh the link on the dependent origination so

529
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:41,359
this mind just automatically does this there's an aspect of mind that automatically labels

530
01:00:41,359 --> 01:00:48,000
things as pleasant unpleasant and neither so that part of mind is what we tend to

531
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:54,720
live in in our urban society there is still an intuitive mind you

532
01:00:54,720 --> 01:01:00,240
know it because something as simple as you can walk into a room where two people were

533
01:01:00,240 --> 01:01:07,440
arguing they're not arguing now but you know something went on you don't know what happened but you know something went on

534
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:15,359
or you can look at two people and say oh they like each other oh i can see you just have this intuitive sense so we

535
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:22,839
do have an intuitive capacity consciousness of knowing and penetrating

536
01:01:22,839 --> 01:01:30,799
through mostly we don't come to that knowing until we go into a retreat where we have

537
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:37,280
shaved away all of the other distractions and we can point our mind towards it

538
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:44,880
and what we're learning in practicing in urban life you're learning how to

539
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:50,960
be and cultivate that intuitive mind in the midst of a lot of distractions

540
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:55,599
so it's harder but it still can be done

541
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:04,480
all right great i think we've probably used up all our time now yes thank you very much okay good thank

542
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:09,520
you so much for having me i appreciate it you know i hope to see you again

543
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:16,799
bye thank you thank you bye
