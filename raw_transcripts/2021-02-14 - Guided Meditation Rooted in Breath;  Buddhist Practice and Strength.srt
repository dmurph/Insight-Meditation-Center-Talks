1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,560
so good morning everyone good day and i'm happy to be here with

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:17,920
you and to share this sunday time and um

3
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:25,920
it's a wonderful thing to sit in meditation a chance to show up and be present for

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:33,360
our experience and one of the qualities of meditation that maybe

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,680
aselda mentioned is the value of bringing some strength

6
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,719
tapping into or calling on whatever native strength we have

7
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:53,760
to not to assert ourselves but to really be rooted here to be

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,960
present in a full dedicated way to this doing this practice so we're

9
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,840
giving a bit of whatever inner strength we have to let

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,600
that strength be activated so that we are stronger

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,439
than the mind that wants to wander away not in conflict with that mind but

12
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:27,600
simply that [Music] the our bill our strength of attention

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,280
our attention is given more value more importance and that there's really

14
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:41,360
kind of a engagement with it that naturally then becomes stronger than our wandering

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,840
away distracted mind analogy the buddha often gave is that of the sun

16
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,840
when the sun becomes strong the stars disappear so in the same way when the sun of

17
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:58,880
awareness gets strong then then you know the distractions tend

18
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:08,640
to vanish so to take a to assume a meditation posture

19
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,319
and to gently close your eyes

20
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:23,920
and to as you know in assuming your posture

21
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,720
whether it's it you know there's there's considered before dignified postures

22
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,000
sitting standing walking and lying down

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,680
and whichever these postures that's close to how you are

24
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:49,440
perhaps to assume at least some form of inner

25
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:57,360
strength or vitality to that posture and one way to do that

26
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:03,120
is to be clearly here in this posture

27
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,080
clearly here in this body

28
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:19,519
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

29
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:27,360
that can be part of the movement towards becoming

30
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:36,080
rooted here to enter into fully and in a strong way

31
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:43,120
here and as you exhale

32
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:51,840
to relax the tensions the holdings of the muscles

33
00:03:52,799 --> 00:04:01,840
softening the shoulders

34
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:15,840
softening the belly

35
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:29,840
softening the muscles of the face

36
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,840
and there's a heart to relaxing and softening

37
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:49,199
which a lot which makes room and space for an inner vitality

38
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,400
and inner aliveness to flow through us more fully in a sense

39
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,000
physical tension constricts her vitality

40
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:11,840
the deeper fuller the relaxation the more that vitality begins to flow

41
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:25,520
a vitality that i can have a certain kind of strength maybe a sweet strength or a peaceful

42
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,000
strength

43
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,840
letting your breath return to normal

44
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:07,840
breathing in and breathing out

45
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,840
one of the strongest muscles in the body is the diaphragm

46
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:29,280
there is a kind of a strength perseverance

47
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:35,840
inherent in breathing

48
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,199
to allow the breathing to breathe you

49
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,840
allow breathing to breathe itself

50
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:16,080
and letting your breathing

51
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,319
be the way that your the strength of your attention

52
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:32,319
is is rooted here in the present moment in the present

53
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:39,599
moment breathing breathing at the center of all

54
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
things

55
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
so

56
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,279
most things that you think about in meditation

57
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,160
you've probably thought about them before and will think about them again

58
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:47,120
more likely most likely it's not particularly useful to think

59
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,880
about them now there's no need

60
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:59,600
and so to realize that clearly

61
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:08,480
and choose again to be with your breathing

62
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:16,399
with an atten an attention that has a little bit of strength to it

63
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:24,800
a little bit of investing yourself this is important this is the time

64
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:33,839
to ride on the waves of breathing

65
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:31,839
so

66
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:51,839
so

67
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,840
so

68
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:11,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

69
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,120
it's often considered a special occasion

70
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:30,080
to sit in meditation to have the time the inclination

71
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:39,840
to spend time connecting to the dharma practice this way

72
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,960
and at the end of a practice session like this

73
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:52,960
it's an opportune time to spend a minute or two reflecting

74
00:33:52,960 --> 00:34:02,398
on how this is this practice that we've been doing can be a basis a support

75
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:10,720
for living in a way that betters the world for others

76
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:21,599
that we don't meditate in isolation just for me myself and mine

77
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:28,720
but we meditate open and available and caring for the world around us our

78
00:34:28,720 --> 00:34:33,760
friends our family neighbors and people in our communities

79
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:36,638
far and wide

80
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,839
and to have the aspiration that whatever benefit we receive from the

81
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:53,520
meditation spreads outwards into that wider world

82
00:34:54,159 --> 00:35:03,760
may all beings benefit from the goodness of this practice

83
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,760
may all beings be happy

84
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,279
may all beings be safe

85
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:21,680
may all beings be peaceful

86
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:31,838
may all beings everywhere be free

87
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:42,209
[Music]

88
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:05,599
and then before switching over to the dharma talk the

89
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:12,240
um the announcement is that starting

90
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:19,440
tomorrow morning for seven days from monday through sunday morning

91
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,599
uh the seven a.m meditation that we've been doing now for about nine months

92
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,040
will be outside of a 30-minute meditation will be 45 minutes

93
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,200
it'll start at uh in california at 6 45 15 minutes to the hour

94
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:44,000
and uh and the idea is that i think that it's coinciding or doing

95
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:53,599
being being done together with a week-long retreat i'm teaching and um and also the idea is that uh

96
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:59,440
for those of you who have been coming in the morning that a longer sitting is might be nice to stretch yourself or to

97
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,599
have a fuller experience to especially for this practice of anapanasati that we're doing

98
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:13,520
during this time so you're all welcome to come

99
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,359
and then also next week because i'm on the retreat i won't be here to teach the sunday

100
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:24,720
morning talk and a wonderful new dharma teacher new on our scene

101
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:31,040
named salah who's the guiding teacher up in

102
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,240
the seattle light in seattle inside meditation center

103
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:51,839
will be here to give the talk and i'm delighted that you get to meet this wonderful teacher

104
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,480
so

105
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:23,839
the so i want to share with you some of my

106
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:30,480
reflections from this weekend and maybe you'll permit me not to

107
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:36,560
give a dharma talk but maybe a dharma chat since um maybe they're not so well

108
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,599
formulated but the topic is an important one and one that

109
00:38:41,599 --> 00:38:47,119
is i think seldom talked about and maybe even uh there's some

110
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:57,119
reluctance to teach it here in the united states because that the topic is um is easily something that

111
00:38:57,119 --> 00:39:05,200
is off-putting for people or can it come across as something which is maybe even dangerous

112
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:12,560
and that is the topic of strength uh that the developing

113
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:17,680
inner strength and inner power even through this practice of ours

114
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:24,800
that that is part of what we're doing here in this practice and um i think much of the

115
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,560
way that the inside meditation practice practices taught in the modern west

116
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,160
maybe that's implicit but it's explicitly more language of

117
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:43,920
acceptance more language of just being with your experience not trying to fix your experience

118
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,480
the idea of personal agency that you have some control some power some

119
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:55,680
in your ex practice is not really get emphasized

120
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,920
and i think that sometimes maybe it's a shortcoming that we don't do that and

121
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:08,000
that really developing becoming strong people

122
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:13,680
is actually one of the benefits of developing and practice becoming a strong person that develops

123
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:21,040
strong inner core or capacity of various kinds

124
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:26,560
and it's important because certainly we wanted to have enough strength

125
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,640
to not succumb to our defilements not succumb to greed hate and delusion

126
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:39,359
not to come to unwholesome unhealthy fear

127
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:46,720
and one of the things that people are can be afraid of is they can be afraid of themselves

128
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:53,359
and uh and so certainly be afraid of things out in the world but they can be afraid of themselves

129
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:58,800
afraid of what they're going to say what they're going to do what they're going to think and what they're going to

130
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,319
feel and so there's a kind of an avoidance of really connecting here

131
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:10,880
because of this self fear that that can exist now uh but that and that self fear then

132
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:17,520
also what it does it can easily dampen uh personal strength in fact some people

133
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:23,680
are afraid of their strength they're afraid that if they are strong that they will

134
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:30,480
harm someone that they will cause trouble for other people other people be uncomfortable

135
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:38,160
that somehow they'll be seen as conceited or seen as being somehow assertive too much

136
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:44,800
in a way that's maybe considered unacceptable in the scenes the situation we're in

137
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,839
and and and then also sometimes this fear of

138
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:54,880
one's own strength can be related to a fear an idea

139
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:02,319
that we don't really um have a full right to exist or we're not

140
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:08,720
really worthy enough to be strong that somehow we're diminished we're less than others

141
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:16,000
or we should really what what's you know we should really kind of keep small stay small or stay

142
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:22,480
unnoticed or stay in the back row and somehow diminish ourselves because to

143
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,960
not diminish ourselves sometimes is socially disruptive for the scene that we're in

144
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:35,680
and sometimes in some families and even some cultures that there's a preference for somehow

145
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,880
not being a little bit

146
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:47,440
self-effacing a little bit not assertive and certainly that can be quite valuable

147
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:54,480
and at times of quite healthy and appropriate but it can lend itself for support go

148
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,520
along with a tendency of people to be afraid of their own strength or reluctant to embody it or engage it or

149
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:07,920
not to realize or appreciate they can be developed and and grow some people are kind of looking

150
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,960
for something that's going to fix them some insight

151
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,880
some in experience something that's going to be their savior from the

152
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:24,079
difficulties they have and so they're kind of a little bit looking outside of themselves

153
00:43:24,079 --> 00:43:29,520
for a and and one of the things about strength as strength and practice

154
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:37,520
develops there's something that grows from the inside out that is little bit has the effect of

155
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:44,400
of not solving problems not providing an answer per se but we grow

156
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,000
in such a way that like the snake that grows the skin gets shed

157
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:57,280
the old skin gets shed and there's something about cultivating developing a strong inner strength or

158
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:02,720
sense of power or powers or strengths maybe in the plural

159
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:09,440
that makes us grow and old things just get shed they fall fall off us

160
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:15,520
rather than needing to be solved so to spend too much time trying to solve problems sometimes as a

161
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,839
dead end solve our inner turmoils and challenges sometimes it's actually more useful to

162
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:28,400
develop a strength so for example a strength in mindfulness a strength and concentration

163
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:35,920
as strength and ethics integrity a strength in impatience and strength in telling the

164
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:42,640
truth and being truthful to oneself or maybe to others as really a strength of presence really

165
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:49,280
to and sometimes that can be done physically in fact so much of what can be developed in

166
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:55,119
practice develops stronger develops more more more effectively

167
00:44:55,119 --> 00:45:02,160
if there's a kind of embodied association or embodied

168
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:07,280
connection to actually doing this embodied mindfulness embodied

169
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:14,160
presence embodied truth so um clearly the buddha wanted people

170
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:21,280
to be strong and in buddhist practice develops inner strength

171
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:26,960
and as i said ideally we become stronger than our defilements so we don't cause problems in the world

172
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,640
or problems for ourselves and some of the language the buddha used in his teachings

173
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:41,440
are language words that i associate with strength the words like ardency with practice in an ardent way to

174
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:47,040
the word that's often translated as effort which kind of it the word effort is a

175
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:52,720
fine word but it's kind of a neutral neutral word just effort it doesn't carry any

176
00:45:52,720 --> 00:46:00,319
strength in it and the word that's often translated as effort is viria and viria probably more

177
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:06,800
appropriately should be translated as something like courageous effort um that the word vira

178
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:13,040
that viri is part of is a word for hero i've been told that in modern india

179
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,880
it's the word for a soldier and so a heroic effort i think is sometimes the

180
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,480
way it's translated in maybe in tibetan buddhism where they use the word hero that

181
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:31,599
in related terms the idea of courageous effort and

182
00:46:31,599 --> 00:46:39,599
and then also the word power itself and that is used and and as people

183
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:47,440
develop in freedom in buddhism greater freedom including a freedom from conceit

184
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:54,720
they are frequently depicted as being coming powerful language and symbolism of mature

185
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:00,960
practitioners is often with uh represented by images of power

186
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:07,599
so for example there's a delightful suta where someone who develops uh

187
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:14,480
some degree of freedom initial degree of freedom um together with the seven five seven

188
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:19,599
powers of awakening seven factors of awakening is described as be having a

189
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:25,839
great self a large self and it's a little bit surprising to hear

190
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:32,079
this language of self use in such a definitive way a great self a large self and that great

191
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:37,200
self and large self is uh represented or is the

192
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:44,079
analogy for it is a kind of a great mythic being that develops that grows in the great

193
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:50,800
himalayan mountains that's a it's kind of a river spirit a river serpent

194
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:57,280
and uh and so it's called the naga and uh in this case naga means many

195
00:47:57,280 --> 00:48:02,720
things but one of the things these river spirit uh serpents and that a person a person develops some

196
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:07,920
initial taste of freedom uh becomes one of these great

197
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:14,079
nagas of with uh who are of a great self and a large self

198
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:21,680
expansive self is one translation the um and one of the also delightful

199
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:28,319
uh expressions of the power the strength that a practitioner can have is uh in what's

200
00:48:28,319 --> 00:48:33,920
called the lion's roar it was something that the people the time of the buddha the buddha did this

201
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:40,559
and other people did it as well they would declare their full awakening when someone came and told the buddha

202
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:47,440
that they had then now they were fully awakened that was referred to their lions roar

203
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:54,640
and i don't know if you've ever been close to a lion that roared but i have fortunately it for me

204
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:00,800
at the zoo maybe not fortunately for the lion but i was probably only standing only

205
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:06,640
four or five feet away from the lion and with bars between us

206
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:13,920
and the roar that it uh directed in my direction was one that commanded a tremendous

207
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:20,720
amount of respect it had felt it had a primordial feeling that the like the whole bowels of the

208
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:26,640
earth were kind of roaring at me and and i thought the only respectful the

209
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,960
only proper thing to do with that war was to walk away

210
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:39,760
so the lions roar not that we're supposed to walk away from in lines enlightened people but it's a it's a

211
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:48,000
expression that conveys great confidence and great strength so so one of the things that are called

212
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:56,720
powers in buddhism and here we see the powers are not meant to be powers that we on other people

213
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:02,880
but rather inner capacities that we have the five powers are the five faculties

214
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:08,160
when they're strong and these are faith or confidence to have a

215
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:14,559
conf the power of confidence of faith the power of this courageous effort that

216
00:50:14,559 --> 00:50:21,920
the courageous effort has now become something a real strength that we carry with us the power of mindfulness the power of

217
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:28,800
samadhi usually translates concentration and the power of wisdom what a great power to have wisdom be

218
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:34,400
wise in a way that has a real strength that we carry with us

219
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:41,920
another place where we seek i associate with powers what's called the four resolves and

220
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:47,040
the pali word is aditana which is a means could almost more literally be

221
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:53,520
translated in english as taking a stand the etymology of the word

222
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:59,200
and but usually as resolves and and so what we have resolved for is what

223
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:05,680
there's a power there's a strength behind us in doing it and and so these are also interesting

224
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:13,839
lists again it's not power over others so it's um the first one resolve is

225
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:20,400
not neglecting wisdom the second one is um

226
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,838
is um

227
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:32,960
preserving protecting the truth the third is cultivating the capacity to

228
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:41,599
let go to relinquish and the fourth is to train in peace train peacefully

229
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:46,640
train to become more peaceful to so to develop a strength of being

230
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:51,760
peaceful sometimes we don't associate i think power and peacefulness together it's

231
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:57,599
almost like peacefulness is is an alternative to being powerful but the power the resolve

232
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:03,440
of being peaceful so living in a confident committed and

233
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:09,520
dignified fashion is are some of the associations with this developing this power this

234
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:15,040
capacity to be and so there's not in itself if there's not a there's a there's

235
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:20,319
it doesn't look from the outside like some developed practitioner is self-effacing

236
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:26,160
at least not in how they carry and hold themselves but it is in terms of not having any

237
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:32,319
conceit or arrogance letting go of being self-centered at the same time as being

238
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:38,400
strongly centered no egotistical center but a strong

239
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:44,799
centered in our lived vital experience of being here and present

240
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:51,359
one of the ways we might understand this is to live in a manner where there's no

241
00:52:51,359 --> 00:52:56,960
need to apologize for ourselves i think there's a strong tendency in the

242
00:52:56,960 --> 00:53:02,720
united states for some people to constantly want to say they're sorry to apologize to

243
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:09,599
to kind of diminish themselves for exerting themselves or being even being and i think that to live in a

244
00:53:09,599 --> 00:53:15,440
way that we don't have to apologize not regularly of course not regularly not as a policy not as a

245
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:21,920
second nature thing to always feel sorry or apologize and the way to do that in buddhism is to

246
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:28,400
live what the buddha called the blameless life a life the blamelessness that is meant to

247
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,960
bring a certain kind of joy the strength of a blameless life and this is to live a life

248
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:40,000
that adheres to the precepts to not harm people not intentionally be

249
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,640
involved in causing hurt or harm through killing and stealing and sexual misconduct and lying and

250
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:52,880
and using intoxicants and to really have confidence that one is living this way

251
00:53:52,880 --> 00:54:00,000
um to the end we end up living a life we don't apologize for ourselves

252
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:06,160
to be blameless and uh i don't think it's second nature for many of the people here in this country

253
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:13,119
but um it's uh but if you can live that way then you're encouraged to feel the joy

254
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:20,160
of that the joy and the power of a blameless life an unapologetic life

255
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:27,920
in the dhammapada there's wonderful descriptions of of strong

256
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:34,079
people that they don't use the word strong but i think we can substitute it

257
00:54:34,079 --> 00:54:41,040
reasonably enough and there's a whole chapter called the brahmana the brahmanas were kind of the the

258
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:46,079
priests of the brahmanical religion they're also a hereditary role so there

259
00:54:46,079 --> 00:54:53,440
were families there were brahmanical families and they thought thought of themselves as being the top

260
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:58,480
class in society and the dominant class and often they were

261
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:03,920
had a lot of authority sometimes and owned a lot of land had a lot of wealth

262
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:11,599
and they're responsible for the religious rituals of the brahmanical religion and um there was often a kind of not

263
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:17,440
just in buddhism but in other areas of india as well a kind of jockeying for

264
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:22,960
position or um you know but who was it really should be dominant

265
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:30,240
or what kind of kind of critique of the dominance of the brahmanas and the buddha he did this by

266
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:36,559
redefining what it means to be a brahmana and he defined a brahmana as someone who

267
00:55:36,559 --> 00:55:43,520
has some degree of spiritual awakening and so so here are some examples of

268
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:50,240
these ways which he says this this is a verse from the dhammapada

269
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:57,440
who has no clinging who has nothing i call the brahmana

270
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:02,559
so at first no clinging having nothing that doesn't really seem like a

271
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:07,680
situation of power or strength or you know an important class of people in society or

272
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,720
some someone to revere or something who has no clinging who has

273
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:20,559
nothing i call the brahmin whoever is most excellent a bull

274
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:27,680
a hero a great sage a conqueror free of craving cleansed

275
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:33,760
awakened i call a brahmana so here now that's all these are all synonyms for

276
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:39,839
the same person all kind of describing the same kind of person here they're talking about excellence a

277
00:56:39,839 --> 00:56:45,280
bull which is a powerful uh animal a hero which has

278
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:51,040
strength to it and a conqueror now this can be quite off-putting for

279
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:56,400
many people in the west to have these kind of masculine seeming words or concepts associated

280
00:56:56,400 --> 00:57:01,839
with it but but there is clearly a show associated with

281
00:57:01,839 --> 00:57:07,440
non-clinging freedom from craving inner cleanliness

282
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:13,440
it's not an assertiveness or a dominance the idea of conquering being a conqueror

283
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:21,359
is really becoming conquer of one's own defilements one's own inner attachments and clinging one

284
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:26,559
conquers oneself in a sense not others so we get this

285
00:57:26,559 --> 00:57:31,680
clear example in other verses that this power strength of a

286
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:36,960
practitioner is not meant to be over other people it's really over themselves

287
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:43,520
in these verses having given up violence towards beings both timid and

288
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:49,040
strong whoever neither kills or causes others to kill

289
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:55,760
i call a brahmana i call i say is strong whoever is not

290
00:57:55,760 --> 00:58:01,920
adversarial among those who are peaceful among those who are violent not clinging

291
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:07,280
among those who cling i call a brahmana whoever lets passion

292
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:14,000
hostility conceit and hypocrisy fall away like a mustard seed from the tip of an

293
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:19,119
all i call a brahmana who speaks

294
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:26,160
what is true informative and not harsh who gives offenses offense to no one

295
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:32,799
i call a brahmana so for me in in these

296
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:39,280
these verses all this emphasis on non-harming is presented in a way that prevents a

297
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:45,680
real strength of people there's a dedication a community this definitively this is what a person is

298
00:58:45,680 --> 00:58:51,280
this idea of a blameless life that doesn't cause harm in any kind of way to do that with strength and be able to

299
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,960
stand up in a dignified to be in dignified confident way

300
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:02,799
to carry oneself in the world with confidence to no one sells well enough to know all

301
00:59:02,799 --> 00:59:09,040
the forces of fear self-belittlement self-fear

302
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:16,160
the ways that we self-criticize ourself or and kind of become less than who we are

303
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:22,480
and to learn to shed those to learn to not have them diminish us us so that our native

304
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:28,880
strength we don't we're not it's not assertive strength it's not like puffing ourselves up in

305
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:34,079
some arrogant macho but rather the native strength of who we

306
00:59:34,079 --> 00:59:41,760
are can be there in a simple natural full way it's not we don't

307
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:48,480
we don't diminish it we don't apologize for it we don't you know

308
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:53,599
hide it or hide from it that somehow we're allowed to be

309
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:59,200
strong we're allowed to be present fully embodied in here in a clear definitive

310
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:06,240
way we are worthy of that in fact one of the the meaning for our our heart someone is fully awakened

311
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:11,440
literally means a worthy one and uh i i kind of like to translate to

312
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:18,480
interpret that i mean they're worthy of really being present to being here and alive and full

313
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:27,200
so that one of the goals of buddhist practice is to become fearless and and part of that is to stop

314
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:32,880
undermining ourselves through fear and the fear that i wanted to emphasize

315
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:38,400
today in this chat is self fear how we are afraid of ourselves

316
01:00:38,400 --> 01:00:44,880
and therefore diminish ourselves and and kind of undermine our strength

317
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:51,760
so to do this it helps to take stock of our fear of how we're afraid of ourselves including

318
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:57,040
our fear of being strong this then allows us to address these

319
01:00:57,040 --> 01:01:03,280
fears and develop growing confidence in our capacity to live intentionally without

320
01:01:03,280 --> 01:01:12,720
harming anyone including ourselves so um i hope that

321
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,920
these ideas that i've presented here uh are meaningful enough for you for you

322
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:26,000
to reflect and consider a little bit how it is that um it's a pro how in what appropriate way

323
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:32,559
can you step up and uh and allow for yourself

324
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:39,520
to have a native power native strength of someone who metaphorically

325
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:45,920
stands their ground speaks speaks freely and confidently

326
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:52,880
what they feel like they have to say can talk honestly can doesn't diminish themselves but just

327
01:01:52,880 --> 01:02:02,079
as they're allowed to be present and fully there and have a voice and show up and um

328
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:09,520
and that uh that is i think one of the great benefits from doing mindfulness practice

329
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:15,599
the mindfulness practice that helps us to let go of any force within us

330
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:22,000
that diminishes us that undermines our native natural strength that's here

331
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:28,160
and in doing so um we might end up looking like strong people

332
01:02:28,160 --> 01:02:34,400
in the eyes of others but in our in our own inner sense we won't

333
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:40,799
necessarily feel that we are now strong but the inner sense is feeling now we're

334
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:50,160
free and but to be free from the outside will look as if we become strong so

335
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:55,440
i hope that you will think about this and reflect on it and so hopefully there's something of what i said today

336
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:02,000
that will be useful for you and i would love to meet each of you in your

337
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:09,680
strength so thank you all very much
