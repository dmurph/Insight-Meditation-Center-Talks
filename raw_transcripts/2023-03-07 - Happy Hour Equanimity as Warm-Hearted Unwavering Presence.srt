23
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:34,140
the natural breath which is what we use as our anchor

32
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,379
preoccupations thoughts plans memories this that are all down below we're far

33

contracted

37
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:28,940

98
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:42,120

99
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:48,059
means we're more prepared to be with them

100
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:54,059
with all of it whenever you feel already imagining

101
00:21:54,059 --> 00:21:59,520

105
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:22,919
space in your heart and your mind if you need to stay more

[Music]

137
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:00,258
[Music]

138
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:16,559
thanks for your practice everyone so we practiced we explored equanimity

139
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:23,940
practice of opeka in Pali Equanimity which is the fourth Brahma vihara

140
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:29,100
forth Heavenly Abode first being meta loving kindness second

141
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:35,159
one being karuna compassion third one vicarious joy joy for Joy of others and

142
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:43,559
the fourth one is equanimity ah it's related to all of the other Brahma biharas it it supports them it's the

143
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:50,120
basis of them it's the the foundation and

144
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:56,880
the invitation tonight was to relate to it from this this image of sitting on

145
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:01,980
the mountain there's space all around so so there is a sense of perspective so

146
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:07,380
that we can then be with what is in our life with a sense of spaciousness with

147
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:15,539
calm with with care Equanimity is is kind is it has warm-heartedness in it it

148
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:20,880
has care this caring presence without entanglement it doesn't fall

149
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:27,360
into and it doesn't push things away like oh I don't want to deal with this it's present it's just present in the

150
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,120
middle of everything so we played around with that image a bit to get a little bit of presence we

151
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:41,399
had a little bit of space and then walking down back to the village and and be in our lives and but relate from that

152
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:47,039
space so so

153
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,980
I'd like to invite us now to transition into the sense of

154
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:59,700
equanimity holding the sense of presence the sense of stable presence

155
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:06,899
um for ourselves and in relationship to others because it is a skill to of

156
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:14,039
course it's it's a cultivation to feel it for are in in our own heart in our own uh

157
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:21,120
bodies and then the rubber meets the road when we start to interact with others of course our families and

158
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,880
colleagues and friends it's a higher bar but you get the chance to explore uh now

159
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:33,659
in small groups for those who are on Zoom to explore in small groups to show up with the sense of equanime to

160
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:41,059
interact with other human beings which are stand-ins for for all of humanity which are standards

161
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:49,320
and and the um question the the inquiry for us to explore together is

162
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,419
um is in our bodies so is the physical explosion so when you

163
00:32:54,419 --> 00:32:59,580
have a sense of equanimity how does it feel in your body how does your body

164
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:06,240
feel and we'll we'll go around each person will say one one nugget and then the

165
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:12,600
next person the next person will come back to you and it'll be a spiral if it comes to you and you can also say I

166
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,940
don't know um I don't quite know right now I'm still exploring it that's perfectly fine

167
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:24,840
you can say pass in that way and then later say oh actually maybe I feel a sense of uprightness or maybe I feel

168
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,419
like my arms are wide open I want to embrace the whole world with a sense of

169
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:37,460
equanimity and my hands are in the fist anymore anyway they're they're my fingers are open or whatever

170
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:44,460
physicality you associate with Equanimity I think this can be such a powerful exploration

171
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:52,380
um and inspiring to to yourself and and to each other supporting each other in this very interesting exploration

172
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:59,340
so I'm going to create the zoom uh the breakout rooms they'll be roughly of size three and I

173
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:07,200
invite you to be kind to yourself kind to um each other of course and not asking

174
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:14,158
questions not directing it's just offering what what you have and if somebody says something and it's you're

175
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:21,240
confused it doesn't matter don't explore don't interrogate just let each person have their own experience in this way

176
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:30,118
being supportive okay all right the rooms are created yes oops all the numbers keep changing

177
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:36,300
here we go okay the rooms are created uh and let's go alphabetical order just for

178
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:43,020
the fun of it first name okay take care be kind and the rooms are open

179
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:49,200
now rooms will close in about 20 seconds so we'll wait until everybody's back

180
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,419
and in the meanwhile I will change the chat settings so that those who have

181
00:34:54,419 --> 00:35:01,619
uh come back to the main room if there's any Reflections you'd like to chat you like to type in chat you are welcome to

discoveries aha moments confusions how was how is it either the meditation

186
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:35,099
or the um exploration of the physicality of

187
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:41,400
equanimity what it feels like what did you discover and especially if you haven't spoken recently with happy hour

00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:48,000
we'd love to hear from you um if you have spoken pull back if you haven't pull forward for the benefit of

nav please now from Japan uh I'd love to share something that Fred

191
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:06,420
inspired which um which is an idea from a permaculture

192
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:12,420
uh thought leader called massanobu Fukuoka and he believes that the act of

193
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:18,119
farming is not to produce vegetables or or to grow anything it's really about

194
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,640
the cultivation of human beings so this idea of approaching any practice

195
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:30,060
with without the end in mind but rather falling in love with the practice

196

203
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:21,060

204

207
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:46,760
sharing that both in your small group and and big group it's just yeah yay

208
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:53,220
feeling you would call and and appreciating it thanks Nancy

209
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:59,040
um Claire I see your hand I also see a question from Gita let me get to this

210
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,859
one first um Nikki we shared about consolidating Equanimity with feeling safe do you have

211
00:38:04,859 --> 00:38:11,040
thoughts on this yes I have thoughts on everything um

212
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:21,240
um so um let's see so I would not consolidate

213
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:29,099
um Equanimity with feeling safe they're they're uniquely different they're related like a Venn diagram there is a

214
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:37,079
relationship but I would definitely not consolidate them together so so here's how and it's an important

215
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:45,359
distinction so I do want to take time to to tease this apart um so Equanimity and the practice of

216
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:51,780
equanimity um as an uprightness has a strength to it

217
00:38:51,780 --> 00:39:00,359
and has a sense of equipoise basically the classical definition of equanimity is is

218
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:08,040
um is equipoise with everything that arises and passes away okay

219
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:14,339
so is this feeling I mean it has to do with vedana the feeling tone actually with that teaching of pleasant

220
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:22,200
unpleasant and neutral so the idea is that the mind and heart is so still so calm that it doesn't fall into

221
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,540
what's Pleasant it doesn't want more of it it doesn't fall into greed I wanted I

222
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:33,839
wanted more of oh I want more and more and more and more and it doesn't push away what's unpleasant oh make that go

223
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:40,820
away I don't want it like ah so it's not aversive and it's not graspy that is

224
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:47,640
an important element of equanimity okay and safety doesn't quite approach that

225
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:53,700
safety has different qualities to it which are beautiful and important for us to give it to ourselves and give it to

226
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:59,339
others but it's not Equanimity so I would not consolidate them so I can say

227
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:06,920
more but maybe I'll just leave it at that hopefully that's clear enough Claire your head

228
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:16,200
I don't know if this will be helpful to anybody but I mentioned in my group that within the last 10 years or so in the

229
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:21,240
course of my spiritual actually longer spiritual journey I've adopted two

230
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:27,560
practices that I didn't do as a young person that have led me to real uh

231
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:34,140
true State I believe true states of equanimity one is cycling on a bike

232
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:42,480
because all you think about is the relationship of your body to the motion that's all you have no

233
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,560
other there's nothing going on in your head at all um and the other is dancing Tango

234
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:57,780
um and again it's all about being with your body beautiful so I I'm

235
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:05,160
loving this clear both of these practices that you talked about I love the practices you mentioned and and I

236
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:11,760
would I would add some Nuance to what you said because they're beautiful embodiment practices they're beautiful

237
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:16,859
embodiment practices for the mind to be really present right here not to think

238
00:41:16,859 --> 00:41:24,599
not to be entangled and that call that sense of presence can be a

239
00:41:24,599 --> 00:41:30,119
um a a ground for Equanimity to grow in but I wouldn't say that these are

240
00:41:30,119 --> 00:41:38,000
Equanimity practices so it's very important to make a distinction I was trying to figure out yeah

241
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,079
these are a great embodiment practices but not equanonymity practices but they

242
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:49,740
they create the ground for Equanimity but they're not Equanimity practices right thanks Claire the other thing I

243
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:55,320
just wanted to add for a benefit or a friend from Japan name I didn't hear is

244
00:41:55,320 --> 00:42:00,960
there's a wonderful book called chop wood carry water I don't know if you've ever read it

245
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:06,780
that's related to this yeah yeah chocolate carry water yeah yeah I love

246
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:13,800
that thing what do you do before Enlightenment shop would carry order what do you do after Enlightenment chop

247
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:22,220
would carry water so I'd love that thanks Claire thanks for bringing that in and Christine you get the last word

248
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:29,280
great thank you Nikki this is I got a lot out of the practice I uh just first

249
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:34,380
of all want to say thank you this has been in my groups it was uh a lot about

250
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:39,780
Equanimity and just right now it's like this for me you know and we're going through

251
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:47,040
the last six weeks I've had to wear a a brace on my legs so I haven't been able to straighten my leg and I'm back

252
