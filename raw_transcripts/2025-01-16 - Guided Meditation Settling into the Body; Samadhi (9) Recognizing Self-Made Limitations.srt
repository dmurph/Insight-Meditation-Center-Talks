00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:08,000
so hello and welcome and welcome to this series of

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,080
guided meditations related to

3
00:00:13,879 --> 00:00:23,599
samali and one of the very important aspects of samadi

4
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,960
meditation is that it's uh deeply

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:37,559
attuned deep ly connected to our subjective

6
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:42,680
experience and the contrast to that is

7
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:49,760
objectifying our experience or being with the objective

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:56,359
experience and but there's wisdom to both sides there's no not much wisdom to objectifying

9
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:03,920
exactly but we often when we suffer around ourselves or suffer even around

10
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:11,119
others there's a strong tendency to be caught up in

11
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,520
objectification seeing the objects so seeing objectifying ourselves

12
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:24,240
seeing oursel as an object of our ideas our

13
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,040
projections our fantasies our

14
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:37,439
thoughts about what the future will look like thoughts about the past and

15
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:46,079
building up all kinds of stories about the past and there's a removal a stepping

16
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:53,439
away from the sub the immediate subjective world and not subjective in the sense

17
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,479
that subjective because of our opinions our

18
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:05,039
preferences our likes and dislikes but some a much more deeply subjective

19
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:12,560
experience of being in the experience of our

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:21,440
body the embodiment to be sensing and feeling the

21
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:27,000
quality of our immediate subjective

22
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:35,200
experience and one of the things to notice is whether in our subjective

23
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:43,920
experience are we in fact viewing it through some idea some

24
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,280
concept some sense some idea of self of me

25
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:57,120
myself some idea of how I'm supposed to be some idea of what has happened to me

26
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,640
of course things happen to us but then we live live in the idea of that some

27
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,440
idea of what's supposed to happen in the future some idea of what meditation is

28
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:15,640
supposed to be like what we're supposed to experience what's supposed to happen and we're seeing the world

29
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:22,159
through the filter of these ideas the alternative

30
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:31,560
here is to feel to sense the immediacy of our of

31
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,519
the quality of our subjective experience is it does it

32
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:46,480
feel Pleasant or unpleasant does it feel whole or

33
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:53,319
partial are we focused on a very small piece of the

34
00:03:53,319 --> 00:04:01,720
whole and can we open up to feel more of the whole experience that's here and now

35
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:09,040
and oddly enough one of the ways to focus in a very partial

36
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:16,919
way is to identify ourselves with just a piece of the full Human Experience we

37
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:22,680
have to identify ourselves mostly through our body or through our Pleasure

38
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:30,720
and Pain or through the stories of our life or through the concepts and ideas

39
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:39,400
that we have inherited or made up even to think with we are

40
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:45,240
Consciousness limits the full subjective

41
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:52,360
experience so to sit with a quality of our inner

42
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:58,199
life subjectively so it's not an object to fix to

43
00:04:58,199 --> 00:05:06,919
manipulate to judge to comment about it's just something to feel and

44
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:16,320
sense so to assume a meditation

45
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,638
posture and to gently close your eyes

46
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:40,360
and to maybe tell yourself that all of who you think you

47
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:45,800
are all your past and your memories and your

48
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:52,360
judgments all the ways in which you see yourself through the conclusions your

49
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:58,000
thinking makes it's okay to put that

50
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,800
aside as you're going to to

51
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:12,960
meditate we are entering into a sacred World in

52
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:23,240
Samar the sacred world of our subjective experience here and now

53
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:32,240
in and of itself and now with your your eyes

54
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:40,080
closed allowing the present moment experience of body mind and heart to be

55
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:46,919
as it is feel the quality of

56
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:54,440
it does it feel good or not so good is it comforting or not

57
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:59,919
comforting is it settled or unsettled

58
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:06,160
you're allowed to be whatever way it is it's

59
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:13,879
okay is the inner life peaceful or is

60
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:20,639
it conflicted and putting away the ideas of

61
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:28,360
all that just to feel what it's like to be peaceful

62
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,240
within what what it's like to be conflicted

63
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:46,800
within and then to help you enter more deeply into this Temple of

64
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:53,919
samadi or at least into the entryway to gently

65
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,960
lightly easily take some deeper breaths

66
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:07,919
as you feel your body more fully as you

67
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,478
inhale imagine that you're entering your

68
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:28,759
body and with a longer exhale settling into your body

69
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:43,080
with a deeper inhale entering into your arms and hands

70
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:49,720
feeling them for what they are and as you

71
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:55,360
exhale softening relaxing the arms hands

72
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,360
fingers

73
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:18,079
as you breathe in easily

74
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:25,560
deeper enter into your legs and feet to feel the

75
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,360
sensations of life in your legs and feet

76
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:39,240
feel it on the inhale relax your legs and feet as you

77
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,240
exhale

78
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:12,200
maybe still breathing a little deeper than usual but easing up a a bit so it's more

79
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:23,399
easeful enter into your whole torso as you breathe in and settle as you exhale

80
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:48,240
and as you breathe in enter into your neck and your head

81
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:56,399
feeling the sensations there and as you

82
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,839
exhale soften in the neck in the

83
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:31,040
head and as you inhale

84
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,440
in some simplest way that's easy for

85
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:46,560
you feel your whole body or open up in a way that as if

86
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,160
you're going to feel the whole

87
00:11:54,440 --> 00:12:01,240
body and as you exhale to settle the whole body

88
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:22,480
settling into the settling Place Point within the grounding

89
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:31,160
point maybe at the end of the exhale deep inside from where the inhale

90
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:56,480
begins and perhaps as you breathe normally you can feel the

91
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:04,519
hum of of the body maybe a subtle sense of vibration

92
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:09,480
or flow or

93
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:19,720
tingling that's broader wider in your body than any single thing you can focus

94
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,720
on

95
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:34,160
as you breathe in breathe into that

96
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:43,440
hum as you exhale

97
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,680
release the body

98
00:14:00,519 --> 00:14:08,079
and as we continue now in the body breathing with the

99
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:15,240
body body with the breathing

100
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:19,560
notice when you lose

101
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,000
touch with the body more with the whole

102
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,360
body notice how your thought thinking being pulled

103
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:41,639
into thoughts ideas pulled into treating things as an

104
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:49,440
object separate you from something which feels more whole or

105
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,480
holistic in the body

106
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:08,000
and then if you can relax back into the

107
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:13,639
body here and now this subjective experience of your

108
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:19,079
inner life known through your

109
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
body

110
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

111
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

112
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

113
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

114
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

115
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
for for

116
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:27,240
notice inhale thinking might take you out of the body

117
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:34,400
away a pulling in back from the deep subjective

118
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:47,360
experience and that relaxing the thinking mind allows you to settle

119
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:57,360
in to the Simplicity of the body here

120
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
breathing

121
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

122
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

123
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

124
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,559
e for

125
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:56,039
the mind can rest more deeply if it's not thinking so

126
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,158
much and if the mind can

127
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:11,320
rest maybe you can settle and rest deep into your

128
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:16,640
body settling into the settling

129
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
point

130
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

131
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

132
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

133
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

134
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
e e

135
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:36,240
and as we come to the end of this

136
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:46,679
inning if you feel your way into the quality of your inner

137
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:53,240
life inner being how is it now coming to the end of

138
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,440
the sitting

139
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:07,399
and if you could relax into settle

140
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:11,480
into your body even

141
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:21,480
more what would you settle into what would you enter in your

142
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:31,960
body what deeper subjective experience or Fuller wider subjective

143
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:55,240
experience and if you have relaxed some of the

144
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,960
objectifications some of the preoccupations

145
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:10,480
some of the ways of being in the world when we're filled with desire and

146
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,398
aversion doubt and

147
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:25,039
fear imagine that you're able to be open and

148
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:29,759
kind open and friendly

149
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,000
open with good will for the people you

150
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:46,760
encounter and that staying deeply connected and in touch with

151
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:57,120
yourself allows you to remain kind and friendly

152
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,720
without being pulled into the world of

153
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:11,960
objectification and may we

154
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:23,360
Aspire for being available to the world with kindness with

155
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,480
friendliness with good will either seek secretly no one needs

156
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:34,679
to know or through the acts of our

157
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:38,080
body our

158
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:46,519
speech May the treasure we carry through the day be our good

159
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:53,240
will for others may we

160
00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:01,880
wish have well wishing that all all beings may be

161
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,519
happy may all beings be

162
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:12,480
safe may all beings be

163
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:18,679
peaceful may all beings be

164
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:25,440
free and may we stay close to these

165
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:31,200
wishes may we go through the day with a deep

166
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:42,600
subjective capacity for a warmhearted good will

00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:37,000
hindrances uh one of the purposes of those talks was to help you see in

173
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:45,200
yourself the ways in which you limit yourself through being caught in the

174
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:51,960
hindrances the hindrances involve some kind of thinking some kind of

175
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,519
projected Concepts ideas onto the world onto others onto ourselves

176
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:05,519
some kind of being caught in preoccupation and in doing so we in some

177
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:10,960
degree are lose touch with theirselves of course people might not

178
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,720
feel that or think that because they think they are their thinking they are

179
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,960
their aversion they are their desire and so there's no problem they're

180
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,279
really in touch with themselves they know exactly what they want they know exactly what they don't want they

181
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:33,720
are their fear and so you know that's

182
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:39,720
that's who I am but if we go deeper in we can feel how these hindrances being

183
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:48,519
caught in the thoughts and the ideas of Desire aversion fear doubt

184
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:57,159
regrets that all these are a kind of limited world we we uh narrow the focus

185
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:05,080
to those preoccupations and the important thing to understand as we go into samade is

186
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:12,398
that we become partial we become fragmented we become divided we become a limited part of a

187
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:20,200
whole of who we are and Somali is a process of becoming whole the classic

188
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:25,839
language of that is unification uh gathering together all

189
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:33,679
the parts of ourselves so they can be uh working and connected in a harmonious way

190
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,480
together and um so

191
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,280
um uh so today and tomorrow I want to talk a little bit about how the process

192
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:52,878
of identification uh does the same thing

193
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:58,320
and classically that that's the steps the Buddha takes um

194
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,200
this to develop to go into this deeper deeper quality of being he first talks

195
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:11,000
about overcoming the hindrances and when those have settled down enough then the next stage is

196
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,520
something even deeper that still involves some kind of Concepts ideas

197
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:23,560
projections some kind of um limiting ourselves but now it's uh deeper and

198
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:31,079
sometimes we don't even see it as a kind of thinking a concept and that is the ways in which we identify ourselves who

199
00:35:31,079 --> 00:35:36,920
we are and there are different ways that we

200
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:42,720
establish this is who I am at least in the moment that uh we kind of have a we

201
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,520
in doing so we limit ourselves we Short change ourselves we're not available to

202
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:56,160
the whole and fullness of who we are so you know this morning I brushed my

203
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:02,040
teeth and um and if I had thought wow Gil you

204
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:07,119
are like really skilled at brushing your teeth you're like a really

205
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:13,240
good uh tooth brusher and uh maybe the world has never seen someone so good at

206
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:20,920
brushing teeth and and I just really know how to zero in on the different teeth get them really clean boy am I a

207
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:28,160
good and I'm you know this is so important that I'm going to have to come down to IMC this morning and

208
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:35,280
really let all the people on YouTube know like this is like that's really it's an essential element of who I am a

209
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:42,000
tooth pressure and how good I am in it and you really need to see that and understand that so you appreciate who I

210
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:49,599
am and to affirm and confirm my very being as a toothbrush her well it's

211
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:56,040
ridiculous and I apologize to talk in such a silly way but it it's intentional

212
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:02,359
to be focused on this simple identity of being a toothbrush her um I kind of lose

213
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:08,720
touch with a lot of things I lose touch with u maybe all of you I lose touch

214
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,160
with a sense of the world and the wider sense of who I am I lose touch with the

215
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,319
fact that at this moment I'm not brushing my teeth and I have more

216
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:24,760
important things to do at this moment to sit here with you and try to share the

217
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,480
Dharma and um and to share it no way that I feel connected to myself to my

218
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,640
body to the very sensibility inside the quality of inner life that I've learned

219
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:42,720
through Dharma practice and so that can be that in many

220
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:50,440
ways some people get very identified with their physical appearance and that becomes their way

221
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:55,839
they limit themselves of who they are and of course if you ask them and say are you your

222
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,520
here they don't really say no of course not but functionally people can be

223
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:07,480
that's that's how they Define themselves as they their sense of well-being and how they want to be seen by others can

224
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:15,359
be through a physical appearance some people identify themselves very much by their comfort

225
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:23,400
how pleasant and unpleasant how comfortable and uncomfortable things are and it's a crime against humanity to be

226
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:30,440
uncomfortable and we have to fix it because that's who we are some people very strongly identify with

227
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:38,079
their values their ideas their Concepts that they their judgments that they

228
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:45,440
have and uh some people identify with their stories and um their fantasies of the

229
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,040
future their stories of the past and some people identify with this kind of

230
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:57,240
quality of just enness or this quality of Consciousness or cognition the one

231
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:04,480
who who knows and in the early Buddhist tradition each of those ways of

232
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:09,599
identifying yourself has the risk of sacrificing the

233
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:17,040
whole and uh it's not necessary to be locked in and be defined only by this

234
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:23,400
way and then live through that way and well you I don't have I don't

235
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,520
want to convince you this way the reason to to talk about this is the degree to

236
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:37,480
which you understand it um the um um the idea is to learn to

237
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:45,520
see and recognize in yourself how you're living in a truncated way how you're by being

238
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:50,760
preoccupied or caught in some identity then now you're left out a lot

239
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:57,720
of who you are and uh and that's the discovery process that prepares us for Sadi

240
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:03,720
to realize the limitations we put ourselves under because if we try to develop some

241
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:09,119
body while we're in those limitations of uh the way of identifying

242
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:17,720
ourselves in a certain way we actually uh stand in the way of samadi so for

243
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:25,160
example if we identify ourselves as a poor meditator that just even if there's

244
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:30,760
might be some truth to that in some kind of way doesn't matter if we identify

245
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:36,680
ourselves that way and stay living that identity hold it on like a badge or hold it on like a

246
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:44,160
coat then we're limiting ourselves from this moment the fullness of now we don't

247
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:49,720
need to live through the lens of being a bad meditator or a good meditator we

248
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:55,920
don't need to live Moment by moment all the time through the lens of being a

249
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:03,280
victim or being someone who's ill or someone who has certain challenges we want to respect everything

250
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,599
about ourselves everything so it's not like pushing any of this

251
00:41:08,599 --> 00:41:15,079
away but the gift of somebody is to learn that we don't have

252
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:22,079
to limit ourselves by any of this and so the task for today is not to break free

253
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,839
of that not to be different than who you are but can you begin dealing your

254
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:33,160
subjective experience in such a way that you can see that you're living in a

255
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:40,079
partial view a partial view of your direct experience partial view of yourself in

256
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:46,960
your direct experience that you're prioritizing certain things over other things that you think some things are

257
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:53,079
more important and of course in the moment there are things that are more important

258
00:41:53,079 --> 00:42:00,079
than other things and so to be fluid and move between that of course that's the way to

259
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:06,240
go and uh but to not carry something with us and keep ourselves limited and

260
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,880
boxed in to one different mode the Buddha when if he he had an

261
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:19,240
orientation to identify people by what they're doing in the

262
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:24,880
moment and that's enough I'll end with a short sense

263
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,280
story there were two uh Buddhist practitioners who are

264
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:37,119
talking about the respective meditation teachers and um so the first one talks

265
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,960
about all the Miracles that their teacher could do they could fly through the air walk on

266
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:50,319
water see through walls through all kinds of kind of disappear reappear in

267
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:57,880
different places all kinds of amazing things Supernatural things

268
00:42:57,880 --> 00:43:04,079
and then the other one who's a Zen student the other the first one was not a Zen student some other form of

269
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:10,880
Buddhism but the Zen student said oh well my

270
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:17,280
master when she walks she just

271
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:29,119
walks when she eats she just eats when she cleans she just cleans

272
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:35,559
and the first one said oh you have a great

273
00:43:35,559 --> 00:43:42,760
Master oh and bow down deeply this idea of just being what

274
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,640
you're doing and enter into that with your whole

275
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:54,960
being that is how you can be identify yourself in the moment and if you're

276
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,359
sweeping you're the sweeper be that fully with a wholeness of who you are

277
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:07,319
not to limit Yourself by past future ideas so that when I'm sitting here with

278
00:44:07,319 --> 00:44:13,440
you giving a Dharma talk let me be here fully for this

279
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:21,520
unconcerned in this moment what a great toothbrush her I am that would limit it

280
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:29,040
that was not relevant in this moment so may you

281
00:44:32,119 --> 00:44:38,880
not limit yourself and if you do great that that's what you want that's what

282
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:46,359
you want to see happen because the task for the next 24 hours is to become an

283
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:53,079
expert really skilled really attuned to noticing what it's like to be limiting

284
00:44:53,079 --> 00:44:58,240
yourself to the objectification to the partiality to particular

285
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:06,520
preoccupation which doesn't allow you to be fully here for what you're doing uh learning that don't don't

286
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:11,680
overlook that don't feel like you have to be anywhere else don't feel like you have to be

287
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:17,800
whole the task here is to understand how you limit yourself how you limit

288
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:24,440
yourself maybe with identity so thank you very much and uh

289
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,920
continue tomorrow
