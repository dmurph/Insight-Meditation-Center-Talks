1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,600
okay uh welcome uh welcome

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:14,719
all um yeah nice to see your

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,400
names so

4
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,680
uh see if I have any inspiring words to say before

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:38,000
sitting I do not but I'm happy to uh to practice with

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:45,680
you so uh yeah find uh find your posture

7
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,640
just over time the months and years maybe decades

8
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:40,520
just coming into Stillness has so many connotations kind of muscle

9
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,079
memory the muscle memory of uh Dharma practice

10
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,879
maybe we touch into some of the

11
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,400
tranquility open-heartedness

12
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:47,280
the ways in which um our practice is a kind of

13
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,159
recollection of uh that which we've always

14
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,840
loved e

15
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:54,480
we relax whatever can be

16
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:03,599
relaxed and whatever tension remains we allow to

17
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,720
remain e

18
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:31,639
the sense of self is the kind of locust uh

19
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:40,639
headquarters uh for controlling samsara controlling this

20
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:53,960
realm and

21
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:03,520
surrender there's this gesture of uh um the self laying

22
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:19,039
down always trying to uh grip experience and then

23
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,199
we

24
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
release

25
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
e

26
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,520
e e

27
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:31,440
the Machinery of thinking and feeling it's kind of the the uh

28
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:40,320
tools we use to orchestrate are

29
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:57,839
clinging our feeling system sounding the alarms

30
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:05,720
and our uh words mental

31
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:12,560
images visual thinking and auditory thinking

32
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,800
orchestrate the control

33
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:38,639
and so in practice we become

34
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:45,120
aware these Dynamics

35
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:54,839
emotion in our body mental images words

36
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:15,800
we feel our feelings we see our visual thoughts image of your

37
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:22,720
body or scenes or memory image of

38
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:32,319
me and we hear our auditory thoughts e

39
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:13,800
rather than using or thinking to control some

40
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,360
Sor we become awake to

41
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:28,240
it and practice laying down

42
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
surrender

43
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

44
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160

e e

49
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:10,720
we're moving from a life of acquisition and

50
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:18,480
control to the intention simply to be

51
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:30,959
awake ordinarily Moment by moment we're forming

52
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,160
the kind of ground for Action

53
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,040
formulating strategy even if it's very

54
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:57,680
subtle drawing up our war plans for samsara

55
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,480
practice

56
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:31,720
surrendering wa don't

57
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:39,519
uh need any plans the ground the

58
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:46,680
headquarters headquarters of uh strategy

59
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:18,000
and our knowing doesn't have to know much at

60
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:30,559
all doesn't have to be quietly nursing some secret agenda of

61
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:36,559
control acquisition we lay

62
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
down

63
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760

e e

73
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:38,039
in a sense we're just noticing the

74
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,880
contraction of

75
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:53,880
self the ways in which um sense of uh

76
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:02,480
control is experience as a um as

77
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,520
tension as a

78
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:24,880
weight we keep relaxing renouncing

79
00:24:28,679 --> 00:24:36,120
equinom ising the sense

80
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:39,559
of

81
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:47,278
uncertainty that sponsors the attempt to

82
00:24:50,279 --> 00:24:54,720
control we habituate to

83
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320

[Music] e

92
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:59,880
okay good to uh practice with you um

93
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:10,120
let us continue my fake list

94
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:16,240
um Leonard uh Leonard Cohen towards the end of his life kind of

95
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:25,519
uh reflecting on his uh suffering well-being was asked if he you know um

96
00:30:25,519 --> 00:30:34,440
if he still uh still suffered the way he used to and he said uh no

97
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:42,120
and uh then added you know it's not so much I got what I was looking for but

98
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:51,559
the search itself dissolved so yesterday was uh

99
00:30:51,559 --> 00:30:58,760
awe and today uh surrender and that's a word that's not

100
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:04,880
not used so much in in our um

101
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:10,919
tradition uh Associated more with the monotheistic

102
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:20,240
tradition um love this from from uh St Augustine um we are but a particle of

103
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,960
thy creation thou a wakest us to Delight in thee praise for Thou made us for

104
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:32,440
thyself and our heart is restless until I Repose

105
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:41,720
until it Repose in thee hide not the face from me let me die lest I die only

106
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:48,639
let me see thy face my soul is like a house small for

107
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:54,440
you to enter but I pray you to enlarge it it is in

108
00:31:54,440 --> 00:32:01,519
Ruins but I ask you to remake it it contains so much that you will not be

109
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:08,120
pleased to see this I know and do not

110
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:13,240
hide but who is to rid it of these

111
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:19,158
things there is no one but

112
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,840
you I I've always found that uh moving since I

113
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:32,000
read read that uh in college many years

114
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:38,399
ago and I was probably averse to it uh then

115
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:45,639
in some ways and now kind of recognize something about

116
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:51,399
it and we in Dharma we don't exactly

117
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:58,559
surrender we're not surrendering to God exactly but um you you might say

118
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:06,760
we're surrendering to the moment surrendering to love surrendering to not

119
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:13,679
self surrendering to uh to the

120
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:21,320
path so on the one hand in practice we're encouraged to be independent to

121
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:27,799
verify aaso see you know ex explore for oneself

122
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:33,559
to verify the teachings directly right the you know

123
00:33:33,559 --> 00:33:38,919
popularize kalas you know of um when you

124
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:45,600
know for yourselves these this is skillful then you should enter and

125
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,399
remain in that right

126
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:59,080
um so there's a measure of Independence in that and of course surrender is um

127
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:04,440
can be dangerous many of us in one way or another at some point have

128
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:10,878
surrendered to bad ideas or bad people or bad

129
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:18,118
habits but the surrender of which um I'm speaking

130
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:25,599
um ah so much of the goodness of the path requires a measure of

131
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:32,800
surrender and maybe we can say in the Dharma our our

132
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,919
power comes from a kind of surrender we're

133
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:44,158
not surrendering to someone not exactly surrendering to the Buddha or something

134
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,520
like this but we are surrendering to the moment and trusting

135
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:59,240
that it will shape our heart well you know

136
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:08,680
that that's not um that doesn't come naturally to us the Dharma practice about trusting

137
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:16,520
that all phenomena can nurture Freedom no no

138
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:21,440
phenomena discriminate against

139
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:31,200
freedom and when the the kind of confinement of this self melts

140
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:40,520
and the all the agendas of control uh all facts are friendly to again quote

141
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:49,240
Carl Rogers the will to um Power the urge to

142
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:55,839
possess to dominate to control that cannot take us deep into the Dharma

143
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:02,000
practice can stay kind of like uh um kind

144
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:07,319
of autant of the ego or sort of like a

145
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:12,359
you know a tool of our control but something there's a kind of phase shift

146
00:36:12,359 --> 00:36:19,480
in practice whereby we um start letting

147
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:25,640
go we offer ourselves up meditation is no longer a kind of instrument of our

148
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:33,520
controlling tendencies that sense of self is just like is the Locust of

149
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:41,280
control and for me you know willfulness seems to to

150
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:48,640
draw its energy from something very young feels like very deep in my biology

151
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,000
feels like a kind of white hot core of very

152
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,160
Primal anger maybe anger is too much but it to say

153
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,400
it's like doing this will not be

154
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:13,640
stopped will hold control the sense of self almost

155
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:19,560
constellates as the Locust of control that's what I was pointing to in the sit

156
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:26,520
the way in which we're always like cobbling together the ground of our

157
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,599
headquarters and a lot of the ground that we make that sense of peering out

158
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:41,280
on experience from headquarters is is about controlling

159
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:49,560
experience and the doing this of the self begins to surrender amidst you know

160
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,800
begins to to rest amid

161
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:02,400
surrender and so we we don't like this process but we want

162
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,400
to look to examine you know like what does our practice look like on the other

163
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:17,480
side of our willfulness and we don't like

164
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:23,160
it but uh the most transformative practice often

165
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:29,440
unfolds when the ego is all out of mood

166
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:39,160
that's um when we really discover the necessity of

167
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:46,359
love we surrender in some ways at the beginning of our path to

168
00:38:46,359 --> 00:38:53,000
acknowledge I don't really know how to live you know which we're too ashamed to

169
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:00,280
say explicitly maybe even to ourselves but love look if

170
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:05,920
you're sitting you know if you're if you're on

171
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:12,599
this PA this path is not plan a sitting with Matthew Bren silver 7

172
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:18,640
a.m. Pacific Time listening to him ramble about suffering that's not plan a

173
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:23,400
none of you dreamed of that as a

174
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:28,119
child I didn't either

175
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:37,160
but here we are don't quite know how to

176
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:42,280
live that's the intensity of this

177
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:50,440
realm and uh to be present is to

178
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:57,760
surrender to stop trying to predict and govern the future that's

179
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,400
surrender mindfulness is a kind of surrender we don't emphasize it so much

180
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:09,440
we emphasize generally the active attentional marshalling of the spotlight

181
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,400
and that's that's that's one dimension of it but then the receptivity and the

182
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:22,119
openness is the self laying down and we

183
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:27,160
often want to do something to the moment

184
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:33,079
right rather than be changed by

185
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:40,000
experience and a lot of this path is about just like the trust I want to be

186
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,760
changed by This Moment by this

187
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:54,400
breath until to um to stop fidgeting with Sam Sara to

188
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:01,680
let go of ownership and acquisition and control this entails a measure of

189
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,520
some of of surrender to uh you know to forgive the

190
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:13,079
imperfection of this realm we have to surrender at least in

191
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:19,960
some moments in order to relinquish the kind

192
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:26,440
of um stories that no longer serve us the Frameworks that have animated our

193
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:31,160
life we have to surrender to not

194
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:38,560
knowing the need to to know to always be

195
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,720
oriented to always keep tabs

196
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:50,800
on self and other like and dislike past and

197
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:59,160
future the the need to know is suffused with volitional Energies

198
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:04,560
urgencies and motives intentions

199
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:12,160
control and everything looks different when the volitional energies dissolve

200
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:19,400
and surrender is the dissolution of volitional

201
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:27,400
energy surrenders the dissolution of of volitional energy

202
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,760
and that's not resignation there's a lot of dignity in

203
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,800
that many people on this path describe the sense of self Getting

204
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:48,359
Thinner and they're as they're thinning out um

205
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:53,559
getting deeper quieter they're sort of jerked back into the

206
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:58,640
self by their kind of oldest habit you

207
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,760
know maybe fear and we're practicing surrendering

208
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:11,319
to groundlessness and trusting that uh the Stillness is Refuge

209
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:20,160
that's protection enough the heart is maybe we say protected by

210
00:43:20,599 --> 00:43:27,280
Dharma even when we're disoriented or lack the ordinary reference points of I

211
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,079
Me Mine ownership and

212
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,160
acquisition when the cultivation of somat that Gil's been speaking to

213
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:43,400
there's effort involved but often less than we imagine and at some point the

214
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:50,200
effort is just more agitation we actually have to surrender the you know

215
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:59,800
the disolution of volitional energies of control at the kind of gate way of of um

216
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:06,200
you know of uh Sade of johana meditative

217
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:13,680
absorption that that uh that gate is patrolled by willfulness you

218
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:21,119
know and we actually have to let down trust that the

219
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:29,040
silence will not harm you trust that it's safe to fall into the present

220
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:36,960
and insight this is Insight Meditation which is discovering a radically new way

221
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:43,440
of perceiving the world that requires surrendering the known surrendering the

222
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:51,000
known relinquishing the control

223
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:57,760
and yet this path is about cultivating our power

224
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:03,920
it's about cultivating our power a lot of what we do on this path is cultivate something like

225
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:12,839
power but it's uh in surrender that we find our true

226
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:20,680
power so offer this for your uh consideration and um yeah I wish you all

227
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:27,119
a good day and uh we'll be back uh tomorrow

228
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:32,119
okay you uh you take a care
