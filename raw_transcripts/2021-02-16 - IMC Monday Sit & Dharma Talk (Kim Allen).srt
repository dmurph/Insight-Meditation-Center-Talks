1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:04,960
okay so we'll go ahead and get started

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:12,559
my name is kim allen and i've been teaching at imc for a while diana

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:21,520
is teaching a retreat this evening at insight retreat center so i'll be stepping in for her

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:31,359
so why don't we go ahead and begin as usual with a guided meditation so

5
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:40,800
allowing yourself to settle in to have a sense of arriving

6
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:50,640
maybe taking a long slow deep breath just allowing the body and mind to

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:59,840
settle on the out breath

8
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,960
if you're comfortable doing so you can close your eyes

9
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,399
just gently feeling the body in the sitting posture

10
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:27,840
upright and also relaxed

11
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:36,479
so we allow the attention to come inward

12
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,240
you can begin to connect in with the body

13
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:55,280
inviting ease through the body

14
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,398
so softening the muscles of the face around the eyes around the mouth

15
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,319
relaxing the eyes and the eye sockets

16
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,640
releasing any tension in the jaw

17
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,840
down through the neck

18
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,519
letting the shoulders gently drop

19
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,840
relax soften

20
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:05,840
down into the chest area the belly

21
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:13,439
letting the belly be round soft

22
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,840
all these places where we tend to hold tension

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,560
letting go of any bracing in the legs

24
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:47,840
and extending awareness all the way into the hands and the feet

25
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,840
inviting softness and ease through the body

26
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:20,560
and then similarly we can invite ease in the mind

27
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:29,840
so we bring in a gentle awareness mindfulness of our experience

28
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,840
in a very simple way

29
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:49,199
even if parts of the body or the mind are not at ease we can be at ease with that

30
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:57,840
offering simple attention

31
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,360
often we will notice that there are thoughts in the mind

32
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,638
thinking going on

33
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:42,000
it can be so easy to wish that the thinking weren't there or

34
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:48,000
to feel somehow that the thinking is getting in the way

35
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,840
of meditation

36
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:07,840
if only my mind weren't thinking then i could have a peaceful sitting

37
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:28,160
but this very wishing for it not to be there as a way of also being agitating for the

38
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,639
mind

39
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:39,360
so perhaps beginning this sit with the idea that thinking is not the

40
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,840
enemy

41
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:49,840
actually thinking is very normal

42
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:03,840
that's what minds do

43
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:24,400
so perhaps seeing the thinking as a natural process when we notice it

44
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,319
ah there it is again

45
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:44,160
gently letting go and knowing knowing the thought

46
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:48,160
it's enough to be mindful that there is

47
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
thinking

48
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:13,840
even a simple thought like thinking is what minds do or thinking is natural

49
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:27,840
it's a thought but it's a beneficial one

50
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:40,959
actually not all thought is unskillful

51
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:55,839
so continuing to rest the mind and the body the breath

52
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:09,839
i'm seeing any thought that arises simply as natural

53
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:21,839
it may be that simply having this less aversive

54
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:33,839
view of thought already reduces its intensity

55
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,399
even when the mind gets caught up as soon as we realize that

56
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,839
just recognizing that thought is normal

57
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:12,839
perhaps adding a good thought about the fact that we're sitting here

58
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:20,880
meditating i'm returning to the breath of the body

59
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,600
no sense of diminishment of our meditation

60
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:57,839
sitting with the normal flow of mind and body is meditation

61
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,920
you

62
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:24,480
as our connection to the breath and the body

63
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:31,839
becomes even a little bit more continuous as we sit

64
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:40,399
it may become possible to breathe through any thoughts

65
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:45,839
that arise in the mind

66
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,480
we sense the feelings of the breath

67
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,839
even while the thought is there

68
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:13,839
like wind blowing through a cloth that's out on a line drying

69
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:27,839
thought is there and the breath just passes through it in and out

70
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:48,880
another way of seeing it is to imagine the breath or the body in the foreground

71
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,720
and any thoughts other such movements of mind to be in

72
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,600
the background

73
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:09,839
still somewhat there but just in the background

74
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:26,240
just gently favoring the present moment experience

75
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:30,959
letting the thoughts ripple in the

76
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:37,839
background

77
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:36,400
from time to time checking in again with the body

78
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:41,520
softening any tension that may have built up

79
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:51,120
allowing the breath to flow throughout the body

80
00:20:51,679 --> 00:21:03,840
and even through the thoughts that arise

81
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:31,840
imagining that we could relax the thinking muscle

82
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:19,840
and in the last five minutes of our meditation together

83
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:29,979
i will offer a reflection [Music]

84
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:38,799
question the aim is not to think about it

85
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,900
but more like when we drop a stone down into a well

86
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:53,919
[Music] a sound will come back

87
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:06,159
and we just let that ripple through the body the heart the mind

88
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:15,840
and then go back to the silence

89
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,799
so i'll ask the question [Music] and you just see what comes back listen

90
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:43,840
to it but let it pass by and then i will ask the question again

91
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:57,840
what about the dharma touches my heart

92
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:20,559
what about the dharma

93
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:25,840
touches my heart

94
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:09,440
perhaps the answer was simple perhaps it was different first

95
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:16,480
and second time perhaps it had no words and was just a

96
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:21,840
feeling or a body sensation

97
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,880
these reflections are a skillful use of the

98
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:49,840
thinking mind the mind with language

99
00:27:53,679 --> 00:28:00,879
once more what about the dharma

100
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:17,840
touches my heart

101
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:40,080
so a warm welcome to everyone here

102
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:48,240
as i mentioned earlier diana is away for the evening teaching on retreat so i'm

103
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:54,399
happy to be here with you this evening my name is kim allen

104
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:01,360
i want to talk tonight about thought perhaps in a different way

105
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:08,640
though then you may have heard we definitely use thought all the time

106
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,320
in daily life but it's also easy in meditation

107
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:21,840
to see that thought is usually what distracts us in some way we lose our mindfulness

108
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:28,240
because we start thinking so then it's easy some people conclude

109
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:36,000
from this that thinking is always bad or that the aim of meditation is somehow

110
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:43,440
to eliminate thinking thinking wine can only be a hindrance

111
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:51,520
but actually that idea is not in line with the buddhist teachings

112
00:30:51,520 --> 00:31:00,399
the buddha had a more nuanced view of thought and its role in the normal functioning

113
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:06,399
as well as in the awakening of the mind there's a place for thought on the path

114
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:11,919
of development so he identified which kinds of thought

115
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:17,200
are actually unskillful and unhelpful and he also talked about kinds of

116
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,960
thought that are helpful that are skillful some of them might even be necessary

117
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:30,320
along the path of liberation so i will talk somewhat about

118
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:36,960
unskillful thought because it's something that we're very familiar with and it's an important

119
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,840
thing to to have some sense of how to work with but i want to leave plenty of room

120
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,480
to talk about the helpful kinds of thought and conceptuality that we can do

121
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:56,720
because we don't get to hear about those quite as much and there are a number of them described

122
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:04,399
in the buddhist teachings now in the end what you may have heard

123
00:32:04,399 --> 00:32:10,640
from teachers is correct in that the ordinary thinking and conceptualizing mind

124
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,960
is a hindrance to freedom at some point and it will be let go

125
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:23,919
maybe we'll even develop some alternatives to it along the path but nonetheless even concepts and

126
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,519
thinking have a function along our path of meditation and in

127
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:34,960
daily life i think we're going to need our whole mind to awaken

128
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:42,000
and so that would include thought so let's look more carefully at what is useful in the thinking mind

129
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:49,840
and what is not so starting with

130
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:56,720
how we often experience our mind at least at the beginning of our spiritual development and often for

131
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,840
many people at the beginning of a sit all along the path what we experience is a lot of

132
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:10,720
discursive what's called discursive or obsessive excessive thought where the mind is

133
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,440
going over conversations it's making plans it's worrying about what that person might have meant by

134
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:24,000
what they did yesterday we're sort of caught up in that and it usually comes with a lot of

135
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,039
largely unseen views about the world and about ourselves

136
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:35,519
and all of that and a lot of this thought is kind of running along habitual patterns

137
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:41,519
most of this kind of thought is not especially original and we've probably thought it before

138
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:49,200
and if we look more carefully we can see that a lot of it is about myself and is essentially

139
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:56,880
based somehow in wanting or not wanting or not being very clear so this kind of

140
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:06,320
unhelpful thought which i'm just going to call discursive thinking this is the kind that is um

141
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:12,398
at the beginning of a sit shall we say and it kind of dominates our mental experience and so because of this

142
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:19,760
thinking it's a bad rap it just sort of gets a blanket statement of ah this is not useful let it go

143
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,440
try not to think try to get concentrated and not do that

144
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,040
but with that kind of attitude if we have that idea that all thought is

145
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:38,320
like that we set up a lot of aversion in the mind and this can actually just further entrench our

146
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,720
tendency to think right as soon as we say you know don't think of a purple elephant that's all you're going to think about right so

147
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:51,280
if you say don't think or stop all those conversations in the mind and get concentrated

148
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,400
there's a way in which that's not an effective approach yes so it's unfortunate because some people

149
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:04,480
can get caught in this aversive dynamic of hating their thoughts for a long time

150
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:11,599
and but if we look at the early buddhist texts there's a more nuanced understanding of

151
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:17,440
the thinking mind thinking as i as i said in the guided meditation thinking is what minds do

152
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,599
it's a normal function of the mind so this kind of normal ordinary thought

153
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:29,040
that we have sort of top of mind can be skillful

154
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,640
or unskillful it can actually be either one of those so i would say that maybe the initial

155
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:40,720
task of practice is that if we have a lot of the discursive kind of thought is that we somehow have to

156
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,599
reduce that and enhance the skillful part uh which is no form of right effort

157
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,800
essentially so instead of thinking in terms of let's get rid of all the thought or let's

158
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,839
quiet all that down how about if we try to change the balance so that more of the thought was skillful

159
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:04,960
and less of it was unskillful that's often a good way to start so we

160
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:12,800
can start to explore this different kinds of thinking by distinguishing

161
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:19,760
the content of the thought from its qualities let's say so the content

162
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:26,480
is what we're thinking about it's about our friend or that thing that happened yesterday or

163
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:33,200
the problem we have with our work that's the content of the thought but then the qualities have to do more

164
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:39,280
with the energy behind the thought how intense it is uh the manner of the thought what's the

165
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:44,320
tone of it and the experience of that thinking you know how are we relating to it in some

166
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:50,880
way so the kinds of thought that are hindering our spiritual practice the ones that i

167
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,720
mentioned earlier they have a certain set of qualities that we can identify

168
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,040
um most obviously they're disconnected from present moment awareness discursive

169
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:08,480
thought is about then and there it's not really about here and now

170
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,560
so they feel kind of distant or vague they're yeah they're not connected

171
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,880
secondly they tend to be sticky they they catch the mind and draw it in that's why we get

172
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:28,160
sucked into this kind of discursive thought again and again it has a hook somehow a stickiness to it and then

173
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:33,599
thirdly the energy of it is usually somewhat driven you know there's a feeling of i've got

174
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:40,160
to play this out you know i have to play out this conversation i have to think through this problem i have to

175
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,680
devise some idea about this i have to figure out why this view is correct

176
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:50,880
there's a sense of um yeah of drivenness to it so that's also

177
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:56,320
useful to know so all of this adds up to seeing oh when

178
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:02,400
we see the qualities of this unskillful thought it becomes clear why we get drawn into it so easily it has a lot of

179
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,960
qualities that are going to pull the mind away from a more subtle experience like the breath or the body

180
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:14,000
so we can understand that yeah it's going to be hard to turn away from discursive thought

181
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:21,280
so you can not maybe not blame yourself for that so much so instead of trying to get rid of this

182
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:28,240
kind of thought i like to talk about reducing the intensity of discursive thought as kind of our

183
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:34,560
first task in practice if you will there are a lot a lot a lot of methods for this

184
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:40,880
in the in the buddhist teachings it's clear that this has been an issue for people for a long time

185
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:48,480
so again you're not alone if this is something that you experience so it's not a focus of this talk they'll

186
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:54,079
talk about a lot of methods for working with discursive thought that

187
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:00,320
could be a whole talk in and of itself but i'll name a few of them since it's good to be reminded

188
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:07,440
so they include first and foremost breath and body awareness and that's why we talk about that so

189
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,440
much that's why those are the first instructions i found this to be these to be the best

190
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:19,200
remedies for discursive thought in fact the buddha says a meditator

191
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:26,560
should cultivate mindfulness of breathing for cutting off distracting thoughts that's a quote right from a suta so the

192
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:32,000
buddha was talking about this quite directly to his disciples

193
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:37,599
so breath and body are are a good choice because they're always

194
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,920
in the present moment they immediately take away that quality of discursive thought that is

195
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:50,400
not in the present moment that vagueness that it has but also really um there are other ways

196
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:56,240
that we can reduce the intensity so for example we can use our thinking mind for something

197
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:01,680
else we can start directing the energy into thoughts that are about the present moment and

198
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,480
this is the point of noting practice so you may have heard of noting practice where sometimes as we sit

199
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,599
we gently name or label the experiences that we're having

200
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:20,960
oh experience of sadness and experience of pressure experience of heat experience of

201
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,640
joy just noting as we go along a little you know simple word that goes

202
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:31,920
with what we're experiencing and that redirects some of the energy that could have gone into

203
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,680
unskillful thought it directs it into thought that's about the present moment it's that

204
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:44,079
simple so it reduces the intensity of that other kind of thought uh techniques like counting the breath

205
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:49,119
are the the same thing we're using our our thinking mind to be thinking about

206
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,560
the present moment and then um you know once we've gained a

207
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:00,400
little bit of traction we can actually turn mindfulness toward the thinking process itself

208
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:08,720
this is another good way to continue reducing the intensity of discursive thought so we can kind of turn the good part of

209
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:14,240
of our analytical mind against the part that's trying to pull us away so we can

210
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,400
actually gain some insight about thought by looking in this way we start to for example discern those three

211
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,520
qualities that i talked about earlier the uh the nebulousness the stickiness

212
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:32,480
and the drivenness of unskillful thought all of that can come about as we start

213
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:36,640
to be able to see thinking with mindfulness

214
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:43,520
so this means we can start to answer questions like how do i know if a given thought that's

215
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:49,280
coming in is one of these discursive or obsessive thoughts that's not useful or

216
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:54,400
or if it's something that would be okay you know more more beneficial to have and

217
00:41:54,400 --> 00:42:00,319
we can see quite clearly that generally discursive thought just is

218
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:05,359
directed toward itself it generates more and more dispersion and it doesn't ever resolve

219
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:11,040
doesn't quite resolve meaningfully whereas in contrast thoughts that are more skillful it's

220
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,359
very easy still to be aware of the body it's pretty easy to breathe through them like i talked about in them

221
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:23,680
in the guided meditation so there are qualities that we can discern immediately as a thought starts to arise

222
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:30,000
as to whether or not it's going to be a discursive one and we should be very careful or if it's a somewhat more skillful

223
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:37,040
thought and we'll talk in a moment more about what kinds of skillful thoughts there are that can arise

224
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:42,640
so we can start to have just a little bit of wisdom about our thinking we could start to have more

225
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,920
distinction about what kinds of thoughts there are and know that some are useful and some

226
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,599
are not so i would say that the sort of initial part of dharma practice

227
00:42:53,599 --> 00:43:00,640
and maybe the initial part of the sit for many people is to start using our analytical mind

228
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:07,599
skillfully in order to reduce the impact of this uh discursive kind of thought that's

229
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:13,839
that's vague that's sticky and that's driven

230
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,280
but actually we can go one step further and we can start looking at

231
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:26,000
uh certain kinds of cognition that are actually praised in sutas this is sometimes a revelation for

232
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:31,520
people to realize that they there are kinds of thoughts that are worthy of developing in their own right

233
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:37,839
so i want to focus now because i think it's rare that i it's spoken well up in dharma talks that

234
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:43,599
thought has spoken well of so let's let's talk a little bit about skillful thought

235
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:50,880
thoughts that actually help cultivate the mind so the buddha praised learning

236
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:58,160
quite highly in the sutures learning is offered as one of five

237
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,800
highly meritorious qualities that we can have that are said to be a form of inner

238
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:11,520
wealth in one suta in another suta it said that these are qualities that

239
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:18,160
fortify the mind so they literally strengthen it or build it up

240
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:27,359
somehow so here's the five faith or confidence virtue

241
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,920
learning generosity and wisdom it's an interesting list

242
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:39,760
isn't it so we have four qualities that are maybe more

243
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:47,920
common you've heard them in other lists faith virtue or ethical conduct generosity

244
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:54,640
and wisdom these are qualities that are named all over the texts and we might aspire to be developing those

245
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:03,680
in ourselves but what about this middle one learning what is that and why is that named along

246
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:09,440
alongside virtue so learning is as important as not killing not stealing it's importantness

247
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:14,640
giving it's as important as wisdom so

248
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:22,240
it's quite amazing so what does this mean now what is meant here by by learning

249
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:28,160
the word that's used there in uh in pali is actually a word that means

250
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:35,760
literally what is heard so it has to do with things that we have that we have heard

251
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:42,160
and you can understand this from the way that things were taught in the buddha's time it wasn't

252
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,760
that they had books most people couldn't even read or write for that matter

253
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,839
so if you wanted to hear teachings you wanted to learn teachings you had to go here a teacher

254
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:59,359
it was about what you could hear and the opportunity to hear the dharma was very precious actually

255
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:06,079
and so this quality of learning though is not literally just hearing like i was within earshot and it

256
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,720
entered my ears it has to do also with a being a little bit more active given that we couldn't take notes we couldn't

257
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:18,720
listen to the recording later we couldn't go consult a book

258
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:25,760
so learning in this this thing you've heard what is heard includes also

259
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:32,000
some sense of active listening so paying attention and kind of taking it in and integrating it

260
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:37,359
into what we know and it also includes memorizing it to some degree

261
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:43,839
remembering it well not literally memorizing it although that was done but remembering it well enough that you

262
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:49,920
would be able to use it the next day if you heard a dharma talk and had forgotten it by

263
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,760
time you walked home it wasn't as useful as if you could remember something about

264
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:02,160
it so this quality of learning that was praised is to have a kind of an intelligent interaction with the

265
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,760
teachings and that and that is what starts to change our mind

266
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:14,880
what is what starts to develop the mind in a sense so this kind of learning we can still do

267
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:20,079
you know we do it through listening to dharma talks online through taking notes maybe through reading dharma books

268
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:25,599
through reading sutas by exposing our mind again and again we may not remember everything

269
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:32,960
so well maybe not as well as they did when there was no other option but nonetheless as we hear and learn and

270
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:38,640
listen to things [Music] they kind of get into the mind in a way

271
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:44,880
and start to come into our thoughts more often you know teachings will come into our

272
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,160
thoughts i like to tell a story where one time i

273
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:58,400
was just in the kitchen doing washing the dishes or something and i i broke a cup and um

274
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,680
you know normal enough thing to have happen but immediately what came to mind was

275
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:09,599
the quote from ajahn cha where he says oh i enjoy my cup very much but for me the

276
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:14,880
cup is already broken you know indicating an understanding of impermanence but it's

277
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:22,079
you know it's a line that i had heard or read a number of times and when i broke the cup my mind said ah the cuff was already

278
00:48:22,079 --> 00:48:27,520
broken so it's just a simple moment where i could have gotten angry or

279
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:34,319
you know said a swear word but instead this thought of the dharma came to mind and that's you know that's

280
00:48:34,319 --> 00:48:40,559
one of the fruits of this this learning that's praised and that's a useful kind of

281
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:46,319
of uh use of the thinking mind the intelligent mind the cognitive mind the linguistic mind

282
00:48:46,319 --> 00:48:52,400
all those things that we might associate with thinking which is not which is supposed to be bad but it's not

283
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:59,599
it can be used well there are also many beneficial ways to use the cognitive mind on the cushion

284
00:48:59,599 --> 00:49:05,760
so the buddha for example encourage reflection on

285
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:12,800
various inspiring themes that will invoke confidence and joy so in one of the

286
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:18,880
sutas he he offers six different themes that we could reflect

287
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,079
on during sitting and those include the qualities of the buddha

288
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:31,359
qualities of the dharma the qualities of the sangha our own virtue our own generosity

289
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:39,119
and the fact that there are beings with well-developed minds in the world so those are the six

290
00:49:39,119 --> 00:49:44,720
themes and it's interesting it's also interesting to note that the

291
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:50,640
where i said beings that have well-developed minds what we reflect on is the fact that they

292
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:57,200
have those five qualities i just mentioned we reflect that there are beings in the world who have faith virtue learning

293
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:02,640
generosity and wisdom and just knowing that there are people like that

294
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,240
can be inspiring and it's skillful to think about that so any of these themes is said to bring

295
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:14,240
about according to the suta inspiration and the meaning inspiration in the dharma

296
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:19,520
and joy connected with the dharma so it's interesting isn't it that

297
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:25,680
qualities heart qualities like faith like motivation and like joy

298
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:34,000
can emerge from thought so as an example um what is what are

299
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,079
these reflections there are specific words given for how we would reflect on each of these six themes and the one for

300
00:50:40,079 --> 00:50:46,880
the for the dharma is like this the dharma is well expounded by the blessed one

301
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:54,319
to be seen here and now timeless inviting verification pertinent

302
00:50:54,319 --> 00:51:02,480
to be realized by the wise for themselves so it's six qualities of the dharma and

303
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:08,800
we could just reflect on those even during sitting it's okay to reflect in this particular

304
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:13,920
way it's kind of like the question i asked what about the dharma

305
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:20,880
touches your heart in the guided meditation so there's a way in which we can use the

306
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:27,680
thinking line to uplift the heart and it says further in the suta that when we are thinking in this way

307
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:33,359
the mind is headed straight and it doesn't get distracted it's not tangled up with great hatred

308
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:39,200
and delusion and in fact it will go not only toward joy but also eventually toward concentration

309
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:47,039
which is interesting also if certain forms of reflection can eventually lead to concentration

310
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:53,119
so then we can also look into the cognitive mind's ability

311
00:51:53,119 --> 00:51:58,400
to ask questions and explore the dharma in various ways so i'm talking now about

312
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:04,160
inquiry as a way of clarifying the teachings and also going deeper into our

313
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:10,880
experience so the suit does report cases of meditators sitting in meditation and it

314
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:17,119
will literally say in the suta while the venerable so and so was sitting in meditation

315
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:22,160
a certain train of thought arose in his mind his or her mind

316
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:27,200
and sometimes it will say at that point they went to ask the buddha a question

317
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:33,599
or maybe they continued meditating and later they went to ask the buddha a question about it so there are times

318
00:52:33,599 --> 00:52:39,359
in which thoughts can arise kind of out of our sitting practice that are relevant for the dharma

319
00:52:39,359 --> 00:52:44,800
dharma questions related to the dharma or understanding the meaning of the teachings

320
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:50,400
and we don't need to call those unskillful and say oh thinking oh bad i got distracted from the breath

321
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:56,240
again you know you don't necessarily go off on a long discursive thought trail about that but

322
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:01,359
you can remember okay my mind came up with the thought about the dharma maybe i'll look into that later

323
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:08,000
maybe i'll ask the teacher about that later that that's okay there are thoughts about the dharma that are

324
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:14,000
that can be taken seriously essentially we want to take take it seriously when our mind starts inquiring into

325
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:19,920
the meaning of the dharma so then a more modern inquiry practice

326
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:26,720
is like what we did in the sitting where we can drop in a question and it's not expected that we're going to come up with a

327
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:31,839
clear definitive answer that we could write down and carry around yes i know the answer to that question

328
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:38,319
it's really more intended as a a way to lead the mind deeper into itself

329
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:45,359
i've noticed when i do those repeating kinds of questions that sometimes the first few times i ask it i get an answer that

330
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:50,880
i kind of already knew you know kind of a cognitive answer

331
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:58,240
but then after maybe if i if i say okay thank you and i rest for a moment and ask again

332
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:03,839
i start getting answers that are no longer at the surface level maybe i didn't know some of that maybe i

333
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:11,040
surprised myself oh [Music] i didn't realize that that is also touching me about the dharma

334
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:16,720
something else and something else and eventually maybe there's even a kind of a visceral response that doesn't

335
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:22,319
have a word associated with it anymore and then we know that we're that inquiry

336
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:27,520
is leading us deeper into the mind deeper into the heart and it's helping to integrate you know

337
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,960
the cognitive mind with the heart with the body and that kind of integration is useful

338
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:40,240
along the path so it is clear i think from this that

339
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:48,559
well-directed thought about the dharma relating to practice has a place on the path

340
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:55,440
but it is true that this is not sufficient the buddha does say many times that the teachings cannot be fully

341
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:01,359
understood by the cognitive mind i'm going to read two different translations of a passage that's

342
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:06,720
repeated throughout the suttas about this one translation is like this

343
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:14,240
this dhamma is profound peaceful and sublime unattainable by mere reasoning to be

344
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:19,520
experienced by the wise and another translation says this

345
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:27,200
principle is deep hard to see hard to understand peaceful sublime beyond the scope of

346
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:33,280
reason subtle comprehensible to the astute

347
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:39,040
so we start to get the sense that although there is good thinking along

348
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:44,240
the path we're going to have to develop other dharma qualities also

349
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:52,319
so the next level of skillful thought if you will is to begin uh directing the attention to

350
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:59,280
stabilize the attention uh into samadhi into some gathering of the mind

351
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:06,240
so letting go even of what could be called thought and arriving at more just a continuous

352
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:11,280
attention so some of the initial factors that support

353
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:18,640
concentration are qualities that are called applied thought and sustained thought so where we direct the mind it's

354
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:23,680
interesting that it's called thought but this means directing the mind toward the meditation object

355
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:29,440
so it's the breath placing the mind on the breath placing attention on the breath or the

356
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:37,200
body for example that act is actually a cognitive act we are intentionally directing the attention

357
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:42,400
but it's a more subtle kind of mental act right than thinking way more subtle than discursive

358
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:47,920
thought which is way up at the sort of top level so we start to see that there's a refinement

359
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:53,599
of how we're using the cognitive mind and it begins to invoke other dharma

360
00:56:53,599 --> 00:57:00,559
qualities such as samadhi concentration we can also use thought to cultivate the

361
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,839
heart qualities like the brahma viharas that's a word for loving kindness

362
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:13,440
compassion appreciative joy and equanimity these are not exactly thoughts but they are things

363
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:20,160
that can be evoked through repeating phrases which are thoughts through directing the

364
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:26,319
mind to the feeling in the heart you know these are other ways that we use our cognitive

365
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:34,000
mind to cultivate very skillful qualities on the path that are taking us much deeper than the level of the thinking mind

366
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:39,040
amazingly thought can even be used to evoke the

367
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:45,760
seven factors of awakening there's an amazing suta that says that

368
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:51,280
when one this is about speaking about an advanced meditator

369
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,760
dwelling thus withdrawn the meditator recollects the dharma and thinks it over

370
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:04,000
it literally says recollects the dharma and thinks it over on that occasion the awakening factor of

371
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:09,920
mindfulness is aroused how about that so for someone who's

372
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:18,000
meditated for a while who has some understanding of how the thinking mind works it's possible to think about the dharma

373
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:25,680
in a way that evokes uh mindfulness wow it's a very surprising suta

374
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:31,839
and very interesting one and it goes on to say that the other factors of awakening can be evoked this way also

375
00:58:31,839 --> 00:58:37,040
so it's quite stunning so i like to say that as um

376
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:43,280
as we refine the cognitive mind from discursive thought which we let go of

377
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:49,920
and replace with more skillful thought we then start to cultivate more and more wisdom-related dharma

378
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:56,480
qualities and we come to have what i like to call the mind of dharma where the mind is just operating in a

379
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:02,319
frame where it thinks about the dharma when it breaks a cup where it calls forth the brahma

380
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:07,920
bihar is as needed where it understands what activity would be

381
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:14,079
ethical in a certain situation our mind starts to become useful to us

382
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:20,079
really functional really beneficial for continuing to walk the path

383
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:27,119
and we can cultivate this kind of mind simply through beginning with skillful thoughts

384
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:32,400
beginning by reducing the intensity of the unskillful thoughts and starting with the skillful ones right up at the

385
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:39,440
surface level from that all of the rest can unfold all the way to the qualities of wisdom

386
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:46,319
insights and awakening but i hope this talk is at least giving you the

387
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:51,920
idea that the thinking mind is not all bad you don't need to get rid of it

388
00:59:51,920 --> 01:00:00,799
any more than one needs to get rid of a child in order to become an adult so it's a natural process

389
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:07,359
and it begins simply with replacing the unskillful side of the

390
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:13,839
discursive mind reducing the intensity and replacing those with more skillful thoughts that

391
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:18,960
will then lead the mind deeper so may your practice bear great fruit

392
01:00:18,960 --> 01:00:24,079
and may you come to love your cognitive mind

393
01:00:24,079 --> 01:00:29,839
as a tool on the path thank you
