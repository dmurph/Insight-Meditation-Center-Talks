1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:09,679
so good evening everyone and welcome and what i'd like to do is um

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:17,119
talk about ethics it's uh at the heart of

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:23,039
buddhist practice living ethical life though there's no word in buddhism for at the

4
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:28,720
word ethics the english word ethics so you can argue maybe there's no ethics in

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:36,480
buddhism there's something else that looks like ethics so if you if the word ethics doesn't quite work for you

6
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,520
and the um the let's see

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,600
if the um um so what i'd like to do is start i

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:55,039
mean part of it is also this integration many people one of the wonderful questions people ask me

9
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,399
people meditate or go on retreat this is all meditation's fine it's fine but how

10
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,880
does it apply to our life you know it should apply to our life you know just not by just sitting peacefully

11
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,880
by yourself well this topic of ethics is about how it applies to life

12
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:18,640
and and it's not like ethics is secondary or it's

13
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,720
it's not like it's the foundation so because so we can meditate it's the fruit of meditation it's the

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:30,799
expression of it the manifestation of it in our life so that's kind of a little bit introduction

15
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,479
but i thought uh the way i'd like to start here is is uh

16
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,920
i'd like to wear a relatively small group compared to before the pandemic

17
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,360
we can take we have the luxury of maybe you could all go around and say your names

18
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,360
and will it be okay if you could

19
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,039
does it work yes my name is veta

20
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,400
hi my name is beverly herbert

21
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,439
and laura

22
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,480
my name is sage sally

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,760
my name is sue

24
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,000
my name is jamie

25
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:54,719
hi bill good evening everyone i'm anne rose

26
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:07,200
hi my name is kristen hi i'm malvika

27
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,840
i'm caroline

28
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,200
mike april

29
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:24,799
wonderful and also we have some people online it's a little hard for them to say their names but

30
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,640
and uh you're all included so uh

31
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,760
that was really nice nice for me it's also now a way that we're more

32
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:42,319
connected a little bit each of you had your voice in here and so there's more sense of being

33
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:48,720
somehow in relationship or been recognized something about you as a human being now has been

34
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,319
seen or recognized and as opposed to some of you i didn't know your names and

35
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:00,480
nameless people who come time c and maybe you wouldn't speak otherwise they wouldn't hear your voice

36
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:06,080
but there was some contact or some knowing and in a sense that's an

37
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,879
act of mindfulness that you know paying attention noticing what's here

38
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,120
and um but something else happens in that noticing now you're more

39
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:25,759
you know maybe you'll forgive me for saying it this way because probably not exactly to the point

40
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,120
or i don't know what but you're more human you're more yourself there's more

41
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,320
feeling for you there's a easier for empathy there's a like now you're you're

42
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:44,160
somebody rather than someone more amorphous or uncertain or and now

43
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:50,400
um for me i care for you more there's a sense of care there's a sense of you're

44
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,680
you have an emotional life you have an inner life you have a history you come you know you have something brought you

45
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:04,320
here an interest that maybe we share and so so that there's a deeper recognition

46
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,639
and i'm touched in some way it's not you know i'm sure i can be much more deeply

47
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,840
touched if you told me a little bit more about your life but uh i feel a little bit touched too

48
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,880
something moves inside of me that's different all of that

49
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:28,160
changes how i'd like to live with you in a sense um i'm i'm much less inclined to want to

50
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:33,280
hurt you to harm you more importantly i'm much more

51
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,280
interested in to have care for you and and be concerned for you i'm much more

52
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,759
ready to notice that if i have some kind of harsh or mean or

53
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,919
angry kind of hostile kind of thoughts that i've noticed that when i do that it

54
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:58,240
hurts me that it isn't just that why would i do that to you now that i know you

55
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:04,800
but also if i do that do it i'm now going to be a little bit

56
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,280
i'm hurting myself i'm kind of diminishing myself undermining myself and that's the movement of what i'm

57
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:18,400
calling ethics this is how ethics can come out of buddhism because of this practice or mindfulness

58
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:25,280
because we're paying attention more we're connecting more where people around us have a different role

59
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:31,360
and place in our lives than they do if we don't know them at all

60
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,800
and we know ourselves more through this practice we're much more sensitive we recognize the quality of

61
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:44,639
our thoughts the quality of our speech the quality of what we're trying to do our intentions

62
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,520
and it isn't that we're it's ethical in the sense that there's a should and shouldn't way of being

63
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:58,160
but rather we there's an ouch factor it's like oh that hurts why would i do that

64
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:04,880
why would i close myself down we could continue going around the room

65
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:10,400
and do this and i think the the sense of connection and things would be deeper

66
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:18,560
and not only to each other but also to ourselves so i'd like to ask we do that

67
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,919
and and maybe you can pass if you don't want to say anything it's completely fine

68
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:29,199
and in fact that's also a way of knowing you in a nice way it's a kind of

69
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:34,960
expression of who you are and that should be respected and and it's not uh

70
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:40,560
you know there's lots of place for that but this is the this is the it's something very brief it could be a

71
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,840
phrase no more than a sentence not a story

72
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,440
but it has to do with the story in the story of your

73
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:56,639
inner growth your caring for your inner life your growth of wisdom of compassion

74
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:01,840
of healing your story you know the story of your life in terms

75
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:08,400
of your inner growth healing spirituality

76
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,240
maturity where does meditation fit in that for

77
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,840
you does it is that part of that story or is it just like you know

78
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:26,639
you know you deny any difference in going home and doing this watching the shopping channel

79
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,919
how does it fit so let's put you on the spot but just it's just something it doesn't have to

80
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:37,599
be brilliant just some little phrase or idea

81
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:44,880
meditation's a foundation is what foundation foundation nice

82
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:55,120
thank you um this is the first time i've done a 45 minute sit since before the pandemic

83
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:01,540
and it was horrible [Music] [Laughter]

84
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:13,600
i would say meditation is the way to slow down and

85
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,880
get closer to attaining balance nice

86
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,880
um for me meditation is a way of bringing loving awareness to everything

87
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,440
around me

88
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,880
uh deepening quiet

89
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:45,440
meditation brings me closer to myself and to others in my life

90
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,839
it's what i do

91
00:09:54,480 --> 00:10:02,279
um i would say meditation is something like the beating heart of my ethical practice

92
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,839
um i found that my daily practice is like

93
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:16,440
ironing out the wrinkles

94
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:25,760
i like the freedom of finding here

95
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:38,640
meditation has allowed me to just become more aware of the treasure of each day

96
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,279
today what i'm thinking about is meditation gives me the awareness

97
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:53,839
of what's happening in my mind so i have more choice about how i respond to that

98
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:02,560
i don't know whether it's the meditation sitting or meditation in daily life but i'm more

99
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,800
aware of what's going on in my body and what that's doing to my mind or vice

100
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:13,160
versa maybe more vice versa

101
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,600
meditation's had a changing role in my life and it's becoming more and more foundational

102
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:24,160
these days

103
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:35,519
meditation is a place of rest for me and it's how i find myself

104
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:41,040
nice very nice thank you so it was lovely to hear as well

105
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:46,720
and from hearing all that from myself i hear

106
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:51,839
a sensitivity in each of you that probably

107
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:58,720
would make you more ethical if you stayed close to it if you stay close to what you described

108
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:04,079
that probably you're not going to go jump up out up up sitting here and

109
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:11,040
and yell at me for wearing the wrong color shirt you know like how could you a dharma teacher shouldn't wear blue

110
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:18,800
or something you know i i'm just making something silly up but but uh you're probably more likely to make some space

111
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:25,200
i felt you know to listen or be a present and and

112
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:31,200
come out of that somewhat more caring for each other you could do a different activity

113
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:36,800
tonight and would come out of that activity the opposite

114
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,120
what you choose to do has a big impact on the tendencies of the mind and what we want to do

115
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:50,000
and and so coming to meditate and engage in the dharma in some kind of way

116
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,279
changes us in the direction of wanting to be more kind

117
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,720
wanting to be more connected or more sensitive to ourselves and to others the quiet

118
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,399
that some of you discussed is something that makes us more available

119
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,320
to feel and sense what's going on here and it makes a difference

120
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:18,880
what we do and so one of the things that comes out of that is this very i think important

121
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:24,959
recognition that we don't really don't want to harm anyone

122
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:30,639
because that harms them why would you

123
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,560
also you don't want to harm yourself one of the reasons not to harm yourself

124
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:44,000
is that that's a way to create the conditions to take remove the foundation that's important to have

125
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,639
that would make you a kind supportive caring person people who are very critical themselves

126
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:56,000
and living under that kind of stress are much more likely to snap and been

127
00:13:56,000 --> 00:14:02,320
angry or or be shut down or insensitive to the world

128
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:07,920
around them and so as we practice

129
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:13,920
there's a tendency to become more sensitive to ourselves the impact we have

130
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:20,160
the impact we have in others the impact we have on ourselves and as that becomes more sensitive

131
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:26,399
then people will naturally want to live a little bit more ethically

132
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:31,519
which in my vocabulary means a life that avoids causing harm

133
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:37,839
in fact the very idea that we would harm someone intentionally or unintentionally

134
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:44,240
it just feels completely like no that i don't want to do that there

135
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:50,800
becomes a more and more a life of living for the for the benefit of others

136
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:56,000
for their care not because it's a should not because

137
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,920
that's what buddhists do and you've got you're a buddhist so now you've got to go figure out how to be kind

138
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:09,040
but it arises out of this mindfulness out of this practice out of this the deeper connection we

139
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:14,160
have to ourselves and the world around us so

140
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:21,120
that's one of the reasons why that's like so the connection to ethics and the integration of mindfulness in daily life

141
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:27,519
is inherent in what we're doing however

142
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:35,199
it's easy to overlook it it's easy to get distracted and busy it's easy to not appreciate fully that

143
00:15:35,199 --> 00:15:41,680
this is happening so then we give dharma talks so we study buddhism and they say you know

144
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:48,079
it's good to live by the precepts it's good to be ethical and be kind and be compassionate and here

145
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:54,240
are some ways of developing compassion here's practice of loving-kindness i know that the precepts are hard to

146
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,360
practice but they'll really create the right conditions for you so when you do go sit

147
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:04,720
and meditate you won't feel regrets and upset about what you've done

148
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:10,399
so so there's all kinds of logical ways and doctrinal ways that we can get the

149
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:14,000
instructions to be ethical

150
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:21,440
sometimes those can put people in the wrong direction i've seen people try to be ethical

151
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:27,120
and they get all tight and they become a judgmental of other people

152
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:33,360
but i've also seen that people get inspired at some point

153
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:38,880
to want to learn about how to be ethical it's to learn to study about it think

154
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:45,120
about it to reflect on it to do practices connected to ethics

155
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,399
because they value that ethical sensitivity

156
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:56,639
growing inside of them that this is a good direction to go this is a way that i want this to be part of

157
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:04,240
my life and so some people then say you know if they say that that the five precepts

158
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,640
are what supports this or the expression of this and that there's a feedback loop between

159
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,079
living by the five precepts and this beautiful thing is happening to me having it grow

160
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,678
then i'm going to live by the five precepts and that's a very different feeling

161
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:28,558
than having some kind of strict moralistic idea that to be a good person you have to

162
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:34,640
follow the precepts it's something something that's coming from the inside out now

163
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:41,919
and but what i'm trying to say one thing i'm trying to say here now is that you don't have to leave it to chance

164
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:48,720
you don't have to let it this ethical sensitivity this care to be something that you just let

165
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:55,760
arise and develop kind of naturally out of the meditation practice as it does at some point you can begin recognizing

166
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:01,520
that you're being changed this way and want to support that

167
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:08,080
encourage it to develop it further and then it becomes something you take on intentionally

168
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:16,640
but the motivation from it for doing it comes from within the motivation is an expression of

169
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:23,360
the practice that's maturing as opposed to you read all the books on buddhism and that book say this the

170
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,679
manual say this is what you're supposed to do so this is the transformation

171
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:37,760
that this is the way that this practice becomes our life

172
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:44,160
and the idea that how do i bring this practice into daily life

173
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:50,559
i feel a little bit i feel very happy when people ask that question and i feel a little bit sad

174
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:56,080
and the sad part is because it sounds to me sometimes as if there's two things

175
00:18:56,080 --> 00:19:01,600
their practice and their life and as long as there's these two things

176
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:07,520
then there can be a challenge or you know then you know sometimes habits

177
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:12,880
sometimes don't you don't but to really feel there's not two things it's your life we're talking

178
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:18,400
about it's how you live your life how you experience your life how you

179
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,520
how you inhabit your life that we're talking about and so it's not so much um

180
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:30,720
and so um um it's a lovely way of talking about this

181
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:38,000
is that you don't bring your practice into your life you bring your life into your practice

182
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:43,440
and why that's a wonderful turn of phrase is that

183
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:51,760
if you bring your your practice into your life it might for some people prioritize life

184
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:56,880
you have to live your life and do what you're doing and then you bring you integrate you bring in the practice to

185
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,919
it and that's certainly a valid way of seeing but to say

186
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:08,799
what um how do i bring my life into my practice puts the practice at the center

187
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:13,840
like that's the most important thing and you know where i go shopping and how

188
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,360
i drive my car those are all him that is my life

189
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:26,400
but my the practice is more central in my life because the practice is what i'm discovering is this deeper sensitivity

190
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:33,280
this deeper sense of foundation this deeper place of quiet of peace of compassion or care

191
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:38,320
this is where i want my life to be based on that's portable sometimes i'm driving my

192
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:44,640
car sometimes i'm shopping sometimes i'm doing whatever having breakfast and

193
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,840
and rather than prioritizing that

194
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:58,080
prioritize this place of practice as if that is who you are that's life

195
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,480
and then see how everything fits into that rather than how your practice fits into

196
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:10,400
into your life and because then you're always in practice is always always kind of the

197
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:17,280
forefront some people who don't know about this inner change that happens

198
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:23,039
can feel like now you're just being told to do get more busy to add something on top of your life now

199
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:28,799
i got to do a less practice on top of the dishes and making breakfast and all that

200
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:37,039
it's actually in some ways you get to do less because the practice becomes who you are

201
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:44,000
not what you do and that's the direction where this integration or this how this practice

202
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,120
goes more and more ethical when the practice becomes you you become

203
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:55,200
the practice it's not something that's apart from you you don't have to come to imc to do the

204
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,559
practice at some point it you carry it with you it's kind of

205
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:07,039
the nature of your heart it's who you are the um

206
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:13,760
the uh in the ancient language they talk about this in terms of entering a stream at

207
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:19,520
some point you enter the little little literal meaning of this word is not stream but entering the

208
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:24,960
current of a river and if you find the current it'll carry you along

209
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,400
and um and uh the um and then when the buddhists are

210
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,520
asking what is the current we enter into and it's the eightfold path

211
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,360
that we have become so the eight practices that are the eightfold path are not not meant to be

212
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:47,679
something you're adding to your life but something arises out of your life

213
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:53,679
so the challenge i'd like to offer each of you if you're up for a little challenge

214
00:22:53,679 --> 00:23:00,720
is what is it about this practice that we do the meditation practice the dharma practice

215
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:07,200
that flows out of you that when it flows out of you

216
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:13,679
is looks like you're now an ethical person you're living an ethical life

217
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:20,880
what is it can you identify something have you recognized something in you what is it that flows from you

218
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:26,480
that maybe sometimes it gets forgotten gets over

219
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,919
or you know overwritten because of the busyness of life but what is it that flows out of you

220
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:40,159
and if you're willing to do one more round i'd love to hear some of you again you can more than welcome to pass because

221
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:46,000
this is a little more difficult question to answer but if um if some of you would like to

222
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:53,039
offer some words about what is it that flows out of you that

223
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:58,559
would someone else would look at you and say oh that person is inclined towards to be

224
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,640
ethical but you're not ethical because you're not thinking in those terms you're thinking about just

225
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,640
how to let the sensitivity be expressed in your life does that make some sense what i'm

226
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:15,158
asking yeah good enough

227
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:28,559
i have two things that come to my mind

228
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:35,760
i started trusting my kids to start trusting my kids my peers

229
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:43,679
no my kids i really trust them you know this is a big change and

230
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:49,279
and i conserve water i think about it all the time and

231
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,399
i really focus on this nice nice

232
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:07,760
and no specifics came up but just an attitude that i i recognize that's changed is um

233
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:13,200
is just coming from a non-harm perspective

234
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:19,120
as opposed to maybe more of a protect myself or something kind of a perspective

235
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:30,080
i'm not really sure i would say maybe caring being more caring of others but

236
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:33,519
i'm not sure i'd answer your question

237
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:45,760
i think i would say something like tenderness

238
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:52,720
it's become more and more part of my life and i think that comes from

239
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:57,919
meditation and the recognition that like you know all beings are

240
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,880
sacred and important

241
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:12,640
for me acceptance of myself of other people of things that are happening in the world

242
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,880
yeah

243
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:23,520
i think right mindset for me because thinking critically of myself and others

244
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:30,400
and being very anxious has always been something i've struggled with which you know putting that into putting

245
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:35,600
practice practice into my life has allowed me to um kind of

246
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:42,399
influence how my actions affect myself and others

247
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:54,720
i think equity equanimity really helps

248
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,519
that's onward leading

249
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,080
yes

250
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:18,080
i'm i have a little less tendency to be angry at people and

251
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:24,799
i understand my anger more when i have it

252
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,440
ah love

253
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:44,080
um i guess more acceptance of myself and

254
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:52,158
also when i see somebody really struggling

255
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:58,720
i find myself having a respect for them as a person

256
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:07,520
and and and caring concern which is a different place than i have been in the past

257
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:17,360
say care and the more i'm in the present the more

258
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,880
i uh have the ability to be attentive for others

259
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:25,919
which i work towards

260
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,159
what came up for me was gratitude and reverence when i feel that spring up i'm

261
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,720
more likely to not hurt others

262
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:47,440
i'd say compassion and connection just seeing myself in them and them and

263
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:49,600
me

264
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:59,679
meditation has helped me recognize when i'm angry to not get triggered and to

265
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:04,799
see that i'm angry and to observe it and not react so much

266
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,880
and like one of my girlfriends said i don't understand why you're not just jumping up and

267
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:16,640
you know defending yourself and i didn't have an answer at the time but

268
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,440
i think that's why

269
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:29,120
yeah where i work you sometimes hear people say it's better to seek forgiveness than

270
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:36,159
permission and i turn that around i'd much rather ask for permission than

271
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:40,360
you know get it cleared up front

272
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:48,159
very nice thank you all so i hope that the theme of today the

273
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:55,200
connection of this practice with ethics or something that looks like that

274
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,360
you know it was somehow addressed in a nice way and inspired something in you or touched something in you

275
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:07,279
i don't have much more to say today do you have anything you want to say or

276
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:14,399
any questions or comments april use the mic please

277
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:23,360
a colleague of mine was on the ethics committee and i asked him because i've

278
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:29,520
always wondered what's the difference between ethics and morals i don't know if you have an opinion

279
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:35,919
about that oh ethics and morals i think that's probably a very

280
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:41,440
individual thing how people would answer that that the difference between them is kind of like

281
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:47,840
you know some people would say they're synonyms some people i'm sure there's people who will have definitions that are different

282
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:54,880
um the um uh i think that uh morals

283
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:59,360
uh i i associate more with

284
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,799
guidelines by which people live and ethic is an abstraction it's more like almost like philosophy of ethics

285
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:12,559
it's the the wide field of how people might make decisions how to live their

286
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:19,519
life and and so morals are closer to the heart ethics is more can be more abstract

287
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:25,760
though i never use the word morals i use the word ethics in english so

288
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:31,080
um so that's the best i could come up with

289
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:54,480
the as i said the there's no clear word in in the buddhist

290
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:01,200
language about that matches our word ethics but many people say it's the word sila or sheila

291
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:08,399
but that word literally means a conduct and it refers to kind of some people now

292
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:13,760
translate as virtuous conduct ethical conduct

293
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,360
but usually we think of ethics in english as something something deeper in us

294
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,640
than only what we do it's also the source within us for how

295
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,640
we do it and so the word that's a better fit for the

296
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:37,200
english word ethics is kusala a word that can mean both wholesome

297
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:43,120
which i like is a wholesome word and also has the meaning of has three meanings that can mean

298
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:49,919
virtuous and it can mean skillful so do something skillfully with some

299
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,640
so this ability to that to do something with skill that is for the benefit of self and

300
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:04,799
others and uh and what's uh repeated often in the teachings of the buddha

301
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,159
is live a life that's for the benefit of oneself

302
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,600
benefit for others and a benefit for self and others

303
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,720
and i love that last one itself and others because i don't we don't know what it

304
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:26,799
would have meant but how i interpret it is that um it's the we

305
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:33,440
it's us in community and so it's not just the ethics of individuals now it is for me or the

306
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,880
impact i have on you but it's also the impact it has for us as a community is in a relation in

307
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:44,559
relationship to each other and so we want to care for that relationship as well

308
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:50,720
and so the carefulness is in how do we have a relationship that is friendly that's

309
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:57,279
warm that's connected that's that's supportive that's carries some of these values in the

310
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:04,000
relationship itself and so um so this so-called ethics

311
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:09,040
is uh in buddhism is very relational as well

312
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:15,599
so i love that that uh it's all of us in it together so thank you for being together here

313
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:22,560
today i really appreciate it a lot that we could come here and meditate and that you participated with me rather than

314
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:27,599
giving a classic traditional kind of dharma talk but to hear from you and

315
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:32,720
do this together and um so thank you very very much and i wish

316
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:35,838
you well
