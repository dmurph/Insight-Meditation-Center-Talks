3
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:21,779
we started with the meditation I didn't say too many words to frame it

4
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:27,240
um and it was relatively Quiet One inviting the nourishment of

5
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:34,739
settling in of of Peace of quiet as an expression of meta and and many of you

6
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:43,140
expressed enthusiasm for for having another similar uh happy hour

7
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:49,980
so so let's see let's see how it goes tonight I'm not gonna say much similar

8
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:56,520
to Monday let's explore together let's see what arises exploring silence as

9
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,640
nourishment of meta uh and and meta okay so let's begin

10
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,000
let's begin our practice our formal practice of meditation together

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
ah

12
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:19,040
you're sitting in a chair

13
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:29,360
letting your body be afraid

14
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:36,000
not uptight but upright no tightness needed in the muscles

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,380
but the sense of Integrity in your posture

16
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:48,840
and if you need to lie down that's okay or stand up

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,140
to standing meditation that's perfectly fine as well

18
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:03,020
I'm gonna give the instructions assuming you're you're sitting though so assuming you're sitting

19
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,640
feeling your sit Bones on the chair and the cushion

20
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:27,489
paying attention [Music]

21
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,620
foreign

22
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,959
attention to the body how are you buddy how are you in this

23
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,200
moment in time greeting greeting your body

24
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,540
the kindness it's worked so hard all day

25
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:29,300
how are you body pay attention foreign

26
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:41,760
places in the body that are really tired heavy

27
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,519
maybe tight maybe achy

28
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:54,260
can you greet them welcome them to be just as they are

29
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:06,060
maybe there are parts of the body that are feeling good comfortable warm

30
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,840
light

31
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,120
invite them too

32
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,860
to be as they are

33
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,000
and also inviting the body I said wanted to relax a little bit let

34
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,680
go of tightness and tension

35
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:17,840
listen listen carefully

36
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:23,160
listen spaciously

37
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:32,699
listen spaciously with your heart

38
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:35,539
to the body

39
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:16,560
and the listening here is metaphor for paying attention spaciously

40
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:24,680
listen spaciously

41
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:37,100
through the sensations of the breath in the body in the abdomen

42
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:57,240
with another sensation in the body is louder it's okay listen to that

43
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,340
listen to that wholeheartedly

44
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:36,360
listen lovingly body

45
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,258
to the breath

46
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,380
nothing needs to happen

47
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,860
be just to listen

48
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:17,759
foreign

49
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,959
but

50
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:05,459
if their thoughts are rising can listen to the Ark of them coming and

51
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:12,740
going not the content the content isn't needed right now

52
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:20,820
the fact that thinking might be happening thank you thoughts not now

53
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:27,120

spacious deep listening kind presence

92
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,640
is one way it shows up

93
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:07,279
can we express that for our bodies for this being whose me

94
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,760
In This Moment

95
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:35,419
listening listening to the sensations

96
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:47,840
the Lullaby of the breath

97
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,400
foreign

98
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,720
foreign

99
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,360
thank you

100
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,460
the body is a great teacher

101
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:49,639
pay attention relax the tension

102
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,500
the attention to the Stillness

103
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:34,220
silence between the notes

104
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:41,299
in this body

105
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,919
foreign

106
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:44,480
and as we begin to bring this practice session to a close

107
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,360
opening up your sphere of awareness a little wider

108
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:03,380
not just where your body seemingly ends

109
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:10,340
border of your skin but as if your body was more extensive

110
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:18,000
more expensive part of the air the space around it and

111
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:20,299
Beyond

112
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:29,720
listening spaciously internally externally

113
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:44,159
this being who is Me In This Moment In Time interconnected

114
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:52,279
and vast unfathomable ways

115
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:56,760
eternally externally

116
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:13,638
so much more I this being who is me is so much more

117
00:34:13,639 --> 00:34:18,378
and Where'd I take it to be

118
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:28,260
connected supporting others being supported by

119
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:38,000
others appreciating perhaps with all this vast

120
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:45,419
Universe inside and outside and offering our goodness

121
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:53,898
or care or deep listening to the world as a gift

122
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:02,280
as we listen to ourselves as we can be more present to ourselves with meta

123
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:08,180
we can be more present for others with meta

124
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:15,119
may all beings everywhere including myself be safe

125
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:23,780
happy healthy heavy may all beings be free

126
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:47,119
thanks everyone thanks for your practice

127
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,079
so so what we did tonight was

128
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:01,260
a practice of meta as deep listening

129
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:06,300
as presence deep listening internally for to this

130
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:13,680
body listening to the sensations of

131
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,800
sensations of the pharah and really being a good student being a

132
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:27,599
good student of the body the body is attuning Fork as I mentioned the meditation when there are

133
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:34,619
State of Mind states of heart emotions etc etc etc the body like a tuning for

134
00:36:34,619 --> 00:36:41,220
resonates so the more we get to pay attention and be present for with meta

135
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:48,720
without pushing things aside in a way like I don't want to listen to that no let me listen to that let me listen

136
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:56,820
to it all even if it's quote-unquote bad news I want to know I want to be present for it

137
00:36:56,820 --> 00:37:02,940
all so tonight our expression of meta our practice of meta was deep listening

138
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:12,060
deep listening to this body Sensations and one then the mind can get quite calm

139
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:18,599
settled with this deep spacious listening to the

140
00:37:18,599 --> 00:37:25,800
sensations there's a lot of Stillness in the body in between the vibrations

141
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:31,859
and all that as I was describing it like the silence between the notes as if it

142
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:38,820
were music so paying attention so

143
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:45,720
like to open up the space or any Reflections questions

144
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:50,820
comments anything you might have discovered or noticed

145
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:56,579
denied with this practice offered for both your own benefit and the benefit of

146
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:02,700
others bill says when you spoke of seeing

147
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:07,800
thoughts come and go without becoming entangled in the thoughts themselves I

148
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:16,380
had a real problem with doubt not sure how I can do that ah okay

149
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,420
um I appreciate the question pal so

150
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:30,900
so it takes some practice but consider a stance he stands of

151
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:37,020
um not entanglement into the thought but knowing I mean thoughts can come and go

152
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:47,099
and and at first maybe you realize it later after you've been entangled into thought it's okay then oh yeah I was

153
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:55,020
gonna be unentangled oh it's okay but in that last moment become aware of the

154
00:38:55,020 --> 00:39:00,780
thought disappearing going away so start there it starts there

155
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:06,359
and then little by little while you're in the middle of the thought when you're still

156
00:39:06,359 --> 00:39:12,420
entangled then this awareness comes like oh I'm entangled or can I just see

157
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:20,280
can I just step back and see thinking is happening like oh no no no no no no no they can be a little bit of space and

158
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:25,500
then through this practice then you can see yeah thoughts are coming and going

159
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:31,740
when the mind gets a little more settled without getting entangled from the beginning but it happens step by step by

160
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:39,480
step you can just do the whole thing um at once start when you just wake up

161
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:45,000
having been entangled and thinking for a while start noticing the thought going

162
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:51,359
away so that's the place to start Bill and that that way your confidence will

163
00:39:51,359 --> 00:39:57,720
be built in this practice little by little you are welcome

164
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,000
Richard I see your hand

165
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:10,320
oh my God yes uh you know there's always different

166
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:17,400
Sensations in the body but there's also different sort of ways of being in the body or being the body

167
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,560
like a gang gang thing a very passive thing a very active thing

168
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:30,060
uh it's like every week every state of emotion and

169
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:35,900
thought you know just sort of shows up differently

170
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:44,820
yes yeah there are lots of different ways but being in the body and tonight

171
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:51,119
I was specifically inviting you guiding you to

172
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:57,240
to relax and to listen spaciously that

173
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:05,180
was the key word to listen to the body spaciously that spacious way of listening

174
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:10,859
that it was an unentangled way of listening it's a particular way of

175
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:16,980
paying attention and also I was bringing the sense of Meta Care with this with

176
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:26,099
this presence with this spacious presence uh I'll try I'll try yeah great thank

177
00:41:26,099 --> 00:41:32,059
you thanks Richard yeah there are so many ways

178
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:40,680
any other Reflections or questions before we transition

179
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:45,839
any aha moments perhaps you hide

180
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:51,320
being present for this body this deep listening

181
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:59,180
spacious listening Jesse please

182
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:06,119
yeah thanks Nikki for this practice um yeah this was great you know this deep

183
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:11,220
listening practice I've done some day language sheets with you before on

184
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:18,119
concentration practice and which usually use the breath as a meditation object but this this felt

185
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:24,420
really different and I'm just wondering if you could maybe compare and contrast

186
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:30,839
samata or shamata practice with this this mindful deep listening that you presented tonight thank you yeah yeah

187
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:36,980
thank you so much Jesse yeah um so

188
00:42:36,980 --> 00:42:42,599
practice often translate as concentration where the mind gets still

189
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:47,940
when we keep coming back to an object and usually in the west we use the

190
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:53,820
breath for this practice though there are many different objects and by the

191
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:58,980
way in February 4th and 5th I'm teaching a white Casino which is a different way

192
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:04,640
of developing concentrations on my skin schedule if you go to my website

193
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:09,839
nickymergaforia.com but um the body is also another way to

194
00:43:09,839 --> 00:43:16,500
cultivate concentration settling the mind the sensations of the body are

195
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:22,380
definitely a concentration object and tonight with this invitation for deep

196
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:29,280
listening and I was talking about listening to the Stillness the silence between the notes that was an invitation

197
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:36,960
for the mind to settle into some idea actually uh the Stillness yeah exactly

198
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,180
right on Jesse great thank you thank you

199
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:47,400
Elaine says I really enjoy turning tuning into my body and getting a break

200
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:53,819
from my thinking mind lovely another practitioner

201
00:43:53,819 --> 00:43:59,520
says thank you this was much needed I felt a sense of ease amidst the physical

202
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:07,140
pain I've been feeling lately um thank you for sharing that Sandra says

203
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:14,460
it was nice to quiet my mind and turn into the body at the end of the busy day

204
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:20,880
yes he asks how can one stay with the practice in a Rowdy environment for

205
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:26,940
example kids are Rowdy and shouting caregivers are screening Etc do we just

206
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:34,740
try to extend the meta to all of them as well yes yes exactly so this practice of deep

207
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:40,740
listening when we practice when it's not so rowdy perhaps around and we get to

208
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:46,140
listen then we can take this to where it is rowdy and we can still listen to our

209
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:51,900
our own heart our own mind when there's a lot happening externally as well as

210
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:56,960
extend our full presence to others and listen to them without

211
00:44:56,960 --> 00:45:03,780
toppling over it all starts internally and then of course it extends to to all

212
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:09,859
beings everyone whether they're Rowdy or shouting Etc

213
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:17,220
thank you for the reflections everyone so not like to invite us to engage in

214
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:22,560
small groups in the Sangha breakout groups and then the question for

215
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:30,060
tonight's reflection and you can choose to reflect you can choose to just be silent uh offer your

216
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:37,680
silent presence is um this this tuning this tuning into the

217
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:42,720
body listening deeply into the body this um

218
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:47,940
this act of listening um

219
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:53,280
is there what what supports your deep listening

220
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:59,160
to the body and what challenge is it what supports it and what challenge is

221
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:06,960
it what is supportive what's challenging so what's supportive might be oh yeah an environment that's not so loud uh maybe

222
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,000
a guided meditation is supported no it's not supportive is when I maybe when I

223
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,819
try to push and I'm really really tensing up to listen to my body I

224
00:46:17,819 --> 00:46:23,700
realize actually it's counterproductive anyway so your Reflections your mileage might vary but what's supportive maybe

225
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:31,079
one thing and one thing that's not supportive that you discover and maybe you have one and not the other like the

226
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:36,780
other one I don't know what's not supportive or what's supportive I'm still exploring this you can just hold

227
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:44,339
space for others so so with that I'd like to invite us to

228
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:50,099
to here we go the breakout rooms I'm going

229
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:56,099
to create them now so as always please just offer it and Reflection from

230
00:46:56,099 --> 00:47:04,140
yourself and make space for others not asking questions not directing and let's go alphabetical order just offer

231
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:10,920
something maybe you say pass the next person next person he'll come back to you go around and around

232
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:16,020
take care of yourselves take care of each other here we go

233
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:24,180
okay the rooms are all closed everybody is back and it's seven o'clock so

234
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:31,260
um I wonder if there's any very quick Reflections from what you learned maybe something surprising or discover uh

235
00:47:31,260 --> 00:47:38,760
surprising like a 30 second reflection someone who hasn't spoken Ali please

236
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:46,560
hello thank you for uh on your teachings and and sharing with us uh

237
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:52,319
what came up with me is just like I mostly in the mind but this thing is more I mean with the body it's more

238
00:47:52,319 --> 00:48:00,240
solid and I can just feel the sensations rather than the you know stuff in the mind is like more ephemeral harder to

239
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:06,300
catch so thank you for that reflection I just going to practice more staying with the

240
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:12,839
body beautiful thank you so much Ellie thank you for your practice and sharing that reflection it's so fresh and the

241
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:19,920
way you shared it for the benefit of everyone beautiful so thank you and thank you all for your practice may all

242
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:27,200
