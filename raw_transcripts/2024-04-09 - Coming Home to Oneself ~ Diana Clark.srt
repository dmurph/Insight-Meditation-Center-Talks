1
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:15,240
welcome welcome everybody happy Eclipse day right this a

2
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,400
amazing thing that happened over there in another part of the United

3
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:26,359
States it's kind of a such an unusual thing it makes me wonder you know

4
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:31,759
thousands of years ago the how they explained something like this like how

5
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:39,000
could they like how would you explain something like this if you didn't un know all the astrology

6
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,399
astronomy I don't think knowing astrology would help you much

7
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:52,719
but so today I wanted to talk a little bit about this idea of coming home to

8
00:00:52,719 --> 00:01:00,239
ourselves coming home to ourselves this idea that uh this home

9
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:07,759
inside of us a place that has a sense of ease sense of maybe some safety and

10
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:15,280
that's a home that no one can take away from us it's always there and yet we are often not there

11
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,720
this place inside of us that um is

12
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,840
welcoming and has a sense of belonging and there's a way that no

13
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,439
matter what is happening around us that this is you know always available and it's always

14
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,680
there but we're not always connected to it we're not always

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,439
home if we want to use this language kind of like home this maybe um I don't know about

16
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:53,399
all of you but when I'm home I'm relaxed and I tend to be you know doing what I

17
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:59,560
want to do and wearing clothes that I only wear at home

18
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:06,479
you know it's just being comfy so there's this way of you know just this feeling like being who we really are

19
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:12,920
being authentic and not trying to impress anybody else or you know just uh

20
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:20,319
being ourselves for some people when they get home there's a sense of I know that uh when I worked in

21
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,640
Corporate America this would be like this thing that when I would come home from work with like okay I've changed my

22
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:32,120
clothes out of my professional clothes and into whatever I was going to wear to lounge around in the

23
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:38,519
evening and there was this sense of you know changing of the clothes was like oh okay now I can be a little bit more

24
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:46,680
relaxed can be who I am in some kind of way but when there's this uh sense of

25
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:53,959
being home there's a sense of there's nowhere that we need to go there's nowhere else that we need to be going to

26
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:59,920
or there's nothing else that we need to be then we can just be here we can just

27
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:06,400
be here in this moment so coming home to ourselves is

28
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:12,480
related to mindfulness being present for what's actually

29
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:21,680
happening as opposed to being lost in thought or you know in fantasies or

30
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:29,319
planning and so what are some of the ways in which we kind like abandon or like leave this abandon ourselves or

31
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:35,280
leave this home I'm using home just as a you know a nice way to point to a place

32
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:40,439
that feels comfortable and familiar inside of us even if it's not as

33
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:47,280
comfortable and familiar as we would like it to be maybe it's as comfortable and familiar as it might be is than

34
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,159
other places than when we're out in public for

35
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,760
example so what are some of the ways in which we abandon ourselves using this kind of as a maybe strong language to AB

36
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,840
AB in ourselves but what is this some of the ways in which we really start to orient outside of ourselves instead of

37
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,920
like staying here with what our experience is and part of that is just

38
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,919
very simply because we're experiencing difficulties whatever those difficulties

39
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:25,040
might be something minor like okay I can't figure out how to fix the

40
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:31,039
dishwasher that's uh not doing what it's supposed to do or or they're having some

41
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:38,440
really emotional difficulties like feeling really sad or

42
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:45,199
angry or having difficulty in our personal intimate relationships and so there's this way

43
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:51,240
and when there's often when there's difficulties there's the Mind kicks in and says oh I have to figure it out and

44
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:57,280
it starts to like go outside and it starts to um engage with things and want

45
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,320
to find a solution look up a YouTube video on instructions

46
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:10,520
on how to do fix that dishwasher or whatever it might be but that's not the only thing that

47
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:17,400
happens when we start to look outside ourself we start to look for answers but often we start to blame

48
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:22,800
to there's these difficulties and it's something outside of there it's that's

49
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,560
fault that person that entity that

50
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:34,840
situation as a way and then we kind of like get disconnected from ourselves because then all the energy goes out

51
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,160
there there's a maybe a strong sense of self-righteousness I'm right be but that

52
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,919
thing over there is wrong but that's not really a

53
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,560
comfortable feeling maybe it feels energizing this self-righteousness for a

54
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:58,400
bit but there's a way and also it feels um kind of like alienating or it's like

55
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:04,319
you're hiding behind this uh shield and getting all puffed up and it just takes

56
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:10,479
so much energy and to maintain this uh

57
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:18,240
self-righteousness is uh not a comfortable way to live one's life it's not a good way it's for goes

58
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,759
forward so maybe that's one reason why we kind of abandon ourselves why we're no longer home is because we're having

59
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:31,240
difficulties and we're either looking for Solutions outside of oursel or we're blaming something outside of of ourselves but either way we're kind of

60
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:40,639
like disconnected from ourselves or maybe it's nothing like difficulties maybe it's just uh We've um

61
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:45,960
gained this habit that our culture our society our family our education so

62
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:54,400
often likes to promote and that is like oh let's go chase the next shiny

63
00:06:54,400 --> 00:07:02,160
thing let's uh have attainments or let's have accomplish ments or let's go get

64
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:09,199
whatever the advertisers want to convince us that we need or whatever our phones tell us that we should do or

65
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,560
something like that so it can just be a habit to always be like striving and

66
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,160
looking trying to get something or it can just maybe it's like

67
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:26,000
just literally buy something but any in either way it's also again this way in

68
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,120
which we are oriented outside of ourselves kind of being disconnected from this

69
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:38,680
home this uh place of spaciousness and stability

70
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:44,680
inside and then another reason why we might be a little bit like disconnected

71
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:50,000
from ourselves is maybe being

72
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:56,360
present for the moment and for ourselves is a let down maybe it's kind

73
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,919
of disappointing nothing nothing exciting here I'm just sitting here and we're so used

74
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,960
to right you know having this like something entertaining or interesting or

75
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:15,199
engaging in some kind of way and so on the surface to just be with our

76
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:21,199
experience maybe it feels boring

77
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,919
oh it's just like this but there's this way in which we

78
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:33,200
are when we can gain um maybe having some deeper attention some deeper

79
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,399
connection to ourselves that's when it starts to become so rich and

80
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:46,440
so um rewarding and delightful but it's often not that way

81
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,080
at the beginning in fact if when we start like with a mindfulness practice and we start turning towards ourselves

82
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:00,440
in the beginning it's really disappointing we start to see all this stuff about oursel that

83
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,519
we wish we didn't see all our bad habits we can't really

84
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,640
ignore them anymore or all the ways maybe that we have um

85
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,200
unskillfully harmed ourselves or harmed others we start to see that more

86
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:24,440
clearly and so then maybe we just want to like oh that's really uncomfortable and so we like jump out and distract

87
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:30,839
ourselves with uh what's on a screen or something like this

88
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:36,720
because there can be a way in which this inner critic can be really vicious and

89
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,519
mean when we start to see and I know for me that was uh when I started my

90
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:49,920
practice I you know I thought I was a pretty good person but I just started to see all these ways in which I wasn't

91
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,079
really showing up for my friends the ways that I was you know

92
00:09:55,079 --> 00:10:01,360
telling Little White Lies and these ways that I was was always thinking like oh

93
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,600
yeah I'll I'll try more later like not quite engaging with

94
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:13,920
things with my life or something and no wonder I felt kind of like dis

95
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,959
uh I didn't have contentment with my life discontent was because I was kind of

96
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:27,000
like oh yeah later all engag but right now I don't know I don't even know what

97
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,079
I was doing actually but just wasn't Eng engaged with my

98
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:38,720
life and then when we start a mindfulness practice when we start showing up for ourselves it can be a

99
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,839
wakeup call I think I it might have been Gil

100
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,360
fronal I'm not sure who said something along the lines of like

101
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:57,560
um all self all self- understanding is not necessarily good

102
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:05,760
news so that could be another reason why we don't often are connected to ourselves because especially if our like

103
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:12,399
as I said is our inner critic is kind of vicious but there's this way in which

104
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:21,600
connecting to coming home to and making friends with ourselves is so important

105
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,079
it's so important but in contrast many of us believe that uh self-criticism is

106
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,720
this is an appropriate strategy for success and you know it works until it

107
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:40,680
doesn't it works you know a certain amount we can beat ourselves up be mean

108
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:46,839
to ourselves for a certain while but then it comes at a

109
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:53,120
price and a lifelong of this self-criticism the price can get

110
00:11:53,120 --> 00:12:00,240
high the price can be that makes us anxious and makes us a not want to try

111
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,800
new things or take any risks because if we have this inner critic that's really

112
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:12,399
harsh we know that if we fail or we don't do it perfectly we'll just beat up ourselves up we'll berate ourselves for

113
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:17,839
quite some time so we don't try new things we don't take risks we don't

114
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,760
learn new things and then our life gets smaller and smaller and smaller just

115
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:32,199
only staying with those things in which we feel like we have some expertise in or feel familiar and

116
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:41,079
comfortable so the inner critic makes us anxious and our life turns and become smaller but it also has us be kind of

117
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:50,320
like U dissatisfied with our life this way in which not being connected and feeling like nothing's quite

118
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,480
right always something is wrong it also can contribute to a sense

119
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:04,519
of um being disconnected from others cuz if we are beating ourselves up so much and we think that we're so bad we don't

120
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:10,800
want anybody else to know how bad we are so we're hiding hiding behind a armor or

121
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,720
a shield or

122
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:22,120
something but so many of us feel like okay well we need this inner critic to

123
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:28,240
motivate ourselves I've talked about this a number of times a number of different

124
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,360
talks and a number of different contexts we have this kind of like convoluted

125
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,519
sense of self-care like okay I have to be mean to myself beat myself

126
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:49,560
up say mean names to myself so that I can do things in an

127
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,160
appropriate way or do do

128
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,040
well and so there's this way in which um

129
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:07,079
we might with this self-criticism we start to um have this this expression

130
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:13,480
this a lowgrade fever of self-doubt and then we start to feel

131
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:19,079
like not only we disconnected from ourselves but disconnected from

132
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:26,560
everything really feel like well maybe I don't belong here this famous impostor

133
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:33,560
syndrome or If people really knew me maybe they wouldn't be

134
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:38,920
okay so often what happens is we try to engage in this game of trying to

135
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:45,600
convince ourselves that actually we're okay we're okay and it's astounding like

136
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:52,040
how this is like such a common strategy that uh many of us have in fact you might say this is a lot of what humans

137
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:57,440
do is they going around kind of like I'm okay I'm okay and everybody's like

138
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:03,160
projecting they're okay they're okay they're okay but inside everybody's like you know what I'm kind of struggling a

139
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:09,480
little bit here whether it's they struggling a lot or just a little

140
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:17,839
bit so we engage in this game of trying to convince ourselves otherwise we try

141
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:25,759
to say the right things or look the right way or do the right things or be

142
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:32,920
at the right place or be with the right people or something like this is a way to reassure ourselves with this because

143
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:39,279
we have this lowgrade fever of self-doubt and then other people they have this low-grade fever or self-doubt

144
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:44,440
and they're doing the same thing too and it kind of gets normalized this uh way

145
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,440
of showing up in the

146
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:57,279
world so maybe we have this idea is like well people like me so I must be

147
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:03,240
okay but that really Rel on what's happening out there not on what's

148
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:08,959
happening in here in our hearts and in our

149
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:15,040
minds or maybe we have this uh you know I have a lot of professional success I'm

150
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:22,120
a good student uh my house is uh beautiful the grass is green or the

151
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:29,720
house is neat and tidy or beautiful or whatever it is I have all these things so I must be okay and we try to convince

152
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:35,839
ourselves of this and it doesn't last for very long

153
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:43,600
or there's always something right it's so it's never like okay now that I got my house perfect I oh I still

154
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:50,839
kind of feel the same I have a certain amount of professional success oh I feel kind of the same I need I need more

155
00:16:50,839 --> 00:16:57,279
professional success that's a little bit of my story that when I was in Corporate America I

156
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:07,079
had a fantastic job I had a great job and I felt like um oh I'm still not

157
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:13,400
so happy I I thought that's what was needed you know to have this uh have a good job

158
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:20,319
or something like this and uh I thought well my professional life is not going to get any better than

159
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:27,360
this or not much better than this so there has to be something else has to be

160
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:34,240
something else and I left Corporate America not really knowing what I was going to do and I was

161
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:38,840
all these years ago and found myself

162
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:46,640
here so instead is there's this way that we can this journey it might be a

163
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:52,799
journey of like coming home and connecting to ourselves and

164
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:57,840
then here's the sometimes the tricky part in a friendly

165
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,679
way in a warm-hearted way in an open spacious

166
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:12,039
way sometimes they're like well like we we connect but it's with ourselves but it's with like a sense of we have to

167
00:18:12,039 --> 00:18:17,080
whip ourselves into shape somehow or that we have

168
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:23,600
to it's this big self-improvement project and okay here's everything that's wrong I guess I'll start over

169
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,360
here and work on it or something like that but this journey

170
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:35,120
to kind of like coming home connecting to ourselves in a friendly way and for

171
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:41,480
some of us it might be a radical idea for me it certainly was this radical

172
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:49,480
idea of like oh to be to take care of honor and respect

173
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:55,440
myself my inner life it's really

174
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:02,280
important and so this journey it goes beyond just like feeling good about

175
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:09,200
yourself because it's not based on convincing yourself of anything it's not based on convincing yourself that you're

176
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:17,799
an okay person or and it doesn't rely on acquiring more more um success more

177
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:24,640
Badges of Honor more objects material objects or whatever it might be it's not

178
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:30,880
about um accumulating more even though that's definitely the

179
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:38,320
message we get sent in uh everyday life in this society that we've created it's

180
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,840
definitely this promotion of more and more and more and so and this journey is so it's

181
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:50,960
not exactly the same as like increasing our self-esteem because we might say that

182
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,520
self-esteem is a way you kind of like judge yourself like okay I'm good I'm I'm good

183
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,600
enough instead it's more more about uh

184
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:07,840
having this um recognizing okay I have

185
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:13,039
difficulties and how can I meet them with

186
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:19,480
care with warmth with openness so this journey to Greater

187
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:24,799
Freedom this journey to coming home to ourselves is not pretending that

188
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:31,919
everything is fine and not comparing ourselves to others or even comparing ourselves to how we think we should be

189
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:38,840
comparing ourselves to ourselves or our younger selves or our ideal future selves but instead it's something really

190
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:45,880
different it's saying oh yeah some of this is

191
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:51,039
hard but how can I respond to this

192
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:56,840
difficulty with kindness how can I acknowledge honor and

193
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:02,559
respect this difficulty this struggle that I have with uh

194
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:07,960
understanding with care with

195
00:21:09,279 --> 00:21:15,919
concern how can we meet ourselves how can we like come home with kind of often

196
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:23,600
like this idea of home is a place where it's relaxed and safe and

197
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,840
warm figuratively or literally

198
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:35,120
and so there's this way in which this uh this journey of coming home might begin

199
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:41,279
with a meditation practice and one is

200
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:48,240
mindfulness kind of the emphasis here at IMC and I guess here I I um don't give a

201
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,960
lot of mindfulness instructions I have this basic assumption that people um

202
00:21:53,960 --> 00:22:00,279
know mindfulness or familiar with mindfulness practice but briefly all say it's just

203
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:07,480
know being present for what's happening as best we

204
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:16,200
can but with an attitude of warmth or care or openness or

205
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:23,640
spaciousness feels like this is Diana's of confessions here I say like for me with a mindfulness at the beginning

206
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:30,320
somehow I had this feeling cuz I so really wanted to be mindful I didn't didn't uh appreciate that I was kind of

207
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:38,559
like using like a sledgehammer kind of like on the like the breath like just I'm here you know just somehow and it

208
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:46,440
turns out all it needs to be is like NOP I'm here it's more like a feather than a sledgehammer because the

209
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:53,480
sledgehammer well maybe I'll just say this you can an indicator of like how you're practicing

210
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:59,200
mindfulness can be like how you feel when the bell rings if there's a sense

211
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:06,039
of oh thank goodness then that that could be like you're doing a little too hard this

212
00:23:06,039 --> 00:23:12,279
little straining too much but if there's a sense of like oh Belle wow listen to

213
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:17,520
how it's like wavering there's the second Bell

214
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:26,400
wow and then you know opening your eyes when you're ready or maybe know some of us are

215
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:34,880
like are they ever going to ring the bell oh my goodness we've been here for 2 hours already I'm sure of

216
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:41,000
it but this journey of coming home this journey of connecting to ourselves might

217
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:47,000
begin with this meditation practice so not only mindfulness or mindfulness

218
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,240
where we're meeting our present moment experience and we often talk about it as

219
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:58,480
we have an anchor mindfulness practice which is often the breath and we just

220
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:04,400
you know stay on the breath the mind wanders that's what Minds do and then when we notice that it's wandering we

221
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,799
just simply come back to the Anchor the breath and then when it wanders again we

222
00:24:09,799 --> 00:24:15,039
just keep on coming back doesn't matter how many times you have to do this it absolutely doesn't

223
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:20,400
matter and then if there's something in the body that's like really compelling or

224
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:26,159
uncomfortable some difficulty let go of the breath and just

225
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:32,960
turn towards the bodily sensation oh the knee the knee and we often we'll

226
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:39,760
look at for adjectives it's throbbing it's stabbing it's hot it's pulsing

227
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,880
whatever whatever is the uncomfortable sensation is and then when the mind has

228
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:52,120
either slipped off or it's no longer compelling we just come back to the

229
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:58,600
breath so mindfulness is just showing up for we have an anchor and then move to W

230
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:04,720
what's compelling so that we're never in a struggle we're never like oh with a wrestling match trying to just stay on

231
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:11,480
the breath when something else is really calling our attention and this is a way in which we

232
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:19,679
just meet whatever is arising with the some care and just being present for

233
00:25:19,799 --> 00:25:26,399
it this way that we can be open to whatever arises I gave the the example

234
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:35,080
of being with the body but it could be with sounds if that's compelling the dogs barking or there's a traffic sounds

235
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:41,120
outside can be emotions it can even be

236
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:47,760
thoughts thoughts are a little bit more tricky but but is there this way that

237
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:54,440
um when we start to do this when we start to do some mindfulness and we're

238
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:01,360
being with whatever is arising there's this way that uh we discover that oh

239
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:08,399
we've been compartmentalizing ourselves like okay I'm going to try to

240
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:15,360
ignore this part of myself that I don't like and just pay attention to this part

241
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:21,080
here and then this part here that we don't like we're kind of like excise it or hoping that it'll go away if we

242
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:26,919
ignore it long enough it'll wither away or something like this but if we're just

243
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:34,760
practicing with mindfulness whatever we're trying to ignore sooner or later will become compelling it'll show up in

244
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:41,840
some kind of way and then we're trying to shove it away this won't work and

245
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:48,080
then we realize oh okay so mindfulness practice is about allowing all aspects

246
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:53,120
of ourselves even those ones that are so uh

247
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:58,880
well hidden and that might only come up when the mind is really quiet and the

248
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,240
body is settled and there's a way that we might

249
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:10,799
have been disconnected from some of the more subtle difficulties that we're

250
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:16,640
having and so we invite them in too this is part of way that we're coming home to

251
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:24,120
ourselves is we're inviting in all these different parts and let letting them in let

252
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:31,120
letting them come home and sit in front of the Hearth and get warm and

253
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:39,000
cozy but there's also a way in which this meditation practice is we can bring some uh what we might say some

254
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:44,360
compassion for ourselves so this is maybe I'll can use

255
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:51,039
this word care is to just this warm-hearted like oh this is what's happening for me and

256
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:56,200
it's not easy but to meet it with some openness

257
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:04,200
some warmth and some care some of you might know that loving kindness one way that we could um I'm

258
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:11,320
sorry compassion one way we can talk about compassion is that it's when loving kindness meets

259
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:17,480
difficulties so this well-wishing when it meets difficulties turns into May

260
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:24,039
these difficulties go away May these difficulties May the difficulties uh

261
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:29,399
diminish or no longer be as no longer be difficult

262
00:28:29,399 --> 00:28:35,440
so this journey home this journey to connecting with ourselves may may

263
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:42,840
involve some meditation practice mindfulness but also with some compassion too because we will meet some

264
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:48,120
difficulties in ourselves that's part of how we come home as we meet all these

265
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:54,039
different places but there's something beautiful that happens with this process not only

266
00:28:54,039 --> 00:29:00,159
do we come home also but helps us connect with

267
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,640
others connecting with ourselves helps us connect with

268
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:11,679
others when earlier I said that it's not uncommon that people are trying to

269
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:17,640
project okay I'm fine everything's fine I got it together even though inside

270
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:25,360
there might be a lot of discomfort or confusion or some difficulties or suffering but then when you start to

271
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:32,480
connect with yourself and you say oh yeah when I used to have a lot of

272
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:39,039
self-righteousness or I used to brag a lot or something like that that's because I was actually feeling kind of

273
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:46,559
awful inside is did the microwave is the microphone still okay yes it is okay

274
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:53,240
something happened just my ear maybe it's different so

275
00:29:53,240 --> 00:30:00,760
the so we might recognize somebody's doing a behavior that we used to do and we did

276
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:06,080
it when we felt uncomfortable so then when we see somebody's doing a lot of

277
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,399
boasting we might think oh yeah they just might not be feeling good about

278
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:16,640
themselves right now they might just uh be having some difficulties and then

279
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:22,600
we're more up to connect with them we recognize okay they're just like us in

280
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:29,039
this kind of way and then of of course there's this

281
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:35,000
way in which connecting with ourselves is helps us

282
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:41,760
to there when some of us kind of like withdraw into ourselves when we are

283
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:49,960
having difficulties but when we recognize that no this is just what it means

284
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:57,720
to be a human this is part of The Human Experience then we're less likely to

285
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:03,399
with draw and try to hide and isolate and can connect with others and of

286
00:31:03,399 --> 00:31:09,519
course connecting with others makes our life richer and often we learn more about

287
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:16,919
ourselves by what's getting reflected back to us by those that we spend time

288
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:23,880
around and then we might say that there's no particular endpoint to this

289
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:29,760
process of making friends with ourselves it's kind of like this there's

290
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:36,279
it's not like oh okay I'm finally done I never have to treat

291
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:42,639
myself with care again it just it's the way that we show up in the

292
00:31:42,639 --> 00:31:47,919
world it's just the way that's kind of like we express

293
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:56,000
ourselves and so there's this way in which the process unfolds naturally it's just this uh this

294
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,120
uh unfolding that happens this way that like okay we care about

295
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:08,200
ourselves so then we have like a little more interest like what's what's because

296
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:14,720
I care like those people we care about we care about what's happening in their lives how they are what's happening and

297
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:20,000
so we start to care about ourselves and like okay what's going on here why are

298
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:26,480
you feeling agitated we might say that to somebody else but we might say to ourselves oh yeah I'm feeling agitated

299
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:32,240
what what's going on maybe there's something vague that we're not even clear

300
00:32:33,679 --> 00:32:38,840
about so this process is this unfolds

301
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:45,000
naturally that leads to some greater understanding from some understanding comes some acceptance and from

302
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:50,080
acceptance Comes This Love Love for

303
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:57,840
ourself love for others and maybe just love this warmth

304
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:06,639
that shows up in so many different ways so this coming home to

305
00:33:06,639 --> 00:33:11,720
ourselves is a way in which it's can be a journey and it can be this radical a

306
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:18,080
move movement this radical shift from trying to this self-improvement project

307
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:25,000
or maybe disowning parts of ourselves to this really different movement

308
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:31,399
of oh what's happening there's difficulties here how can I meet

309
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:39,559
this with kindness how can I meet this with warmth how can I meet this with care and myself instead of the usual

310
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:45,320
beating up that so many of us do not everybody not everybody does this but so many of us

311
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:51,600
do and then to help that kind of like radical shift can be the mindfulness practice as

312
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:59,039
we start to see more and more subtle difficulties as well as some heart practices maybe some some things maybe

313
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:06,000
have a formal loving kindness practice or or compassion practice and if not

314
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:12,760
just this intention to meet with warmth the difficulties that we're

315
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:21,118
experiencing so that we can be at home in front of the fire with hot cocoa and

316
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:26,398
slippers little blanket or I don't know whatever it is whatever you know for you

317
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:33,280
whatever home nice cozy home would be so this idea of coming home to

318
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,480
ourselves and how meditation practice can be a

319
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:44,398
support so with that I think I'll open it up to see if there's some questions

320
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:51,280
or comments uh about we were what I was speaking about something does somebody

321
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,280
have something they'd like to

322
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,640
say

323
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,760
well I'll start I saw a movie yesterday and it had somebody that I I

324
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:22,240
think is an early Mentor for me on self-acceptance oh it was a comedian

325
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,720
named Red Skelton and he some of you may have seen he was on television for about 20 years

326
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:35,400
and he was very self effacing kind of goofy guy but

327
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:42,680
just always had that sense of love and acceptance at least that was my take on

328
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:48,280
it so he was he was an important um role model Al I didn't realize it at the time

329
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:58,040
I thought he was just funny but going back and seeing a movie that he made from the early 50s reminded me of that h

330
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:04,040
that's I'm not I've heard the name but I can't bring to mind you know how he is and I'm so great to hear this that a

331
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:11,079
comedian was com mean has some self-acceptance because usually they're kind of or these days they're kind of jabbing or you know something like this

332
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:16,359
so do you want to give any example Jim about uh something like he would do or

333
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:22,920
would say or uh well it's hard for me to to

334
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,200
exactly remember but there there was something about how

335
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:36,119
he never jabbed like that I mean you know like he would he he would speak uh

336
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:41,760
honestly but also kindly and kind of make fun of himself

337
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:49,040
so I think that kind of making fun of oneself in a healthy and useful way I is

338
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:56,079
is important I think being able to laugh at yourself and yeah thank you for

339
00:36:56,079 --> 00:37:01,160
saying that that's so important right this uh I should have spoke about that

340
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:06,480
this sense of play too right like okay we can play around or experiment and see

341
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:13,200
like okay what how I am or just playfulness in general or something like this yeah that's a good idea thank you

342
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,760
thank you Jim anybody else have a comment or

343
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,040
something they'd like to say

344
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,599
or hi um when you were talking about the inner

345
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,520
critic and I was thinking of kind of the opposite I don't know if this will make

346
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:46,160
sense anyway um I was thinking about fueling the inner critic you know

347
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:53,440
getting in habits of talking meanly which thankfully I don't do much um and

348
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:02,480
then the opposite which I've been thinking about lately when I'm in the present moment and I'm um the word that

349
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:08,160
comes up lately is satisfying so I notice like I was just

350
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:17,160
this morning looking at the light on the telephone pole you know something very mundane as the sun was coming up and it

351
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:24,800
kind of soaking in that satisfying feeling nice and um thinking of it as

352
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:34,400
like the fuel you know to notice ah this feels good and and kind of um I don't know

353
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:43,160
using that fuel and not being and and there is the thing of of not striving to

354
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:49,040
have that feeling right you know oh I want to be I want to be present you know

355
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:57,280
yeah um but when I notice that I am and it feels good or satisfying is the word

356
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:03,079
that that comes up lately I I'm kind of that's the state I'm in

357
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:09,520
lately perfect and this is so great that you're talking about because often you know we do have those moments but we're

358
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:15,800
often dismissive of them like going out trying to find you know something to solve or be entertaining or something

359
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:22,200
like this but I love this just the light on the light post or the telephone pole

360
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:29,760
or I don't know whatever it was fantastic not the same as the eclipse but but

361
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,359
uh thank you thank you there's somebody back there that

362
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,560
has my name is uh my name is Kurt and I wanted to share uh what one thing that

363
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:49,440
came up for me um Robert Duval I I really love movies and good acting and

364
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:56,400
Robert Duval to me is a terrific actor and he was you know um The Godfather all

365
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:03,079
sorts of great movies anyway he was being interviewed um on TV

366
00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:08,839
by I think it might have been um oh doesn't matter but he was being

367
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:13,880
interviewed and the guy was who was interviewing him said you know um Robert

368
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:19,880
when you did this in this one particular movie you were so brilliant and you just got so

369
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:26,640
emotionally um you you were portraying this very emotional uh person and what

370
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:32,440
he said and I'll never forget what he said was and so the guy said how do you do that

371
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:39,040
and he said well for me what I do is I never go

372
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:45,400
beyond who I am I mean I can like you know when I was first acting he said you

373
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:51,160
know I would try to I'd try to go over the top and really you know act in a in

374
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:58,960
a very convincing way but it was but I was going Beyond Myself it wasn't really true to who I am and so he said this

375
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:05,359
very articulately but but it struck me because um you know I've I've done a lot

376
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,280
of that trying to be a certain way present a certain Persona or something

377
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,520
and he was kind of addressing that for me that he never goes

378
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:23,240
beyond who he is so he can go get very emotional anyway you get what I'm saying

379
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:31,280
would you say that he was trying to say that something about authenticity like he was trying to like be like the I

380
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:36,560
don't know I don't yeah well I I yeah I I think it was I think it's more than

381
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:43,359
just being authentic I I think it was also it's hard for me to describe this but it really struck me but I think it's

382
00:41:43,359 --> 00:41:48,720
more than being authentic I think it was I am I'm supposed to the role here I'm

383
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,280
supposed to do is very dramatic but I'm not going to overplay that I have to

384
00:41:54,280 --> 00:42:00,440
stay within my own range uh that's what he said I have to stay within my own range cuz if I try to go beyond my range

385
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,560
it doesn't come across as authentic yeah there we go great great thank you thank

386
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:11,200
you very nice very nice anybody else have uh something

387
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,280
they'd like to say or question or

388
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:24,160
comment over here in the hi I'm

389
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:31,720
Katherine um you spoke about let's see that the tendency is to

390
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:37,359
contain or compartmentalize our emotions or our

391
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:42,760
experience and that the goal is to

392
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:51,440
meet life and experience as it is is there also um kind of the downfall

393
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:58,040
of overindulging in experience or emotions

394
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:04,319
that we should be aware of because there's the suppressing the

395
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:10,400
compartmentalizing there's the meaning and is there an

396
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:17,359
overindulgent aspect that can be detrimental just curious yeah yeah can you say a little bit like how would one

397
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:24,160
know they're overindulging like let's say meeting

398
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:30,720
difficulty in life and and

399
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:35,880
um maybe not meeting it as

400
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:44,160
effectively in and I don't even know what effectively looks like or is um I'm just

401
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:49,520
curious if there's an aspect

402
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:57,760
of just overdoing the um the feeling of

403
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:03,880
of difficulties I see so you mean like being with difficulties in such a way

404
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,319
that it perpetuates the difficulties and you just kind of get stuck in this kind of uh loop kind of like this yeah does

405
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:17,480
that h i mean is there something on that end that we should be aware of curious yeah and so with mindfulness practice

406
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:25,280
there's this way in which you could uh you could start to see if this is a pattern that one has and this becomes

407
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:31,200
then very something very difficult I'll just uh make this up like let's say um

408
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:36,400
when there's a difficulty with one's uh Intimate Relationships there's a way in which there might be just be this

409
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:43,720
collapsing and say oh no it's fine it's fine and you're like not talking or not engaging with one's partner or something

410
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:51,240
and then with mindfulness you start to see oh yeah okay here I am I have this this I'm this collapsed feeling again

411
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:58,920
and it might just notice it because with the body being like this somehow or something but then uh this awkward time

412
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:05,200
is like oh I see that I have this pattern I see that it's not helpful and

413
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,640
I'm doing it again and I'm doing it again right so this is how it starts is

414
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:16,960
that you start to see or understand or be more familiar with some ways of

415
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,800
showing up in the world and then you can't just stop because I now that you see it and it's uncomfortable but it

416
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:30,079
does unwind it does unwind but it starts with having to see

417
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:35,440
it and then and then again you have to bring this kind of this warm heartedness

418
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:40,640
I talked about like okay I'm watching myself do what I know is not helpful but

419
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:45,960
I'm doing it again and then just to kind of this recognition that okay I know

420
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:51,160
it's not helpful but I'm doing it again that kind of like starts the ball

421
00:45:51,160 --> 00:46:00,760
rolling to stop doing it is that helpful I think it is like it's like

422
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:07,359
it's the principle of it but it's like the fine details of the of the doing of

423
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:16,200
it is like to do it with Precision um and knowing this um is

424
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:24,440
challenging yes yes that's right it's not easy this is not

425
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:33,640
easy well so here's a little hint that I'll say here's a little hint that can be helpful it can be enormously helpful

426
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:39,079
to uh Orient towards adjectives rather than nouns I know this

427
00:46:39,079 --> 00:46:45,359
sounds weird but instead of saying um I'm sad I'm just making this up I'm sad

428
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:50,960
say like oh there's real heaviness in the body there's pressure behind the

429
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:57,720
eyes the thoughts are really slow um I feel like I'm can't I'm not

430
00:46:57,720 --> 00:47:04,200
going anywhere so to do a descriptor instead of like I'm sad because I'm sad

431
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:10,319
is kind of just you know then we start having a relationship with this word like sad means oh I've always been sad

432
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:17,280
I'm going to be sad again and I don't want other people to know I'm sad but if we start to say oh I have this heaviness

433
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,640
in my body pressure behind the eyes then we're engaged with what's actually

434
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:30,680
happening we're Mindful and this is the Precision here so and this then things can I keep on

435
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:38,079
using this word but they can unfold differently if we can stay with the adjectives with the actual experience

436
00:47:38,079 --> 00:47:45,920
any adjective is fine you know describe it in any way but instead of just slapping a a label on it so to avoid

437
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:54,640
judgment on it and to give it space with just neutrality of description exactly okay

438
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,160
so like a naturalist would do with a uh with a uh you know you're looking at

439
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:08,200
some creature in the woods or something like oh it does this and then oh look it's doing that you know so same thing

440
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:14,359
this yeah okay so thank you all and I'm

441
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:22,319
wishing you a wonderful rest of the evening thank you
