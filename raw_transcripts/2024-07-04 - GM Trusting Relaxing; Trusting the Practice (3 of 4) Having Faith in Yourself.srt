00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:07,600
greetings everyone thank you for coming and for

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,519
the folks at IMC and in the USA happy Freedom

3
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,680
Day for our meditations this week are based on the Buddhist

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:27,800
discourse on how to practice mindfulness of breathing Monday we drew on the

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:34,559
introduction to this discourse in which the Buddha suggests that we should meditate in some

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:41,800
place empty so that the mind can be available for staying close to the

7
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,320
breathing Tuesday we meditated with the first two steps of the Buddhist

8
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,600
instructions to know our breathing intimately knowing the texture and

9
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,800
quality of each in breath and each out breath

10
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,280
such as whether whether it's long or [Music]

11
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:13,479
short open or constricted and yesterday we followed

12
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:22,040
the third step in which we moved from knowing to training by experiencing the whole body

13
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:29,920
as we breathe in and breathe out training is a bit more active than

14
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,320
knowing and we'll continue in training mode today and

15
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,880
tomorrow with our attention still anchored in the

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:52,200
body but we're also continuously aware of the breathing in our peripheral

17
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,399
awareness today we'll work with the fourth step in which the Buddha

18
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:06,640
instructs us one trains I will be breathe in calming the

19
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,480
bodily constructs when trains I shall breathe

20
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:20,480
out calming the bodily constructs so these bodily constructs

21
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:28,680
are the translation of um Gils translation of the poly word

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:37,560
Sankara where which literally means making together and is often translated as

23
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:44,080
formations the idea of making together suggests that the Buddha is talking

24
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:52,280
about the unity of body and mind our bodily constructs include all

25
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:57,879
its tensions movements or activities whether

26
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:04,879
subtle or gross these tensions in the body usually have

27
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:10,840
their origin in the mind so essentially the task today is

28
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,959
relaxing the body all the while keeping in our

29
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:22,080
peripheral awareness the whole cycle of

30
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:33,040
breathing again as we did yesterday we're ating awareness of the whole

31
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:38,760
body but today we want to see our holding patterns and whatever tensions

32
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,439
we may have and then we do our best to relax

33
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:50,360
and let go with them or if that's not possible to just

34
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,840
try to soften them a little we can trust that the body

35
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:03,040
doesn't want to stay tense and if you find something you can't

36
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:12,319
relax maybe just acknowledge it by gently breathing into it it's

37
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:21,680
okay so let's begin our meditation on relaxing the body by

38
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:29,199
gently closing the eyes relaxing and softening any small

39
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:35,120
physical tensions around or behind the

40
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:48,560
eyes taking a moment to formulate your deepest intention

41
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,560
now assuming a calm stable and grounded

42
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:17,280
posture that can help you avoid any inclination to

43
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,479
move staying with the breath and bringing compassion and care

44
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:28,120
to the body as we do a soft body

45
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:34,000
scan straight stening the spine and relaxing everything

46
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,840
else downwards head to the

47
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:48,280
face the neck relaxing into the

48
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,319
shoulders the [Music] arms and

49
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:05,960
hands relaxing the front and back back of the Torso and letting go in the

50
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,639
pelvis the legs and the

51
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,720
feet still aware of the body and the breath establish your mental

52
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:27,720
posture by letting go of having to be someone

53
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:46,360
now feeling how it is to take a lovely long

54
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,758
calm deep breath

55
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:07,960
and gently letting the breathing return to normal as you stay

56
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,840
grounded resting in relaxing the body

57
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,680
breathing breathing in breathing out

58
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,960
spacious and caring as we bring calm to our precious

59
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:08,520
body keep practicing like

60
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
this

61
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

62
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
e e

63
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:33,640
the Buddha says that tranquility is the food for

64
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:41,720
tranquility so whatever little calm or Tranquility you

65
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:47,519
have be sure to take it in and let it

66
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
register

67
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

68
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240

69

e e

72
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:31,880
often in images of the Buddha meditating we can see a slight

73
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:38,360
smile on his face so bring your attention for a

74
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:43,880
moment to your face and see if you can relax anything in your

75
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:50,920
forehead again your eyes your cheeks your

76
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:57,480
chin your jaw and feel

77
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:02,600
free to let your lips Express the smile

78
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,880
of the Buddha

79
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:45,519
and you trust relax it relaxing the

80
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:53,199
breathing relaxing the body and mind if

81
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:59,480
possible try not to move knowing that stilling the physical

82
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:06,240
body goes a long way to also quieting the

83
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
mind

84
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839

85
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840

e e

93
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:45,159
earlier we practiced noticing if there is anything calm in our

94
00:21:45,159 --> 00:21:51,480
experience and now the invitation is to notice if there's

95
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:56,520
anything Pleasant in your experience of calming

96
00:21:56,520 --> 00:22:01,360
the body as you stay with the

97
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:13,679
breathing or perhaps you can even enjoy being here in the body breathing

98
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:21,279
calmly if so let that enjoyment

99
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
register

100
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440

101
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440

102
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440

103
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360

104
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320

105
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

106
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

107
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

108
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

109
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
e e

110
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:11,000
as we come to the end of this sitting we'll return to our circle of

111
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:16,200
compassion for ourselves for everyone meditating with

112
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:21,278
us today and for all

113
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:28,799
beings may all beings be safe and protected

114
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:39,080
being safe may all beings including ourselves be happily at

115
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,000
ease may all beings abide in

116
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:51,039
peace and may all beings everywhere be

117
00:28:55,640 --> 00:29:01,880
free so to end the meditation perhaps we can all join our

118
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:09,559
hands together and bow to each other honoring the sincerity of

119
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:12,720
everyone's practice

120
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
here

121
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:01,000
e e

122
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,200
readings everyone good to be here with you

123
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:07,840
in our meditation just now we focused on relaxing the body while staying with the

124
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:13,679
breath and this is a further step in strengthening our

125
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:22,039
mindfulness because it also helps stabilize and concentrate the

126
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,519
mind yesterday we talked about s The Faculty or power of

127
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:37,279
trusting taking refuge in the path of

128
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:45,120
practice and sadada also refers to having faith in

129
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:53,880
yourself I'll begin with a passage from Joseph goldstein's book one

130
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:03,480
Dharma the heart qualities of faith confidence and Trust are actual Powers

131
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:09,080
we can cultivate in Buddhist texts they are

132
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:16,440
likened to a magical gem that settles impurities in

133
00:32:17,159 --> 00:32:23,320
water faith in the possibility of

134
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:31,639
Awakening confidence in the moments experience and in the nature of

135
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:37,559
awareness itself and

136
00:32:37,559 --> 00:32:42,559
Trust in the direction of our own

137
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:48,240
lives all of these settle doubt

138
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:55,159
confusion and agitation they create an inner

139
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:01,519
environment of clarity Stillness and

140
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,360
Beauty yes Beauty

141
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:17,039
again earlier in the week I stressed that the good news is that we have

142
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:22,200
agency and one of my heroes Deepa

143
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:28,000
ma said you can do anything you want to do

144
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,638
it's only your thought that you can't do it that's holding you

145
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:45,159
back Faith grounded in wisdom is also one of the seven mental

146
00:33:45,159 --> 00:33:49,840
qualities that support the development of

147
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:56,720
equinity Sada opens us to what is greater than

148
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:04,679
the ego's concerned we open up to the possibility of

149
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:11,280
freedom and come to understand that our limitations our

150
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:19,720
separateness our fears are actually the material through which we discover the

151
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:23,078
truth of our

152
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:33,118
wholeness having faith in the present moment lets us be with whatever

153
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:42,598
arises and that in turn allows us to investigate whatever difficulties

154
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,599
arise The Awakening factor of Investigation is what gives us the

155
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:57,399
wisdom to make wholesome choices about what we do in each moment

156
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,160
the reason that the hindrance of Doubt is considered to be the most

157
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:12,880
dangerous is because it can knock us off the path but

158
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,480
everyone starts out with doubts and we can learn a lot by

159
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:25,760
studying them here's a poem by the founder of the

160
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:33,280
soo Zen tradition dogen zenji the great

161
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:39,800
ancestor he says the peach blossoms begin to bloom

162
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:46,560
in the breeze of spring not a shade of Doubt is left on

163
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:53,839
the branches and the leaves though I know that I shall meet

164
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:01,040
the Autumn Moon again how sleep Sleepless I remain on

165
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:03,960
this moonless

166
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:14,920
night so uh in the Zen tradition the Moon is often uh a metaphor for

167
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:21,520
awakening Clarity in the mind but it it's pretty amazing uh that

168
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:29,880
even dogen contrary to the beach tree knows the without

169
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:37,040
doubt and what's important is that we don't identify with our

170
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:43,000
doubts instead we can watch the whole process of

171
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:51,640
doubting asking who it is that doubts seeing how doubts come and

172
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,760
go and another um problem

173
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:06,040
with doubt is that it takes us away from the direct experience of the

174
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,599
moment so if you have doubts see if you can step outside of

175
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:19,599
them so that you're no longer victimized by

176
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:31,480
doubting trust in the practice gives us the energy to bring our lives

177
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:37,760
into alignment with our highest aspirations and if

178
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:44,560
your inspiration Fades your faith can keep you

179
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:55,200
going in the proximate CA suta the Buddha explains that we all experience

180
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:04,040
suffering and when faith or trust rather than doubt or despair is born of that

181
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:12,760
suffering this sets in motion the whole chain of liberative dependent

182
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:23,000
arising which actually begins with suffering and then leads to gladness and

183
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:29,440
joy and all the way to complete liberation

184
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:39,119
and what this means is that we're not stuck with our duka our

185
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:46,079
difficulties if we trust the practice our difficulties are just the starting

186
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:54,480
point they lead to gladness when we have no doubt that we're on a path we

187
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:02,640
trust they the hindrance of Doubt manifests in two basic ways doubt in the

188
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,680
Buddhist teaching and doubt in

189
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:16,319
oneself I'll never forget how I felt when I first met Suzuki rosi as he bowed

190
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:24,640
to each of us as we filed out of the little meditation space at sooi in San

191
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:31,200
Francisco and in that bow he wordless ly communicated that he literally saw me as

192
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,680
a Buddha and I was moved beyond

193
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,920
words six days later I heard him teach and somehow I

194
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,359
knew beyond the shade of a doubt that I was in the presence of a great teacher

195
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:56,680
and I'd give up anything to become his disciple and ever since then my faith in

196
00:39:56,680 --> 00:40:03,200
the Dharma has been unshakable

197
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,200
but having faith in myself has been a lot more

198
00:40:10,839 --> 00:40:18,079
challenging I know it's true that many of us tend to be loyal to our

199
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:27,000
suffering and to seeing ourselves as inadequate or damaged

200
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:35,839
one of the challenges for me has been the tyranny of [Music]

201
00:40:35,839 --> 00:40:42,839
perfectionism a powerful lesson from my childhood was that if I'm not perfect

202
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:50,119
I'm not safe but actually we can trust that

203
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:58,920
we're all fine just as we are which means that we can all shine

204
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:06,680
just as children do and when we see how

205
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:12,359
perfectionism doesn't serve us and can start letting go of

206
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:17,480
it we can become contented and

207
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:21,720
peaceful with just doing what we

208
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:31,560
can and this in turn counters agitation and fosters

209
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:38,200
Tranquility a useful mantra for me has been good

210
00:41:39,839 --> 00:41:47,920
enough I love what Walt whitmann says in his song of the open

211
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:53,560
road I am larger better than I

212
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,800
thought I did not know I held so much

213
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,200
goodness it's important not to be afraid of feeling

214
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:18,680
insecure after all uh in this practice our

215
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:27,359
priority is to cultivate non- clinging and as human beings not

216
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:32,640
clinging to anything is profoundly

217
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:42,880
counterintuitive Gil tells us that we can trust that the safest place to be is

218
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:49,960
in our field of awareness it's a lot safer to be aware

219
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:56,119
than it is to be identified with a self and there's great Freedom when

220
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:01,839
we're deep ly and we deeply understand the Buddhist teaching on the truth of

221
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:07,640
not self we can all stop worrying about our

222
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:15,240
supposed inadequacies this practice is pointing

223
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:20,839
us to a place of the greatest safety which is

224
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:26,599
portable internal safety we can take into the world where

225
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:33,200
things may not not be so safe and as we learn to abide in

226
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:40,400
Awareness we learn to carry our internal safety with

227
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:47,280
us awareness as the pure natural quality of the

228
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:54,040
Mind awareness is often said to be like the sky where everything is

229
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:59,319
okay knowing that all our mental storms Ms are just

230
00:43:59,319 --> 00:44:11,040
clouds that don't change the nature of the sky we can trust opening up to the sky

231
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:19,000
itself in our meditations this week we've cultivated knowing feeling and

232
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,880
relaxing and these three work together to bring forth the calm and the

233
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,400
confidence we need for awareness to be more

234
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,880
here in our experience taking a moment for knowing

235
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:43,240
feeling and relaxing allows us to be less distracted from what's happening in

236
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:51,760
the moment and when we connect with our Pure mind in a way that's relaxed and

237
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:59,000
balanced our experience of the world is also relaxed and balanced

238
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:06,440
bed and a mind even momentarily empty of distractions feels

239
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:10,920
beautiful and we can't help but enjoy

240
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:20,319
it as the Buddha says with a mind that is open and uncovered one develops a luminous

241
00:45:20,319 --> 00:45:27,839
mind and my hope is that each of you can grow in having confidence in yourself

242
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:33,040
just as you are resting your inner

243
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,280
goodness and

244
00:45:39,359 --> 00:45:46,559
wisdom in the meditation today we practice trusting relaxing and in the talk just now I

245
00:45:46,559 --> 00:45:51,760
emphasized the importance of trusting yourself so if you'd like some homework

246
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:57,040
for the next 24 hours reflect on what you personally

247
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:04,000
might do in order to cultivate trusting yourself are there any mental or

248
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:13,680
physical habits you may want to let go of or how might you pause and relax more

249
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:21,359
often or take a piece of paper and jot down a few ideas then get in touch with a friend to

250
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:29,880
share your thoughts thank you for
