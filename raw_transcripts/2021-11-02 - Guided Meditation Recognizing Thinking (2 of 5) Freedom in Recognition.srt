1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:07,600
good morning everyone and uh happy to be here with you all

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:16,440
and i'm going to start with an analogy

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:22,320
and if you uh maybe you go on a cross-country train trip

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,920
and um you're going along and after a while you just settle into the

5
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,200
train trip looking out the window and and you pass many things many little sites

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:42,239
and after a while you find yourself on not commenting on what you're seeing or not having preferences for what you see

7
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,160
or not being you know having any reaction to what you see you

8
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,280
see and you know a beautiful tree goes by just a

9
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,039
tree and it goes by kind of quickly it's you see a ugly house it's an ugly house you just

10
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,680
see it and there's so much change so much variety so many different things coming through it's just kind of like it's almost like

11
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:11,040
you're settling back relaxing just seeing seeing it all without making anything of

12
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,320
it reacting to it preferring one thing over the other you're in the train looking

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,640
out the window out the window is just the scenery it just goes by and it's kind of interesting it's kind of

14
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,799
relaxing and kind of nice not to have an opinion about everything and and just to let it

15
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,280
be as it is simple and then halfway through the country you

16
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,200
go through your old old town where you grew up in and right through the middle

17
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:48,240
of it and suddenly it was oh no they tore down my school or oh look at

18
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,600
that they put in nice park how could they build this big skyscraper like that in the middle of this place and and

19
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:02,399
suddenly there's all these opinions reactions intensely interested in everything and being foreign against it

20
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:07,840
and then you finish going through your town and you off into some part of the country

21
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:14,959
i've never been before and and you realize wow that was exhausting all that reactivity all those judgments

22
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:20,959
all those preoccupations and then slowly over time you settled back and then it's just the scenery

23
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:28,239
going by and you clearly see it but it's almost like you enjoy just the sight and just being relaxed and looking

24
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,840
it's not like you're actively enjoying or reacting negatively to anything it's just

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,360
just it's a pleasure just to look out the window and see so that one opportunity in meditation is

26
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,519
kind of like being sitting in a train looking out the window and experiencing what happens to

27
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:53,200
us with that kind of freedom that kind of non-involvement

28
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,840
of just going through the countryside in a train and not succumbing to the kind of

29
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,040
attention we would have if the train went through our town where everything is so important

30
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,200
everything is something to have opinion about or react to or want or not want or something

31
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,840
get involved in it's not not it's wrong it's not that it's wrong

32
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:23,280
to be reactive or be involved in the sights and sounds

33
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:30,159
for the purpose of meditation it goes in the wrong direction it doesn't lead to abiding peace or

34
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,200
insight or or developing mindfulness it can actually go in the other

35
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:42,640
direction it pulls us into the world of stories ideas memories plans for the future

36
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,840
so i i use that

37
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,439
i use that analogy to to represent the kind of recognition

38
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,720
we do in meditation one of the for mindfulness meditation one of the great

39
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:10,319
keys great practices that really at the heart of

40
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:17,519
mindfulness is a simple recognition of what is happening in the moment

41
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:22,960
without searching for it recognizing the obvious and um

42
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,320
and then doing so uh like you're going with trains going through the countryside and just kind of

43
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:34,000
seeing it you're clearly seeing things but there's no reactivity there's no

44
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:41,360
assigning me myself and mine to that experience it's just clearly recognized and we allow the

45
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:48,160
train to keep going to the next recognition and the next recognition and there's something in the

46
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:55,360
simplicity of recognizing something where there is a kind of a freedom and kind of a piece

47
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:00,639
it's a little bit hard to find because often right together with recognition is

48
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,000
our preferences our stories our ideas our ways of

49
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:14,080
liking and not liking or all kinds of things it's seldom that we allow ourselves a chance to recognize something simply

50
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,960
so uh just now there was another train whistle very faint in the distance i don't know if you could hear it

51
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,479
and um and i didn't i did a teeny bit with it and thinking i

52
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:32,479
would tell you about it but the first passing of it was um

53
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:39,280
you know in my coming to my years it was like i recognized it as a train whistle

54
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,280
but it was just you know there was nothing for against it i didn't make anything of it

55
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:50,840
i didn't think about my story that i told you and

56
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,960
um so one of the things we want to try to learn to do in mindfulness meditation

57
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,560
is to some degree start learning the art of recognition

58
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:07,600
that is radically simple this recognition is represented

59
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,720
by this thing called mental noting some people like to do it some people don't

60
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,319
it's using a one word note label

61
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:26,800
to help us be with a simple recognition of the experience

62
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:33,520
so it could be sound when i heard the train with soldier's sound i have an itch itch

63
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:40,479
i feel the in-breath in out breath out the theme for this week is thinking

64
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:45,600
and it's possible to note thinking people who normally don't like to use

65
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,960
mental noting as they meditate we'll find that the one place where it's useful to note is with thinking

66
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,560
it's a way of using thought to step away from our involvement with thinking

67
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:05,520
just a thought rather than thinking and and rather than being swept by the thinking

68
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,039
so the art of recognizing thinking just thinking

69
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,240
and it could be the most horrible thought anybody has ever had but just thinking you're on the train

70
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:22,319
you're looking out the window there's no need to be involved in good or bad it's the most beautiful thought

71
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:30,000
anybody's ever have we don't have to appropriate or congratulate ourselves it's just a thought thinking

72
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,120
having a memory just a memory remembering planning

73
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:41,360
thoughts of planning planning fantasy mr fantasy fantasy

74
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:47,599
and to and it's very simple if it's um it's kind of refining our freedom from

75
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:53,440
it and finding the middle way between being for something and against something

76
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:00,160
it's a tremendous power not to get pulled into what we like or pulled in the way into or away from what

77
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,680
we don't like just to hold steady thinking thinking

78
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,360
planning having a conversation remembering

79
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:17,919
and in doing so we begin pulling back away from our entanglement

80
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:24,560
our involvement our participation in the world of thinking and we start becoming free

81
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:33,440
so let's go on start the meditation so assuming your meditation posture

82
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:39,560
and gently closing your eyes

83
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:46,240
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

84
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,920
relaxing as you exhale

85
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:18,399
and then letting your breathing return to normal and continue a little bit to relaxing as

86
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:21,560
you exhale

87
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:27,079
settling in

88
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:54,399
relaxing the mind

89
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,839
the thinking muscle

90
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,959
and if you're thinking a lot see if you can slow down your thinking

91
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,920
think a little bit calmer

92
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:40,120
and then settling down into your breathing

93
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:54,880
and if you find yourself involved in thinking

94
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:02,560
take a simple moment to look thinking right in the eye

95
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:08,560
and like you're relaxed on the train looking out the window

96
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:17,200
note thinking where the note note the recognition of

97
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:24,079
thinking is not the same as thinking more

98
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:29,680
it's stepping away into a place of non-reactivity

99
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,320
quiet openness receptivity

100
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:45,440
and if it's obvious to be more specific you can do that remembering planning

101
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:52,759
fantasizing discussing something

102
00:11:56,639 --> 00:12:02,320
and see if you can find some freedom and calm and peace

103
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,560
in the the most radical simplicity simple

104
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,920
aspect of our capacity to note and recognize

105
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:33,040
when it feels that you found some freedom from your thinking then begin again with your breathing

106
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,600
until thinking pulls you away again

107
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:34,080
if you're involved in thinking take a backward step away from it

108
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,200
then clearly recognize that you're thinking

109
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:44,400
simple radical simple recognition

110
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:50,960
you might feel for or against your thinking but in their recognition

111
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,600
there can be no for against

112
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:06,039
just recognition

113
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,799
in the simplicity of recognition it can be almost like a light bulb goes

114
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:33,200
on in the mind that simply recognizes oh it's the oh

115
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,840
it's thinking it's just thinking

116
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:48,480
nothing more nothing less nothing true nothing false

117
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:55,360
nothing right nothing wrong just letting it be simplicity of thinking

118
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,840
in that recognition

119
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:06,200
when we are not glued to our thinking

120
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:13,919
there is room then to not be influenced by the thoughts we

121
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,120
have to not be caught in the mind stream of

122
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:25,120
thoughts and instead to observe them to be free

123
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,080
of them to recognize them and in that simplicity and freedom of

124
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:38,799
recognition there might be room to think

125
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,080
in beneficial ways

126
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:51,360
in the end of a meditation it's good to think in ways that have good will

127
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:55,600
for the world that you'll encounter today

128
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,799
thoughts of generosity and kindness care

129
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,120
well-wishing

130
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:24,960
and you might say these words to yourself silently as representations or as representatives

131
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,559
of the good will that you can find inside

132
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:37,360
of yourself may all beings

133
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:40,000
be happy

134
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,200
may all beings be safe

135
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:55,360
may all beings be peaceful

136
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,720
may all beings be free

137
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:11,440
and may whatever benefits and merit that comes from this meditation this morning

138
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:17,200
whatever learnings we've had

139
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,480
may it work for the benefit and welfare of the world

140
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,360
may goodness spread out from this meditation out into the world

141
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:34,039
may all beings be happy

142
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:57,320
thank you

143
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:52,880
so we come to the second talk on mindfulness of thinking where the emphasis is the power of

144
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:59,519
recognition and the art of mindfulness of thinking is

145
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:06,480
not to thereby think more it is uh

146
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:13,279
to be able to recognize more clearly what's happening as we think and there's lots to notice as we're

147
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:19,039
thinking and but before we talk about what we can

148
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:26,159
notice in thinking it is uh how we note how we notice

149
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:32,640
the way in which recognition happens which is as i said earlier is the art of mindfulness meditation kind of one of

150
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:38,640
the central features of it and that is recognition is the way in

151
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:44,840
which we know what is happening as it's

152
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,240
happening and not know it in complicated ways like no story why it's here

153
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:55,840
but just the simplest uh knowledge recognition of what it is

154
00:31:55,840 --> 00:32:02,320
the thing what's happening what's occurring so if i'm breathing to recognizing just the

155
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:09,600
breathing is happening not to connect it to other breathings and just breathing is happening

156
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:15,200
if there's a sound just a sound just hearing is happening and

157
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:22,159
and as we settle in meditation that is to be as simple as possible so we're not caught or reactive to or judging what's

158
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:27,279
happening just a recognition it's not an easy skill to learn but it's

159
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:32,320
a powerful one because it helps us be free in the midst of whatever is happening

160
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:38,320
to stand in the middle of a complicated life and to be able to just take it in and recognize what's happening

161
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:44,960
but not be swayed by it or or react it reactive to it just there i just see it and clearly then we have

162
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:50,159
access to our wisdom inside our clarity about what to do in a way that we don't

163
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:55,279
if we're caught up in the enmeshed in the drama of it all

164
00:32:55,279 --> 00:33:03,120
so learning's ability to how we recognize radical simplicity and meditation is a wonderful laboratory

165
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:08,960
to discover how simple it is we can i would be in recognizing and in that

166
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,480
simplicity find some peace find some rec some some freedom

167
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:20,159
from what it is we're recognizing so it could be that we're tremendously depressed

168
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:25,360
and it's difficult to be that it's uh you know very sticky to be depressed

169
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:32,240
but as mindfulness gets stronger it's possible to recognize oh this is depression

170
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:37,919
and somehow for that moment maybe just a moment of recognizing this is depression

171
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:44,320
there's a little bit of like light bulb goes off or a little bit clarity the fog clears or something just for that little

172
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:49,440
moment and um and sometimes you have to kind of

173
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:55,679
say the note a few times until we really are standing in the note and not standing in the depression

174
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:02,000
depression depression anger anger whatever it might be

175
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:08,240
and slowly slowly like this crack opens up and we begin identifying more with the

176
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:14,480
recognition than the state emotional state we might be in oh

177
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:20,800
there is you know sadness sadness and then and then the sadness is not

178
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,320
diminished the sadness is not disrespected it but it's clearly known so we're not

179
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:31,679
influenced by it or caught in it it's an amazing capacity

180
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,320
as we do this we also start seeing more clearly what's happening as we're thinking

181
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:44,720
and that also gives some freedom and so one of the things that's useful in meditation

182
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:50,158
is to distinguish different kinds of thinking so that both the more clarity

183
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:57,359
of what we're recognizing but also to recognize what kind of thinking is useful for meditation and what is not

184
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:03,520
so for example maybe somewhat little bit going from coarsest

185
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:10,000
most least helpful to maybe going closer and closer to what's most helpful there could just be a dream like

186
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,119
fantasies just that have nothing to do with the present moment there's maybe images that

187
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:20,640
are involved and and we're caught up in a fantasy world of the future what's going to happen

188
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,079
tomorrow and um and we're kind of entered into the realm

189
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:32,320
through the imagination of tomorrow or of the fantasy and so those kind of thinking is just

190
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:39,440
recognized as fantasy and it's recognized that it's really a disconnection from reality

191
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,480
we're not really present for what's immediately here for ourselves

192
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,240
another kind of thinking is discursive thought and that's when the mind is having a

193
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,520
conversation either we're talking to ourselves and or we're having a conversation with

194
00:35:55,520 --> 00:36:02,000
someone else we're repeating a conversation yesterday to try to come up with a better response or something

195
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:08,000
and um reviewing it and reviewing it and it's kind of like having a discourse

196
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,200
discursive thoughts a discussion in the mind and and that also is not about the

197
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,760
directness of mindfulness it's kind of removed into a kind of abstraction

198
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:28,320
and and so to recognize oh discursive thinking is happening discursive thinking

199
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:34,640
then there's a simpler kind of thinking which is a getting closer now to

200
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,480
a thinking that recognizes what's happening it could be still a sentence it could be

201
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,720
i've sat down to meditate it's true we've sitting down to sat down to meditate and it's kind of recognizing

202
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,400
what's happening a certain way i'm feeling hungry i wonder you know

203
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:58,560
i'm wondering what i should have for lunch and then as we begin thinking about what to have for lunch there might be and

204
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,000
then it becomes a discursive thought or a fantasy but the simple uh you know thought i'm

205
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:09,599
hungry and and i'm thinking about lunch that's a kind of recognition of what's happening

206
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:15,599
here and now and then it's simpler and then it might also be

207
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:23,040
very simple thoughts in the mind in meditation that are directing the meditation

208
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,640
i'm thinking about lunch because i'm hungry maybe i'll bring my attention to my

209
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:35,680
stomach where i'm hungry and just feel that um and so that's kind of like very simple thought telling you let's go pay

210
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:41,119
attention there or let's go back to the breathing it was nice to be with the breathing i don't

211
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:46,320
have to think about lunch let's go back to the breathing and feel the breath

212
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:52,320
so that kind of thinking it might not necessary to have this clear recognition

213
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:58,400
that just kind of guiding you pointing you to the present moment you might have the thought i think i

214
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,079
should practice in recognition now and you know you could have infinite regress

215
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:11,440
if you say well let me recognize that i'm thinking about recognizing i'm thinking and it's kind of crazy making very quickly so it can

216
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:17,280
be really simple so some very simple instructional kind of thinking and meditation

217
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:24,240
can be very supportive provided the instructions is very relaxed and ease and not demanding not

218
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:30,240
not stern or something and then we get even simpler thoughts

219
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:37,680
which is uh this thing that's closely related to mental notes it's one word um it's rather than i'm hungry what's

220
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,400
for lunch it's hunger or there might be tightness a pang in the belly

221
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:50,320
hearing uh there might be um a warmth

222
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,000
not i'm sitting in a warm room but just a feeling of warmth because the feel of sitting in your eyes closed sitting in a

223
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,720
warm room is kind of an abstraction but with eyes closed what directly direct experience is just

224
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:09,599
warmth coldness coolness as meditation gets quieter and quieter

225
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:15,280
the more relevant it becomes to keep it that simple warmth coolness hearing

226
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:20,640
in-breath out-breath pressure release of pressure expansion

227
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:27,839
contraction not it's not a job it's not like work that you're supposed to kind of but it's supposed to be this it's

228
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,599
getting closer and closer to having the mind be very clear clearly aware

229
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,400
of what's happening in the present moment as it's happening

230
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:44,320
so we're thinking we're just so easily getting pulled into so easy to get trapped by or caught by

231
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:50,720
this is where mental noting sometimes is very effective um it's a way of kind of stepping out of

232
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:56,079
them you know if you're like you're stuck in the mud in the quagmire and stuck in the money you

233
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:02,480
can't get out like quicksand you have to have helpful to have a one

234
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:09,359
foot on dry land to be able to pull yourself out there the classic example is if two people are in the quicksand

235
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,560
and one person tries to pull the other one out the one pulling sinks deeper so

236
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,240
the first one then the other one tries to pull the ones going deeper and pull it out and that person sinks in

237
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:25,920
deeper and they just kind of progressively make themselves go deeper but if one of them is up on dry land

238
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,040
then that person can pull the other person out so with um

239
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:37,599
we're thinking the simple recognition is meant to be standing on dry ground

240
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:45,920
being in the train and in the train looking out the window not involved with what you see but clearly recognizing it

241
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:51,760
so clearly recognizing thinking thinking remembering remembering

242
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:57,359
one of the nice things about these mental notes is that you can pay attention to the

243
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:02,960
tone of the voice that's making the note and if it's harsh or

244
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:12,000
afraid or irritated or something you can feel that in the tone

245
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,079
and the idea is a tone to be very relaxed easy untroubled by what we're noticing

246
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:24,640
that's where we start feeling the freedom of recognition and um

247
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:30,400
so um so it's maybe not easy to discover but once

248
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:38,000
we get the hang of look at how a simple moment of recognition is a kind of freedom a kind of peace

249
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:44,720
it kind of cracks the universe open and you start feeling much more space

250
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:51,280
and start feeling more more peace and and also kind of delight i just find a

251
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:57,599
delight sometimes oh um i'm thinking about

252
00:41:57,599 --> 00:42:04,240
i'm thinking about i need to get my oil changed in my car thinking and i just oh that's what i'm

253
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,920
thinking about and i kind of like oh it's kind of like i'm no longer in the thought

254
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,119
and i'm kind of delighted or kind of amazed you know wow this mind thinks isn't that quite

255
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:20,640
something and um and it's easier to be amazed or to be kind of just

256
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,079
delighted or just free if we step back up on drug land and just

257
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:32,800
really recognize the thinking thinking now it's possible to get busy with all

258
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:39,599
this recognition and and then hopefully you recognize now i'm getting busy i'm working too hard at it

259
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:45,359
and doing too much too much of it the idea is to do just enough to support you

260
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:51,440
and uh some people will not do the active recognition the noting when they're resting with the breath

261
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:58,319
being with their breath in and out um but as i've said they they definitely use it when they

262
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:03,440
find themselves in thinking because it's a with some practice it becomes a really

263
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:10,640
clear way the easy way even to step away from thoughts not be enmeshed in it we're going to turn the

264
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:17,440
light of attention onto the fact we're thinking thinking thinking

265
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:25,440
over time as mindfulness gets stronger it's a interesting skill to learn to be

266
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,960
thinking about things allow yourself to think because you need to think about them

267
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:37,440
but also to be aware of what it's like to be thinking and to adjust the how

268
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:44,160
so the thinking is not so fast not so forceful not so addicted not so harsh

269
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,400
whatever it might be and find a supportive and a pleasant enjoyable way to think

270
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:57,200
thinking can be a wonderful thing and meditation is not supposed to be a critique of thinking at all costs you're

271
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,960
not supposed to think or something or thinking is bad but we are trying to um

272
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,079
restore thinking to a way that is harmonious and peaceful and

273
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:13,760
supportive for our lives and the path to that in meditation

274
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:18,960
is to step away from thinking and in meditation it's the one place

275
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:24,960
where you barely need to think at all certainly don't need the discursive thoughts don't need to think about things that

276
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:32,079
are not present only thing to think about is what is present here and now

277
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:38,160
but without analysis and asking why and keeping it very simple just simple

278
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:44,960
thoughts about let me see if i can hold that in awareness let me meet that with kindness

279
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,000
can i feel that in my body and just and then with as we settle in

280
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:57,359
oh just pressure warmth tightness simpler and simpler

281
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:02,800
so i hope that that makes some sense and uh if what i'm saying seems

282
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:09,200
not quite right for you or understandable at this point just uh kind of file it away

283
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:16,640
and now there'll come a time i think where you'll recognize where it's valuable to do what i've been talking about today

284
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:22,079
and so then we'll continue tomorrow with mindfulness of thinking

285
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,240
thank you
