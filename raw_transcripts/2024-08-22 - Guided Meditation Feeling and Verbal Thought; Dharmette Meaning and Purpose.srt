so uh so welcome folks uh good to uh good to be with

00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:17,360
you um okay let's uh yeah let's let's sit

3
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,960
sit for

4
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:10,960
we'll practice a technique guide us through

5
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:19,560
something but even reaching for a technique is sometimes

00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:39,079
for technique out of a certain kind of bubbling or

00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,119
agitation

10
00:01:51,399 --> 00:02:01,560
craving and techniques are beautiful I used one today sitting

11
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,040
but we don't want to act from

12
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,400
compulsivity even subtle

13
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,920
compulsivity and so we explore what would it be like to sit

14
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,000
just for a

15
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,680
minute

00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:52,550

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:20,919
what would it be to give up all gestures of

00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,720
coping to trust

22
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:40,478
in surrender maybe we say trust in what's already

here e

24
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,160
maybe now having seeing some of this

25
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:50,360
we take some full breaths kind of

26
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:58,160
cleansing releasing kind of breath that reaches up

27
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:06,599
into your shoulders down into your belly might even feel it the kind of ripples of relaxation of

28
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:11,080
your exhale all across your

nature often felt along the front axis of your body

00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:08,159
but uh intense feeling States will coat your body as if with a thin

film of feeling

00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:37,399

feeling often kind of love a lamp like

it's like we're just bathing these feelings circuits

45
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:03,600
this moving pattern of uh emotional Sensations just

live out their life whatever that life should be over

long they are before they self liberate as the T saying

e e

55
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:16,320
we can uh investigate the relationship between this feeling

experience affect anger fear sadness Joy

57
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:30,560

00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:37,800
relationship between all of that and

59
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:52,560
thinking so one of my teachers shinsen Yang would have

60
00:14:53,320 --> 00:15:00,680
us listen listen to auditory thought

61
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:08,079
can sense where you hear it spatially of course it's not actually happening there

62
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:14,759
it's a kind of the genius of our brains but the way that auditory

63
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:20,759
thinking arises is that a kind of

64
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:27,319
sound often sensed in your head maybe between your ears

65
00:15:50,319 --> 00:15:57,639
when we don't hear it as sound we simply obey it live in the

66
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:03,399
confines of the World created by that

67
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
thought e

68
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,438
this is uh subtle of course sometimes thought kind of sneaks up behind us and

69
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:20,798
grabs the attention then we keep waking

70
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:27,839
up to thinking as just hearing

71
00:17:42,679 --> 00:17:46,080
we listen more and more

72
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
deeply

73
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
for e

74
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:13,960
and so we have words and uh

75
00:19:18,679 --> 00:19:25,320
feelings and maybe we now open the kind of aperture of attention

76
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,080
to include both

77
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,690
noticing those phenomena noticing their

[Music]

79
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:49,919
interactions sometimes a Charged thought seems to catalyze a whole set of

80
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:58,240
feelings in our body it's kind of the basis of cognitive

81
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,640
therapy

82
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:13,039
sometimes feeling bubbles up from deep within and it begs for an

83
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:20,080
explanation begs for a story and we give that feeling a

84
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,720
story we give it words

85
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:42,720
sometimes that story feels like a way of explaining the feeling neutralizing the feeling making

86
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,080
it

87
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,679
safe just stay poised in

to have equinity is usually to have

equinity with these two aspects of

00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:40,360
okay so this is from the um stoic uh

111
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:47,159
philosopher senica uh if one does not know to which

112
00:29:47,159 --> 00:29:53,720
Port one is sailing no wind is

113
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:06,120
favorable I was talking uh to a friend about kind of meaning meaning

114
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:12,519
purpose uh and they asked like are there any any Dharma talks about meaning and

115
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:19,960
purpose I thought about it it's like well the one hand it's

116
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:28,760
like no there like very very few probably explicitly address those themes

117
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:35,159
that are maybe more those words are more familiar to western western

118
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:42,240
philosophical traditions uh but on the other hand the sort of whole of the Dharma presupposes

119
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:47,679
some ideas about meaning and purpose and I ask myself the question do

120
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:54,679
I reflect on meaning and purpose not really not

121
00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:01,159
really do I have it I think so but the meaning has been a kind of

122
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:06,600
byproduct of my love not a goal to which

123
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,880
I've aspired and this topic it strikes me is

124
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:18,399
is quite tricky right because Dharma talks are meant to be at least partially

125
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:23,559
a kind of way of inviting folks into a

126
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:28,600
new view you know

127
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:34,600
uh yeah come see for yourself right but there's an invitation to a new view and

128
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:41,799
the tricky part is that meaning involves intrinsic motivation it cannot be

129
00:31:41,799 --> 00:31:49,279
prescribed by me or anyone else to you right this is like very

130
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:56,279
personal and intrinsic motivation is the the pursuit of a kind of activity for

131
00:31:56,279 --> 00:32:01,440
its inherent interest or enjoyment enrichment

132
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:09,399
something um we're we're doing uh we're doing it is its own reward in a

133
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:14,760
way and some of this is drawing on on Research kind of body of research known

134
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:19,919
as self-determination Theory I can I can post something about

135
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:25,279
that um so extrinsic motivation is

136
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,760
instrumental it's pursuing a goal pursuing a kind of outcome doing

137
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,600
something to get something rather than doing something because it's inherently

138
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:45,919
enriching and I don't want to say and no one would say that in extrinsic motivation is bad intrinsic is

139
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:51,120
good but I think we can say fairly that

140
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,600
thriving thriving is a way of living that is

141
00:32:56,600 --> 00:33:04,360
focused on uh intrinsic intrinsic

142
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:11,360
motivation that if our lives are going to be you know animated full of meaning

143
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:19,399
it's going to feel intrinsically motivated and so intrinsic intrinsic

144
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:26,559
value doesn't it doesn't exist for the sake of something else right so this is

145
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:34,600
um the couple the researchers Ryan and DC so they write uh consider the value

146
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:42,279
of wealth if we asked a person why are you working so hard one common answer might be to accumulate accumulate money

147
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:48,159
or wealth if we then ask why do you want wealth there might again be various

148
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:55,960
answers one might be because I want to be admired we would then need to ask well

149
00:33:55,960 --> 00:34:01,080
why do you want to be admired again various answers might emerge

150
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:07,360
because so far we've not reached a bottom line but suppose the person

151
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:14,240
answers because I want to feel loved when we get to this answer we can

152
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:21,200
ask again why do you want to be loved but here our interviewee is likely to be

153
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:29,358
puzzled when it comes to love we seem to have hit an irreducible

154
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:37,358
one subject might say I don't know what you mean everyone wants love or because love is good at a fundamental

155
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:46,280
psychological level Love Is irreducible it is a good that explains

156
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:52,800
itself so you might reflect on your life

157
00:34:52,800 --> 00:35:01,160
what are the goods that are not a means to something else what is irreducible

158
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:07,440
you know this is not not something you think

159
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:12,720
you should feel it really must be native to your

160
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:18,839
heart meaning it's it said um is linked

161
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:25,200
to satisfying these basic psychological

162
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,599
needs and so basic psychological needs are hypothesized to

163
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:39,160
be Universal and fundamental meaning that if thwarted we

164
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:44,880
suffer there and there are no kind of Replacements no compensations for the

165
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:51,480
failure to meet these three basic needs and in this body of of research it's

166
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:57,880
it's autonomy competence and related

167
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:04,560
so autonomy in this context means like being engaged in an activity with a full

168
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,440
sense of willingness volition choice

169
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:17,119
choiceful and generally that's that's it's linked to doing you know spending

170
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:23,400
one's energy doing work with a sense of of

171
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,760
Engagement and I would say but it's not limited to that

172
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:36,359
um Dharma practice I would say itself engenders

173
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:42,560
some we don't use this language much but deep sense of autonomy like we become

174
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:48,680
deeply willingly engaged with life whatever shape that

175
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:54,119
is and there's a certain sense of we also don't use the word independence we

176
00:36:54,119 --> 00:37:01,240
say interdependence but we there's a sense of of Independence and confidence

177
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:06,839
engendered by practice

178
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:11,839
feels freely offered our our

179
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:19,480
energy sometimes um you know a sense of autonomy and

180
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:24,760
meaning may be may be related to some Leisure you know when we have the choice

181
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,400
to do this or that even when we just have a tiny bit maybe it's just 10

182
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:35,839
minutes maybe you're busy with the life and children and all of it it's like

183
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:44,440
okay just 10 minutes but it's like okay that actually maybe rest rest can become very

184
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:50,119
meaningful rest can become very meaningful sense of of autonomy in the

185
00:37:50,119 --> 00:37:58,760
free flow of where you place your attention the need for comp

186
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:08,160
uh refers to a sense of efficacy of of finding um channels for your

187
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:14,640
capabilities and so maslo uh maslo writes um if you

188
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,960
deliberately plan on being less than you're capable of being I warn you

189
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:26,079
you'll be deeply unhappy for the rest of your life you will be

190
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:31,400
evading your own capacities your own

191
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:39,000
possibilities so this is not some kind of grandos fantasy you know it's like

192
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:46,040
I'm bad at like 1 million things and good at like three and I'm unashamed of

193
00:38:46,040 --> 00:38:53,838
the enormous swalls of my incompetence but I know what I can

194
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:01,960
cultivate I uh I also associate competence this kind of basic need with

195
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,920
something like wisdom and understanding if you cannot understand yourself your

196
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:13,920
choices your behavior the behavior of people around you it's very hard to find

197
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:21,119
life meaningful it becomes a kind of puzzle that we don't quite get and

198
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:27,440
so part of the sense of competence meeting this kind of basic need is

199
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:34,280
supported by our Dharma practice where we're growing in understanding understanding ourself and partially

200
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:41,640
through that understanding the inner lives of others one of the fruits of Dharma

201
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:48,800
practice is the capacity to predict our own feelings in response to this or that

202
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,960
to predict the behavior of others to understand how their mind relates to

203
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:01,440
their behavior and this this supports this sense of of

204
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:07,160
competence in the world not being ambushed by surprises at

205
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:13,640
every moment we have to know a lot about human

206
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:21,359
nature about our nervous system about Dua and anicha about

207
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:26,440
unsatisfactoriness about the changing of all things we have to know a lot about

208
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:36,400
all of that to navigate the world skillfully to be more and more

209
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:45,280
competent and then the need for um for relatedness the need for

210
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:53,560
relatedness um this is uh the sense of of feeling connected to

211
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:58,839
and cared about by others this is about

212
00:40:58,839 --> 00:41:04,000
about spiritual friendship about saana

213
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,079
about uh family and loved ones and heart

214
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,560
companions it's about those we we serve you

215
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:23,319
know and um this engenders a lot of meaning you

216
00:41:23,319 --> 00:41:28,520
know I think uh Daniel conoman the the Noel yet at the end of his life was

217
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:35,960
asked to kind of sum up you know sum up his learning and behavioral economics

218
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:41,800
and all this stuff and he was like well spend time with people you care about

219
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:47,359
that was what he said actually an interview when he died just a few days after

220
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:53,560
it you know we know our life

221
00:41:53,560 --> 00:42:00,920
counts When Love is its main currency you

222
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,200
know that um that engenders a lot of sense of

223
00:42:09,319 --> 00:42:17,640
meaning and meaning in other words um will be Shackled by a fixation

224
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:23,319
on I me mine yeah we have to know ourself we have to take good care of

225
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:33,119
ourself we have to protect our boundaries all these things things right um but uh meaning to the

226
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,200
extent that which it's it's where there's a kind of

227
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:43,760
fixation on me as a kind of Island

228
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:50,800
uh that that um really really squelches

229
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:59,119
the possibilities for meaning meaning in other words is engendered by the other

230
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:09,000
and so yeah these kind of basic

231
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:15,319
psychological needs you know autonomy competence

232
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:25,359
relatedness it's connected to um sense of um yeah of intrinsic meaning

233
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:32,599
meaning in our life sense of purpose purpose and so maybe we reflect on this

234
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:38,359
as a a way of understanding our own

235
00:43:38,359 --> 00:43:45,160
needs and uh ways in which life might become even

236
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:53,400
richer so I offer this for your consideration and uh yeah I wish you all

237
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:57,680
