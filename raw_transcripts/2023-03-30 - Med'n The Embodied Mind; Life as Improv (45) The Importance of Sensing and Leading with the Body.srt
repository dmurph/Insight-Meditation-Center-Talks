5
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:34,140
so so this week we've been exploring the Dharma of Improv

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:42,300
or The Improv of Dharma there's so many relationships and uh and today

7
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:49,140
we in the meditation we will explore something that is both

8
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:57,300
very important in in our practice and in our lives as well as its key and improv

9
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:03,660
absolutely key and that is embodiment

10
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,960
we need to be embodied in our bodies not in our heads

11
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,520
to be present to be present with whatever is arising in the present

12
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:22,140
moment and the idea of embodiment really feeling the body sensing the body

13
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:28,140
um not being the head not being not doing mindfulness from the Mind

14
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,259
assuming that it's somewhere up in our heads but actually body fullness body Ness

15
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:40,020
be present with whatever is arising without judgment without

16
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:46,380
fighting against it need for embodiment similarly need to be

17
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:53,880
embodied when you're improvising really be but think about what you're going to do or say but really allow your body to

18
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,100
to sense and lead and meet the moment I'll say more about it

19
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:06,840
worsen the dormant but but to plant the seed for really bring attention to how

20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,420
embodiment can support us to meet this moment sort of jumping forward or or

21
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:17,459
being in a reverie of the past and there's more that I would I would

22
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:24,840
add to it so so with that set up let's uh let's begin

157
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:25,760
the theme of Dharma of Life a Dharma of Improv improv of in Dharma

158
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:33,480
is is groundedness is is embodiment as you might have heard before Gale

159
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:40,320
speaking other teachers myself speaking about embodiment feeling the body the mindfulness of the body the first Sati

160
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,618
patana really the first establishment of mindfulness is about the body the body

161
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:52,800
the body most practitioners when they start practice they want to go to the

162
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,160
the mind the third Sati Katana mindfulness of mind

163
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:05,460
the Buddha taught about mindfulness of the body being Mindful and and resting

164
00:35:05,460 --> 00:35:13,320
in the body first we're really important it's a fun it's foundational practice only later after feeling tone we get to

165
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,560
mind ones of mind so in order to to awaken we really do

166
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:26,760
need to to um explore and really make friends

167
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:32,460
understand how important embodiment is for our practice for our daily life

168
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:37,920
and for me it it took some time when I was a beginner practitioner it took me

169
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,920
some time to really understand to really grock how important mindfulness of the

170
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:52,920
body was and then it just opened up my practice deep and then opened up more it was it was quite profound actually

171
00:35:52,920 --> 00:36:00,480
um when when that when that unlocked so so since then

172
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:05,700
mindfulness of the body teachings have been so important both to me and also in

173
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:12,540
my teachings with others they seem so basic oh yeah embodiment yeah yeah the mind is where it's at no

174
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:18,480
no believe me it's the body where it's it's all at to be grounded to be

175
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,480
um to to sense the body and also to allow

176
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,900
the there I would also say the wisdom of the body the wisdom of the body to lead

177
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:39,140
instead of being in our heads and trying to think and figure it all out but let the wisdom of the body lead

178
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:44,940
similarly in the Dharma of improv it is

179
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:50,640
important it's a it's a primary rule teaching of improv that you need to be

180
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,040
embodied not in your head not disconnected thinking about what you're

181
00:36:56,040 --> 00:37:02,400
going to say in a scene what you're gonna do and especially as you're interacting with others in this

182
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,980
relational field in this relational field

183
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:15,780
in fact that the the basic rule the basic teaching is be embodied and let your

184
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:22,980
body lead let your body lead your choice your your thoughts your your actions

185
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:28,800
your interactions really use the tuning fork of the body when you're embodied

186
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:35,820
use the tuning fork of the body Let the Body lead Let the Body lead the in

187
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:43,260
sensing the emotions the the all the thoughts in the body and again not the

188
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:48,960
control tower of the head but in the body and and in improv the scenes where

189
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,920
people are really embodied and actually as as a player improv player when you when you're playing relationally and you

190
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:03,800
are in your body you let your body lead um it's so satisfying it's such a

191
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:10,020
satisfying co-creation then when you realize oh actually in that scene I was really in my head I was trying to like

192
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:18,060
figure out what to say or what to do and so like ah just it was it was hard it was tight whereas the body there is this

193
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:24,060
both the ease of resting in the body stable grounded yes

194
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:32,220
and and the body um leads really leads and and and gives

195
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:37,320
you the cue as to what is needed it's it there's so

196
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:43,680
much more wisdom to the body than just our head thinking in fact I'm gonna be

197
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:48,780
silly for a moment you know what do we ascribe in the west to be our mind is

198
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:54,420
yeah this much whereas there's so much wisdom to the rest of us it's and in fact

199
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:00,560
um our mind there's the seminal book years ago in in um

200
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:07,079
in uh in Psychology called the embodied mind really an amazing Dharma book

201
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:13,320
by Francisco Varela the the famous neuroscientist the Dharma dharmic

202
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:18,480
neuroscientist um and um

203
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:25,740
Eleanor Raj and Evan Thompson amazing book for those who who are uh inclined

204
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:31,380
that way but really that wisdom the wisdom of the body embodied mind it's

205
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:37,920
it's the entire mind is really in the in in our bodies not just not just in our

206
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:44,640
heads and so much research and actually philosophy to support that so

207
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:51,119
so so the invitation as we as we practice both on the cushion and as we

208
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,160
improvise Our Lives we're all improvising Our Lives

209
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:01,920
is to be in our bodies not in our heads to be

210
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:09,540
in our bodies to keep coming back to the body to keep coming back to the body and I'll give you an example and and for

211
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:17,000
example when I teach mindful leadership and and um one of the things that I teach

212
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,680
leaders in inba is that when you are for example sitting at your desk when you

213
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:29,339
are sitting you're about to send an email you're about to do something check back with the body before you're about

214
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:35,940
to send an email check back with the body ideally you'll be embodied the whole time but you know we know us right

215
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:43,560
we get distracted check back with the body how is it feeling what's happening check back in with the body feel

216
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:50,160
grounded feel your feet on the earth feel your hands um on the keyboard feel your

217
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:58,200
self-present be the step back into the body p and body take a breath embodiment

218
00:40:58,200 --> 00:41:03,960
is um is really the key to awareness is the

219
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:11,520
key to awareness of what is arising what the appropriate response is at this point is it really Wise It's kind to

220
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:17,880
send this email you're about to send oh the body will tell you um

221
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:26,520
and if the body's so agitated that candle could get up go for a walk become embodied really without sense and and

222
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:32,820
and and land in the body so embodiment is so helpful both on the cushion as

223
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:38,700
we're practicing and you might have noticed and again I noticed this in my own

224
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:44,160
practice that when I am embodied seems like there is this big large

225
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:51,060
um you know if if there's a balloons of thoughts then they're under swinging in the wind this wind that way oh you know

226
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:57,420
the same way that with helium balloons we attach a weight to them so they don't

227
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:03,900
go off everywhere body is that weight is that lovely light

228
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:09,020
they're not heavy and you know Grim duty but this this this

229
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:14,240
ah the sense of coming into our own in our practice

230
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:21,119
unmoved unwavering not being pushed over by this thought that thought

231
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:27,660
that emotion but actually having the resilience having the stability to be

232
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:33,780
with our with with everything that arises with this sense of Integrity of the body

233
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:38,960
I love the statues of Buddha all these different

234
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,579
postures but mostly we see the seated posture and there's just such a sense of

235
00:42:44,579 --> 00:42:50,220
Integrity you know his legs again you can be sitting on a chair or or or on

236
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:57,119
the cushion it doesn't matter and yet this as we look at his statue there's a sense of stability the sense of

237
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:03,960
stability of the body grounded stable upright the sense of dignity Integrity

238
00:43:03,960 --> 00:43:11,579
of the body so so important in our practice on the

239
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:18,300
cushion as you're sitting actually as you're listening to me in the in the relational

240
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:23,760
practice of of relating to others mindful listening and mindful speaking

241
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,700
the primary trick or the primary way of of deep

242
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:35,579
listening is to be embodied to really be in your body and listen to others so as

243
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:41,940
I'm listening to you in fact you can't be practicing embodiment you can be

244
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:49,200
feeling your feet on the earth your your your legs your sit Bones on the cushion

245
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:56,160
your breath is it tight is it Loose ah so much wisdom in the body and of course

246
00:43:56,160 --> 00:44:02,520
relationally in improv you need to be in your body to to be actually light and

247
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,619
responsive you be in your body not in your head to be responsive and improv

248
00:44:07,619 --> 00:44:14,940
can be pretty fast if you if you watched um if you've done improv yourself or if

249
00:44:14,940 --> 00:44:20,579
you've watched it you know Whose Line Is It Anyway for example there's this can be quite fast and sometimes people are

250
00:44:20,579 --> 00:44:25,680
intimidated wow how are they thinking about all this it's actually it's really

251
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:31,020
a lot about embodiment it's it's that's the trick it's like The Wizard of Oz

252
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:37,500
I've pulled back the curtain it's about embodiment it's really there's so much Dharma uh in improv it's about

253
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:45,060
embodiment meeting the moment meeting the moment not from the cleverness of your head but but bringing bringing your

254
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:51,500
whole self your body um letting the body lead so

255
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:59,339
so thank you thank you friends may you be embodied today as you're moving

256
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:04,740
um cooking or eating or walking going to

257
00:45:04,740 --> 00:45:10,859
the bathroom oh it was sitting at your desk typing emails and body come back to

258
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:16,040
the body listening especially interacting with others relational field

259
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:23,660
and again it's not that you just check out and you're in your body but you let the body lead it's both the stability

260
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:29,339
and also the tuning for the body tells you whatever is needed if there's upset

261
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:37,260
anger if there's anything that's oh that's not quite right before it develops to full-blown say anger is like

262
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:43,560
oh yeah something isn't quite right here let me check in anyway so much to the mindfulness of the body so much to

263
00:45:43,560 --> 00:45:50,880
embodiment both relationally and on practice in on the cushion thank you all thank you so

264
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:59,220
much for for your cultivation for your wholehearted whole body dedication

265
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:06,000
take good care be well be embodied today observe plant seeds and looking forward

266
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,020
