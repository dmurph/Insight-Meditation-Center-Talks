13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,479
our ideas of past and future what happened and what might

14
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:43,759

dedication or of gratitude

119
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:05,360
to be wow not to be panish not to overlook the

120
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,200
things which are

121
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:18,480
difficult but as a way of not doing the opposite not

122
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:25,880
overlooking the good not overlooking what we can be grateful for because we're

123
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:30,120
preoccupied with what isn't right

124
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:34,720
may we live in

131
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:28,480

132
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:34,240
kind of foundational practices of Buddhism like

133
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:39,760

136
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,679

137
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:03,159

138
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:11,559

140
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:25,159
a wonderful leavening for our society for our communities It's a Wonderful sharing of

141
00:31:25,159 --> 00:31:33,960
our hearts with other people it's a wonder wonderful way to see and acknowledge other people for whom we're

142
00:31:34,279 --> 00:31:39,080
grateful the Buddha had this Wonder has this wonderful

143
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:45,519
teaching there are uh

144
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:52,399
four qualities of a person who is wise

145
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,559
skillful a good person who maintains oneself without

146
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:07,519
causing any s self harm who is blameless and Beyond reproach from the

147
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,240
wise and who generates much Merit the only way the Buddha defines

148
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:18,720
Merit or describes it is with the word happiness it's almost

149
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:25,480
synonymous one generates much happiness so four things four actions

150
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:30,360
four ways of living that the

151
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:38,519
wise uh maintain themselves as a good person what

152
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:52,519
for goodness in bodily conduct goodness in verbal

153
00:32:52,519 --> 00:32:58,960
conduct goodness in mental conduct

154
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:05,039
and gratitude and thankfulness possessing these four

155
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:12,159
qualities one generates much happiness

156
00:33:12,159 --> 00:33:19,600
so it's so this gen uh goodness and conduct is more than just being ethical

157
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,840
it's being generous it's being doing all kinds of beneficial things for oneself

158
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:30,320
and for others there's a goodness there's a healthiness there's a a

159
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:39,480
beneficence there's a benevolence there's a beauty uh one of the words for good

160
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,639
actions the Buddha uses beautiful actions so there's doing these beautiful

161
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:52,440
things but then one of them that's has its own category is a grateful and

162
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:59,120
thankful and there's two words here because the word for grateful in Pik K

163
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:07,839
Anu uh kind almost almost a literal English translation would be um

164
00:34:07,839 --> 00:34:14,760
acknowledgement it's uh knowing what's been done for us but knowing it as a

165
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:21,839
special thing being grateful for it being appreciative of it valuing it and

166
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:28,560
um and then the other thankfulness uh at least in pully uh

167
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:35,240
the the um the Grateful is kind of what goes out is towards the person the thing

168
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:40,878
that we're grateful for maybe an expression of gratitude the acknowledgement of what has been

169
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:49,919
done the the thankfulness is the feeling the emotional impact of being grateful

170
00:34:49,919 --> 00:34:55,560
so there's two directions that gratitude goes It goes outward to what we're

171
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:02,079
grateful for an inward to the the heartwarming

172
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:09,160
effect the inspiring effect the goodness the smile that we're given and smile of

173
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:14,240
the heart when someone or something H happens that we receive goodness we

174
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:19,720
receive benefit we receive inspiration we something really nice happens to

175
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:26,920
us and um and to appreciate both directions uh sometimes uh thankfulness

176
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:33,480
it's only in the direction of others or to what's being what we're receiving the object of what we that's giving us

177
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:40,160
something it can be a calculation and a duty and a custom to be thankful and so

178
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,400
it's only kind of uh come you know tongue deep we might

179
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:51,920
say um and um but if it's only taking it in for ourselves like Ah that's great I

180
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:57,160
feel so much pleasure it's so nice it's so wonderful um then it's then it

181
00:35:57,160 --> 00:36:03,720
doesn't enter into the world of our relationships it doesn't enter into the richness of our interpersonal life which

182
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:12,160
is a huge part of the heart itself the heart is not distinct from our interpersonal life so but to do both to

183
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:18,560
have it Go in both directions is a beautiful thing so this adds points to

184
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:25,319
the Ecology of gratitude and I want to uh discuss a few things there are the

185
00:36:25,319 --> 00:36:33,240
Ecology of gratitude the first is that um uh part of

186
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:39,760
gratitude that has to do with the you know what we receive from the world from

187
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:46,760
others is um uh to appreciate that we've

188
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:51,839
benefited from someone or something appreciating we're benef we've

189
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:57,079
benefited from the air the clean maybe if we can the Clean Air that we can

190
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:04,280
breathe or that we can breathe at all to feel the benefit of receiving

191
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:09,599
food to all these people who work hard in their lives to provide us with the

192
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:18,400
benefits that keep us fed keep us uh hydrated to keep us um be able to navigate this world

193
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:24,040
that provided the internet so that we can be and the technology that we can be

194
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:30,440
doing this wonderful 7 a.m. together so to acknowledge the benefits the

195
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:37,680
goodness that comes from something so that's the first part kind of the first level of of this external

196
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:45,359
gratitude the second uh is to recognize how it comes to us the intention or the

197
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:55,040
attitude uh the goodness that it comes from uh if someone offers us uh a um

198
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,200
something out of Duty if someone in a store is paid to be

199
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:06,880
a door opener and they open the door it's nice we can appreciate it and be beneficial for it but if we're

200
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:14,960
struggling with something and we maybe we're uh you know we're on crutches or something and uh someone goes out of

201
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:21,319
their way to show up and open the door for us they don't have to but uh they

202
00:38:21,319 --> 00:38:27,640
really they really care about us they want to support us they have some Compassion or care or friendliness or

203
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:33,760
kindness and you can feel there's so much more than they're being paid for this doing this nice thing for you

204
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,280
they're actually there's just goodness that comes from them friendliness and so

205
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:45,319
to feel that there's much more being given than the door being opened we're

206
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:52,119
being given someone's inner goodness we're given someone's love or friendliness or Good

207
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:58,520
Will and so that so then the Gratitude we feel has a different quality

208
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:04,680
based on how much people are giving of themselves they giving something of their own

209
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:13,160
heart and the third is is it done specifically for us and uh sometimes um someone might be

210
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:19,760
very want to help a lot of people they do a lot of things um but um someone

211
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,640
maybe Cooks a big meal because they want you and other people to be wellfed but

212
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:31,520
they don't know who you are and they leave the they finished their doing their cooking they gr lab they could do

213
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:39,960
what they could do they have other things to do and um so you hear this wonderful person has benefited you has

214
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:48,079
done it with a lot of goodness in their heart but they actually don't know you you don't know them maybe and so there's

215
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,960
um uh so the the ACT hasn't done specifically for you but maybe that

216
00:39:53,960 --> 00:40:00,160
person Cooks the food and then comes out and actually hands it to you uh and says

217
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,599
thank you for being here I'm so glad to be able to cook for you and you know they're thanking you and you know and so

218
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,480
and so now there's a personal connection so there could be these different levels and the third one maybe

219
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:21,920
is the one that can touch us the most provided it doesn't get complicated for us with senses of

220
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:28,920
obligation and to distinguish uh gratitude a a offer offer of an offering

221
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:34,359
that someone does to us from a favor at least in my English a favor sometimes

222
00:40:34,359 --> 00:40:41,640
needs to be returned it's more of an exchange but a a offering is a gift that

223
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:48,839
someone gives us a gift of opening the door the gift of some food the gift of their time is not meant to be a favor

224
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:56,000
it's just a gift for you to have and so uh then the the How Deeply that goes

225
00:40:56,000 --> 00:41:01,960
into us can VAR can change and that's the second half of the gr the Ecology of

226
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:10,800
gratitude is how it how it moves into us uh we can we can know that we've been

227
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,599
benefited there can be a recognition there can be Inspire the mind a light goes off in the mind say wow that's

228
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:25,640
great but it can be also be a more um a thought an idea an understanding it can

229
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:34,319
also travel into our heart go into our emotional life we can feel softer uh inspired we can feel a smile

230
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:42,160
throughout our chest we can feel um love we can feel Delight we can feel a wish

231
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:48,720
kind of to um meta of Good Will of kindness for

232
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,480
the person who does something for us something melts sometimes something is

233
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:01,839
inspiring sometimes we can be brought to tears when someone does something exceptional to us that they don't have

234
00:42:01,839 --> 00:42:09,920
to and um and so it can go deeper um and then if it at some point

235
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:18,400
in this inner Ecology of it we speak out of it we speak thanks we don't just keep it

236
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:24,160
to ourselves there's something that brings gratitude to a kind of fullness

237
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:29,720
when we speak it thank you um my the culture that I kind of grew up in

238
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:35,720
is it's a gratitude culture as I understand it uh in Norway there's a lot

239
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:42,559
of expressions of thanks that are given there it seems like all day long people are saying thank you for something and

240
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:48,119
um if you if you uh see a friend when you first meet you'll say thanks for

241
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:55,839
last time when you finish seeing them and you're going to say go say goodbye one of his Expressions is thanks for now

242
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:05,559
thanks for the food thanks for um you know all kinds of things and uh and um so to allow the

243
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:10,760
circle of gratitude which it is the relatedness of gratitude to be complete

244
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:16,640
or full to speak it or to act it in some way and that's a third thing we can

245
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:23,839
offer an act in return not out of obligation not out of Duty but because

246
00:43:23,839 --> 00:43:29,760
of the inspiration we have that now we just feel sense of abundance we feel a

247
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:37,160
sense of goodness we feel a sense of this relationship has a now a beautiful channel in it that the channel of

248
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:43,440
Communication channel of connectedness that that can be the vehicle now for

249
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,680
wonderful generosity from our part that satisfies or meets these three parts of

250
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:55,599
of generosity that others can do towards us uh we can do something beneficial for

251
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,839
someone we can do do it because it's really comes from our goodness some good

252
00:44:00,839 --> 00:44:05,960
part within us our generosity our love and uh it can be specifically for

253
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:12,960
someone else and when I went to practice uh in Japan uh I learned especially in the

254
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:18,920
monasteries that when you uh give something to someone you give it to them with both

255
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:25,240
hands and then uh when uh when I study with some of the Zen Masters in Japan

256
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:32,319
and un united states who are influenc by Japanese culture like one of them I studied with Robert Aken rosi in

257
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:39,400
Hawaii and in order to become a student you had to do a formal little ceremony and ask him to be a stu your student his

258
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:46,960
ask to be his student and and you had but you had to give him money a gift of money and there was very particular

259
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:54,640
instructions about the money you had to give him it had to be $3 three $1 bills and they had to be

260
00:44:54,640 --> 00:45:00,040
brand new $1 bills and and they had to be in a nice envelope and you had to

261
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:06,800
hand the envelope to him with both hands so the amount of money was

262
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:13,160
incidental but the the the the whole approach to how it's offered to him uh

263
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:20,800
the care and you know dollar bills all crumpled up into a ball and thrown at him but it's offered with care and

264
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:27,400
respect and and kind of an honoring of him with giving him something beautiful the new dollar bills the new nice new

265
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:35,480
envelope the care and offering it so the three beautiful qualities of gratitude

266
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:43,319
we offer benefit someone the motivation comes from our

267
00:45:43,319 --> 00:45:49,160
heart uh and we do it personally and those things can when we

268
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:56,119
receive that on the receiving end we can take it in with acknowledgement of what's happened we can feel the B the

269
00:45:56,119 --> 00:46:04,960
goodness of it we can offer thanks and we can return the

270
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:10,839
ACT uh through our gratitude so maybe that gives you

271
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:16,400
something to think about and uh think about the richness and the of uh the

272
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:21,680
relatedness of gratitude for this day and then we'll continue I'll continue

273
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:28,920
with this theme on this gratitude week in the United States thank you
