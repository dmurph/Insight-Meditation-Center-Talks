1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,320
and um welcome and i have this in my imagination

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,360
i have this uh kind of an image of all of us together sitting in one very big

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:20,560
circle and that we're all welcoming each other to this into this meditation time

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:28,539
thank you for being here one of the [Music]

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:35,840
inspiring maybe even guiding stories from the buddhist tradition for me

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,840
is the story of the buddha's death how he died

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,719
knowingly and conscious consciously he died

8
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:53,760
prepared to die he spent his last times last days

9
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,359
saying for a well he said it's been his last days carefully asking

10
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:06,400
his disciples if there was anything else they needed to learn anything if they had any questions anymore

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,760
and [Music] perhaps as a very fortunate thing for him they

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,400
did not so that as he was dying he could feel maybe complete with having passed on his

13
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,720
teachings to others and then he gave his very last teaching

14
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:31,360
very last words two sentences that everything

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,520
everything that arises everything that's conditioned has a nature to pass away

16
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:43,040
i think he was now just saying of course i'm going to die and

17
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,000
and then he said

18
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:56,240
keep practicing to become complete to

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,240
become accomplished with vigilance with diligence

20
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:07,280
keep practicing in other words and then he lay down or he was maybe

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,560
already laying down he was outdoors which i find inspiring

22
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,599
between two trees they say it's the indian saul tree and

23
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,959
and he laid down between them and laid on the side and

24
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,480
he entered into uh meditation he entered into deep

25
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:39,040
uh concentration deep absorption went through the jaundice and it's kind of like he took one last

26
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,519
tour or visit to these meditation states that he was familiar with maybe they were kind of a

27
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,599
home for him and he went through experiences of being very settled and

28
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:57,280
focused experience of tremendous joy maybe even kind of

29
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:04,080
rapture as the concentration deepened so deep and further experiences of sublime

30
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,400
pervasive sense of peaceful happiness happy contentment

31
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,840
went further and experienced deep levels of equanimity and peace

32
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,680
this is a man who knew he was dying he went further and

33
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:28,640
went into deep states of absorptions that were no longer hearing

34
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,680
seeing touching the world around him the mind became very very still until

35
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:40,080
finally there was just everything kind of faded away in his mind and there was just almost nothing almost no perception

36
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:47,680
feelings at all and maybe you would think that's a place he would die but he returned he came

37
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,280
back out of his deepest absorptions and went back to the beginning and then

38
00:03:53,280 --> 00:04:02,799
started again and he came to the the middle state of a very deep equanimity and peace

39
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:08,480
and we don't know what happened exactly what he did at that point

40
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,799
but that's when he died and it passed away and um

41
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,680
and this is a wonderful story inspiring for me because death is one of the great uh

42
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,120
things that terrify people a lot of people are troubled by death and

43
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,440
and and here the buddhist tradition offers a story at the center of its

44
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:38,960
religion of the founder of the religion who had this tremendous peace and

45
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,040
equanimity and it's an old man he was 81 years old knew he was dying he was sick

46
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,600
and and and he just uh faced it with a lot of peace and

47
00:04:51,600 --> 00:05:00,240
equanimity and kind of a matter of factness and so that story is a reframing story

48
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,160
it's a story with for some of us story for people that don't have an example

49
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,919
of embracing or facing stepping towards death in a sense

50
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,600
and having capacity to do so with tremendous equanimity and peace to do it in a way that is just very

51
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,800
rewarding very satisfying the level of peace and happiness

52
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,360
and that the process of letting go that death and that kind of circumstance is

53
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,840
becomes a welcome process and in this way we have it's a story

54
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:42,240
that the buddhists tell that creates a very different context

55
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:48,479
not one of fear or closing down or horror or

56
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,800
running away or trying to discover the elixir that'll live us let us live forever

57
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,319
but something something that faces the inevitability of an end

58
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:05,600
with with freedom with peace

59
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:10,720
and maybe there are many endings in our life many challenges in our life

60
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:17,360
that maybe uh the story points to that we can meet it with a level of peace and attention

61
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,440
uh we can practice in the middle of it so these stories of practice that this

62
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:30,000
is what's important the stories that lead us help lead us to

63
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,680
our freedom so here we are now to do our meditation practice

64
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,080
and there is a long history of

65
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,440
mindfulness meditation as being a preparation for dying it's many other things too preparation

66
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:53,280
for living but it's a very important work this work of

67
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,479
waking up to here developing capacity to be here developing the capacity to let go of the

68
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,919
distractions let go of what takes us away from here that that capacity to let go and come

69
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,840
back wait come let go and wake up to let that become strong and developed

70
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:19,199
and cherished and loved and and and kind of a home homecoming to be

71
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,440
awake here might not seem so special today

72
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:33,120
but there'll be a time maybe even not just when you're dying there are times when you'll be so grateful that you've

73
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:39,199
developed this ability it'll provide you with tremendous benefit

74
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:47,039
so now we practice so taking a meditation posture

75
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:53,520
and doing whatever you do to settle in

76
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,240
to be here

77
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:50,880
perhaps with an intimacy to your body

78
00:08:51,360 --> 00:09:01,519
to your breathing and a relaxing letting go as you exhale

79
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,480
each exhale letting go of your thoughts

80
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,160
exhale letting go into your body

81
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,839
here

82
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:39,519
each breath each exhale

83
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:48,279
as if you are the buddha and it's your last breath

84
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,079
so

85
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:38,559
as you're sitting here if there are any challenges for you

86
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:50,799
maybe reframe the challenge either is one more thing to let go of

87
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:58,759
or one more thing to love

88
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:40,000
and then as we come to the end of the sitting you might consider

89
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:48,720
a new way of viewing your awareness your attention

90
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:55,360
some people have the idea i mean maybe not the idea but

91
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,559
maybe deeper than idea just maybe even unconscious

92
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:05,919
that awareness receives the world

93
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:15,600
maybe we're oppressed by the world by what comes to us difficulties and things

94
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:21,760
and to rather look at awareness as

95
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:30,960
something with which we touch the world and it's kind of with a midas touch

96
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:35,440
that we touch everything with awareness

97
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:43,279
with kindness with care if we're fortunate enough to see

98
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:51,039
our seeing sees everything with kindness if we're fortunate enough to hear

99
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:56,240
everything we hear is touched by kindness

100
00:29:56,240 --> 00:30:02,559
smell taste touch even if we think about things

101
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:11,760
and i offer this knot as a thing you have to do

102
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,080
but rather as an alternative that might be better than what you're

103
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:25,120
currently doing and if it's a better alternative you might try it

104
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:32,080
so that when we come out of meditation that maybe just maybe you're more

105
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:37,360
inclined to see each and everything to hear every

106
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:44,640
each and every sound with some modicum of kindness of care

107
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,679
of love may all beings be happy

108
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:57,840
may all beings be safe may all beings

109
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:04,919
be peaceful and may all beings be free

110
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:21,340
[Music]

111
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:38,600
um

112
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:50,159
so hello continuing with this theme of stories

113
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:56,720
that we live by today's focus is stories that open

114
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,799
so using the acronym for story we have the source story trapping stories

115
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:08,640
and then today's opening stories and um

116
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:15,200
i've seen over these years that i've been a buddhist practitioner here especially here in the west

117
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:22,000
all kinds of attitudes towards stories and thinking and words that are dismissive of them

118
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,720
that treat them as traps that treat them as problems that uh we mindfulness practice is about

119
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,960
uh breaking out of stories completely and all stories somehow are our

120
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:41,440
obscure reality or is not quite quite right and um

121
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:48,720
or even even having any words for things words are somehow a barrier towards

122
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:55,440
wordless kind direct non-dualistic contact with reality something like that

123
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:01,360
and certainly it's true that stories and words and all that can interfere with our life that's why the talk yesterday

124
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:08,480
about trapping stories there can be trapping words that keep us restricted narrow tight constricted

125
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:16,158
but there are also words and stories that are opening that open us new possibilities that

126
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:24,000
kind of free us from the traps of stories and for me uh kind of the enigmatic or

127
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:29,040
the kind of pandemic example of this that i love when i saw

128
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:35,599
it or first read it was in the autobiograph autobiography of helen keller

129
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:43,919
who was was blind couldn't hear couldn't speak

130
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:49,720
and she um

131
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:55,760
was raised without any words at all and kind of a wild animal almost apparently something like

132
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:01,119
that and some of you know the story better than i do but she had a teacher

133
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:07,599
who at some point put her hand underneath a faucet of water one hand and the other hand she

134
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:14,640
spelled with her the teacher spelled with the fingers to teach the teacher's fingers the letter um

135
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:20,480
the letters for water and helen in autobiography writes that

136
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,599
the light went on for her she the world opened up for her that now

137
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:30,800
she's understood there were words that referred to the objects in the world

138
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:37,359
and and now she could have she could communicate she could understand she could organize the world

139
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:45,200
that the whole world made sense starting to make sense so this idea that the words interfere

140
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:51,920
uh stories interfere it's not not always the case there are some stories which are opening

141
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:58,160
and they open us uh and they open us from the traps they're what the stories that free us

142
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:04,000
from the trap the traps of stories that we live in and um

143
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,680
so i'd like to uh tell you or maybe a little bit reid tell you a story from my

144
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,000
book a monastery within that in the monastery

145
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,040
after new monastics had been there for

146
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,280
close to a year they were starting to get restless and started to wonder why they were there

147
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,839
and uh had settled in enough to start seeing their monastery has problems even and then

148
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:40,720
a lot of the interpersonal issues and monasteries are often places people go who

149
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:47,839
have the greatest need of spiritual practice but because of that great need they often will have

150
00:36:47,839 --> 00:36:53,280
you know challenges that have brought them there and they bring the challenges with them and and so monastic life can

151
00:36:53,280 --> 00:37:00,240
be difficult with the all the challenging fellow monastics there there

152
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:05,520
so um so there was a custom for the abbess of the monastery

153
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:12,720
to take after about a year to take the new monastics on a pilgrimage to the holy sites of buddhism

154
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:18,400
and when they heard this the new monastics were quite excited they'd read about the holy sites in

155
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:26,000
india where the buddha was born the buddha first taught where the buddha was enlightened where the buddha died

156
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:33,440
and and they so they packed their bags and ready to go and went on a bus

157
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:39,920
and the first thing the abbott did was take them to a old age home

158
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:46,480
and and there they saw people who were quite old and amazingly old and frail and

159
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,839
wheelchairs and blind and toothless and um

160
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:58,320
some of them um you know were quite frail and they'd never seen such a collection

161
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,400
of older really older people and it was kind of a surprise to see it they

162
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,400
went back on the bus and the abbess took them to the local hospital where they saw people

163
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,839
at all kinds of stages of illness that you know dramatic illness and

164
00:38:15,839 --> 00:38:22,079
alzheimer's and major injuries that people had and

165
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,760
living with there was going to live with them there's their life and and the monastics were kind of stunned

166
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,200
to see the collection of illness and injuries and physical challenges that

167
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:39,760
people can live under and then the abbess took them to

168
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:46,079
the to a mortuary

169
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:52,240
and uh to see in a hospice and seeing people who are dying last days of

170
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:58,800
their death seeing people who had died seeing people laid out on the mortuary slabs to be

171
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:04,800
prepared for whatever is next and they'd never seen such a all in one

172
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:11,040
place so much death and so much dying and it was a little bit stunning

173
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:18,079
then they went back to the monastery and they went to their infirmary in the monastery and there was an old old

174
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:24,640
monk a monk who was a maybe you know 99 years old and had a long

175
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,160
monastic life and and he was also dying

176
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,240
but they went to see him in his room and there was a piece in the room there was a serenity

177
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:42,320
and when they went to sit with him he didn't really talk but he was certainly very cognizant aware that they're there

178
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:48,240
and he had this delightful sparkle and warmth in which he received

179
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:53,520
the visiting new monks and they'd never seen someone in the brink of death who

180
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:59,680
had such warmth and peace and love then the abbess took them back

181
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,760
to the

182
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:10,640
meditation hall to give them some teaching and she said you have now seen

183
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,800
the holy sites of buddhism now it's for you to practice

184
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:23,200
and the holy sites were sick old age sickness death and then the monastic who

185
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,960
has discovered peace and and so this story is a story of

186
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,440
reframing of opening up now the monastics had a whole different attitude to their life

187
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:41,040
in the monastery that they didn't have before

188
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:46,880
maria renee rilke writes that

189
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:53,920
everything terrifying in its deepest being is something helpless

190
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:59,760
that wants our love so that's not a story but it's a reframing statement

191
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,119
that everything terrifying needs our love that's a terrifying idea because there

192
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:11,599
are frightening things and now we're supposed to love them but this idea that we reframe we have

193
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:17,280
stories that reframe and open up our world to and

194
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:24,160
people if you have enough of this you begin to appreciate that maybe the trapping stories

195
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:30,960
shouldn't have the last word maybe they're not absolute or you know ultimately true and

196
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:37,119
this is how it is maybe there's other perspectives to bring and good stories

197
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:42,240
bring that bring our opening or are

198
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,440
offering a new possibility a new perspective that's freeing rather

199
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:54,000
than uh limiting and um

200
00:41:54,000 --> 00:42:00,800
so um i'd like to end with a a story which

201
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,960
i'm also fond of that i've told told many times many times i

202
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:14,800
tell it in children's programs and so i'm sure some of you have heard it many of you heard it but

203
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:22,560
maybe as you hear it you can not dismiss it because you've heard before but rather apply it

204
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:30,560
because you know it how's this relevant for you in your life how is this a story which is opening

205
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,599
it's a story from china of a very old

206
00:42:35,599 --> 00:42:40,720
farmer who was getting old and weak and he had a young son who helped him on his

207
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,920
farm and um but they also had an old horse

208
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,960
they were plowing their fields and taking care of things and at some point uh the horse died

209
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,319
and um or ran ran off into the mountains or something

210
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:05,680
and the fellow villagers said oh disaster has struck poor you and this

211
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:11,599
how are you going to manage this terrible what's going to happen to you now without your

212
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:16,960
and um and so um

213
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:22,319
the old farmer says we shall see and so the

214
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:27,920
young sun goes up into the mountains to look for the i guess the horse that ran away the old horse or something

215
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,119
he comes back with a founding wild horse and brought it back and

216
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,240
knew a young horse and the villagers say oh now everything will be okay for you

217
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:43,359
and the farmer says we shall see and then as the sun was training the

218
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:48,480
horse he fell off the horse and broke his leg

219
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:55,839
and they said oh this is terrible for you your son does all the work can't work now and this is a disaster and

220
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:00,880
the farmer said oh we shall see then the king of the country decided to

221
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:06,160
go to war with a neighboring country so he recruited all the able-bodied young men

222
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:12,000
but of course the young man had broken his leg so he couldn't be re uh drafted

223
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,800
and so then the villagers came to the fed oh you're so lucky that your your son wasn't drafted he's here and

224
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:25,839
he'll he'll he'll heal well enough this is great and of course the farmer says we shall see

225
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:31,599
and and there's no end to the story some stories you know a good story is supposed to have an ending but this

226
00:44:31,599 --> 00:44:36,800
story just goes on and on and on we shall see

227
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:43,520
maybe so maybe not we'll we'll see so this is a an opening story

228
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:50,640
what are your opening stories what are what ways can you reframe

229
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:56,400
the trapping stories that you live by what are the stories that you live by

230
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,560
that do not serve you and is there in fact a better story to tell

231
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:07,920
not to make something up but the trapping stories are already made up

232
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:16,480
they're just perspectives and stories that tell of possibilities stories that tell of love

233
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:22,960
to love everything to care for everything is

234
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:30,480
neither a true thing or a false things it's a possibility thing

235
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:35,520
and so the stories that let us live into the possibilities that are

236
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:43,599
inspiring meaningful and help this world stories that teach us to love everything

237
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:49,200
so thank you and

238
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:54,720
we'll continue tomorrow and with a little different twist on this

239
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:02,240
opening stories the stories that release us and maybe they release us from stories

240
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:05,800
so thank you
