00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:05,840
foreign

2
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:16,759
so hello everyone and um

3
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,359
the main focus of this week's meditations and

4
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,380
teachings it has to do with the different ways in which we perceive different ways in which we

5
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:37,380
receive data from the world including our own inner world

6
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:43,440
and um so we you know Through The Eyes the ears the nose the tongue

7
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:49,260
uh through all the different kinds of sense uh capacities sensory capacities

8
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,600
we have for information and from the world and one of them that

9
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,199
the Buddha put a much emphasis on was uh

10
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:07,380
what he called what we sometimes called the English feelings of Pleasure and

11
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:13,799
Pain and that which is neither Pleasant nor Nora unpleasant

12
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:19,080
and um and so we'll do a meditation on Pleasure

13
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:25,979
and Pain but I'd like to do it in a different way than Buddhism usually emphasizes

14
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:32,900
I think some ways Buddhism for very wise reasons will sometimes

15
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:38,220
narrow the focus on the feelings and feeling tones of Pleasure and Pain to

16
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:45,840
the Simplicity of just a pleasure part and the pain part because in some ways that's what we react to the most or it's

17
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:52,439
one of the Avenues of learning how to be equanimous learning how to be comfortable or equanimous with pain or

18
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:59,880
pleasure but in terms of uh our our attentional

19
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:06,420
faculties how we take in information the world of Pleasure and Pain has a

20
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:12,540
much uh has a big impact on us uh it involves all these pleasure

21
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:19,140
involves all these different pleasure centers in the brain all these different uh information comes

22
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:27,300
through Pleasure and Pain something as simple as thirst when we start feeling uncomfortable with

23
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:34,260
the balance of sodium and other things in our you know in our in our

24
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:39,840
in the fluids of our body the fluid balance we feel thirsty and that's a

25
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,760
kind of and that can be kind of uncomfortable it's kind of uh unpleasant experience that motivates us

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,300
we can drink plenty and feel pleasure and that pleasure is an indication that you know that we're doing well we're

27
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,180
hydrating ourselves and so there's lots of different things that are happening with Pleasure and

28
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:07,140
Pain that our system is taking in and operating under and and we're adjusting

29
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:13,680
accordingly we don't just simply sit quietly knowing Pleasure and Pain we our

30
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,800
system our body biologically physiologically hormonally all kinds of ways

31
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:26,099
um uh are involved in processes that involve Pleasure and Pain

32
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:34,140
so to meditate is not uh with Pleasure and Pain and having Equanimity about it is not

33
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:40,140
just to have equanimity but it's also to be able to be more

34
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:45,480
attuned to the uh to the full spectrum of what's

35
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:53,159
happening when we have pleasure in pain to be able to listen deeply and what else is being conveyed here with those

36
00:03:53,159 --> 00:04:00,959
Sensations with those feelings and this is not a time to think a lot about it and react and figure out things

37
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,659
what to do but rather certainly to have Equanimity about it and just kind of continue

38
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:14,159
practicing but the um but the idea of equanimity and mindfulness awareness of

39
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,340
Pleasure and Pain in an open way is so that we can kind of go through the door

40
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:27,740
of Pleasure and Pain to allow our whole system of attention focus awareness

41
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:34,100
to operate more harmoniously more fully the way that it does even

42
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:40,500
unconsciously even without us trying to do something

43
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:48,180
um it's all operates much of this is operating on a deep level within us but it up my proposal is that the whole

44
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,940
thing works better when it's done uh when we create room

45
00:04:53,940 --> 00:05:00,360
and awareness room in attention kind of imaginary room that allows it all to be

46
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:08,340
there without any interruptions without any hindrances without any interference on

47
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:16,259
our part so hopefully that was a little bit quick and and uh understandable enough

48
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:22,440
and we'll start and I start sitting here with some

49
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,380
pleasure of being together with all of you and being able to share this practice with

50
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:37,020
you and perhaps you have some pleasure in a simple maybe very mild pleasure

51
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,180
to be getting ready for meditation

52
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:48,360
and to gently close your eyes and to feel

53
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:56,659
make room for whatever sense of pleasure there might be your body right now

54
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:02,479
it could be as simple as some tingling in your arms

55
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:11,360
it could be the ways in which your body is comfortable in your posture

56
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:24,919
that pleasure of being able to begin a session of meditation

57
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:33,979
may be a pleasure of anticipation the pleasure of relief

58
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:43,759
the pleasure of becoming more connected and intimate with oneself

59
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:58,280
there might be simple physical pleasures of the hands touching

60
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:04,759
the feeling of warmth if you're warm or

61
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:22,139
if you use recently had breakfast or coffee or something before sitting down

62
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:28,860
maybe there's some lingering pleasure or physiological pleasure in the belly and

63
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:31,819
in you

64
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:38,180
from what you ate and drank

65
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:48,139
there might be a range of Pleasures in the body

66
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:54,500
that if you sit down and just matter of factly kind of begin focusing on your breath

67
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,599
you wouldn't notice or even recognize

68
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:13,860
and then very gently not too much

69
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:20,879
take a few long slow deep breaths as if the exhale the egg as if the

70
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:28,460
inhale is spreading throughout all the areas of pleasure in your body

71
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:37,919
even if you have pain it's okay to let that kind of be in the background for a few moments

72
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,800
and just with the inhales it's like a wave maybe of a tension from

73
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,360
the inhale out throughout the body feeling the pleasures

74
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:08,279
and on the exhale letting it all relax all settle

75
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:16,399
they exhale the body even the pleasures can settle

76
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:34,640
gently let your breathing return to normal

77
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:53,540
and finding the areas in your body where there's pleasure pleasantness

78
00:09:54,120 --> 00:10:00,920
feeling of satisfaction or contentment

79
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:06,500
simple physical pleasure even though the mildest kind

80
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:16,860
and as you exhale let that settle and spread a little bit

81
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:20,240
around wherever it is

82
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,839
and then with the mind

83
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:10,260
as you exhale let the mind or thinking mind relax

84
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:14,120
the thoughts become quieter

85
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:32,279
and if any of your thoughts are Pleasant

86
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:37,940
feel the pleasure of them as you relax and quiet the mind

87
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,620
if you're not thinking pleasant thoughts

88
00:11:52,500 --> 00:12:00,420
maybe calmly and quietly see if you can have pleasant thoughts

89
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:07,640
that are appropriate for you to have

90
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:25,399
and feeling the pleasure of those thoughts the pleasantness

91
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:48,779
if it feels Pleasant to have the thinking quieter and calmer

92
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:56,779
letting go of thoughts difficult thoughts let go

93
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:02,899
settle the thinking mind

94
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:30,839
and then with a quiet mind quiet attention that's not trying to

95
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:36,360
change anything make anything happen anything go away

96
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:44,540
not trying to analyze or understand very simple attention

97
00:13:45,899 --> 00:13:50,600
Let There Be awareness of the pleasures

98
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:57,260
within the body and the heart and the mind

99
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:03,380
making room for it all

100
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:14,100
breathing with whatever Pleasures there are

101
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:17,899
appreciating that pleasures

102
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:28,940
might be connected to Deep Integrated Systems of

103
00:14:30,899 --> 00:14:36,019
your biological mental processes

104
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:44,899
built into being a human sitting quietly breathing

105
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:54,800
with all the pleasures that's available sitting here allowing it to be there making room

106
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,600
and you become quieter in your mind so there's greater sensitivity to the

107
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:23,720
pleasures of Within

108
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:45,500
every time you exhale letting go of your thoughts

109
00:19:48,299 --> 00:19:52,880
so you're more sensitive to pleasure

110
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:48,620
foreign

111
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:23,960
if you have sensations of pleasure

112
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:31,320
there are two things happening the sensations

113
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,899
and the sensing of them

114
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:44,220
if the sensations are Pleasant is sensing

115
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,780
also Pleasant

116
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:56,000
and if the sensing is Pleasant

117
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:04,500
is the knowing of pleasure The Knowing of sensing the awareness of

118
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:13,158
it might it also have some pleasantness pleasantness or pleasure as part of it

119
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:24,200
the broader sense of being conscious

120
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:32,000
does it share in some of the pleasantness pleasure that's known

121
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:58,440
and if there is let the pleasure of awareness

122
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:06,620
however small it is let it spread

123
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:54,140
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

124
00:26:55,460 --> 00:27:01,140
imagine that the pleasantness the pleasures you feel

125
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,720
your body your mind your awareness

126
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:16,460
radiates from you flows out into the space around you

127
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,200
out into the world

128
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:31,919
touching others has a bridge to others

129
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,340
that will carry your wishes well wishes for them

130
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:46,400
riding on whatever way you feel pleasure

131
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:56,120
offer these wishes may all beings be happy

132
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:04,940
may all beings be safe

133
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:16,220
may all beings be peaceful

134
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:27,200
may all beings be free

135
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:37,820
and may the simple awareness of pleasure

136
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:47,960
be a guide to happiness safety Peace and Freedom

137
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:07,419
[Music]

138
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:21,240
thank you and little afternote

139
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:27,899
um I want to apologize to those of you who's have chronic pain and that that is

140
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:33,600
really prominent and an emphasis on Pleasure like this maybe

141
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:39,120
makes the pain even more challenging and so I apologize and there's a whole way

142
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:45,840
of doing this kind of meditation with pain and as well that can be very useful but maybe we'll get to that at some

143
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,799
point and I also apologize a little bit for all the Talking I do during these

144
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:58,260
meditations it'd be nice if there's more silence and so but I'm also trying to teach some

145
00:29:58,260 --> 00:30:04,500
things and it would be lovely if you made up for my talking by meditating

146
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,539
later with some silence and finally

147
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:15,659
um well I have about water and stuff it'd be nice to have some comments maybe maybe a very brief comments a couple of

148
00:30:15,659 --> 00:30:22,320
words or something word two or three about what it was like to do that meditation and um and then

149
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:27,679
helps me prepare me for what I'm going to say next thank you

150
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:38,279
so thank you for the comments and I appreciate appreciate the full range of them

151
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:45,299
and and I'll read I'm going to start now with the teaching and I'll read the rest

152
00:32:45,299 --> 00:32:49,700
of that come later I appreciate them very much

153
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:01,159
so as a repeating what I've said the first few days I understand

154
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:06,679
Consciousness or awareness I use the words more or less synonymously

155
00:33:06,679 --> 00:33:14,640
as in the sense what people have that it's a a thing uh you know that we have this

156
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:21,299
thing called consciousness um whatever that might might be kind of a something that's always there maybe

157
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:27,139
something that has some kind of you units here you you kind of uh

158
00:33:27,299 --> 00:33:34,980
United feeling or a whole feeling people talk about Consciousness that

159
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:42,320
um as a thing the degree to which it is a thing it's a

160
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:48,600
um it's a Gestalt It's a combination of many different things integrated together many different biological

161
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:54,179
physiological and mental cognitive faculties kind of working together in a

162
00:33:54,179 --> 00:34:02,039
whole um and uh without necessarily our choice

163
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:10,080
or our direction for how it's be done and um and the the holistic working of

164
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:16,980
it all can make it feel like there is such a thing as Consciousness which is uh its own thing

165
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:22,138
um and with the idea that when every some people have the idea when everything else disappears but always

166
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:29,520
will remain to some kind of pristine consciousness uh I don't think that's the idea of the

167
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,118
of early Buddhism but um the idea that uh that what we call

168
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:42,300
consciousness of the idea we have of it is a sum total of all these different attentional faculties we have in

169
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:52,138
cognitive functionings that we have I think is a very rich idea and um and is conducive to uh putting

170
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:58,260
greater value in our capacity to be aware to be attentive because the whole

171
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,200
attentional system works better when it's kind of all being known or

172
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:11,280
there's space for it all to be there there's if we're caught up in preoccupations it's like we almost limit

173
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:19,640
how much space there is in the mind or how much free um Ram there is in the mind for

174
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:27,540
processing and working of all the other things that can be going on and sometimes even the

175
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:33,599
um you know we reach the limit of how much our active memory can handle and so

176
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:40,940
we get stressed and and things begin kind of breaking down and the kind of psychological biological system

177
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:46,800
uh I mean something as simple as being so busy with work and activities and

178
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:52,800
doing things that we forget to drink and even though their body has signals it'll

179
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,820
tell you you're thirsty they're overridden by the intensity of focus on something and so that's true with many things in

180
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:05,640
our life that that if we're too focused or too preoccupied we're not going to

181
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:12,060
Avail ourselves or notice the uh and allow to function all the rich uh

182
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:18,540
systems of attention and data Gathering and processing that exists within us

183
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:24,180
and so one of those is the pleasant the capacity to feel

184
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:29,760
Pleasure and Pain these are very important parts of life without this our

185
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:34,800
life would probably not really work people who don't feel pain sometimes

186
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,400
will damage themselves tremendously because they don't have to get the signal that um that you know they put

187
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:47,339
their hand off the hot stove or that they should stop uh you know sawing into

188
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:52,800
their fingers when they're actually trying to saw the bread or the vegetables

189
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,280
the idea that pain um you know there are a few people in the world apparently can't feel pain

190
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:06,000
there's a and imagine there's people who can't feel pleasure and that's unfortunate just for the pleasure's sake

191
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,560
but uh pleasure is the vehicle in which other information is coming to us

192
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:20,119
and uh and other systems within us that begin operating and as I said before I think in Buddhism

193
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:25,440
where there's a very strong mindfulness practice strong emphasis on being

194
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:32,640
present for the pleasant and pleasure of of our experience that's a very valuable exercise to do

195
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:40,800
it's very valuable to tune into it and develop Equanimity to it but then but it's also valuable because if we have

196
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:47,579
Equanimity and allow the Pleasure and Pain to be there we might also start appreciating that

197
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:56,160
it's part of a uh it's can it's not just kind of mechanistic Pleasure and Pain it's uh the part of it's the kind of

198
00:37:56,160 --> 00:38:03,720
visible or the felt part of a bigger system of uh of uh

199
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:10,619
of human functioning going on uh behind that Earth as part of it so if something

200
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:16,980
simple as a human touch human touch can feel Pleasant and and that's nice that

201
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:24,000
it's pleasant but there can be so much so much can happen physiologically and psychologically with physical touch if

202
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:29,940
it's Pleasant that it can be reassuring it can be nurturing uh you know

203
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:37,320
um you know touching a a child or holding it baby holding a preme is necessary for them to

204
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:43,020
really be able to mature the whole system of a premature baby

205
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:48,119
um and so this idea of touch uh supports

206
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,339
the growth and the development of some of human beings as they grow up as

207
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:59,099
children touch is valuable for our sense of safety a sense of social connection a

208
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:07,320
sense of um nourishment inside and so the pleasure of social touch is fantastic

209
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:15,060
there's the the pleasures then of sexual touch and um and that can also be wonderful

210
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:22,380
but sex that has a very different mechanism maybe or other things going on involved there too and and a sexual

211
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:28,640
touch the pleasure there is so clearly connected to so much more than just the

212
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:33,839
place that's being touched it's part of a bigger system and

213
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:40,260
hormones and all kinds of things going on aesthetic pleasure where does that come

214
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:46,800
from and what what are all the systems that are operating when we see something really beautiful in nature or or we see

215
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:53,460
beautiful art or something the sense out of satisfaction inspiration you might feel that the

216
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:59,520
inspiration might feel very pleasant that pleasure is more than just some simple pleasure there's probably all

217
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,460
kinds of processes within us that have been activated

218
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:10,619
and apparently there are many pleasure centers in the brain

219
00:40:10,619 --> 00:40:16,200
and so uh so these you know just pleasure is not just you know physical

220
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:22,200
pleasure or the sensations the sensing itself being Pleasant it's processed in

221
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:28,020
the brain and um and so to allow ourselves to have

222
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:33,079
sinful pleasures and not deny them can be very helpful

223
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:39,960
for this integrated awareness full awareness that we're trying to develop

224
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,660
in mindfulness and um and as that gets developed it

225
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:52,560
also then hopefully develops our capacity to be with pain that we're not holding on to pleasure or

226
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,099
expecting it to be there all the time but we're also learning a a

227
00:40:58,099 --> 00:41:05,520
non-reactive uh way of being with all of all things because pain too is an

228
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,460
important system for us and what I've learned through mindfulness practice is that I've

229
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:17,520
learned to pay careful attention to pain when it arises um because part of the function of pain

230
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:24,420
sometimes it's a danger signal and sometimes I pay attention and if I

231
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:31,859
could feel that there's a little bit of signal of danger or in the pain itself and I can't specify how that is or how I

232
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:37,560
know but sometimes it's clear there's a danger something's about to go wrong or

233
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:42,780
bad and other times it feels like okay this is this pain is okay it's you know

234
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:48,480
who knows I I injured myself the injury injury is over over but now it's healing

235
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:55,079
and and now there's pain they're just there that's left over that needs to be there until it settles down and I don't

236
00:41:55,079 --> 00:42:01,320
feel a danger anymore and so if I feel danger then I'll then I

237
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:06,359
don't just practice mindfulness and acceptance of it um I will try to avoid the danger if

238
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:13,619
it's possible I'll try to like if I'm sitting in meditation and I feel a sense of danger in how I'm sitting I'll change

239
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:18,720
my posture but if I don't feel that sense of danger then I don't

240
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:24,420
so this pain is also connected to all kinds of uh deeper systems that are

241
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:31,859
providing information and so as we begin tuning into this world of Pleasure and

242
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:38,160
Pain uh the um that itself can feed back onto

243
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:44,640
what we might call Consciousness or the sense we have of awareness and the sense of awareness and

244
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:50,700
Consciousness can take a different shape depending on

245
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:56,520
uh you know I know exactly shape is the right word these are all metaphors or something that doesn't really exist but

246
00:42:56,520 --> 00:43:03,359
we have a kind of a intuitive sense for and so uh the Consciousness or awareness

247
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:10,500
can can feel either contracted or expanded expensive it can feel tense if

248
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:16,920
there's a lot of pain and they can feel the pleasure and in it and the kind of goodness and it then it expands

249
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:22,319
and so so much so that some people feel that Consciousness in and of itself

250
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:27,540
um has Bliss as part of it and I don't know if it you know I don't

251
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:34,500
think it's in and of itself but as things get simpler and simpler and quieter and the an awareness can can

252
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:40,200
tune into these other systems that are working in harmony the sense of Harmony

253
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:45,540
it creates a pleasure for awareness itself and so there's many Pleasures the

254
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:52,560
pleasures of sleep the pleasures of eating the pleasures of of the drinking the pleasures of sex the pleasures of

255
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:59,160
exercise all these can provide Pleasures not just the physiological surface pleasure of

256
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:06,000
the moment but they tap into something deeper Within and maybe a sense of satisfaction and

257
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:12,720
inspiration something so so this is the Pleasure and Pain is

258
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:18,900
part of the part the pieces of this Gestalt this whole that contributes to

259
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:24,480
our sense of being conscious and so what I'd like to suggest for you

260
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:32,339
if you would like for the next 24 hours is to give a kind of respectful

261
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:39,540
attention maybe even reverential attention to The Simple Pleasures and pain of

262
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:44,640
daily life with the assumption that they're not simple

263
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,339
they're just like kind of like the tip of a vast inner Network and maybe even

264
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:57,960
interpersonal Network that is somehow being conveyed or carried or evoked by

265
00:44:57,960 --> 00:45:05,040
the Pleasure and Pain and offering respect to that means make room feel that feel what's going on in

266
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:12,060
some bigger bigger way allow yourself to feel that pleasure allow yourself to feel the pain so you

267
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:17,420
can not feel pain or pleasure for itself but see if it kind of helps you connect

268
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:24,900
to uh some deeper or Fuller dimensions of who you how your system how your body

269
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:30,780
mind works so um

270
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:38,280
thank you very much and um I look forward to continue on this theme

271
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:43,220
of our attentional faculties tomorrow
