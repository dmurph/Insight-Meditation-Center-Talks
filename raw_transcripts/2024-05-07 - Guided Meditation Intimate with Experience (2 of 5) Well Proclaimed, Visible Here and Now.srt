1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:11,120
good morning folks good day good evening whatever time it is for you where where

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:18,520
you're located in the in the world and again I'm really happy to be

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:24,119
here with you this week while Gil's teaching and retreat at at IRC or

4
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,960
Retreat Center in Santa Cruz and I think uh

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:39,960
here it is the top of the hour and let's sit

6
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:50,039
together so I can hear you all adjusting your posture as the chairs squeaking and

7
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:56,480
cushions moving so if we were in a hall

8
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:05,600
together so uh as I suggested yesterday you know taking taking a posture that

9
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,280
allows you to stay connected to your experience whether you're sitting on a

10
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:17,680
chair or a cushion or lying down possibly standing up that's a completely

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:24,560
legitimate posture for for meditation um really key into

12
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:31,159
what's what happening in the body is there upright

13
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:36,399
lightess is there uh

14
00:01:36,399 --> 00:01:41,680
alertness along with a sense of relaxation so you might just

15
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:48,079
scan scan for attention to any of the kind of Habitual places that you

16
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:53,399
know you you carry it and see if you can let that just

17
00:01:53,399 --> 00:02:01,399
relax a little bit ease up as much as possible

18
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:07,759
those common areas in the head and neck and

19
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:15,480
shoulders the belly sometimes the chest can

20
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:23,400
be contracted so the breath doesn't flow well

21
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:33,640
just taking a little journey around the body to see where there's tension and seeing if that that can ease

22
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:46,640
up we want a a a posture that really supports us being present that supports

23
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,840
being aware of what we're experiencing in the body and in the

24
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,760
mind and I I encourage you just to to revisit any

25
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,519
habitually uh tight places in the body occasionally during the sit just letting

26
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,959
them soften if possible each

27
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:24,879
time just becoming aware of what it's

28
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,760
like to be sitting here

29
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:40,360
be meditating preparing to meditate however

30
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,959
you think of it

31
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,920
perhaps you can hear the the beep beep of

32
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:13,720
the the garbage truck outside my

33
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:18,359
house Tuesday Morning

34
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:24,959
special one sound can just be heard

35
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,759
it rises and it

36
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:45,120
passes and I I invite you to let your breathing be at the Forefront of your

37
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,400
awareness for for a time this

38
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:59,720
morning the the rhythm of the of the breathing

39
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:07,759
be a a help to settling the Mind settling the body if that works for

40
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:17,680
you think that the rhythmic aspect of the breath can can help to calm the

41
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,919
whole organism both both our minds and our

42
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
bodies

43
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
e

44
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
e e

45
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,199
our practice of mindfulness mindful awareness is

46
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,319
uh is to know our experience as it

47
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:27,440
unfolds excuse me and become more and more intimate

48
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:33,759
with our our lived EXP experience to really know it to know our

49
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:41,080
bodies to know our minds it's quite simple our our

50
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,039
experience can be known just as it

51
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:55,960
happens so let let let the mind be awake aware and uh and whatever is arising

52
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:02,319
within you whether it's uh bodily sens Sensations other than the breath

53
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:11,800
sensations of breath thoughts emotions movements of energy tingling

54
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,720
pulsing just let it all be known whatever is

55
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:34,599
rising and if you find yourself not knowing but just lost in thought can

56
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,919
always just turn the awareness back to whatever

57
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,159
is

58
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:55,640
arising and we get more and more closely more and more

59
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
intimately

60
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

61
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,360
e e

62
00:10:53,519 --> 00:11:00,000
even confusion and distractedness can be known they show up

63
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,600
the Dharma asks us to to stay

64
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:14,320
present and when we get lost soon as we notice

65
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:21,600
it we become present again and each time is just a simple a

66
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:30,040
simple activity here again knowing

67
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:37,320
each time is simple and over time we get lost less

68
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,560
frequently and become present again more more

69
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:51,279
quickly we're practicing

70
00:11:53,839 --> 00:12:01,560
staying and as we learn to stay Our Lives open up to

71
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,360
us we receive

72
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
them

73
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120

body mind and heart all in the same

122
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,360
so many names are familiar to me and I'm seeing your names here before of

123
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,799
course in the chat and also from Retreats and other programs IMC and IRC

124
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:48,039
and and also from my home s here in Santa Barbara it's a delight really I'm so

125
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:56,720
happy again to be part of this sa this week ael's teaching at IRC

126
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:07,000
so um uh yesterday I uh I introduced the theme for uh for this week which is a

127
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:12,039
list of of six qualities of the Dharma qualities that all point to the Dharma

128
00:33:12,039 --> 00:33:17,639
being empirical being something that's evident uh in our experience

129
00:33:17,639 --> 00:33:23,559
discoverable through uh through practice and life experience not something that

130
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:29,080
we simply learn from hearing others or from reading books the Dharma it comes

131
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:35,240
alive in us through our practice through living our lives through paying attention to our

132
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,480
lives really close attention and I said yesterday that I'd

133
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:46,960
be relating these six qualities to a list of capacities that support what is

134
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:53,679
um called performative literacy an ability to read uh difficult texts in a

135
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:58,720
skillful way that leads to deeper understanding

136
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:06,000
so uh long long ago many years ago when I was young uh I was in an English

137
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,919
teacher credential program at at uh UCSB here in Santa Barbara and I had a professor Sheridan

138
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:19,158
Blau who is um a just a very passionate

139
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:26,599
uh supporter of investigating how people learn especially about how people learn

140
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:32,040
to read and write skillfully and then teaching them how to do

141
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:39,358
that and uh over 40 years ago he wrote a paper that is still uh cited today by

142
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:44,878
those who train teachers he actually still is a uh active he's at the

143
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,000
Columbia Teachers College now in um in New York City and this paper that he

144
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,919
wrote it identified this series of capacities of skills that those who are

145
00:34:56,919 --> 00:35:02,920
what he called successful readers of difficult texts display and they're all

146
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,480
ways of relating to what's being read and I think that each of them also

147
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,000
describes ways of relating to our experience that are really supportive of

148
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,880
recognizing uh these qualities of the Dharma that uh that we're going to be looking

149
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:27,079
at so I each of us um human beings on this planet could be called a difficult

150
00:35:27,079 --> 00:35:33,079
text you know I think we're all complex beings with with so many threads of

151
00:35:33,079 --> 00:35:38,920
conditioning that have affected the way we see and approach all of our life

152
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:44,119
experience including the way we see and approach the Dharma in our practice and

153
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,880
I think we are texts that are definitely you know worth reading and learning and

154
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:56,599
reading well so the first two in the list of

155
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:03,160
qualities of the DAR Karma um are that it is well proclaimed and it's visible

156
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:09,280
here and now well proclaimed swato taught skillfully you know in a

157
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,880
way that people can relate to um in a way that they will listen to and put

158
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:20,880
into practice that can serve them serve us all the way along the path beginning

159
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,400
to end remember good in the beginning good in the middle good at the

160
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:32,960
end and then visible here and now stico

161
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:40,079
so it's not just some promise about understanding the Dharma in the future but it's accessible to those who are

162
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:45,560
willing to look who make the effort to pay attention the Dharma is seen by us

163
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:52,160
in our experience as we practice here and now you know I was trying to point

164
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:58,800
in in the meditation to that uh that's what we do we look at what's

165
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,800
going on within us and we see it and we come to see it more and more clearly

166
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,160
here and now it's not just described somewhere you know that we're to take on

167
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:16,240
faith we see it

168
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:23,599
so examples of where we see it you know excuse me I always have a frog my

169
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:28,720
throat it's like my continual Companion now at this point in in my

170
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:35,760
life so Gil one time spoke about these qualities of the Dharma using the uh

171
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,240
example of having a pebble in your shoe that's causing pain with every step you

172
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:50,359
take so a pebble in the shoe that's something pretty obvious something that we can see here and now and the solution

173
00:37:50,359 --> 00:37:56,359
removing the pebble is pretty obvious too unless we're unless we're seriously

174
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:02,119
distracted we don't need a lot of mindfulness to see that problem and its

175
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:12,480
solution but more subtle kinds of pain and stress might require um a bit more

176
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:21,720
attention for example uh maybe I I text a friend uh suggesting that we get

177
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:29,920
together have a have a meeting see each other and the friend doesn't respond and then um maybe some

178
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:36,560
sense of being ignored or unappreciated arises and uh and I might

179
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,760
make an assumption that uh my friend just doesn't want to see me and then

180
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:46,960
some resentment might arise out of that and if I don't notice what's happening

181
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:52,040
pretty quickly there might also be memories of other times as friend try

182
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:58,359
seemed to ignore me or wasn't kind or you know all that kind of

183
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:03,839
associative thinking that can happen and I can get lost in a in a maze of

184
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,880
speculation and blame but if I'm actually looking if I'm being mindful I

185
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:15,640
can see pretty quickly before any spinning out and recrimination or all

186
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:21,560
kinds of other unproductive thought that I'm PR I'm projecting meaning onto the

187
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:28,560
situation I'm making an assumption and that that assumption really is the s s of the dooka I'm

188
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:36,319
creating for myself and so there's the Dharma right there seeing the arising of Dua when

189
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:43,480
there's resentment when there's defensiveness self-righteousness impatience any of those kind of niggling

190
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:49,040
things that arise in daily life I can see them and when I'm mindful of

191
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:54,480
resentment for instance sensing into how it feels quickly not it doesn't take a

192
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:59,560
long time how it robs me of my peace seeing immediately oh I've just my mood

193
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:08,280
has changed when I see the clinging the contraction in the mind and I'm able to let go that's visible also right here

194
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:15,240
and now both the arising of the Dua and the ceasing of the Dua are plainly

195
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:23,480
visible right where they happen and uh to bring in the um

196
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:30,920
capacities from the literacy essay the first skill that's list listed in the essay is a capacity for sustained

197
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:36,079
focused attention so you know it's pretty clear I think the relevance of

198
00:40:36,079 --> 00:40:43,480
that to our mindfulness practice to the ability to see clearly in order to develop mindfulness

199
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:51,079
we need to sustain focus on on what's arising and uh Blau uh points out in his

200
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:57,720
uh in his essay that often students who complain that they can't understand a

201
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:03,640
text assume that it's because they just don't have the intelligence or the skill

202
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:10,079
to understand it when the problem is actually that they just haven't given it

203
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,160
close sustained attention and this is really just really

204
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:20,400
resonant for me in relation to seeing the Dharma here and now I think so so

205
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,520
many of us humans are just so used to taking for granted that what we're

206
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:33,440
thinking and feeling is simply how things are the correct picture of our life we have to be trained and our

207
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,720
practice trains us of course to look more closely we assume without actually

208
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:47,400
looking and our practice is just you know it's a training in looking more closely looking Beyond

209
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,560
assumptions so we learn to be more attentive to be more mindful in order to

210
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,119
see the Dharma here and now in our experience and new meditators you know

211
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:03,599
trying to develop mindfulness they often complain that when they're when they're sitting when

212
00:42:03,599 --> 00:42:10,400
they're trying to practice their minds just go crazy thinking nonstop and often

213
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:15,760
they imagine that means that they can't meditate just like the students that

214
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:23,119
Blau speaks of who imagine they can't read difficult texts students can have the expectation

215
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,520
that simply being able to read should result in deep understanding just you

216
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:36,559
know the simple ability to read and meditators can have a similar expectation that simply closing our eyes

217
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:42,760
and deciding to pay attention to the breath or whatever uh we're attending to

218
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:48,280
that staying present staying connected becoming mindful will just

219
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:54,040
happen but I think we all know that what's needed is developing this

220
00:42:54,040 --> 00:43:01,000
capacity for sustained focused attention and we learn to stay by coming

221
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:09,400
back of course again and again that's how we develop the capacity Minds really like to think you

222
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:17,119
know and after 20 years I think it's probably it's maybe it's even more than 20 years of web surfing and swiping left

223
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,400
and swiping right and following links from one topic to another modern minds

224
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,160
are way more distractable than they were in the past I think so it takes more

225
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:36,720
effort to to develop this capacity but the only way to develop it is to

226
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:42,280
practice coming back again and again and another of the of the

227
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:49,200
capacities in blouseless that's re related to this is a tolerance a tolerance for failure a

228
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,720
willingness to reread and reread again and you know that's what we're

229
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:59,880
doing when we you know we often talk about cultivating uh continuity of

230
00:43:59,880 --> 00:44:07,559
mindfulness trying to string the moments of mindfulness together really staying present and this is the key to that not

231
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:12,680
giving up when our mind wanders when we're sleepy or bored when we really

232
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:19,000
would just rather go do something else we don't give up on cultivating

233
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:24,119
mindfulness because our minds like to chatter I think it doesn't usually take

234
00:44:24,119 --> 00:44:30,079
too long for new meditators to recognize that that it's not just in meditation

235
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,319
that their minds are pretty much out of control it's the nature of the mind to

236
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:43,079
just do its own thing to think and plan and react and reflect on its own time

237
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:48,680
schedule and in daily life if we aren't engaged in some activity that uh

238
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:53,880
requires a lot of focused Attention our minds will usually just wander where

239
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:58,960
they want coming to realize that's the case

240
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:05,280
is often a really big motivator for us uh for many of us to develop more

241
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,680
mindfulness those of us I think here in this worldwide Sana we didn't give up

242
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:15,760
because our minds have minds of their own as Jack cornfield used to say maybe

243
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:22,720
still says instead we we saw the need to develop steadiness a capacity for

244
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:27,760
sustained attention and we came to recognize that the way mindfulness

245
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,400
actually gets established in the mind is due to our willingness to fail at it

246
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:40,040
again and again to keep returning to our present moment experience learning to

247
00:45:40,040 --> 00:45:46,960
stay learning to stay that's what pemma children calls it and it it comes after

248
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:53,000
not staying many times you know failing to stay and then the Dharma can really

249
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:59,640
reveal itself to us we recognize that it was always right here visible here and

250
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:04,200
now we just weren't paying very good

251
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:10,800
attention and uh as we more and more develop the habit of paying attention

252
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,559
the Dharma becomes more and more visible to us we learn to read our experience

253
00:46:16,559 --> 00:46:24,000
more skillfully to become more and more intimate with it to understand it in a a

254
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:32,440
in more uh a deeper more subtle ways I'd like to uh I'd like to close

255
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:39,160
this morning with a um a reading of something I'm sure probably a lot of you have heard it before something that's

256
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:46,800
often read in Dharma talks and Dharma situations it's called autobiography in

257
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:54,520
five short chapters by Porsha Nelson chapter

258
00:46:54,520 --> 00:47:00,680
1 I walk down the street there's a deep hole in the

259
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:06,079
sidewalk I fall in I am lost I'm helpess

260
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:11,520
it isn't my fault it takes forever to find a way

261
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,760
out chapter two I walk down the same street there's

262
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:23,960
a deep hole in the sidewalk I pretend I don't see it I fall in again I can't

263
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:30,000
believe I'm in the same place but it isn't my fault it still takes a long

264
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:36,280
time to get out chapter 3 I walk down the same

265
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:42,960
street there is a deep hole in the sidewalk I see it is there I still fall

266
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:50,280
in it's a habit My Eyes Are Open I know where I am

267
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:57,839
it is my fault I get out immediately chapter 4

268
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:05,319
I walk down the same street there's a deep hole in the sidewalk I walk around

269
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:11,960
it chapter five I walk down another

270
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:20,000
street so mindfulness allows us to see the hole

271
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:26,960
and to see the way to avoid falling in it's visible here and now right here

272
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:33,319
right now so that's what I have for this morning

273
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:38,800
and I thank you for your attention and we'll continue tomorrow looking at the

274
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:44,640
the third and the fourth qualities of the Dharma and uh and some skills that

275
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:52,200
really support uh them coming alive in us so again thank you have a have a

276
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:58,720
lovely uh rest of your day see you tomorrow
