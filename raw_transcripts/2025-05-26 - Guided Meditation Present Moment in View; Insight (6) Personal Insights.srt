1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:09,519
so hello and welcome and welcome to this meditation session

2
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:16,039
and the topic these days is the is insight and insight

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:22,240
um uh I think it might be useful to see kind of the word play a little bit

4
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:28,439
around the word insight in that it means something similar to having something in

5
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:35,600
view if it's in view then it's within within eyesight something we can see so

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:46,280
in in sight is something that also comes into the domain of our mind's eye our

7
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:54,399
perception so sometimes I consider uh insight to be closer to revelation

8
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,680
than it is to understanding something we don't search we don't

9
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:07,040
analyze we're not uh uh but we something comes into view when we uh walk up a

10
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,720
hill and then we see the surroundings they come into view it's a there's

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,320
somewhat of a receptive quality to it a discovery reality appears to us rather

12
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,400
than we going to reality and mindfulness meditation is the

13
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:34,799
meditation practice where we become available to have things in view the

14
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,040
direct experience of our life comes into view because our distracted mind that

15
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:48,040
takes us into the past the present into fantasy into commentary

16
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:56,720
into planning has quieted down the mind is not jumping around so much and so now

17
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:03,759
we've come to a place where there's an amazing view and we don't have to work

18
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:12,200
at seeing that view we just sit here quietly keeping it in view keeping it in

19
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:20,800
sight allowing what's here to show itself to us so to do that we prepare ourselves

20
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,280
prepare ourselves by understanding at the beginning of the

21
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,560
meditation that the that the goal of the meditation is to be present with what

22
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:39,760
is and if what is a distracted mind thinking about the past and present we

23
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,720
enter the present moment experience of doing so this is a mind thinking about the

24
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:54,879
past this now is a mind thinking about the future here this is the place where

25
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,120
we relax and hold reality in

26
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:07,280
view so assuming a meditation posture

27
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:14,959
and gently closing the eyes and as part of this prep

28
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:23,959
preparatory work to take some fuller breaths

29
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:30,840
maybe when you breathe in more fully pause before you

30
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:39,720
exhale it can be a momentary pause so that you choose to begin the

31
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:48,040
exhale with a letting go and releasing

32
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:56,480
relaxing at the end of the exhale so the exhale is longer

33
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,159
fuller the little pause at the top of the

34
00:04:07,159 --> 00:04:14,439
inhale is a moment to bring you more fully into the present moment

35
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,800
and then letting your breathing return to

36
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:40,280
normal and as you exhale to relax in your

37
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:48,759
body tension in the body is kind of like exerting

38
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:54,680
pressure on the thinking mind so it thinks

39
00:04:54,680 --> 00:05:01,479
more as the body relax there's less pressure to think

40
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,440
so softening in the

41
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,800
face around the eyes

42
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:45,680
as you exhale softening the shoulders

43
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:53,000
relaxing giving in to the weight of the pull of gravity

44
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,919
as you exhale softening the belly

45
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:39,440
and as you exhale a broad general general

46
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,960
relaxation of the whole body

47
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:08,120
and as you inhale to feel the thinking

48
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:16,199
mind the thinking muscle pressure or tightness

49
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:23,240
As you exhale to

50
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,960
soften the thinking

51
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,800
mind to quiet the mind

52
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:50,160
and then as you now center yourself on your

53
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:00,879
breathing breathing in an easy breathing in in an easy

54
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:07,440
way and when you get to the top of the

55
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:14,039
inhale experiment with a momentary

56
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:21,680
pause that brings you more into the present moment and maybe it's an occasion to let

57
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,080
the thinking mind become

58
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,360
quiet and then exhale

59
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:58,040
relaxing into the present experience of your body as you exhale

60
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:35,480
The pause at the top of the inhale can be for just a half a

61
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:45,480
moment just enough to pull you into the present more fully to quiet the thinking mind

62
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,120
and as you exhale relax at the end of the exhale

63
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:07,000
release in the body so the exhale

64
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:12,120
continues for a few moments more

65
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:26,320
and for a half a moment pause before breathing

66
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:34,519
in for another moment

67
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:40,560
of being present being pulled into the present

68
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,920
moment around The

69
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:51,760
breathing with the thinking mind becoming

70
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:58,680
quiet and then breathing in

71
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:59,480
With these momentary pauses the end of the

72
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:04,880
inhale perhaps the exhale comes into better

73
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:10,519
view and pause at the end of the inhale

74
00:12:10,519 --> 00:12:15,600
exhale the inhale comes into better

75
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:34,920
view the lifegiving experience of breathing

76
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,079
can be appreciated for what it is and what it does

77
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,079
by keeping it in view

78
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:36,440
where there is breathing there is life

79
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:50,279
to let the thinking mind become quieter so you can better

80
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:53,279
feel

81
00:15:56,519 --> 00:16:04,680
observe experience the lifegiving movements of the body as you breathe

82
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:18,079
as if breathing is a sponge for any tension and preoccupation

83
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:22,680
and pressure to think

84
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,519
allowing everything to enter the rhythm of

85
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,959
breathing in and breathing out

86
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:00,480
at the end of the

87
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:07,919
inhale the exhale comes into

88
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:15,400
view gaze upon the exhale as you

89
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,840
would seeing some natural

90
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:29,600
object that's a delight to gaze

91
00:22:33,799 --> 00:22:43,520
at at the end of the exhale let the inhale come into view

92
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:58,240
like watching maybe the gentle swells of

93
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:07,799
waves moving by the ocean washing up on the shore

94
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,080
hold the breathing in view

95
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:16,480
and after these minutes of meditation what else comes into

96
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:22,400
view without thinking about it

97
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:29,400
what else besides breathing do you now have a better view

98
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,600
of what do you see about

99
00:24:36,679 --> 00:24:41,240
yourself what is revealed

100
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:01,640
and for whatever that's revealed breathe with

101
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:11,080
it let it too rest in the gentle rhythm of

102
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,919
breathing so you don't do anything about it just

103
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:22,640
see just observe from the vantage point of

104
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:27,400
breathing in and breathing out

105
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:57,880
and then as we come to the end of this meditation there's a way

106
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:05,640
of staying close to breathing that makes it easier

107
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:12,440
then to gaze upon the world with without getting caught in thoughts and

108
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:15,440
judgments

109
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:25,039
agendas to let the world and others come into

110
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,158
view where the eyes are

111
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:39,840
not marshaled by desires and fears and judgments

112
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:47,919
where the eyes of perception gaze uses upon the world

113
00:26:54,279 --> 00:27:02,720
calmly and is available as a conduit for our

114
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:10,799
goodwill for kind regard of others

115
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:17,120
may all beings be

116
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:22,559
happy may all beings be

117
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:28,080
safe may all beings be

118
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:35,480
peaceful may all beings be free

119
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:51,820
[Music]

120
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,880
thank you

121
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:09,440
so hello and welcome to our series on insight and um now for the second week

122
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:16,080
I'm going to introduce to you five areas of insight that uh might be significant

123
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:22,960
for people who do insight meditation and um and somehow

124
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:31,000
understanding that there are different forms of insight different objects of insight can help us put each into

125
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:37,679
context and so maybe we better understand uh what the classic Buddhist idea of

126
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:44,640
insight insight meditation is aiming towards and all these forms of insight

127
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:52,240
are valuable and um but uh we don't want to be limited by any one of them we want to

128
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:57,360
be able to appreciate each one in its own way but not think that this is the

129
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:02,480
this is what insight is by itself

130
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,840
so um the word insight is uh as I've said you know comes from the word

131
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:16,240
vipasana which means uh either to see clearly or to see distinctively to see

132
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:23,600
each thing that occurs in a distinctive kind of way in its own right and um so what that means is we

133
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:33,279
don't use a discursive mind to start creating lumping everything together in some kind of way but uh rather we are um

134
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:41,360
uh letting each thing stand for itself so we know it well and so that the thinking conceptual mind is not uh so

135
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:47,760
busy analyzing uh conceptualizing about our experience taking us away from it in a

136
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,799
certain way so the word insight

137
00:30:52,799 --> 00:31:02,240
um is uh sometimes I've in a kind of um kind of um evocative way I like to

138
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:09,760
think of it as um as the synonym as being revelation and why I like that as a

139
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:16,880
synonym is that uh revelation is not something that we uh are searching for

140
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:21,919
uh necessarily or that we're responsible for uh it's something that just seem

141
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:29,200
suddenly seems to appear that's a meaningful understanding a meaningful experience um but that we didn't make

142
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:34,880
happen we didn't uh feel like we constructed it or thought it out or

143
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:42,519
analyzed something it just it just appeared somehow in a way that was surprising and gratifying

144
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:48,399
meaningful and so insight has that quality that we're not trying to

145
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:55,120
construct insight or figure something out with the figuring out mind we're uh

146
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,279
using the meditative mind to become quiet and still so that we're not

147
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:06,080
distracted we're not caught up in the world of concepts uh so that uh uh and

148
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:13,039
instead can kind of see things directly thing our life comes into view might be

149
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:20,039
less grand than the idea of revelation um the our experience comes into

150
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:25,320
view and um so come be it comes into

151
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:32,159
sight and uh rather than looking we're seeing looking being this

152
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:38,480
active effort to kind of zero in on something seeing means a kind of uh

153
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:45,120
relaxed receptive um awareness of the present moment here

154
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:51,200
and so there are five different areas that that uh in which insights can occur

155
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:58,000
where some new understanding some new um clarity some new meaningful way of

156
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,200
experiencing our life can come into view so the first is that uh uh personal

157
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:11,679
personal insight and that means uh we see um we understand something new about

158
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:17,120
ourselves that's unique to pretty fairly unique to us has to do something about

159
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:23,919
uh we understand something about our history what happened to us how we were conditioned and shaped by things uh we

160
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:29,679
have a new insight into what happened to us in the past um we have insight into

161
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,519
the kind of uh thoughts we have the biases we have the orientations we have

162
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:42,559
the beliefs we have that might be operating unbeknownst to us but they are in the background and sometimes it's

163
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:48,480
mystifying why certain things happen but then uh we kind of at some point get

164
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,360
quiet enough in meditation that the quiet mind um is seen and we say "Oh

165
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:03,720
that's what I'm believing that's why everywhere I go um things are look

166
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:10,398
dangerous because I'm always thinking uh thoughts of catastrophe i'm always

167
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:17,280
imagining that the worst will come and no wonder every place I go seems dangerous because I'm constantly

168
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:24,398
projecting or seeing through this catastrophi catastrophizing kind of mind

169
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:31,839
or for me um I used to uh I saw at one point in meditation that in the back of

170
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,440
my mind very very quietly but quietly doesn't mean uh unimportant it's kind of

171
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:45,118
like the lens through which everything else was seen was I had this strange belief that if any meditative experience

172
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,240
was happening to me it was not the real thing i didn't know what the real thing

173
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:55,760
should be but I I had steeped doubt about my whatever myself and my own

174
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:02,800
experience that I could never feel settled or at ease with whatever experience I had there was a very subtle

175
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:07,839
anxiety a very subtle agitation very subtle kind of like holding myself back

176
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:14,000
from experiences meditation because of this very background thing so other

177
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:19,920
people might have something like that as well but it might not be uh as uh you

178
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,880
know um it might not be the prominent kind of background belief that of many

179
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:33,119
people and so u but this is a personal kind of to me it's a personal insight I saw oh it made a huge difference to see

180
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,560
that it's almost like as soon as I saw that the veils were cleared and now I

181
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:46,560
could just be with my direct experience of meditation in a much simpler more easy way uh content to be just let

182
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,119
it be what it is without having to some idea that it's not quite up to

183
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:57,560
snuff and so there's a whole slew of personal insights like that that become

184
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:04,000
available when the mind starts getting quieter and quieter um sometimes uh if

185
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,359
we're thinking about it's very concerned about something uh the mind has is operating sometimes uh

186
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:16,000
offline and uh and we're sitting quietly we have enough space in the thinking

187
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:21,040
mind gets quiet enough that some of the offline kind of insights revelations

188
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,119
understandings will pop up um many years ago when I was a new Zen student I

189
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,960
worked at a bakery and my job was to uh prepare the

190
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,520
uh wets and the dry uh ingredients for the bakers that came in early in the morning to make bread and different

191
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:46,160
things so I'd have these two bowls all the all the wet stuff all the dry stuff the eggs whatever whatever that was

192
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:52,640
needed that was wet and they would just mix it in together in the morning when they came and um so one day I was

193
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,200
sitting meditating and my mind was fairly quiet and peaceful and minding my own business and suddenly there was like

194
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:07,040
little explosion in my mind and uh and uh my mind said the salt and something

195
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:14,240
inside of me maybe because I'd been making the doing this work for some time it was deeply in my body something

196
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:20,800
inside of me knew that I left the salt out of one of the bread one of the head

197
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,720
um preparations that I was doing so I had to call him as soon as soon as I could i called the bakery and told them

198
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,800
and and so they uh were very happy with the results because they put a sign

199
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,480
up salt-free bread and uh it was snapped up people bought

200
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,520
it so uh so this way in which uh personal insights of different kinds can

201
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:49,920
appear when we're doing uh meditation and um I don't want to uh

202
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,599
dismiss the value of that these at all but what I'd like to uh suggest is that

203
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,240
for the purposes of mindfulness meditation we don't want to get too involved in these personal insights if

204
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:09,040
they're impactful and you want to spend time to reflect and think about them um the recommendation is do it afterwards

205
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:16,880
go for a walk with a friend journal about it um spend other times so that you don't um condition yourself to think

206
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:24,079
that meditation is about thinking about things that that's where you're going to kind of have all these aha moments

207
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,839
and the reason for this is uh I I like to present this an analogy that if you

208
00:38:29,839 --> 00:38:34,880
go into um an apartment building a tall building a skyscraper because you've

209
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:40,720
been told that there's a fantastic and very important view from high up and um

210
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:49,119
and so you get into the elevator and it takes you up to the second floor and the second floor opens and there's a amazing

211
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:56,560
party um uh show going on that just seems so made

212
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:02,320
for you and all your interests so you leave the elevator to go see this party

213
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:07,839
this show and you're there for many weeks before you realize hey wait a minute I was supposed to be going up in

214
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,960
the elevator and um so you get back in the elevator and you go up and it opens at

215
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:19,760
the fourth floor and there is World War uh uh three and um and you see you know

216
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:25,680
the good cause and and uh who's who's the good guys and bad guys and you're

217
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:33,040
ready to you feel like you have to responsible to join the good cause and you're out there uh on the fourth floor

218
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:40,720
fighting the war and maybe then it takes you many months to realize hey wait a minute I was in the elevator going up

219
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:48,640
and so then you go back in the elevator and now you go up and uh and the elevator opens in the seventh floor and

220
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:55,760
there's this person that you can't believe the person standing there ready to greet you it's the person of your

221
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,800
dreams you've been dreaming about this person for years and here is the person

222
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,280
who is clearly going to be your life partner clearly going to be provide everything you need and you can't

223
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:14,400
believe your good luck and so you get off the elevator and it takes you some years before you realize wait a minute

224
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:21,280
I'm going up the elevator so in this way medi when meditation is

225
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:27,560
working it's like you're in in the elevator and uh and

226
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:33,520
uh and uh and then when you have certain revelations certain insights certain

227
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:40,640
thoughts certain fantasies certain things that you can't believe how good they are or how important the the right

228
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,160
cause is we get off the elevator in order to engage in those and plan and

229
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:52,720
work and fight the good fight and um but uh the idea when you're doing meditation

230
00:40:52,720 --> 00:41:00,160
is don't get off the elevator trust the process it's working uh if these different insights

231
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:07,680
these different self-standings come up different topics are important for you come up appreciate that but don't get

232
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:12,800
off the elevator sometimes when I meditate um there will

233
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,319
be things more than just salt uh things will arise say oh that's actually

234
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:24,560
important to address thank you and I'll say thank you and they'll say later not

235
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:29,839
during meditation and um and if you're worried really worried about forgetting

236
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:37,280
something so important you could have a pad pad next to you and just write it down so that you can put it aside but uh

237
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:42,440
the idea is here if you're doing mindfulness meditation uh the personal

238
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:48,160
insights self-standing that comes along is invaluable and very supportive but

239
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:54,000
the idea is don't get sidetracked by those in meditation itself or at least

240
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,760
don't take them as being the only reason we're doing meditation some people when

241
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:06,960
they hear the the idea of insight then will assume that oh now I've gotten an insight now I know what insight is i

242
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:14,160
understand something very important about myself that's going to change my whole life for the better so thank you insight that I got

243
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:19,839
my insight i'm also appreciate that you know very significant forms of personal

244
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:27,200
insight can happen and um and the idea is remember there's actually many more

245
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,319
important insights that going to come that are part of this p this phenomenal

246
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:40,160
path to a deep liberation of the heart a deep freedom from some of the deepest

247
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:46,400
um challenging cha uh operating systems by which our whole psychophysical system

248
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:53,200
is operating and to really drop down to see that in a deep quiet way that we

249
00:42:53,200 --> 00:43:00,520
want to go into that uh see having insight into things which are more universal things that are shared by all

250
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:06,160
people and not just personal for myself and that'll be the topic now for

251
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:12,960
the next four days so uh I appreciate very much um

252
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:18,440
this opportunity and and we'll continue tomorrow
