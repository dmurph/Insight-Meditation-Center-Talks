16
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,760
has started for many people be themselves or their

17
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,959
family and also just some shifts in life

18
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:29,440
and things and so I thought I'd talk about what's important uh uh so I want to talk about

19
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,040
the PRI excepts uh I will say that being an

20
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:42,200
Asian and monastic person uh that though I have practiced

21
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:49,440
meditation mostly in the convert Buddhist scene

22
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,879
um where actually we think meditation is first but really in most of the Buddhist

23
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,480
World precepts are first and uh before you do a retreat you

24
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:10,000
take the precepts but in terms of studying and learning uh and I like G um

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:17,000
ordain uh fully ordained in the soosan tradition and uh of course when we get

26
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:23,040
Dharma transmission it means we can give the precepts before that you can be a teacher but you can't give the precepts

27
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,400
so it's really important in the Buddhist World um however I'm not going to really

28
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:37,080
talk about them specifically though of course the five are not killing not

29
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:45,280
stealing sexy not taking what is not no that's stealing not lying and not uh

30
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,840
intoxicating mind and body or I like to say no killing No

31
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:57,920
Stealing no peeling like Tak off your clothes no spieling talking right

32
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,360
excessively and no dealing so this is how I try to remember things right no

33
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:10,680
killing No Stealing no peeling no speling and no dealing so those are those are the basic

34
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:18,519
five in all Buddhist Traditions um and uh here's I'm both and I again

35
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:26,240
are from the Shu Zuki roshi Lich and this is what uh Suzuki roshi had to say

36
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:31,600
about the precepts it's called real precepts are Beyond word

37
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:39,360
when I say precepts the first thing you think of is something like ten commandments or 10 gra prohibitory

38
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,680
precepts of course in the Zen tradition we have 16 and there are 10 main ones

39
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:50,560
but Zen precepts is not like that the Zen precepts is to study Zen precept

40
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:57,000
means to understand zazen so it is another interpretation of

41
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,479
zazen is prep technically Zen isn't meditation it's just being with things

42
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:10,280
as they are which sounds easy hard to do as we all know using words word precepts

43
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:16,560
we explain what Zen is actually the purpose of receiving precepts observing

44
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,120
precepts is not just to remember what we should do or what we shouldn't do and

45
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:28,479
how we observe precepts is to practice Zen or to extend our practice to our

46
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,479
everyday life so the idea of precepts is completely different from the usual understanding

47
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:41,319
of precepts and when I reflected about how

48
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:48,440
maybe precepts and meditation are different I actually thought well actually I'm going to make the case that

49
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,720
they're not so different in this way uh so I'm going to talk about three

50
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:01,520
ways of practicing with the precepts one is called stopping one is called

51
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,000
examining and one is Enlightenment or

52
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:12,720
actualization so in terms of meditation of course there are two main me

53
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:19,199
meditation grouping and that would be shamata and theana and shamata is one way to

54
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:26,720
describe it is stopping stopping you stop to pay attention and so uh in the

55
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:32,560
precepts as you could see uh they start out with the not right not killing

56
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,800
that's what I just said to you all not not not and the reason for that and a

57
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:46,560
way that you can call them ethical principles or ethical precepts which is usually what they call or Sila or Sheila

58
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,800
is that um it helps you to stop and pay attention and I also wanted to talk

59
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:58,319
about it as how I learned this because I think uh it's really important for us to

60
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,160
remember uh the sources of our learning and our practice and so I want to share

61
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,680
some stories from my practices overseas how these ways of working with the

62
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,080
precepts for me um was exemplify so one is uh when I was

63
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:25,280
practicing at the Trum or bamboo force uh lineage in Vietnam in 2006 and

64
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:35,360
7 uh so my viames is very bad so here it goes uh Tik tonu is uh was a

65
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,879
when they were young he and tick Nyan practiced together in the pur land tradition and then obviously they went

66
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:47,400
their different ways and uh Tik tonu stayed in Vietnam and became kind of the

67
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,599
Zen in Vietnam and uh so I was there and I went

68
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:58,879
for 5 days and stay for six months um and I worked mainly with this one

69
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:04,360
teacher who had the best English in a nunnery uh the monks and nuns were

70
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:09,840
separate as in a lot of Asia uh the master lived in the middle and uh but

71
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:17,479
was a big piece of land and um and so in the NY there between 85 to 100 nuns and

72
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:23,800
I worked with this one teacher to translate the Master's book into English

73
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,000
and uh so uh you know I when I was there

74
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,399
I had some work they also did what's called sa service if you've been on IRC

75
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:41,560
Retreat you know you clean the temple a little bit right after the first meditation of the day and um so I

76
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:49,040
was doing some gardening work and I there was a big pink rose and so I

77
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,519
leaned in and I smelled the rose and a teacher a different teacher

78
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:01,600
went by and my venies again is bad but then when you're surrounded and I did

79
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,760
pick it up a lot better she was like don't smell the

80
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:14,000
roses and I was like okay um and by the way um I was told

81
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,040
what to do all the time which I'll say more in the second one so I was like hm

82
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,640
but my vienamese was not good and her English was non-existent that teacher so

83
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:32,480
at the next time I was working with the teacher that spoke English I said what's up with that CU in English you know we

84
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:40,079
actually have an expression stop to smell the roses which sounds very you know being in life mindful of your

85
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:45,399
surrounding enjoying life so what's wrong with that and she said well it's

86
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:51,800
like this that um the precepts are like

87
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:59,760
um fences at the edge of cliffs because we tend to be go around and we pay

88
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:08,120
attention and then we just fall off a cliff if we're overly passionate right and we're we're just too excited so

89
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:15,560
they're like fences to help you from falling off the cliff into passion so it's true you know if you

90
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:21,519
really well in my sense it has a truth to it which is when you're very riled up

91
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:27,959
that's passion we can talk about passion different way but in general passion if you're really riled up you might say

92
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:34,240
things or do things in ways that you will regret later um

93
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,399
and so these precepts as not really helps you to give a clear boundary

94
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:44,639
they're like a protection fence to go oops not killing what does that mean not

95
00:10:44,639 --> 00:10:51,040
stealing what does that mean right so they really stop you so stopping right

96
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:59,800
so that's stopping so the second is examining

97
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:08,279
or uh you could say vasana which is to investigate now vasana is a not as a

98
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:15,040
meditation practice is much more about investigating it's actually not um just

99
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:20,320
like H you know that's not really what you're going for in meditation yes you

100
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:27,800
want the investigation to be full of the how of curiosity of non- judgmentalness

101
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:35,600
the quality of mindfulness but as a practice is actually a very um directed

102
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:41,320
investigation of things or an examination of things right so um the

103
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:48,320
second way to practice with the precept is what I would term as like compassionate connection how is it that

104
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:53,920
we interact how is it that I take my sense of what are my values as another

105
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,760
way to understand the precepts and then what is the way that I enact it in life

106
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:08,320
what is my awareness of how I do it not just my idea of it or be it that it's my

107
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:18,040
idea or that I've taken in as teachings right uh AA which of course uh teacher

108
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,480
tight Force teacher of many people we know um says in short keeping

109
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,920
CA ethical conduct means watching over yourself

110
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:36,800
watching over your actions and speech the practice involves establishing Sati

111
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,160
mindfulness within this one who knows the one who knows is that intention of

112
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:49,199
mind which previously motivated us to kill living beings steal other people's

113
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:55,839
property indulge in illicit sex lie slander say foolish and ferous things

114
00:12:55,839 --> 00:13:04,320
and engage in all kinds of unrestrained behavior the one who knows leads us to speak it

115
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,639
exists within the Mind Focus your mindfulness or Sati that constant

116
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,480
recollecting on this one who knows Let The Knowing look after your practice use

117
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:22,639
Sati or awareness to keep the mind recollecting in the present moment and

118
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:29,880
maintain mental composure in this way make the Mind look after

119
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:35,440
itself do it well if the mind is really able to look

120
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,440
after itself it is not so difficult to guard speech and actions since they are

121
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:47,399
all supervised by the mind keeping cila in other words taking

122
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:52,440
care of your actions and speech is not such a difficult

123
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:59,120
thing you sustain awareness at every moment and in every posture where

124
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,079
whether standing walking sitting or lying down before you perform any action speak

125
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:13,519
or engage in conversation establish awareness first you must have Sati be

126
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:18,800
recollecting before you do anything it doesn't matter what you are

127
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:24,720
going to say you must first be recollecting in the

128
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,240
mind so mindfulness helps us to

129
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:35,519
examine how we're going to interact with each other right is it from

130
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:42,320
decency or sense of connectedness maybe when I asked you all to say what is your

131
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:48,240
value today right how are you going to actually do that if connectedness say

132
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:57,399
was your word for your value are you speaking in a way that's connecting are you um interacting in a

133
00:14:57,399 --> 00:15:03,519
way that's not killing someone's interaction with you right so it really

134
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:11,639
is the how I would say now um my practice in Japan I did go

135
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:19,519
for an Ango or a rain Retreat um and as many of you know in Zen our forms are

136
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:25,839
very you know lots of forms um and uh

137
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:34,079
you one may think right that it's just too much it's just a lot of uh

138
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:41,360
difficultness you know and I will say in Japan if you thought if anyone here has been in a Zen Center in the United

139
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:49,759
States that's a convert Zen if you think it's hard try in Japan everything

140
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,120
is you're watched all the time and everything is actually not just in Japan

141
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:01,079
but in all monasteries in Asia um it's because you're being trained so that

142
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:08,040
your behavior the way you carry yourself of so much of the directedness is

143
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:14,000
actually on what's called comportment how do you carry yourself how do you

144
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,079
really take those mindfulness the development of the

145
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:27,040
zazan Mind Z or the mind that's clearly aware of what is into what you do

146
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,959
because as you all well know right if I say okay time now for cookies or potluck

147
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:40,480
most of you just get up maybe not even have any mindfulness about how you do it

148
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:47,360
maybe some of you will but you know a lot of us in these transitions we forget in our actions

149
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:55,360
when things are busy we forget to pay attention and make sure that we're enacting our values in everything we

150
00:16:55,360 --> 00:17:02,680
do and so that's really important um so compartment and how you carry

151
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:08,918
yourself is really important

152
00:17:08,919 --> 00:17:14,000
uh I will say for from my uh

153
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,880
experience in Japan um mostly you're instructed on how to do things and you

154
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:28,120
don't get a lot of praise for it um and it's just do it do it do it um and there's a

155
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,919
lot of practice and uh and yet you know um part of that

156
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:40,440
culture is just not so much about words it's really about again this sense of

157
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,240
relating in a way that we realize that how we hold ourselves and how we

158
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:52,000
interact with each other um affect each other and that system and in most

159
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:59,280
monastic systems you know I will say in my experience I did start out in the Spirit Rock tradition first before I got

160
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:07,080
into zen um the sense that there's no form and insight is actually not so true

161
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:14,159
in my experience when you go to practice in Thailand say um uh because if you're

162
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:20,360
in any Monastery or any practice places there are forms when there are monks and

163
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:25,600
nuns there are forms and there is hierarchy and that's um on one level you

164
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:31,480
know in the US we like to think we're all equal which of course is not true true that's just an ideal we have um and

165
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:38,520
yet when we are clear about our location when everyone is aware that location

166
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:45,360
matters social location matters then it comes with responsibility doesn't it and

167
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,480
it comes with knowing that if you're in the up power position if you if you're

168
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:57,799
the Abbot if you're the leader then you your task is to take care of the S and

169
00:18:57,799 --> 00:19:03,320
it and so so how um everyone behaves we

170
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:11,120
learn to move together and then we like to say as one body this is why when we all turn right

171
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:16,840
it's so that it looks good doesn't it everyone turning right but also it's so

172
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,919
that you don't bump into each other and say oh excuse me because when you're doing that and someone's meditating you

173
00:19:22,919 --> 00:19:30,360
want to hold the container of quiet for everyone so a lot lot of it is how do we

174
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:37,039
interact in way that may just seem very unprescribed but it's really about then

175
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:44,960
we have a sense of location between each other and how we negotiate space how we

176
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:52,360
negotiate holding things right you always hold everything two-handed in

177
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:59,280
Zen so and you may think it's just Zen but it's actually again in all

178
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,360
monastic settings uh in fact I can't remember it was my one month or two

179
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:11,600
month but um that's Spirit Rock what was his name anyway one of the teachers um

180
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:18,799
oh guy Armstrong I believe don't quote me but I'm pretty sure said that when he went back you know for six months not

181
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:25,960
not not the first time he went to Burma I think it was where he practiced he said oh yeah so many of the um monastic

182
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:31,240
precepts are actually how to tie your ropes and how to hold it in a certain

183
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:37,280
way so a lot of it's just compartment and that's really important

184
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:43,440
because again it helps you to have a clear awareness of your body heart and

185
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:51,880
mind as it negotiates itself in the world now I love to look up words so

186
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,840
comportment the noun describe both the way a person behaves and also the way

187
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,760
they carry them M themselves their General manner the compartment of a bunch of

188
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:09,159
little kids at an amusement park is very different then say you know in the

189
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:14,840
monastery uh this is from vocabulary.com the French the middle French root is

190
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:21,960
comp I don't know French comport comportment bearing or behavior and from

191
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:29,799
the Latin which I also don't know is comport to bring together or collect

192
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:37,919
now doesn't that sound a lot like mindfulness to bring together and collect right to remember the

193
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:43,039
collectiveness the recollection of what's important in what you're doing

194
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:51,400
what is your value how are you enacting it so again our Echo acha you sustain

195
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:57,559
awareness at every moment and in every posture whether standing walking sitting

196
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:02,919
or lying down before you perform any action speak or

197
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:09,919
speech in conversation establishing awareness first you must have Sati be

198
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:18,520
recollecting before you do anything so that's uh

199
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:26,320
examining so the Third Way is what I would say as Awakening or as

200
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:33,880
Enlightenment so now you're like okay with us the two methodology of meditation what's the third

201
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:40,799
one being with things as they are which is Awakening which sounds easy hard to do

202
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:47,919
isn't it who here would say that they're awaken

203
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:55,279
n and yet and yet at least from the Mahayana view you are already awakened

204
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:03,039
but what is it that keeps you from knowing that right and so so in some ways the other two steps help us to

205
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:13,159
really realize that we are awaken that in fact Awakening is

206
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:21,279
life right that we wake up to life as it is right not not as our ideas about it

207
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:28,600
that's in the mind be the past or the future but really what is right here

208
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:35,440
that's what Awakening to so Awakening we could say to

209
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,840
wholeness or interconnectedness to Harmony to how

210
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:46,480
things work as they are so we actualize

211
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:53,159
or realize this now I want to talk about it in two ways in terms of

212
00:23:53,159 --> 00:24:00,360
practice so again I'll just say um in meditation we say shamata and vipasana

213
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:06,000
but there are many other kinds of practices are there not for instance

214
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:14,600
chanting chanting is a very useful and very much part of practice and so um you

215
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:21,640
know uh I belong to a Gen X teacher group and uh recently and we different

216
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:27,240
traditions and uh recently someone said hm I want to know from your other

217
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:32,360
Traditions uh what is a way of talking about

218
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:39,520
love or about the quality of goodness in life and uh another teacher in a

219
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:48,279
different Zen tradition Soo Zen but a different lineage said oh well for us it's about

220
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:53,799
chanting it's about chanting and I was like oh I hadn't heard it said exactly

221
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:59,159
that way however in our tradition Zuki roshi used to say you chant with your

222
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:07,720
ears not with your mouth you're like Zen Paradox what does that mean it

223
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:14,039
means we chant not right we're trying to harmonize with everyone else we're

224
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:21,320
chanting so that we chant together we're not chanting to say hey I know this that

225
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:28,640
stuff happens mind you but you practice to let that go let that be and and then

226
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:36,480
you keep on harmonizing so it's a way in which we can understand Awakening as that we are

227
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,799
not alone that we are interconnected that what each of us does impacts each

228
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:49,200
other right we harmonize together so that's one way I think that

229
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:54,399
you can think about Awakening and Enlightenment not doesn't have to be

230
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:59,640
just some great thought somewhere right or idea somewhere now the other one that

231
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:06,279
I really learned overseas that I will admit took a little bit of work for me

232
00:26:06,279 --> 00:26:14,039
and that is devotion probably most of you did not wake up today thinking oh devotion is

233
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:19,880
Enlightenment I actually poo pooed it quite a bit and thought you know that's

234
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:26,960
a little bit excessive um and uh I when I practiced in

235
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:33,320
Thailand um and I accidentally I really did uh I

236
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:42,240
had what's the short version um I was doing my two month at Spirit Rock

237
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:49,480
and uh though I had just ordained in the Zen tradition but I was like I need I need some silence and I need some

238
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:55,600
recovery um so I blanch my teacher that let me do the twomon at Spirit Rock plus

239
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:01,679
I always wanted to do the two months and um and then another Monk asked me to go

240
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:07,399
practice with sakar in Japan but at the time you know you

241
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:15,480
couldn't get a Visa um without going through the uh

242
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:23,320
the the diploma place sry not diploma uh diplomatic and uh so I thought I'd go to

243
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:30,279
Thailand oh and I wanted to go back to Vietnam uh because the first time I went went I moved back and it didn't work out

244
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:36,760
so I thought this time I just go as I'm from Vietnam right just go but I wasn't sure I could get a Visa so I thought oh

245
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:43,519
it better stop in Thailand to make sure I could get a Visa right and also I thought hey that's where the Insight

246
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:50,159
stuff is so I heard about this one um monk who spoke English and turned out he

247
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:58,640
was an arot um uh lumu buit is his name um

248
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,919
was 92 at the time and I met him at a

249
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:11,760
monastery and practiced with him and then on the right I also met some German nuns and lay people and we were in a van

250
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:18,320
on the way back to Thailand or Bangkok and uh they stopped to drop him off

251
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:25,279
because it was the rain Retreat so he had a benefactor that had a place for him and all the nuns were like o we want

252
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:31,240
to see your place can we come in and see your place and so we all got out the van and went

253
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:39,840
in to see his place and then he had a Salah do you guys know what a Salah is a Sala is like a a place where visiting

254
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:45,919
monastics um hang out right there are two kinds of Salah one is the open kind

255
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:52,399
uh and then one he had one that was um screened in that was like a living area

256
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:57,880
and so uh the two German lay people were like hey can we stay here and practice

257
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:05,600
with him you know Travelers Are Right In tha One Thailand too uh and so I was like oh I'd like to do that um so we

258
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,960
stay there and then they went off right so I was with him for like five weeks and went to different places with

259
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:17,840
him and um he turned out he was an arot which I

260
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:26,279
didn't really know um and he was so famous that when I was there um Tai

261
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:32,640
airlin send them to Gold Card things so that he could just

262
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,080
decide whenever he needed to fly somewhere they would because he always had an attendant he and his attendant

263
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:43,600
could just go first class and he was like American Idol but as a

264
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:49,880
monastic no I'm being really serious because on the week on the weekend just

265
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:55,519
mobs of people would come and give him a lot of money and food um because you

266
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:02,440
know he can't cook or he can't even cut an apple right that's that's part of his his whole practice is just a practice

267
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:08,640
right and that's why he always has an attendant and I also can't handle money for and other things but those are the

268
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,840
main ones so now why am I bringing up except to just say hey I got lucky right

269
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:23,679
um no not that's not the real reason the thing is you know at first I was like oh and when

270
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:31,039
people come they would hand out pictures of him and also little necklaces and stuff and I was like wow

271
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:37,679
this is just like you know and um and I thought wow and there were some people

272
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:43,279
especially in the weekend really rich people who would come and give a lot of money and then they would come maybe I

273
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:49,519
don't know occasionally but the thing that really made me understand

274
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:55,360
devotion because I was there with him every day was that there were some Thai

275
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:00,480
people so we meditated from

276
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:08,880
3 to 6:00 p.m. every day 3 hours straight and then from 88 to 11: p.m.

277
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,039
every day so twice a day for 3 hours and the reason we started so late is because

278
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:21,679
he watched um cable tennis he was obsessed by tennis and also um Chinese

279
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:29,000
kungu movies and so he and he was 92 so they were like hm you you know you could do

280
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:34,480
this and then we would just get up later but however people but he still ate the

281
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:41,399
three meals or two meals and in the morning people some Thai people would

282
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:48,200
travel for an hour or two hour by bus to bring him his breakfast that they had

283
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:55,039
made at home because he can't make anything himself right and then they would then go off

284
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,399
maybe for another hour or two on a bus to work work and then they would return

285
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:06,200
to meditate with him every day of the

286
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:12,880
week now this is the kind of devotion you know not the American Idol

287
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,120
kind of devotion but really the devotion of

288
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:26,240
really having the values that someone who is completely dedicated and who the

289
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:35,120
majority of the people in Thailand really understood to be awaken and someone whose whole life has been

290
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:42,039
spent in making sure people suffering is alleviated or can

291
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:49,320
end so imagine if your life was that that was the most important thing and

292
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:55,279
that you're devoted to that continuity and that

293
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:01,519
possibility right that's that's a very different sense of commitment to

294
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:09,240
me right not just showing up to practice but really to make sure that this has

295
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:15,519
happened [Music] and and to validate and to

296
00:33:15,519 --> 00:33:22,919
honor beings whose life is devoted to the end of your

297
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:32,320
suffering that's huge you know imagine if the United States

298
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:37,600
was devoted to the end of suffering imagine if most of the world was devoted

299
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:43,480
to the end of suffering right to not just the the

300
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:49,760
values of it as I won't lie I won't you know like a self- practice but also an

301
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,840
interaction practice and then to uphold it in a way that's much more than just

302
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,679
about the self or the interpersonal but as a

303
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:11,520
system as a cultural system that's

304
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,398
devotion what if that's your devotion

305
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:37,320
so for those who know me a little bit I really like acronyms or ways of remembering things

306
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:44,480
easily so I've presented for you stopping examining so stopping like

307
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:52,679
shamata right really the precepts as way to just go whoa let me just stop a

308
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:58,560
minute in the habitual karmic tend tendy

309
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:04,760
my reactive tendency I'm just going to stop then I'm going to e

310
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:11,599
examine right what is happening here how am I am I acting according to my values

311
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:18,960
am I interacting with you am I interacting with myself am I interacting right in a way that is about

312
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,040
connection compassionate connection and then the last is

313
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:32,200
Enlightenment which is C SE right which is that actually the

314
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:41,400
precepts have to be seen to me it's not enough to just say oh I am a moral

315
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:48,680
person you know when I um one of my Dharma sisters who became

316
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:54,839
head monk sh so when you become a teacher in the suen tradition not not to

317
00:35:54,839 --> 00:36:00,280
give the precept yet but to become a teacher her first talk she [Music]

318
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:07,520
said I ordained to live a transparent life and I was

319
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:13,720
like oops as I had asked to be ordained and I was like oh wow that's that's a

320
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:21,400
big commitment that's a big commitment right to live a transparent

321
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,880
life to say these are my value and by the way you take the precepts publicly

322
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:36,880
because when you're going hey these are my values and I am making the commitment I'm vowing to live in this way publicly

323
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:43,720
and in the Soto and tradition and I think in all the I know in Vietnam

324
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:49,240
experience uh uh or nation and the public is invited so anybody can come

325
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:56,480
usually it's just family members but anyone can come and friends it's because you're also asking the community to

326
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:05,240
support you to live a life of not killing not stealing not

327
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:10,720
misusing sexuality not uh taking what is not

328
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:20,760
giving not lying and not dealing not uh intoxicating mind or

329
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:25,920
body so it's something that needs to be see

330
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:33,119
right seen or see I will say I struggle because I also like the acronym C

331
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,760
sea right the C and the reason for that and that's why I put Enlightenment and

332
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:44,880
Awakening uh or awareness you could say is because I think that last aspect of

333
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:50,920
practice is to realize that we're actually held in a vastness the sea or

334
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:58,079
the ocean gives us a sense of vastness that there's something here that's holding

335
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:03,440
that's connects us all that really supports

336
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:10,720
us to live a life that's awaken and in fact it's always present

337
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:18,079
and how is it that we practice to know that to know that we're doing it and to

338
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:23,640
know that this is a value that's

339
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:31,000
important so we in some ways you could say we awaken to something bigger than

340
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:39,119
our individual efforts and yet it does take our individual and Collective

341
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,680
actions that's beyond ideals I I think for me devotion seems idealistic but

342
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,760
it's actually in terms of a practice it's a everyday kind of

343
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,599
practice for my students you know devotion sometimes can sound like faith

344
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:04,839
and I for my students I like to say faith is strengthened confidence so how do we practice so that

345
00:39:04,839 --> 00:39:11,240
we strengthen our confidence that the end of suffering is

346
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:17,200
possible that in fact we're already

347
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:26,079
awakened kir roshi says from a chapter entitled Buddha

348
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:32,960
mind the Buddhist precepts are not Commandments they are not moralistic

349
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:40,079
rules that deluded people are expected to obey actually the Buddhist precepts are

350
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,839
not rules at all they should not be seen from a

351
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:51,480
diluted point of view rather than see them as moral

352
00:39:51,480 --> 00:40:00,079
dictates to be followed we should regard them as indicators of the practice of

353
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:10,880
Enlightenment they should be taken as the Buddha's mind if you do this you can behave as a

354
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:17,280
Buddha at the beginning of practice you might believe the precepts are moral

355
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:24,040
rules but you must learn to take them as expressions of the Buddha's

356
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:30,160
activity doing so you will study your everyday life and before you are

357
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,720
conscious of it these teachings will penetrate your

358
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:42,400
life in this way you can live naturally the life of a

359
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:45,960
Buddha thank you for your

360
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:56,920
attention all right we have a minute or so if anybody has any questions

361
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:03,760
I do see a hand but I'm GNA if you generally move back I would invite you

362
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:10,920
to move forward you all

363
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:17,359
right thank you I want to ask about uh your Aran teacher yeah and what's your

364
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:25,760
name Phil Phil what was it like being with him could you tell he was different from the

365
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:32,520
rest of us um well yes in the sense of all the

366
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:40,119
people around him um you know acted differently towards him I will

367
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:45,319
say I mean and also the guy was 92 so already has a certain bearing do you

368
00:41:45,319 --> 00:41:50,599
know do you know and he's been a monastic since I can't remember um he

369
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:56,960
was 12 or something like that right so a long long time at that point um so it's

370
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,480
so so it's I don't really like to say this um

371
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:09,359
okay but since you ask I will say I mean we acted in very different whenever we laugh we all would gather and bow and

372
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,760
you know whenever you arrive we would you know a lot of comportment kind of stuff to honor

373
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:19,800
him and uh and he did speak mostly in Thai so most of the time I didn't really

374
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:25,079
understand what he was saying but the feeling is different and

375
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:32,920
then one time as uh he was getting ready to leave to go

376
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:40,920
do a blessing somewhere and we were all gathered to send him off and uh he made

377
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,440
eye contact not that he didn't make eye contact with me before mind you but he

378
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:54,839
did make eye contact with me and I will tell you I felt completely seen but there was

379
00:42:54,839 --> 00:43:01,640
no me I don't know how to say it any other way and I can't tell you anything else

380
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,240
except for we connected and there was no me and there was no him and that's all I

381
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,240
can say I don't know maybe I make things up I have no idea um

382
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:21,240
but yes I would say that I mean I he and sake har roshi and the nun I practiced

383
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:28,040
with in Vietnam I I find them all to be inlight people and different in different ways of expression

384
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:34,800
