1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,279
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:16,480
and we live in a body human body that has capacity

3
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:23,600
for pleasure and pain we live in human body has

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,679
the ability the potential for beauty and that which is not beauty

5
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:39,280
for inner beauty we have a world that lives in

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:46,320
has a capacity for suffering and happiness for war and peace

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,600
as we're seeing now in

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:58,480
in eastern europe so one of the ways of practicing

9
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:03,520
mindfulness is to um

10
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:10,640
be aware of it all have a certain equanimity for pleasure and pain

11
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,159
the beautiful and not so beautiful the difficult and the easy

12
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:23,119
but to do it from a reference point to do it from a source kind of within

13
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,560
of a kind of a of awareness that is based in or settled

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:34,159
in the place where we have inner beauty or where we have

15
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:42,079
um yeah so qualify for that for now and it's possible to be aware of

16
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,240
things for example physical pain but to be aware of it at the same time

17
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:55,040
as being in touch with or being connected to inner pleasure inner beauty in her

18
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:00,719
well-being and this makes a world of difference

19
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,000
so we're not only identified only rooted in

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,840
this sensory sense world where pleasure and pain exists

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,640
but we're rooted someplace else that contextualizes the sense world

22
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:25,200
so i'll do a kind of guided meditation around this and we'll see how

23
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,040
that goes and

24
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:38,560
and i will hopefully point you first to when you're aware of breathing

25
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:46,400
there can be more than breathing going on there's also the awareness of breathing and how that is

26
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:52,720
and that'll be the entry point to this uh teaching on

27
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:57,760
inner pleasure inner beauty so

28
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,599
to assume a meditation

29
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:06,560
posture and to

30
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,680
gently close your eyes

31
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,480
and some long slow gentle and inhales and exhales

32
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:36,159
especially as you exhale to relax and settle into your body

33
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,720
breathing in deeply and relaxing

34
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,680
as you exhale

35
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,040
and then letting the breathing return to normal and then for a few rounds of breathing

36
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:07,519
to continue to relax the holdings the tension in the body

37
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,439
and if it doesn't relax maybe there can be a softening around it

38
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,518
in the face the shoulders the belly

39
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,360
and then to

40
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,400
breathe normally except the end of the exhale

41
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:22,880
let there be a comfortable pause just long enough not to be uncomfortable

42
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:30,160
the pause before you inhale just long enough so that you feel the

43
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:37,759
gentle pull or desire to inhale and when you feel that desire

44
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:44,560
allow for it and allow the body to

45
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:48,360
perform the inhale

46
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:09,759
let there be a small pause at the end of the exhale when you feel the pull to breathe in

47
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:16,440
allow it and receive the inhale

48
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:30,319
so it's not just the inhale you're feeling there's also a context for the inhale

49
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:37,960
which is a sense feeling for allowing receiving

50
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:56,160
when you when the exhale begins allow it to

51
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,160
the body to exhale allow for the letting go the

52
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,599
release of the exhale

53
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,800
receiving allowing maybe is close to making space for

54
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:25,319
something being spacious making a room for it

55
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:09,199
in whatever feeling you have for allowing and receiving

56
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:13,080
in breath and out breath

57
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:27,240
is that does it have a pleasant feeling and nice something nice or comforting about it or

58
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:41,440
and if it is feel the pleasantness the pleasure of

59
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:47,760
however small it is of allowing the receiving the inhale

60
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,879
allowing the exhale

61
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,800
and maybe you can feel

62
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:39,120
this sense of allowing receiving

63
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,440
to feel it in that place within

64
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:52,480
where inner beauty lives inner well-being

65
00:09:52,480 --> 00:10:00,319
a well-being that is not of the senses not of

66
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:06,279
the five senses but a non-sensual

67
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,320
inner place

68
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:22,760
a non-sensual kind of pleasantness pleasure beauty

69
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:42,600
that informs awareness

70
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:57,040
which is a kind of a source for awareness the flavor of awareness as you breathe

71
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,839
in and breathe out

72
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:34,240
if any part of the breathing is uncomfortable it's okay

73
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:43,720
allow it to be received receive it and allow it

74
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:50,320
from this other place of within

75
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:57,519
from this place is not identified with the discomfort

76
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:03,279
but rather where we are settled

77
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:15,040
in an inner place of that's of pleasure well-being

78
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,320
warmth glow

79
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,839
with which we're aware of the discomfort

80
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:40,279
if there's something uncomfortable happening that

81
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:45,120
preoccupies you grabs your attention

82
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:55,839
see if you can be mindful of it in a receptive and allowing way

83
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:01,519
so that your or something like that so you're aware

84
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:09,560
from that non-sensual place non-physical place within

85
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:18,519
from a place of inner well-being and not rooted or connected

86
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:27,360
to the outer senses of the body

87
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:36,680
but rather to a place of the within maybe of the heart

88
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:45,320
a place within that is the home for inner beauty

89
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:43,480
if there's any way you feel a little calmer or settled and you did it beginning

90
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:51,120
that calmness and subtleness would be considered a non-sensual pleasure

91
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,960
or a pleasure of the inner life

92
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:12,000
let your awareness radiate from

93
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,799
that inner life an inner place of goodness or beauty

94
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:27,919
so you're rooted there so you're not identified or rooted in

95
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:33,760
the challenges or the thoughts or feelings

96
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:42,000
you're aware of all of those respectfully carefully but you're aware of them from

97
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:45,280
this place of inner

98
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:54,760
beauty inner wellness inner calm

99
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:06,240
can you touch into a place of inner pleasure well-being

100
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:13,080
it is not a pleasure ordinary pleasure of the senses

101
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:21,600
in a sense it's an inner well-being that's independent of

102
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:28,919
what we see and hear and taste smell or touch

103
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,360
maybe an inner pleasure connected to

104
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:53,080
our inner life of feel inner feelings

105
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,240
and if there is a pleasure there

106
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:08,360
know it be mindful of it

107
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:19,639
and what happens when you recognize it and feel it know it

108
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:03,840
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

109
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:13,520
to whatever degree you know now or other times a place of inner well-being

110
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:19,919
calmness contentment

111
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:26,159
pleasure that's independent of what's happening

112
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,480
around you

113
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:39,039
from that place can you look out across the world

114
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:45,840
aware of all the suffering and happiness of this world

115
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:53,120
and wish that you can make a difference to

116
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:58,880
improve this world of ours to contribute to the welfare and

117
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:07,039
happiness of others a contribution that wish that begins

118
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:15,120
with the good will of wanting others the best for others

119
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:21,360
may all beings be happy

120
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:31,360
may all beings be safe

121
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:40,440
may all beings be peaceful

122
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:47,559
and may all beings be free

123
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:59,039
[Music]

124
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:21,360
so hello everyone and so the topic this week is the second

125
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:26,399
foundation of mindfulness which is the mindfulness of vedana

126
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:32,000
pali word for that i translate as feeling tone often translated as feeling

127
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,120
but then people confuse it sometimes with emotions and what it refers to is the

128
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:44,640
the tonality the tone of pleasant unpleasant or neither pleasant unpleasant

129
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:51,600
in which everything happens all experiences are felt through those three feeling tones one or

130
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:56,879
one of the three maybe occasionally it feels like

131
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:02,960
they're all there at the same time the um

132
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:08,000
so this is the the instructions are to be mindful of when there's pleasant

133
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:14,159
feeling tone that it's pleasant feeling toned when it's painful unpleasant and no it's it's unpleasant

134
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,399
when it's neither pleasant or unpleasant no so it's a clear recognition this is how it is

135
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:27,200
but then the the text that buddha goes makes a very interesting distinction he goes a little bit further

136
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:33,200
and this is the uh i see it as a really important pivot in the sativatana suttan the teachings

137
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:39,200
and a very important pivot in people's mindfulness practice

138
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,840
because then the buddha makes a distinction between

139
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:50,480
um and they're between the feeling tones

140
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:58,080
that are uh physical in nature and those which have uh are not

141
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:05,919
maybe we could call it if you're willing to go along the spiritual in nature or of the heart in nature

142
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:12,240
but the reason why some people call it worldly and not worldly feelings

143
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:18,320
some people call it worldly and spiritual feelings different people translate these words differently

144
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:24,000
the pali word literally means of the flesh

145
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:29,440
and not of the flesh and that doesn't inspire people that much

146
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:36,159
and uh so people are finding other ways to sort of say it and how i understand it is that

147
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:43,840
of the flesh has to do with the of the ordinary senses we have

148
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:50,320
seeing hearing taste tasting smelling and touching the tactile senses of the

149
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,440
body so if if i feel uh

150
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,159
the coolness against my skin maybe i'm outside and today it was somewhat cold outside and it was cold

151
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:10,880
and on one hand the cold maybe it was unpleasant but it was invigorating and it kind of

152
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:17,679
inspiring to be out there and a nice kind of feeling arose of kind of delight and feeling the sharp crispness of the

153
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:24,080
air and the coolness against my arms and and uh and have a lot of us wonderful

154
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,480
associations and memories of being in the cold and um so there was kind of an inner

155
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:36,799
smile that happened i just felt delighted to be in the cold little bit even though literally there was a kind of

156
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:45,039
unpleasantness in the in the skin for that so there's these two different dimensions of our domains of our life

157
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:51,919
that which is of the physical i call it physical senses and that which is of the inner senses

158
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:58,240
and many people live in their in their physical senses

159
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:05,279
and that's a beaut wonderful thing to do it's a physical senses the sensations being in our body is one of the great pleasures of mindfulness

160
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:14,079
but it's possible to overdo it either by being to identify it with a physical body to attach to it

161
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,280
too reactive to it and but we are in mindfulness learning

162
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:24,800
to kind of be mindful of it and live in it and the whole first foundation of mindfulness is

163
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:31,358
learning how to be embodied in this physical body in a a valuable way

164
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:38,398
and um and so being mindful of the um the feelings of the flesh

165
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:44,240
feelings of this physical senses one would know that the instructions are

166
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,638
when there is a physical feeling of pleasure physical feeling of

167
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:55,679
of um unpleasant to physical of neither pleasant or unpleasant no that's the

168
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,800
case there's no value judgment put on it if that's what's predominant then that's

169
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:06,800
what we pay attention to but then the buddha says also there's another category of feeling

170
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:12,000
this knot of the flesh which is

171
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,760
i associated with the inner life the quality of our inner being

172
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:22,960
um the quality of our inner state can be they're independent of what's

173
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:28,400
happening in the world around us the physical body is very much impacted by

174
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:33,920
what happens in the world around us cold and hot and you know all kinds of things are

175
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,440
happening and also the physical body is impacted by illness and injury and all

176
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:45,680
these things that can happen to the flesh itself through the physical body but then there's a there's this

177
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:52,240
non-physical kind of i mean exactly how to describe this is uh each of you

178
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:58,800
will probably have a different description that works for you but it's the it's the distinction

179
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:04,000
that there's a there's a divide here a separation or a distinction between these two

180
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:12,079
different domains and areas and um and one the second one not of the flesh

181
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:17,839
belongs more to the the spiritual the mental the psychological the

182
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:24,560
um the heartful the the um the kind of feeling of the inner life that's there

183
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:30,640
independent of what happens around us so we can feel contented a very content and peaceful

184
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:35,760
even though the bus we're waiting for is an hour late and um

185
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:42,000
some of our thoughts imaginations of oh this is going to be unpleasant later but we're not trapped in those thoughts

186
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,200
we're actually resting and it's happy to stay on the bus bench

187
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:54,400
just content being there that inner life is very content some people when they meditate

188
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,680
it can um before they meditate there are things that they can look around they're

189
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:06,240
reactive to and they think they should be different and they want their body to be different way and then after they meditate there's a

190
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,359
kind of ease or peacefulness or calm that

191
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:18,079
it kind of holds everything much more easily and spaciously so the place of kind of the calm can be

192
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:24,960
the peace can be maybe the place where love can be a warm hardness can be

193
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:31,359
the place where inner beauty can reside that's all belongs to the world not of

194
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:37,760
the flesh and so the buddha here is saying when there's

195
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:42,960
a pleasant sensation pleasant experience pleasant feeling

196
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,599
not of the flesh know it as a pleasant feeling when you know there's an unpleasant

197
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:54,800
feeling not of the flesh know it as an unpleasant feeling not of the flesh

198
00:37:54,800 --> 00:38:00,240
and when it's neither pleasant or unpleasant know it as that

199
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:07,760
so here this distinction between of the flesh and not of the flesh and now that the whole sati patana is pivoting now

200
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,920
to uh you could say you know simplistically maybe to the mind rather than the body

201
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,680
but it's it's um it's pivoting now to the inner life where

202
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:26,560
happiness and where suffering in a deeper way resides so that can be met and seen

203
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:33,359
and not to be only limited to the physical body and the physical experience but to not begin opening up

204
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:39,359
to a deeper and deeper inner dimension of our life and here all we're asked to do to notice

205
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:45,760
is that pleasant or unpleasant and as people meditate

206
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,119
it's this inner dimension that starts becoming bigger more alive

207
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:57,359
more reference point as important being embodied in the physical body is and how wonderful it is

208
00:38:57,359 --> 00:39:02,560
for some people there's this other area that's deeper

209
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:09,040
and some people have that connection to it and because it's kind of in the body anyway uh within the body

210
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:16,160
they'll often associate it with their body and think this is being embodied and it definitely can be that

211
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:23,280
but but we're trying to make a distinction here to go along with the instructions

212
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,520
and as we learn as we settle and get calmer and calmer more concentrated and

213
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:36,000
more connected to ourselves in meditation it's this inner dimension that begins

214
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:43,920
growing and which this inner dimension then that provides uh a uh

215
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,359
the material for the last two foundations of the of

216
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:55,599
mindfulness um that of the mind and that of the kind of the inner processes

217
00:39:55,599 --> 00:40:00,640
that lead to suffering or to happiness so it's a very important foundation to

218
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,800
make or switch to go from the physical body to not becoming heightened sensitivity to this

219
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:14,160
non-physical inner dimension of feeling that can exist and um

220
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,720
and uh in a way those these they can be a little bit more enduring than the physical ones

221
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:27,440
the buddha like in physical bad enough physical feelings to um

222
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:33,200
the rain drops on top of a lake a big rain is pouring down on the on the lake

223
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:40,720
and there's all these little splatters that go on and physical uh pleasure if you're really or physical sensations if you're

224
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:47,440
really connected carefully to them you'll see that the pleasure and pain and pleasure is uh almost like

225
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,960
little splatters little sparks that come and go and rise and pass

226
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,079
and this inner dimension this knot of the flesh

227
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:03,280
has usually a feeling a little more enduring it's primarily good feelings there it's

228
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,760
primarily pleasure there can be not of the flesh ways in which we feel

229
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:15,440
not so good not pleasant and

230
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:20,800
but in the teachings of the buddha he begins emphasizing the pleasure that's there

231
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:27,119
and um and that's the orientation is to in meditation as we get deeper and deeper

232
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,319
is to begin appreciating and and and feeling

233
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:38,640
the pleasant the inner sensations feelings that are there make room for them

234
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:45,599
and as i did in the guided meditation it's possible that that becomes the

235
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:51,280
the orientation or becomes the reference point for mindfulness

236
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,560
awareness practice no matter what we're aware of and so it's not we're not just aware of

237
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,599
pain for example but we're aware that of the

238
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:08,000
of the of the some kind of pleasure beauty some kind of love some kind of care

239
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:15,200
some kind of spaciousness equanimity that uh allow that supports that

240
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:21,440
awareness of pain or su suffering so we're not only learn not to only be

241
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:28,240
identified with the experience of the moment in terms of pleasure and pain

242
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,480
but we're also starting to identify with this inner place of well-being

243
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:41,200
of calm the economy or something with which we can know what's happening for us

244
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:46,800
and um so um

245
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,560
so you might if this made sense for you you might spend the day

246
00:42:52,560 --> 00:43:00,160
um reflecting thinking feeling exploring uh what your relationship is

247
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:07,200
to this non-physical um place within

248
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:15,839
um that you know you might you know it might be part of you part of your body but not the nonsense nonsense

249
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:22,240
based that which is not triggered by the ordinary senses but uh is independent of

250
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:28,400
um the ordinary senses and the inner place where your beauty resides your inner beauty your inner

251
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:33,920
love your inner goodness your inner subtleness and calm

252
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,839
inner spaciousness inner joy and your happiness

253
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:45,040
in your calm so exactly what this is uh for any one

254
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,880
of you is variable but what experiences have you had that touch that you have history some

255
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,520
reference points for this in the course of your life and what have been the strongest reference points for this and

256
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:02,800
and how do you experience it in daily life and what is a useful way to stay more in

257
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:08,640
touch with it and closer to it and not lose track of it

258
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:14,480
and maybe talk to some friends and if you can explain this to them and see what their experiences have been about

259
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:22,800
this i kind of want to spend a day contemplating the nature of this inner beauty

260
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:31,400
so thank you and we'll continue with this one more day
