00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:07,490
[Music]

2
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:40,550
[Music]

3
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:40,970
[Music]

4
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,920
you

5
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:54,640
so hello everyone and i feel uh

6
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:01,279
particularly heartfelt to greet you on this weekend of martin

7
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:06,640
luther king's birthday and um

8
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:15,279
i think at the foundation of his message and therefore foundation of his life that influenced

9
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:22,399
this country to such an extent that there's a holiday after him the foundation is

10
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:30,399
his dedication to love and um at its best or what it can grow

11
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,079
into mindfulness becomes love or mindfulness is

12
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:42,720
inseparable from love when it's strong when it's well developed there's something about the nature of

13
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:49,199
awareness that is unrestricted awareness which is

14
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:54,320
uh un

15
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,519
uh has no unveiled unclouded

16
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:06,720
that allows the heart's capacity for love

17
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,480
to shine and i suspect that each person for each person love is something a little

18
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,160
different it's not like a uni a single absolute same phenomenon

19
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,760
but it's the human capacity to care for others

20
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:28,800
with generosity with friendliness with

21
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,040
valuing of others respecting others

22
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:41,279
and now kind of the beautiful thing that can happen with mindfulness is that when mindfulness and love seem

23
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:47,120
inseparable maybe become the same that

24
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:53,440
it also doesn't require having an object it doesn't require having someone

25
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:58,800
that is the object of love it's just love just care just warmth

26
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:06,680
just tenderness or gentleness or compassion

27
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,399
in this huge family love is like a family of different emotions

28
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:18,839
and so i don't want to narrow it down to one thing for any of us but to

29
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,639
sit quietly openly in awareness

30
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,639
and allowing making space for the possibility

31
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:36,160
for the many flavors of love

32
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,079
to be born to show themselves

33
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:50,720
and so to value this awareness this mindfulness enough that or to value evaluate more

34
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,079
than our distractions so that when we are distracted or caught

35
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:04,160
up in concerns and feelings we don't dismiss those but we

36
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:12,399
are we center ourselves in the awareness of them

37
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:17,920
maybe with the idea that awareness is kindness

38
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:25,440
awareness is free enough from our concerns and our challenges

39
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:33,279
that there's room for the heart's capacity for love

40
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:41,440
for everything including our challenges and including our distracted mind

41
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:48,320
so assuming a meditation posture

42
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,560
taking a posture itself that maybe

43
00:14:55,360 --> 00:15:01,440
expresses your care your good will

44
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,480
towards yourself

45
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:12,399
maybe one that allows the chest and the heart center to

46
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:18,320
begin to open to all that's here for us

47
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:22,160
the difficult and the wonderful

48
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:29,360
and to gently close the eyes

49
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:40,639
not to shut out the world but rather so there's more room to open

50
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:47,839
to a different way of sensing this world knowing this world from

51
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:51,639
deep inside

52
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:02,360
the place in which there may be love exists compassion kindness

53
00:16:08,079 --> 00:16:13,040
to take a few long slow deep breaths

54
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:22,959
as a way of awakening a heightened

55
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:28,880
sensitivity to our body

56
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:36,639
which is not just our physical body but as our physical capacity

57
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:42,720
for sensing the physical

58
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,880
awareness embodiment

59
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:56,639
breathing in deeply and exhaling and settling into the body's capacity

60
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,199
for to be aware to sense to feel

61
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:15,240
and then gently letting your breathing return to normal

62
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:25,760
and with a relatively normal breath on the inhale

63
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:31,520
feel whatever tension or holding there might be in the body

64
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:38,480
wherever it appears on the exhale

65
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,639
kindly without ambition

66
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,799
soften and relax around that with that tightness

67
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,120
it might be around the face

68
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:17,840
the chest might be around the belly

69
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:27,559
or in the arms and hands

70
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:36,039
in the hips or the legs

71
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,440
and what kind of receptivity or opening or

72
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:13,039
what kind of sensing would you need to feel

73
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,559
your capacity to love

74
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:28,000
what would you where in your body would you open feel

75
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:36,320
rest your attention if you were going to be available

76
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,600
for love kindness

77
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,520
the generosity of spirit

78
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:10,240
and if it's comfortable for you on the inhale

79
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,280
fill your love with awareness

80
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:27,360
with sensing and feeling maybe breathing into the place where

81
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:32,840
love is found in your body

82
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:45,080
on the exhale continue to soften and relax into that place

83
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:58,880
where awareness and love are closely connected

84
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:05,440
either touching them touching each other as you breathe

85
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,600
moving to become almost the same

86
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,320
lovingly aware

87
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,640
mindfully loving

88
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,360
one breath at a time

89
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:38,559
perhaps turning your corners of your lips up a little bit

90
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,720
just enough to feel a smile

91
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:50,799
and with that little smile

92
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,679
is it a little easier

93
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,760
for mindfulness to be accompanied

94
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:07,039
by kindness

95
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:14,919
for whatever you're mindful of

96
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:07,640
for whatever mindfulness knows

97
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:16,320
what happens if you use the quiet soft mental note

98
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:21,520
yes just yes

99
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:27,039
without agreeing or proving just a yes for

100
00:30:27,039 --> 00:30:31,760
awareness yes

101
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:40,080
this too i can be aware of and will that yes

102
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:46,159
make room for kindness

103
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:51,398
love as you are aware

104
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,660
[Music]

105
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,130
[Music]

106
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:19,460
[Music]

107
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,880
[Music]

108
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,939
[Music]

109
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,119
as we come to the end of this sitting

110
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:46,960
to dedicate the benefit whatever benefit has come

111
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:52,240
whatever goodness known and unknown that

112
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:56,079
has been part of this meditation

113
00:41:57,280 --> 00:42:04,720
we dedicate it so that it might spread from us out into the world

114
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,079
for the welfare and happiness of everyone

115
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:18,480
may whatever goodness and benefit that has come from this sitting

116
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:27,200
may it somehow influence our actions in the world

117
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:32,720
so we act from love the act from our goodness

118
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:40,560
and so whatever ways in which goodness love lives in us

119
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:46,640
may it spread out so that those whose sorrow

120
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:54,400
may be happy those who fear may be safe

121
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:03,680
for those who are threatened with violence

122
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:09,760
that they may experience peace [Music]

123
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:17,359
that those who are oppressed they have the oppression lifted

124
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:25,760
so they can breathe freely and live freely

125
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:30,280
find their way in the world successfully

126
00:43:40,400 --> 00:43:46,560
may we be a source of goodness for this world

127
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:51,240
may all beings be happy

128
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:32,400
so warm greetings on this sunday and this is the weekend that here in the

129
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:40,000
united states we celebrate martin luther king

130
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:46,000
and i love this holiday because it's the holiday that

131
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:52,160
i associate most closely with love

132
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:57,760
martin luther king based his life on a love that was

133
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:03,520
inclusive that was not compromised

134
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:08,880
for the conflicts he was in but sought

135
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:14,880
to stay present with love in these conflicts to search for

136
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:21,838
cooperation to search for mutual kind regard

137
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:31,520
and this dedication to love which was at the foundation of his life can be celebrated on this day

138
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:39,359
i'd like to celebrate more than his great accomplishments like with civil rights and voting rights

139
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:44,960
that were really the outcome of his dedication to love

140
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:54,160
the um i suppose the other holidays that the united

141
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:59,440
states celebrates we could infuse them with love

142
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:06,480
labor day and our love and care and good good will and gratitude for

143
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:12,560
the people who work and all the different ways which sustain our lives

144
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:18,079
memorial day and veterans day maybe it can be a

145
00:47:18,079 --> 00:47:23,359
evoke a certain kind of love that uh

146
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:30,240
maybe even love for our enemies in conflict

147
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,400
and the dedication of people's lives

148
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,400
to protect what they love

149
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:51,200
and so so forth maybe it's possible to infuse everything with love to that to be the foundation

150
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:57,760
and of course it's very common for us to say but but what about

151
00:47:57,760 --> 00:48:03,759
what if not that how could i do it how can i love that

152
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:09,520
and martin luther king's message i believe is that

153
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:16,720
if you don't love you harm yourself certainly he said that hate

154
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:23,200
harms the hater and so he was dedicated to not hate

155
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:31,680
and perhaps against tremendous challenges he dedicated himself to love

156
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,200
and it's inspiring and what's possible

157
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:43,119
martin luther king was inspired in turn by mahatma gandhi and he said that

158
00:48:43,119 --> 00:48:48,720
one of the gandhi's great contribution was to

159
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:54,240
uh show how love can be evoked

160
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:59,680
for social action love can be evoked for

161
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:05,760
civil rights for freedom for overcoming oppression

162
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:10,960
government oppression national impression of all kinds

163
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:17,119
and and so martin luther king kind of took that message from gandhi

164
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:23,920
and dedicated his life to to love the force of love the power of love

165
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:30,480
the it said that he was first inspired to non-violence by henry thoreau

166
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:37,119
who had an essay on uh disobedience and a civil disobedience

167
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,800
and um and from thoreau he learned he kind of was inspired

168
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:49,200
that you could stand up against the government against the state

169
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:54,880
with in non-violent ways and and

170
00:49:54,880 --> 00:50:02,000
and so he and he spent a lot of time studying this and thinking about non-violence and in college and graduate school

171
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:08,400
and seminary and uh was influenced he was apparently a big reader of the philosophy of

172
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:14,480
non-violence and social change and it got him more and more centered in this idea of

173
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:20,960
non-violence but when he was introduced to mahatma gandhi that's where he understood that this

174
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:27,119
dedication to non-violent change could be centered on love

175
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:34,000
and he was dedicated to an all-inclusive love that no one no one was left out

176
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,319
and um

177
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:49,920
he wrote he said for oh he dedicated himself for a worldwide fellowship

178
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:57,920
that lifts neighborly concern beyond one's tribe race class and nation

179
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:03,920
and all embracing an unconditional love for everyone

180
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:10,000
and so it

181
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:17,280
is this possible is it interesting is it valuable is it valuable enough that we can dedicate ourselves to it

182
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:22,640
perhaps on this holiday at least for this one to emphasize love

183
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:29,280
this weekend i read a short story that was came out of thailand published in a news

184
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:35,599
journal a new news site there of a

185
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:41,920
in bangkok they have these uh neighborhoods small corner stores that are money exchangers

186
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:47,520
money places to transfer money and send money to and thais will use it to send money to

187
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:53,440
the relatives in the countryside from bangkok and for a long time there was a woman who came

188
00:51:53,440 --> 00:52:01,280
once a month end of the month and would send 20 000 baht 20 000 the currency of thailand

189
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:06,880
to her relatives in the countryside and there was no real discussion about

190
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:14,000
it just matter of fact transaction but one day she came and she wanted to transfer 15 000

191
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:19,520
instead of 20. and so the owner of the shop asked her you

192
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:26,000
know what's happening and she said well uh times are difficult and i this is all i can do

193
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:32,000
and um and uh and uh she said he asked her oh i'm

194
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:38,559
sorry to hear that and somehow in the conversation he learned that even when she sent 20 000 baht to her

195
00:52:38,559 --> 00:52:44,880
son so he can go to school in the countryside and her sister take care of their elderly

196
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:51,119
parents and that she had very little money for herself and it seemed like she worked a little

197
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:56,559
bit as a masseuse and a little bit overlapped with the sex industry there and

198
00:52:56,559 --> 00:53:01,839
something that she really detested doing but felt that she had to

199
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,359
and so the next time she came back next month

200
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:13,280
she came with 20 000 baht and wanted to have a center sent to the countryside

201
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:19,680
uh so he took the money and he did a money transfer and she returned a while later and said

202
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:28,160
there's been a mistake you didn't transfer 20 000 but you transferred 200 000 baht

203
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:34,800
and he said to her it was no mistake i thought i would try to support you and

204
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:41,520
help you and what your life that's so challenging for you she cried and thanked him

205
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:47,920
and then some months later she didn't come back anymore to transfer money but then he got a

206
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:54,559
facebook message from her that she had opened a noodle shop back in her

207
00:53:54,559 --> 00:54:01,839
home village a hometown and that it was already thriving people loved her noodles and food and

208
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:07,200
she'd taken that money and started a business and gotten out of the massage trade and

209
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:12,480
was now running a business that maybe was sustaining her more than her

210
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:18,559
massage trait could do and she thanked him deeply

211
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:24,880
the title of this article that i read was um

212
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:29,920
love without action is a four-letter word

213
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:34,960
so that was kind of powerful title i thought that's why i read the article i said what what are they going

214
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:41,440
to say here love without action is a four level letter word

215
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:48,960
there's a bunch of buddhist teachers a few of them who started the non-profit

216
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:55,920
that's called meta in action is a word for love or loving kindness

217
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:01,200
so loving kindness and action and they raise money to support uh

218
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:07,760
mostly schools and medical facilities in burma and then they've built school houses and

219
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:13,839
supported teachers to teach in the schools and and that's kind of been their mission

220
00:55:13,839 --> 00:55:19,680
for many years now so love and action

221
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:24,880
is without action is love love what is love without action

222
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:30,160
and what is it to act on love and live with love

223
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:38,000
and um and certainly we find in buddhism a lot of emphasis on the value of love

224
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,680
uh and kindness and good will and we the oh kind of or the

225
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:48,960
opening kind of you know if buddhism has a you know a

226
00:55:48,960 --> 00:55:55,920
sacred body of texts and technically it has no official opening passages but because of the the

227
00:55:55,920 --> 00:56:03,839
fame of the dhammapada this book of verses um sometimes that's seen as the opening

228
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:09,920
kind of teachings of buddhism of early buddhism

229
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:16,400
and the text begins in the first chapter

230
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:22,720
with not the very first two verses but the third verse

231
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:28,319
quoting someone who's exclaiming he abused me

232
00:56:28,319 --> 00:56:34,559
attacked me defeated me robbed me

233
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:40,079
and then for those carrying ill will such as this

234
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:46,880
hatred does not end for those who say she abused me

235
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:55,200
attacked me defeated me robbed me for those carrying ill will such as this

236
00:56:55,200 --> 00:57:00,240
for those not carrying ill will such as this hatred ends

237
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:06,319
so when hatred takes the form of attacking and criticizing other people and being angry with them in

238
00:57:06,319 --> 00:57:14,559
in a mean-spirited way hatred doesn't end hatred never ends through hatred

239
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:22,160
by love alone does it end this is the eternal truth the literal meaning is by non-hatred

240
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:28,880
alone does it end this is eternal truth but it's often understood that it's the word non-hatred

241
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,480
means love in this context and then there's a very interesting next

242
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:40,799
verse and maybe this is kind of punctuates this many do not realize

243
00:57:40,799 --> 00:57:47,040
we here must die for those who realize this

244
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:50,319
quarrels end

245
00:57:52,079 --> 00:57:59,440
so there's something about realizing that our life is limited on this planet

246
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:04,960
that maybe we don't want to waste time wasting it with hatred

247
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:11,599
wasting it with greed wasting it with closing in on ourselves or closing in

248
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:17,440
tight on one particular clan one particular tribe or race

249
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:23,640
but rather to have some love that's all embracing

250
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:29,599
so martin luther king was this way and he's i think i think he's most

251
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:36,559
famous for the work he did for civil rights and the need for it was so great in his

252
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:42,720
time he when he grew up as a young man in the south he saw

253
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:48,960
tremendous injustice happening injustice and voting and justice in the courts and justice by the police and

254
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:54,960
justice by the society around him that his african-american neighbors

255
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:01,040
and friends and and struggle under

256
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:06,559
and so he wanted to change that and work for that and

257
00:59:06,559 --> 00:59:12,720
and so he's famous for his civil rights work and it was phenomenal

258
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:19,440
what had what happened in among the civil rights people that he was part one of the leaders for

259
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:26,160
in terms of changing a whole country where they did not give up

260
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:31,680
their non-violent dedication under their onslaught of violence and

261
00:59:31,680 --> 00:59:38,240
most of you have maybe seen some of the videos of the tremendous violence that was done in montgomery and

262
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:43,599
against children and teenagers and high school students

263
00:59:43,599 --> 00:59:48,720
and the violence uh in the bridge in selma where

264
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:53,920
a lot of the civil rights leaders and others were brutally attacked by the police

265
00:59:53,920 --> 01:00:00,400
people who were killed and shot and lynched coming to the south to try to make a difference

266
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,440
and even in these horrendous conditions martin luther king refused to give up

267
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:12,079
love it's hard to believe that anyone could do this

268
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:19,359
but this is a message that he said all religions taught and for him he was just trying to live

269
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:24,799
out the message of love that he received or he found in the teachings of

270
01:00:24,799 --> 01:00:30,079
jesus and christianity and he made i think a very powerful statement

271
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:35,280
about about the love and from a christian

272
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:40,480
point of view he said at one point let us love

273
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,280
one another love is god

274
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:53,119
love is god so to not

275
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:57,839
worship love to not to to

276
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:04,799
destroy love you know for him is kind of a destruction of god

277
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:11,200
the he also wrote when i speak of love

278
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:18,720
i'm not speaking of some sentimental and weak response i'm speaking of that force

279
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:24,000
which all the great religions have seen as the supreme unifying principle of

280
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:32,799
life all great religions have seen as a supreme unifying principle of life

281
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:40,720
love is somehow the key that unlocks the door which leads to ultimate reality

282
01:01:43,280 --> 01:01:50,960
so is love at the heart of buddhism love and action in buddhism is

283
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:58,480
is um described by the word anu kampa a quivering of the heart the vibrance

284
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:06,319
vibrancy of the heart that has translated to action and care and kindness and support of others the

285
01:02:06,319 --> 01:02:12,240
buddha dedicated his life to this anu kampa i think was the organizing principle for

286
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:18,400
his life he was dedicated to metta to loving-kindness

287
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:25,119
and when people came to him with uh to attack him both verbally with anger and hostility

288
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:31,520
and and in one story where it came with hostility to actually actually try to kill him

289
01:02:31,520 --> 01:02:37,760
uh his response was to radiate the power of his love his power

290
01:02:37,760 --> 01:02:43,119
of his meta towards the people and to the in one case an animal that was coming to kill

291
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:49,680
him an elephant and uh the stories say that his power of love was enough to stop

292
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:54,880
the attacks that he was receiving is it realistic

293
01:02:54,880 --> 01:03:00,559
to do that in the threat of violence the buddha made a tremendously powerful

294
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:06,000
statement about this that uh it's easy to dismiss because it's so maybe it's

295
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:11,839
hyperbole maybe it is uh so unrealistic that how could we ever

296
01:03:11,839 --> 01:03:18,319
make this true but it's uh you know martin luther king says that

297
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:24,000
love is the unifying principle of life and this dedication to love

298
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:32,480
and so the buddha said that even if um bandits

299
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:38,240
come and capture you and start cutting off your arms

300
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:45,160
do not succumb to love but radiate your kindness through them

301
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:52,960
and i think we have to understand this uh story this this instruction from the buddha partly is hyperbole like in all

302
01:03:52,960 --> 01:04:00,480
cases but i think also literally because the buddha succumbing to love was such a bad thing to do for oneself

303
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:07,039
it's one of the worst things we can do in terms of harming ourselves to succumb to love

304
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:14,160
someone who really understands and sees the self-harm from hate understand never give up love always

305
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:20,319
always work hard not to succumb to hate and

306
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:26,319
and it's not a message to not defend yourself i think the conditions for this powerful

307
01:04:26,319 --> 01:04:34,160
statement is if you have no other choice and you have can't escape

308
01:04:36,160 --> 01:04:42,799
because the buddha said that if if he did condone

309
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:47,839
not actually acts of violence maybe not but acts of self-defense

310
01:04:47,839 --> 01:04:54,720
to escape from the harm others are doing to us and he said that a monastic can a monk

311
01:04:54,720 --> 01:05:00,480
can strike out to defend themselves for the purpose of escaping

312
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:05,839
provided they do it without any hate provided they can do it with goodwill

313
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:12,799
towards the people they're escaping from so i think what's striking back then though you know

314
01:05:12,799 --> 01:05:18,880
what striking out meant maybe to lift up your hand and block a block a blow or push someone away

315
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:25,680
there's an example of someone who protected their own life by pushing someone off a cliff from the time of the buddha

316
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:32,400
and the buddha kind of understood that matter of factly that that was somehow

317
01:05:32,400 --> 01:05:38,400
not an act of hatred or an act of self-defense so how far this idea of self-defense

318
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:44,480
goes and how far we can go in our lives to do it

319
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:51,119
that kind of act the buddha was not just saying stay you know passive and allow yourself

320
01:05:51,119 --> 01:05:56,799
to be you know taken advantage of

321
01:05:56,799 --> 01:06:02,880
and that there's nowhere in the buddha that he says that you know somehow just accept violence being done to you

322
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:09,920
if anything my interpretation of the buddha is that you should always look

323
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:15,599
hostility in the eye be strong and forceful and look at in the eye and don't

324
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:22,000
don't don't you know kind of sense hold your ground even if you have to step away and walk

325
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:27,920
away but there's no idea that you're supposed to cower or be less than or be somehow

326
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:33,760
meek in buddhism the example of the buddha is one that kind of the way he's talked about in the

327
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:39,599
with language of the texts is a language of power strength

328
01:06:39,599 --> 01:06:46,559
sometimes modern people when they read some of the this language of power and strength in buddhism

329
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:52,720
interpret as being kind of certain kind of machoism or a certain kind of

330
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:57,760
overemphasis on strength but i think it's uh when i read the text i

331
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:04,960
interpret at least to be the nice combination of love with strength love strength with

332
01:07:04,960 --> 01:07:12,000
love and this dedication and so

333
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:17,920
that's what martin luther king says in this quote i'm not speaking of some sentimental and

334
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:23,760
weak response i'm speaking of that force

335
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:29,838
the force of unifying love um

336
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:36,000
i see the shadow you miss speaking about love and hate and like what i said i think yeah i got a little bit jumbled in my

337
01:07:36,000 --> 01:07:41,680
love and hate where i i don't remember well enough to go back and correct it so

338
01:07:41,680 --> 01:07:46,079
if you listened hopefully you understood my jumble

339
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:50,319
the

340
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:01,599
so here's a quote from what i was saying from gandhi from martin luther king of what i was saying about gandhi

341
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:09,760
gandhi was probably the first person in history to lift the love ethic of jesus above more interaction between

342
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:15,680
individuals to a powerful and effective social force on a large scale

343
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:21,120
love for gandhi was a potent instrument for social and collective transformation

344
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:27,600
it was in this gandhian emphasis on love and non-violence that is i discovered

345
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:33,120
the method for social reform that i have been asking

346
01:08:33,279 --> 01:08:39,199
one of my first zen teachers said that the buddhist contribution contribution

347
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:44,880
to humanity was the importance of meditating

348
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:50,238
gandhi's contribution to humanity was important to decide where you're going

349
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:56,000
to meditate and i think what he had in mind was these non-violent protests that

350
01:08:56,000 --> 01:09:01,440
where you marched where you stood where you sat you can sit in such a way that you're

351
01:09:01,440 --> 01:09:08,159
there to offer a counter to offer an alternative to oppression to violence

352
01:09:08,159 --> 01:09:17,040
that exists in this world and so they had in this in the south in the 1960s 50s and 60s these satins

353
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:22,560
and you know us buddhists will often call meditation sitting i'm going to sit

354
01:09:22,560 --> 01:09:28,880
and um and so where do we sit and now the possibility of sit-ins is

355
01:09:28,880 --> 01:09:34,798
non-violent protests we've seen this over and over again and

356
01:09:34,799 --> 01:09:42,960
you know it's easy to say they don't work but i think the genius of gandhi and perhaps of martin luther king

357
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:49,440
was to not do this naively but to really choose very carefully

358
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:55,520
where we show up to sit to walk to march to the actions of non-violence

359
01:09:55,520 --> 01:10:03,199
to have to really change the other people and to search for cooperation

360
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:10,400
to not live a life of competition but one of cooperation to see seek to change the heart of the other

361
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:16,880
um not by force one of the

362
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:22,640
important parts of martin luther king's life was that he realized at some point

363
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:28,800
that the civil rights movement as important as it was and voting rights important as

364
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:35,840
it was was not enough to liberate the african-american population in this country because of the tremendous

365
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:43,199
poverty that existed and and so he became a champion anti-poverty

366
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:48,560
champion he saw that the two uh the civil rights for african-americans and

367
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:55,360
for all people were intimately connected to uh economic change into

368
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:01,600
improved economic position of african americans in this country

369
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:07,040
and he worked with uh in conversation with martin luther king with

370
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:12,800
president lyndon johnson around this and lyndon johnson began this great movement

371
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:18,000
to eradicate poverty in this country but then martin luther king saw what happened

372
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:25,120
when president johnson escalated the war in vietnam

373
01:11:25,120 --> 01:11:30,320
that the money for working doing poverty programs in the country

374
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:35,760
was taken away from those programs and used to

375
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,520
to fuel to pay for the american war in vietnam

376
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:48,400
and so martin luther king started to see all these three as being unified

377
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:54,880
necessary to be addressed civil rights poverty and militarism

378
01:11:54,880 --> 01:12:00,960
war and he became a ch anti-vietnam he started actively fighting against the

379
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:06,480
vietnam war uh actually supporting anti-poverty programs and

380
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:12,719
fighting for working for that and civil rights and he lost a lot of his popularity because of this

381
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:19,920
um he was seen as some even by many of the people who supported him earlier as somehow uh becoming an enemy

382
01:12:19,920 --> 01:12:26,320
of the state in a way he hadn't before or of the country but he saw these as being unified as

383
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:33,199
being connected and he talked about the importance of restitution for

384
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:39,920
african americans he said i'm not talking about getting them paid

385
01:12:40,800 --> 01:12:46,960
back all the money that they deserve from all their work they did in slavery but there has has to be enough

386
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:54,080
focus and financial support to bring them out of poverty as to repair the damages of slavery

387
01:12:54,080 --> 01:13:01,280
but the interesting thing he said about this because his love was so all-inclusive is um

388
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,840
was he said that

389
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:19,640
so he proposed um

390
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:27,760
he did not seek full restitution of wages lost to slavery which he believed impossible

391
01:13:27,760 --> 01:13:35,360
but proposed a government compen compensatory program of 50 billion dollars over 10 years to all

392
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:41,280
disadvantaged groups so 50 billion dollars now seems like a

393
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:48,400
drop in the bucket compared to what this last year the spending programs the federal government is doing

394
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:53,600
now there's 65 billion dollars just available for broadband

395
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:59,760
across the country martin luther king posited quote

396
01:13:59,760 --> 01:14:06,159
the money spent would be more than amply justified by the benefits that would accrue to the nation

397
01:14:06,159 --> 01:14:11,199
through a spectacular decline in school dropouts family breakups crime rates

398
01:14:11,199 --> 01:14:17,440
illegitimacy swollen relief rolls rioting and other social evils

399
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:23,120
unquote he said he didn't want to be only for

400
01:14:23,120 --> 01:14:28,719
african-americans he wanted the money spent for all people

401
01:14:28,719 --> 01:14:37,920
who were poor he said quote that this effort should benefit the disadvantaged of all races

402
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:44,719
so seeing the evils or the problems of suffer of poverty

403
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:50,560
in the times when the buddha gave social teachings for the kind of for teachings

404
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:57,440
that addressed governments and how they should care for everyone he saw that one of the one of the most

405
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:02,480
back in the time of his time 2500 years ago one of the important most important role

406
01:15:02,480 --> 01:15:08,480
for governments back then it was the king was anti-poverty programs

407
01:15:08,480 --> 01:15:14,080
was to provide the means for people to be able to pull themselves out of poverty

408
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:20,719
and provide them with land and other means and you know this idea that uh

409
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:26,080
that poverty and well-being and lack of well-being and overcoming poverty

410
01:15:26,080 --> 01:15:31,600
is essential for people uh to work for you know to to help them

411
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:37,520
out of poverty how without that how can people thrive and develop

412
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:44,400
and so this dedication to love in action

413
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:50,239
would take the form of not allowing people to live in poverty to

414
01:15:50,239 --> 01:15:57,920
support anti-poverty programs support those who are poor in our country support people who are disadvantaged

415
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:03,520
and that's why i was so touched by this one man in thailand who

416
01:16:03,520 --> 01:16:09,679
used his own savings to to provide enough money to this woman a gift to

417
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:16,000
this woman so she could break out of her cycles of poverty and and um

418
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:22,640
and the sex trade and then open up a shop in her home country home town

419
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:30,400
to make a difference so love so i would like to suggest that

420
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:37,198
that we think of martin luther king's holiday as a holiday of love

421
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:44,880
and the argument or the rationale for that is that love was what martin luther king based

422
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:53,040
his life on and all all the all the good work he did for our society that we celebrate and then they did so much good

423
01:16:53,040 --> 01:16:58,880
was um you know was really based on his foundation for love

424
01:16:58,880 --> 01:17:06,400
and when this country went astray and went into war with vietnam

425
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:13,679
he knew that that war in vietnam was going to damage this country he thought called it a poison for the united states

426
01:17:13,679 --> 01:17:19,440
and one analysis for the consequence of the vietnam war is that

427
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:25,120
we're still suffering from the divisions in this country that that war opened up

428
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:32,080
and and if it's true what martin luther king said that the focus on overcoming poverty that

429
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:37,440
started just before their rise this this uh escalation of the american war

430
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:42,480
in vietnam that that was that that came to an end or

431
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:49,360
was to somehow impoverished war and poverty was impoverished

432
01:17:49,920 --> 01:17:55,600
that this has a lasting effect on this country that we've never really come back to

433
01:17:55,600 --> 01:18:00,640
really address poverty in the same all-encompassing way

434
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:07,199
and we've ended up a country that the poison of hate is uh

435
01:18:07,199 --> 01:18:13,440
exists in our society in such a huge way and so let's be careful

436
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:19,840
remember hate it does not end with hate let's be phenomenally careful that

437
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:25,440
to use our practice to use our care and our

438
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:31,440
love to not succumb to hate ourselves

439
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:37,280
and it that's all we do fantastic but maybe when we don't succumb to love

440
01:18:37,280 --> 01:18:43,760
to hate maybe we too can celebrate love and can open up to love and

441
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:50,719
let love kindness good will generosity respect

442
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:57,360
uh compassion be the operating principles for how we

443
01:18:57,360 --> 01:19:03,840
live this life because if we do that then that is the world that we're

444
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:11,040
contributing to make with every action that we do that's influenced by

445
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:18,640
love we are contributing to a world where love has a place

446
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:24,239
may we love on this weekend and perhaps on every day

447
01:19:24,239 --> 01:19:27,400
thank you

448
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:28,080
you
