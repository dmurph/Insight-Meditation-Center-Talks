1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,000
so for this sunday morning talk

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,080
a little bit in the background or the

3
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,240
foundation of the talk is the idea that

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:11,360
the dharma

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,480
dharma practice points to simplicity

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,039
it's a very simple thing

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,359
and it can be deceptively simple it can

8
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,519
be

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,920
surprisingly simple uh what we're

10
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,160
looking for and we're looking for

11
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,760
the freedom from suffering the

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,320
alleviation of suffering

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,880
and and that's at the heart of what the

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,879
dharma the whole religiosity of the

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,040
buddha is about

16
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,320
and and part of the reason why it's

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,120
useful to emphasize the simplicity is

18
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,160
that people who

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,920
uh many people will come to buddhism

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,039
with all kinds of expectations about

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,039
what a religion is what they want

22
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:02,399
that that is

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,920
searching for something that's in a

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,640
sense outside of themselves

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,640
and there's nothing inherently wrong

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,640
with that and

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,560
it can be quite wonderful in itself to

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:15,119
find a religious life or source that's

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:16,799
outside of oneself

30
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,000
but uh the dharma of the buddha is in a

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,840
sense found within ourselves and it's

32
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,479
kind of very simple way

33
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,560
and um and one way that uh

34
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,280
uh one characteristics of this or

35
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,520
emphasis or this simplicity

36
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,680
is the the practice of letting go

37
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,439
rather than acquiring more ideas more

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,040
concepts building up

39
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,159
ourselves and our conceit

40
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,240
there's a real emphasis on letting go

41
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,159
letting go letting go

42
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,119
but letting go is people make it more

43
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,360
complicated than it needs to be

44
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,439
and sometimes react to it negatively

45
00:01:57,439 --> 00:01:59,200
because on this means i've let go of all

46
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,560
my possessions or

47
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,360
let go of the people i love in my life

48
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,320
the

49
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,680
in the teachings of the buddha the

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,679
letting go is almost entirely or maybe

51
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:11,200
entirely

52
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,520
having to do with letting go of

53
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,680
particular mental states or mental

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,800
activity

55
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,520
that's within ourselves not letting go

56
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,040
of things of the world

57
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,440
so the primary letting go is letting go

58
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:26,879
of our clinging

59
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,720
letting go of the grasping or the

60
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,360
craving that we have the contractions

61
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,040
that come along with some of the desires

62
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,360
and aversions we have

63
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,319
and so um

64
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,360
that's what we're letting go of and if

65
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,120
we turn around and really look at

66
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,560
ourselves deeply

67
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,840
we'll see we'll feel that the clingings

68
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,080
the cravings we have

69
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,800
are of way of self-harm the way that i'm

70
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,879
kind of hurting ourselves

71
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,720
causing pain and suffering to ourselves

72
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,879
and in the buddhist analysis

73
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,120
that's the suffering that we have the

74
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,680
most ability to do something about

75
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,440
the suffering that we contribute

76
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,440
contribute to through our clinging and

77
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,080
our

78
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,599
grasping so that's what we're letting go

79
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,640
now when we let go

80
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,879
there are things that we abandon

81
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,920
we're in patent clinging craving

82
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:25,599
grasping we abandon hatred

83
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,720
aversion hostility and we abandon a

84
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,640
certain confusion a tendency towards

85
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,799
confusion or delusion

86
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,200
so there are things we let go of but

87
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,920
these again

88
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:38,720
all internal things and there's not a

89
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:40,159
search for something outside of

90
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,200
ourselves

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,280
a search for god a search for some kind

92
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,720
of cosmic

93
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,640
kind of understanding or wisdom or

94
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,000
consciousness is not a connection to

95
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,920
something beyond ourselves

96
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,519
which is a wonderful thing that can

97
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,200
happen

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,879
our sense of interconnectedness to life

99
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,120
and all that but that's not the heart

100
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,480
of the buddhist spirituality which is

101
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,920
maybe seems very simplistic

102
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,080
reductionistic maybe not enough

103
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,159
in the fullness of life and

104
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:15,760
and that may be but still over and over

105
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,040
again the buddha pointed to this

106
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,680
simplicity of letting go of greed hatred

107
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,440
and delusion

108
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,720
and for the buddha that's the

109
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,639
ultimate that's like that to do that

110
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,639
thoroughly fully is this full message

111
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,040
that he's giving

112
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,040
for people who have other ideas of what

113
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,080
they want their life to really be about

114
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,440
um then i think buddhism contributes in

115
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,080
that

116
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,880
it says or offers that whatever your

117
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,880
values are whatever way you want to live

118
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,639
and be connected understand this life

119
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,720
that we live in

120
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,479
even if you're like you believe in god

121
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,560
or cosmic consciousness or

122
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
you have your fundamental religious

123
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,919
belief is the interconnectedness

124
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,960
of life all those ideas

125
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,880
what buddhism has to offer is please

126
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,199
don't

127
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,199
don't use those ideas as a justification

128
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,199
for greed hate and delusion

129
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,560
don't don't focus on those so much that

130
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:17,520
you lose touch

131
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,880
with this deep inner potential to not

132
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,639
have greed hatred delusion

133
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,840
let that be the foundation and then you

134
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,600
can do all kinds of other things

135
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,720
in a much richer more meaningful way

136
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,520
but for the buddha it was really just

137
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,080
this

138
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,199
this inner life that we're rectifying or

139
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,080
freeing and then the rest of life comes

140
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,840
another way

141
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,880
so there's something we abandon but the

142
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,479
letting go is not just about what's

143
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,680
abandoned

144
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,560
it's also about what is gained and this

145
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,320
probably is not emphasized enough in

146
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,160
teachings of letting go

147
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,280
letting go is kind of uh on the surface

148
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,120
can seem like yes we let go of something

149
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,759
and then

150
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,520
at the best where hands are open we're

151
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,360
open-hearted or open-minded we're

152
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,840
kind of left without clinging to

153
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,280
something but it's

154
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,960
better than that letting go of clinging

155
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:14,240
grasping craving letting go of hatred

156
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,280
and

157
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,560
and hostility aversion letting go

158
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,560
of regrets and agitation sloth torpor

159
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,160
doubt

160
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,360
letting go of all these things we gain

161
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:30,639
something as a result

162
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:33,840
and it's kind of like

163
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:37,039
there's been a there's a dam that filled

164
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,400
with water

165
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,960
and then the gate is one of the the gate

166
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,440
uh

167
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,160
is opened and the water begins to flow

168
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,919
out

169
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,880
and uh and flows out and fills the river

170
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,440
below

171
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:52,240
and and that just flows and flows and

172
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:52,960
flows

173
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,560
and it's a wonderful thing to have the

174
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,800
water flowing and not bottled up by the

175
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,000
dam

176
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:01,120
so the same thing when we let go

177
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,960
something begins to flow something

178
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:05,520
begins to move through us that maybe has

179
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,479
been held back

180
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,160
by the greed hate and delusion by the

181
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,160
clinging and grasping

182
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,880
and there's the gain of what happens in

183
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,000
that flow

184
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,440
when the when something has been

185
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,199
released and let go

186
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,599
that was covering over or resisting or

187
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:20,880
blocking

188
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,080
something inside

189
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,440
and um so the um

190
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:30,639
there's a number of things that uh

191
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:34,479
open up when we let go

192
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,440
and have cultivated awareness and

193
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,560
presence

194
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:41,599
and and one of those things is the seven

195
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:43,840
factors of awakening

196
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:48,479
that when we have a deep letting go

197
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,960
it frees up a certain kind of energy

198
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,319
frees up a

199
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,479
certain kind of momentum in our life

200
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,840
that makes available to us much more

201
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,319
mindfulness

202
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,960
a clear this cleared

203
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,000
distinguishing of phenomena clear seeing

204
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
which we call investigation sometimes in

205
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,440
english

206
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,840
effort

207
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:17,680
joy tranquility

208
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:22,560
samadhi and equanimity and

209
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,599
these are not strange foreign ideas to

210
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:27,599
human beings

211
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,280
it takes maybe it doesn't take that much

212
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:30,800
an uh

213
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,640
reflection maybe to see that they're

214
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
they accompany us to some degree maybe

215
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,719
in small degrees here and there

216
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,839
in our life in ways that we don't really

217
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,080
appreciate

218
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,360
and so one of the ways the examples the

219
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,640
buddha gave for this

220
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,720
that and how these seven factors

221
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,880
awakening can arise

222
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,800
is when is listening to

223
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,880
the buddha at least giving a dharma talk

224
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,800
a great teacher gives a talk

225
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,240
and it's uh it's very engaging and

226
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,080
compelling to really be present and

227
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,600
listen closely and

228
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,360
like what's being said is so important

229
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,360
so clear so profound

230
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
that we're really there to find out what

231
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,200
is this that's being said

232
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,720
and there's a fullness of attention that

233
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,839
is satya's mindfulness really there

234
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,839
that and it isn't that it's we're

235
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:21,760
self-consciously mindful

236
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,839
but we're really the tension is really

237
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,080
present to take in this experience and

238
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,080
maybe even with all our faculties not

239
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,560
just cognitively with the mind but with

240
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:31,040
our

241
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:37,839
our hearts our body or all our senses

242
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,640
as as the thing ordinary thinking

243
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,440
discursive

244
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,560
conversational mind quiets down

245
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,240
and we're just taking something in with

246
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,680
clarity there might still be some

247
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,880
thinking involved

248
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,360
but the thinking is very very simple and

249
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,320
clear

250
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,800
that there there's more and more clarity

251
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,720
in the eyesight and the perception of

252
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,680
things

253
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,120
and we see things much more clearly

254
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,399
i remember i gave i went i went to i had

255
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:10,240
i've been to very engaging talk

256
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,079
sometimes academic talks when i

257
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,040
when i saw taking botany classes and i

258
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,120
was really absorbed in the details of

259
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,079
the botany class

260
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,360
and would leave class and and um

261
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,040
and i'd come we'll go out into the

262
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,279
courtyard in this university where i

263
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,000
went

264
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,079
and i'd see everything so clearly

265
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,399
everything sparkled and it was clear and

266
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:30,959
bright

267
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,880
and in a way that they hadn't been when

268
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,800
i went in there's something about

269
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,440
uh cleaning the the filters of our eyes

270
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,640
developing a clear seeing

271
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,200
that comes with really being present and

272
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:47,680
not distracted by our thoughts

273
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,120
and then listening to a good talk

274
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,800
there's there's some kind of aliveness

275
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,640
and energy and alertness

276
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,399
it might even sit up a little bit

277
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,399
straighter oh this is interesting what's

278
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:58,399
going on here

279
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,720
and then there's also maybe some joy

280
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,399
maybe you wouldn't call it joy at the

281
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,600
time but

282
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,360
all the troubles fall away all the

283
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,200
preoccupations of life all the way we're

284
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,640
really right here

285
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,120
and it just feels so good and delightful

286
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,880
to be with the experience and also

287
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,959
there may be listening to a dharma talk

288
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,959
very reassuring

289
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,200
a deep sense of reassuring oh this makes

290
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,680
sense this puts things into place

291
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,000
this is the way forward and something

292
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,920
inside of us settles and gets peaceful

293
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,839
and quiet

294
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,079
and then there's a gathering together of

295
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,000
all the faculties we're really here in a

296
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,760
concentrated way which means

297
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,480
we're really present with all we have

298
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,440
focused

299
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,160
on what's being said and what the

300
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,560
meaning is

301
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,360
and perhaps also similar to tranquility

302
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,760
it's so reassuring and so

303
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,200
so clear what's being said that now i

304
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,120
understand there's an equanimity and a

305
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,240
balance and

306
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,760
now i understand that there's no value

307
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,480
in

308
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,240
grasping on or pushing away or

309
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,040
leaning forward or pulling back there's

310
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,320
value in just staying

311
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,880
balanced and taking in the experience

312
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,959
being present for the experience

313
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,000
without the usual reactivity with it and

314
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,040
there's the equanimity

315
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,240
so with letting go uh

316
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,880
the and the kind of the gate of the dam

317
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,079
is opened

318
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,200
it's the the water is the seven factors

319
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,800
of awakening

320
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,279
and um what's remarkable is that these

321
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,000
are

322
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:39,440
um can be seen almost as

323
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:43,680
qualities or aspects of awareness itself

324
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,240
as we become more aware in an

325
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,000
unobstructed way

326
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,399
it gets filled with these seven factors

327
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,120
of awakening the opposite of this

328
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,680
according to the buddha is the five

329
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,600
hindrances

330
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,959
sensual desire aversion lethargy and

331
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:02,320
resistance

332
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,880
agitation and regrets and doubt

333
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,440
and these have the opposite effect

334
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,079
the hindrances they hinder they obstruct

335
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,000
they cover over things

336
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,399
and so

337
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,040
it's like closing the gates of the dam

338
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,560
and then the water builds up pressure

339
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,000
behind the dam

340
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,519
i block something and um as we get

341
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,760
partly because with the hindrances the

342
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:32,079
focus of the mind is to be preoccupied

343
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,200
with something

344
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,680
and to be preoccupied in a contracted

345
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,760
and narrow and tight way

346
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,720
and so there's no room for the seven

347
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,079
factors of awakening

348
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,440
to flow out into the awareness or be

349
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:50,079
found in a clear form of awareness

350
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,000
so the buddha talked about letting go of

351
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:55,199
the five hindrances

352
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,800
and it isn't just letting go of them

353
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,279
that's important but it's also how they

354
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:00,399
create space

355
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:04,160
or open the gate for the seven factors

356
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,839
awakening to begin

357
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,880
opening or peering or flowing

358
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:12,560
into our presence into our awareness

359
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,320
and so we're gaining something as well

360
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,600
and uh and so

361
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,839
the letting go of great hate and

362
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,920
delusion

363
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,120
is not just about what we abandon

364
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,880
it's also what we gain

365
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,000
in other teachings the buddha points to

366
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,720
the five

367
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,279
the four divine abodes the four

368
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:39,839
brahmaviharas

369
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,000
is what starts flowing when the

370
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,680
gate has been pulled away from the

371
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,440
opened in the dam

372
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,720
then there's a so there's mehta uh

373
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:54,399
karuna mudita and upeka the pali words

374
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:56,000
usually translated into english as

375
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,240
living kindness compassion

376
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,120
appreciative joy sympathetic joy and

377
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,720
equanimity

378
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,800
and these are beautiful qualities of art

379
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,839
and they also are limited by our

380
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:13,519
preoccupations there's no room

381
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,079
for love and care and compassion if

382
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:16,639
we're

383
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,760
caught up in things like desire cut up

384
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,360
and aversion

385
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,600
doubt regrets and so to abandon those to

386
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,760
release those

387
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,759
it isn't just a matter isn't that we

388
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,000
have to then evoke this loving kindness

389
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,680
or compassion

390
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,360
there's something about the heart that

391
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,759
has space now to breathe breathing room

392
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:38,959
for the heart

393
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:43,839
that tends to then give birth to

394
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,519
these beautiful qualities of heart

395
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,440
there's space for them and if there's

396
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:51,759
space for them they flow

397
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,560
and so part of practice is to abandon to

398
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,079
let go

399
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:58,959
so that some of the best parts of our

400
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,000
human life

401
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,759
can flow and have a chance to be present

402
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,319
and so

403
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,800
and so the simplicity of all this is

404
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,399
that this is

405
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:13,040
this core aspects of the buddha's

406
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,240
teachings

407
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,440
is not exactly a religious teaching

408
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,480
it's not exactly a um you know

409
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,880
my religion versus your religion it's

410
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:24,880
actually teaching something which

411
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,600
um just as uh i'd like to think of it

412
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,519
just practical

413
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,959
psychology or practical uh spiritual

414
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:33,920
practice

415
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,399
that's available to anybody regardless

416
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,320
of what religion they are

417
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,959
and there's a remarkable teachings from

418
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,800
the ancient discourse

419
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,600
that points to this that i'd like to

420
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,839
read

421
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,920
from the connected discourses of the

422
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,720
buddha the book of threes

423
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,839
and i think it's um

424
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,839
this course

425
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:13,678
71 i think

426
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:19,839
72

427
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,280
and so here a man comes to

428
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,160
ananda the buddhist buddha's one of the

429
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:28,000
chief disciples

430
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,760
and asks him this question who's dumb

431
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,799
dhamma is well expounded

432
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,799
and dhamma is can be a word that's

433
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,280
synonymous with religion

434
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,760
and in the ancient world it means

435
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
teachings or religious doctrine or

436
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:44,720
something like that

437
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:46,640
so who's religious doctrine is well

438
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,320
expounded

439
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,440
the question one question on who in the

440
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,760
world are practicing the right way

441
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,240
the good way who are those people who

442
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,559
are prac really practicing the

443
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,000
good way and the true way

444
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,799
and then question number three is who in

445
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:05,360
the world

446
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,640
are the fortunate ones

447
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,919
and um and so the buddha then

448
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:16,240
ananda goes on and says that

449
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,200
those who teach the abandoning of

450
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:24,799
greed hatred and delusion

451
00:18:25,550 --> 00:18:27,280
[Music]

452
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,919
are the ones um um

453
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,760
he says this what do you think

454
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,240
is that dumb of those who teach the

455
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,799
abandoning of great hatred illusion

456
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:46,720
well expanded or not or how do you take

457
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,919
it

458
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,000
and the person who is talking to ananda

459
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
says well the dhamma of those who teach

460
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,280
the abandoning of greed hate and

461
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,000
illusion

462
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,320
is well expounded and you know the

463
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,080
religious teachings of those who teach

464
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,440
the abandoning of great hate and

465
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,480
delusion

466
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,640
that's well taught that's a good

467
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,240
teaching

468
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:07,600
and and what do you think ananda

469
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:08,559
continues

470
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:10,559
are those practicing for the abandoning

471
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,080
of lust hatred

472
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,799
great hatred and delusion practicing the

473
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,080
the good way

474
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,120
in the world or not how do you take it

475
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:21,200
those practicing for the abandoning of

476
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,799
great hate and delusion

477
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,159
are practicing the good way

478
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,679
and then are those who are practicing

479
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:31,039
who are abandoning greed hate and

480
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,440
delusion and really cut them out

481
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,640
really obliterated them to the end

482
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,360
are they the fortunate ones and the man

483
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,559
says yes those are the fortunate ones

484
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,960
so then that was that what he says next

485
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,799
is uh very nice

486
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:49,200
um the the householder the man who's

487
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:49,840
asking

488
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,640
questions for of ananda says

489
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:00,000
it is astounding it's amazing ananda

490
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,679
that there there is no that you have not

491
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,880
extolled

492
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:08,880
your own dhamma nor any denigration

493
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:11,840
of the dumb of others but just teaching

494
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,720
the dhamma

495
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,919
in its own sphere

496
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,200
so buddha ananda is not

497
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,799
championing the buddha's dharma

498
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,679
or or dismissing the importance of other

499
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,679
people's dharma

500
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,200
which is often what you get if someone

501
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,520
says what's what's the best religious

502
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,640
teaching in the world

503
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,159
some people might say oh mine is of

504
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,320
course but rather

505
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,400
than saying something like that ananda

506
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:41,200
is just offering this principles idea

507
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,919
about abandoning green hate and illusion

508
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:44,640
and then

509
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,320
and then rather than making any claim

510
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,159
about how wonderful it is

511
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,360
he asks the the person

512
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,320
asking the question is this well

513
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:55,440
expounded

514
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,240
is this the good way is this are these

515
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,520
the fortunate people

516
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,480
those who practice it and the man admits

517
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,039
that's

518
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:06,960
that's the answer that i was looking for

519
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,840
and so um

520
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,799
so this simplicity of um

521
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:20,159
of this inner look and not looking

522
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:22,320
outside not looking for what's ultimate

523
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,720
in kind of kind of religious way

524
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,600
maybe not looking for metaphysical

525
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,280
claims of truth

526
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,080
not looking for deep understandings of

527
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:36,080
the nature of the universe the world

528
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:38,400
the cosmos the beginning of time the end

529
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,000
of time

530
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,080
there's many answers that the buddhism

531
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:44,000
doesn't answer

532
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,440
but rather to

533
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,240
the heart of it is the simplicity of

534
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:50,720
looking

535
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,600
within oneself and freeing oneself

536
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,039
of forces which limit us

537
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:03,520
that block the flow letting those go

538
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,280
and then letting something beautiful

539
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,960
flow that's there

540
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,520
kind of like it's there waiting for us

541
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:10,640
though it's not really there

542
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,039
it's not like a thing that exists

543
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,720
independent of us

544
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:18,000
it's thing that exists with opening up

545
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,799
with the freedom with abandoning with

546
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:21,520
awareness

547
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:26,640
set free and um

548
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,840
and so letting go both

549
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,679
involves what is abandoned but also what

550
00:22:33,679 --> 00:22:34,000
is

551
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,400
gained and um

552
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:42,960
and so we gain and then

553
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:45,520
and more often than not what the buddha

554
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,760
talks about is

555
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:51,120
we abandon greed hatred and delusion

556
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,400
and then we gain freedom in some places

557
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,760
he adds a fourth

558
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:58,880
thing that's abandoned so there's four

559
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,080
things

560
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,480
and this maybe is helpful the fourth one

561
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,840
to keep in mind

562
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,480
so that we abandon the great hate

563
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,280
delusion

564
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,320
and be sure to keep it really simple

565
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,039
the fourth thing to be abandoned is

566
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,559
conceit

567
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:18,080
greed hatred and delusion and conceit

568
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,440
and and then we really let go of conceit

569
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,720
as well

570
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,480
then having abandoned great hate and

571
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,440
delusion won't give rise to conceit

572
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,120
look how special i am i'm i have the

573
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,280
most wonderful teachings i have the most

574
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,320
wonderful practice

575
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,880
i have the most wonderful attainment i'm

576
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:39,919
the most fortunate one

577
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,720
the idea of making making an eye out of

578
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:44,480
it and building up the self

579
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,679
is also abandoned and this is also

580
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,880
a delightful thing that

581
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,080
opens the gates for what's

582
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,960
wonderful in us to flow out conceit is

583
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,120
one of those things that closes the gate

584
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,400
blocks the flow in a sense

585
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:06,559
so um keeping it simple

586
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,720
appreciating the value of what we can

587
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,880
let go of within

588
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,919
that which blocks us and limits us and

589
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:14,960
appreciating

590
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,159
what's gained as we let go and

591
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,000
really feeling into that and

592
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,159
experiencing those gains

593
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:25,600
and maybe in doing so becoming

594
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,240
recognizing the seven factors of

595
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
awakening with that in us

596
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,279
maybe recognizing them

597
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,720
in a very small initial way but slowly

598
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,679
developing

599
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:39,120
having them recognizing them more and

600
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,919
more and giving space for them and

601
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,559
letting them really be a support for

602
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:46,480
this life of freedom

603
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:51,440
a life that is free of clinging

604
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:55,600
so thank you very much and uh

605
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:59,360
and may this week be one in which

606
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,559
you discover the value greater value in

607
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:03,919
letting go

608
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:05,840
in recognizing the seven factors

609
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:06,960
awakening

610
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:15,200
in your life
