so so as I

133
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:48,720
set up the small groups if there are any quick Reflections you're welcome to share them there will be more time at

134
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:56,100
the end but now I like to invite you all to uh to see you know this is an engagement of

135
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:02,539
the rubber meeting the road as we engage in small groups together

136
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:08,580
and uh the sense of letting letting your goodness letting your good not focusing

137
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:14,760
on your challenges your difficulties what's going wrong what's but actually

138
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,519
letting your light shine and speaking about this person knows you as if you're

139
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:28,620
representative like oh yes this person who's me actually they they love to practice or they they they

140
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:34,559
are dedicated to honesty or they're dedicated to their friends or or they

141
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:40,559
they like to be generous or they're good cook they're loved to cook for their friends just something about the

142
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:47,640
goodness of you as if you're sitting on your own shoulder you're being your own representative okay let me tell you about this person they're great in this

143
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:53,700
I'm just sharing that and if you feel too shy it's not you it's your representative that's sharing something

144
00:33:53,700 --> 00:34:00,720
but it's it's nice to actually say something about that like oh yes this this person who's me like likes to be

145
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:06,059
generous like it's true and don't shy away like oh I don't want to own it what

146
00:34:06,059 --> 00:34:12,060
if you actually showed up with your goodness we show up with all our problems and difficulties in the world

147
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:20,220
but what if you actually let your goodness shine again not from a place of ego but if I'm a place of goodness it's

148
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:26,158
very different and see if you can navigate and see that difference if you're speaking from a place of egos

149
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:33,000
okay say pass I'm gonna just pass and stood with this and maybe the next time it comes my maybe I'll say something or

150
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:39,240
you can just say pass if it's like a little uncomfortable it's totally fine so past I'm just gonna hold silent and

151
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:45,378
I'm not quite ready to talk yet perfectly fine hold other people's Beauties and goodness with with with

152
00:34:45,379 --> 00:34:51,618
modita with vicarious Joy but it's lovely to celebrate that with each other

153
00:34:51,619 --> 00:34:58,500
unusual we usually don't celebrate goodness we get together and complain about what's not going well celebrate

154
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:04,560
goodness just try try something a little different why not let's experiment

155
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,960
so so let's go in alphabetical order and

156
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:16,260
again you can say pass it's perfectly fine but something you share one one thing but you're realized about this

157
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:21,780
being in this person is a hard worker they work really hard um

158
00:35:21,780 --> 00:35:29,040
Etc and uh just say one nugget one thing share one thing the next person the next person comes back to you maybe one other

159
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:34,800
thing or not just uh but make sure everybody gets the chance to to share

160
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:41,579
something and to be celebrated celebrate each other yay how fun how fun so

161
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:46,800

someone else's goodness and then seniors celebrating your own goodness and and also in the group Kim please

168
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:33,420
I just have to apologize because I was put into a room and then I was trying to

169
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:40,160
press the enlarge and I was pretty pressing the X and so I was kicked out and then I was invited to another room

170
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:46,140
same thing went for a large if they acts but I was successful in the third in the

171
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:52,800
third room so my apologies to those of you I came in and jumped out

172
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,940
ah but that's sweet you visited lots of different rooms came you you spread your your light

173
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:05,520

175
00:37:13,020 --> 00:37:18,960
you don't have to switch on the spot um it was a good meditation it was uh

176
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:25,140
I enjoyed it I was able to um fall through with it and I would at

177
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:30,240
one point you know I was visualizing my lovable being and it kind of came

178
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:35,760
into me and then you said uh give yourself some space moved them back out

179
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:41,579
and then I was able to um yeah see myself from their point of

180
00:37:41,579 --> 00:37:47,520
view and then also think of some memories of me of when I

181
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,760
was showing some good qualities sweet thank you thanks for sharing that

182
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:59,579
Kim lovely beautiful yeah Ellie please

183
00:37:59,579 --> 00:38:06,180
hello yeah I was uh very interesting because I'm just so uh close to the inner critic

184
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:11,400
for so long I mean it was just hard stretch for me to do it and then I said why not

185
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:18,119
and in the first one that came on was a little hard but then it kept rolling and it just like I started enjoying it kind

186
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:24,359
of like befriending myself for the first time because the other part I know so well but this is very very new

189
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,720
difficult not usually don't quite go here but I'm just gonna try it out and then oh wow it gets easier yes of course

for a second sorry to see you disappear another time um

194
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:16,380
um I would have found this impossible to do if I were speaking from the first person and uh if I was doing it

195
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:22,619
correctly referring to myself in the third person uh made it possible and uh

196
00:39:22,619 --> 00:39:30,540
still not easy uh but but feasible in a way that you know using the eye would just would

197
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:36,359
have been out of the question nice thank you Fred so appreciate

198
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:41,820
um you sharing that actually having the third person perspective made it easier

00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:46,920
it just created a little bit of space and beautiful thanks for sharing that
