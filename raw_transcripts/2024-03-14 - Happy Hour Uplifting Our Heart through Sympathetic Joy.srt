1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,520
so hello again hello and welcome to this rendition of happy hour as we come

2
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:12,080
together um as a community to practice these beautiful qualities of

3
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:20,240
the heart so so for today's practice I'd like to invite us to explore um one of

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:26,439
the four Brahma viharas one of the four uh beautiful qualities of the heart

5
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:32,320
beautiful practices of the heart and the third one today so third one being in in

6
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:38,879
poly it's called mudita the translation is vicarious Joy or sympathetic Joy or

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:47,640
basically happiness for the happiness of others wow how what a beautiful quality and and whenever I think of of mudita I

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:56,000
think of Joy it just makes me happy when I practice it I especially practice it as an uplift when feel like a do drum I

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:03,519
want to be become happy so I just practice this and and my heart and mind become becomes happier so it's it's just

10
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:09,320
really an act of generosity practicing um mudita and guess what who who

11
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,600
benefits from this act of generosity of practice I do we do when we practice it

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:23,680
so so um the um yeah the dalama has said

13
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,240
um know when you're just happy for your own happiness you have one chance of just being happy when when you're happy

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:35,479
for the happiness of others you have uh what is it now 7 billion is the

15
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:42,640
population of the Earth to uh 7 billion chances of becoming happy so so so

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:50,600
couple more words about this practice um basically this is meta which is loving

17
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:57,320
kindness which is just friendliness Goodwill it's the feeling of simple Goodwill that we have friendliness you

18
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:03,640
have friendliness for your friends you have friendliness for your neighbors perhaps or for there

19
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:10,560
for pets for little children you know it's just friendliness good well um and

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:17,640
this friendliness when it when it meets someone who is having some happiness in

21
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:25,080
their life it doesn't have to be every aspect of their life but it's one aspect that's going well and you feel happy for

22
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:31,280
them you feel genuinely as if it were your own you let their happiness the The

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:39,599
Good Fortune uplift your heart you let it uplift your heart um and it does and

24
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:52,040
it does so um yeah the um you'll also say the the

25
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:59,080
sometimes what masquerades as as mudita is pride the sense of Pride instead of

26
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:06,319
just just uh and pride comes with attachment when you're really proud of something or someone whereas mudita

27
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,599
vicarious Joy is just abundant they just happy for their happiness without making

28
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:19,799
it mine like oh what does it reflect on me if it's your child oh that means I'm a good mother or a good parent right so

29
00:03:19,799 --> 00:03:26,480
doesn't have those extra unneeded attachments and the opposite uh also to

30
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,599
say the opposite of um the uh beautiful quality of the heart this

31
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:38,280
this um vicarious Joy is is Envy um when

32
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,760
you your heart gets tied because you want what the other person is having as if there's it just because they have it

33
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:51,120
it means you can't have it um so the way to work with that if it comes up and if

34
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,640
it comes up don't berate yourself it's okay the way to work with it is realize there's so many opportunities for

35
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,840
happiness in the world by you becoming happy for them it doesn't diminish you

36
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,079
uh it actually uplifts your heart gives you more capacity to to have more

37
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:16,079
happiness for yourself in so many different ways that might be available for you so just a couple of

38
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,600
um yeah this is a this is a rich teaching of course we can stay spend the

39
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:30,000

174
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:13,880
begin because we each shared just one little thing and went around and then went around and around and around and we

191
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:07,760
community for this for the all the causes and conditions that brought many

192
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:14,080
years of um happy hour together possible thanks Fred yeah I feel grateful for

193
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:20,120
that yay yeah um I thought I saw a hand and

194
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:26,440
it disappeared I see one question let's see um hi Nikki can you talk about how

195
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:32,840
comparing oneself to others relates to today's practice ah yeah that's a great

196
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:39,600
question so um yeah comparison is the thief of Joy

197
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:47,039
it's basically if you want to um if one wants to become miserable basically it's

198
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:53,080
you know what one is to compare experiences oh this wasn't as good as that or this was this this thing oh yeah

199
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:59,799
that was a let down you know comparing comparing instead of meeting everyone new every experience know and then

200
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:08,679
comparing oneself which is more the question that has been sent to me is uh comparing oneself it's um maybe one

201
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:15,840
thing I would say is what is really helpful is um consider that each person

202
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:22,200
each being is born of all the causes and conditions of their life that is so

203
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:27,320
unique to them um and I can only be me I

204
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:33,240
can only be the best version of Nikki I can possibly be I can't be anybody else

205
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:40,200
because I haven't had the causes and conditions of their birth their genetics their upbringing their educa it just

206
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:49,480
it's not possible so comparing ourselves to others is kind of crazy it's it's it's crazy in the way

207
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:55,000
that I mean we do that of course um but it's it's it doesn't make sense with

208
00:32:55,000 --> 00:33:00,919
eyes of wisdom when you really truly see that each person has their unique causes

209
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:06,320
and conditions and I can't compare myself to them because if I compare myself to that other person I have to

210
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:12,880
compare every cause and condition like go back through like years and years of history of their parents and their great

211
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:20,559
parents and their great great parents and their conditions and their lives and their upbringing and their it just doesn't right so I can just compare

212
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:28,600
myself to the best version of me that's all I can do because that's um anyway I

213
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:33,760
I hope that is helpful to the person who wrote the question to me privately um to

214
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:38,919
create to help bring a different perspective to loosen that comparative

215
00:33:38,919 --> 00:33:46,120
mind um which is um yeah the thief of joy and thief of gratitude and and

216
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:51,200
doesn't make sense anyway Through The Eyes of wisdom and if you need more

217
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,720
explanation you can also write in chat and maybe I can talk about it in a different

218
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,760
way any other Reflections questions before

219
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:05,760

220
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:20,560

222
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:31,480
York yes um I thought this is real Quicky but I thought it was very

223
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:39,839
interesting that two of the three of us keep a daily gratitude list which I totally recommend to

224
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:45,358
everybody else because it makes such a difference yeah great I just love that

225
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:51,079
Claire you brought this up many times and I just love that you keep bringing up I love it you're the poster child for

226
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:56,599
gratitude practice I love it something if it works you know you gota sell it I

227
00:34:56,599 --> 00:35:04,680
love it I just love it we almost had a chance to hear Richard play his guitar

228
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:10,320
too oh that's sweet that that would bring up gratitude and and and and I'm

229
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,800
grateful for the fun group I was in oh that's sweet that is very sweet yeah

230
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,640
thank you Claire and thanks for putting in a vote as always for the the um

231
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:28,280
Valley of gratitude Journal yeah I I I used to do that actually for a while at

232
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,800
at first with someone else we' do it together and that was really joyous and then I would do it on my own and then um

233
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:40,440
and then it became a practice at night whenever I went to bed and I'm glad you said it because I realized I've just

234
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:47,720
been so jetl recently I traveled to India and back I'm like ah I just kind of lost my you know the the the pract

235
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:53,839
like you know you have a habit pattern set and you come back from a trip and you're like wait what was I doing what

236
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,359
so I'm so glad you brought it back because I think I'm going to do that again so every so I'll tell you what my

237
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,440
practic is is is when I go to bed at night before I fall asleep basically I

238
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:11,040
go through everything like every thing that happened through the day with with like with an uplift like Oh yay that

239
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:18,119
happened yay there's a just a little bit of ding of gratitude oh yeah that happened and I sent that email yay and I

240
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:29,560
received that and so that's that's my yeah thank you and Diana please

241
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:38,000
well you just said what I was going to say what I do um is before I go to bed

242
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:45,119
at night um is I write down a grateful list and not just two or three things

243
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:50,440
sometimes it just explodes but also with the thought of why I'm grateful doesn't

244
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:58,040
take long and I've learned I like to do it then because when I wake it's

245
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:03,079
probably the last thing I do maybe before I go to sleep when I wake up in

246
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:10,640
the morning I tend to to be very clear and and feel good some something

247
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:18,640
has happened so that's all I have to say it's it's a wonderful way to wake up in the morning beautiful I love that always

248
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:24,079
but um with a smile on my face so and I remember something I'm grateful for so a

249
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:30,800
that's sweet I thanks thanks Diana I like the impact of it right the the morning after the day after and and what

250
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,680
you just said reminded me of um of uh a researcher a gratitude

251
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:43,520
researcher um who said that uh counting your blessings is a much better way to

252
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:50,680
fall asleep than counting sheep so so and um yeah because Al you also wake up

253
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:58,240
feeling happier yeah beautiful thanks Diana I appreciate that and let's see

254
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:03,599
yes the reflection uh uh from the person who asked about comparison thank you

255
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:09,960
that's very helpful I often judge myself for not doing what I think others are doing even if I have chosen not to do

256
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:17,319
those things with some intention I know this isn't beneficial so it helps to have lots of tools to address it great

257
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:22,680
beautiful thank you so much for for sharing your reflection um and for the

258
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:31,400
benefit of everyone because comparison is something that we all do uh and it's helpful to to be be um to have tools to

259
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:36,640
address it it's not right it's not Wise It's not helpful and yet we do it and

260
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:42,800
kind of like makes us it belittles us so so um yeah it's it's it's important to

261
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,520
discuss that anything else before we close about comparison about gratitude

262
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:54,160
about vicarious joy happiness for the happiness of others maybe maybe maybe one last reflection and anyone really

263
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:00,440
got into feeling happy for the happiness of someone else yes yes I see Hands yeah I see a bunch

264
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:06,400
of hands great lovely awesome anybody want to say anything about it especially if you're new to happy hour do you want

265
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,880

266
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,920
physical hand I may not see I see

267
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,520
Neil I'm gonna say I'm new because every day is new

268
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,359
um good so

269
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:34,800
so right something I found I did today right I was thinking about my wife she

270
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:41,079
really digs our dog and it brings her such great joy you know and so I was

271
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:47,359
thinking about that and then I remembered that she spoken about getting a dog when she was young and how much

272
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:55,359
joy that brought her and it was very interesting because thinking of her as a young child having Joy right as good as

273
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:01,800
it was going it like whoosh like open the floodgates you know

274
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:09,520
and that was a very interesting thing because other people I'm pretty sure have been young and happy kids too um so

275
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:16,200
it seemed like you know a new trick in the in the you know a new arrow in the

276
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:22,520
in the arrow thingy I forget what it's called um you know to use you know as to

277
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:31,000
help you know appreciate right thinking about them when they were kids yeah beautiful Neil I'm so glad to hear you

278
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,400
uh say that and and when you say about you know talk about the arrow and in your whatever that thing he's called I'm forgetting as well but but um it's it's

279
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,880
like being a um you know the idea of not so much making War right because we

280
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:50,680
associate not errors not just with war but also with with the cupid like you're being a cupid of your own heart right

281
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:56,920
it's like oh yeah here's another eror swee I'm going to wake up open up your floodgates thinking of someone that you

282
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:05,760
