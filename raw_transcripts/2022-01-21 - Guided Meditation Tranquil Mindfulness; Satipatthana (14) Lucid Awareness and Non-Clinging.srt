1
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:10,719
so good morning a good day welcome

2
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,000
and the buddha said that it's likely to slight paraphrase

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,840
that tranquility supports tranquility

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,160
and this can be understood that if you let yourself become aware

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,200
of the tranquility that's here the tranquility can grow

6
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:44,800
if you ignore that whatever tranquility is here it doesn't support or the growth

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,120
of more tranquility and in this sati patana practice the first exercise with

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:59,359
breathing the tranquility that is focused on is tranquility of the body

9
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:05,600
and uh so some translations will will say that

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,880
the the last exercise is breathing in one tranquilizes the

11
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,119
bodily formations tranquilizes the bodily constructs the tension the holdings the

12
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,040
part the way the muscles are engaged very subtly

13
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,080
based on how the mind is breathing out

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,679
one tranquilizes the bodily formations

15
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,799
the bodily activities and and so there is this movement towards

16
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,560
tranquility in this practice that begins when we start just taking

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,680
the posture and see seeing if you can find a posture

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,200
that supports tranquility some modicum some minimum kind of feeling of

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:02,240
being the body is still but not just still

20
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,879
in a hell tranquility is a certain stillness that has a wholesome feeling to it it feels

21
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,160
refreshing or feels nice and

22
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:21,040
the deep tranquility of meditation practice is not kind of calm that puts us to sleep

23
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,440
it's a kind of clarity energized clarity that's very peaceful

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:33,840
and as the practice deepens awareness takes on qualities of

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:42,400
tranquility itself awareness becomes peaceful and the analogy i have for it is

26
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,760
being in some very beautiful wonderful sacred space

27
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:55,440
it could be some you know great cathedral in the natural world

28
00:02:55,440 --> 00:03:00,720
of great big redwood trees or great mountains or

29
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,200
looking out across the sea it could be a one of the large cro the great cathedral where you go in and

30
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,400
it has this maybe the busy noisy streets are outside you go inside and

31
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:19,120
and uh there's a quiet and a piece that uh stillness

32
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:27,440
and in these spaces awareness is is there present without having to

33
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,840
work for it without having to search for it or direct or do anything

34
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,920
it's just somehow the space the situation just

35
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:48,239
allows for kind of a spacious open wide awareness that somehow is attuned or becomes part

36
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,760
of the peacefulness of the place the quiet of the place

37
00:03:54,319 --> 00:04:02,080
and attention is not directed it isn't like awareness being used or to work

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,519
it's simply present it's there and

39
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:15,680
there might be other places that um in your life where just awareness is just there in a nice way

40
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,000
it could be that something as simple as waking up from a very refreshing nap

41
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,800
and you just feel like oh you're just aware you're not really focusing or trying to do anything with it

42
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,479
but you're just you're clearly aware and it's kind of a clarity or maybe

43
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,560
looking out across a great expanse of natural worlds being on a cliff or in the mountainside

44
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:46,400
and it just the situation just calls on awakens a kind of tranquil open

45
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:53,360
awareness but not searching for something not trying to focus on something it's just there the awareness is present

46
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:58,479
and so in this satipatana here in the first

47
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:06,720
exercise there is a gentle movement that takes time that involves establishing awareness

48
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:14,720
settling in on the breathing letting the settling on the breathing settle the mind settle the body

49
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:21,520
until it becomes easier just to relax the body more and more and make and help the body's body become

50
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:29,280
tranquil and appreciating the tranquility of the body and in when that's established

51
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,600
then awareness doesn't have to be directed so much anymore it doesn't have to be work it doesn't

52
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,360
have to be like f making effort to know what's happening or to feel what's happening

53
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:48,479
and it's not just feeling it's not just knowing it's this uh kind of broad or maybe it's the gestalt

54
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,840
or the harmonious working of all or attentional capacities

55
00:05:53,840 --> 00:06:00,639
into a state that we might call being aware and then having this awareness

56
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,600
established or present and um and abiding in it

57
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,600
so this is a pro so i'm just describing a process and i'll say more uh later but

58
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:19,440
so for today let's uh focus a little bit more on this tranquility

59
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:25,600
and see if tranquility awareness can take on some of the qualities of

60
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:32,080
tranquility so assuming a posture

61
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:37,280
that will allow your body to be tranquil and still

62
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:46,160
but it should be a posture that also has some degree of alertness to it

63
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,840
a little bit teeny bit energized so the energy the alertness maybe the

64
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:57,599
uprightness can hold the tranquility

65
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,840
gently closing the eyes

66
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,960
and then noticing is there any hints of tranquility for you now in your

67
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,800
body your mind your heart

68
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,160
maybe it's even in your little finger or

69
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:31,840
your big toe or something but anywhere at all

70
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,759
and then you know in a manner that has some degree of tranquility or calm in it

71
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,319
calmly take some larger breaths

72
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,240
and then as you exhale calmly

73
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,360
soften the body

74
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:19,160
calmly relax your body

75
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:41,839
and then to let your breathing return to normal

76
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:51,279
and calmly taking your time as you breathe normally

77
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,800
search through your body for places that you can relax soften

78
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:06,560
and as you do so see if that can be a settling into

79
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,240
a degree of tranquility or peace

80
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:43,440
letting your breathing return to normal

81
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:53,440
and seeing if there can be a little bit of sense of tranquility or calm

82
00:09:53,440 --> 00:10:03,399
in establishing your attention and experience the of the body breathing

83
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,839
breathing in and breathing out

84
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,000
perhaps if it's present if some tranquility is present for you

85
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,200
maybe that can be the

86
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:05,399
atmosphere within which you're breathing

87
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:24,839
an atmosphere that includes awareness tranquil awareness

88
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:43,760
if your mind wanders off relax something relax

89
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:49,040
any holding or tension in the thinking

90
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,600
any or in the body related to thinking

91
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,480
and see if you can settle back in

92
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:10,800
to a tranquil awareness it's more like the atmosphere

93
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:18,079
than it is doing but which

94
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:25,160
within which breathing is the center

95
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:41,240
a tranquility that makes room for the kind of awareness

96
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:44,959
that doesn't require effort

97
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,040
the kind of awareness that just is

98
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:08,519
some people might call it just being conscious

99
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,600
tranquil con conscious in a tranquil way

100
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:21,560
the effortless way of being conscious

101
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,440
breathing breathing

102
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,880
through that effortless awareness

103
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:39,360
noticing whatever tranquility peacefulness

104
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:43,480
is present for you now

105
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,919
and is that sense of tranquility shared in some way that it's shared

106
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:07,840
by awareness by being aware being conscious

107
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:28,720
and imagine that with whatever calm tranquility

108
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,600
peacefulness you have

109
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:43,919
that you're sitting together with someone you trust

110
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,840
someone that you it's easy and peaceful to be with

111
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,480
and nothing's required nothing needs to be said but see what it's like what would it be

112
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:07,840
like to sit there aware of them present with them

113
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,520
through this tranquility through this peacefulness

114
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:32,320
perhaps appreciating them perhaps having good will

115
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,679
care for them

116
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,360
nothing's required the care the good will don't need any nothing needs to be

117
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:53,559
done just let it be there in the peacefulness in the care

118
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:06,960
and with that kind of good will staying in that place of tranquility

119
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,000
expand your goodwill now out into the world

120
00:29:14,799 --> 00:29:19,760
tranquilly wishing all beings well

121
00:29:21,679 --> 00:29:27,840
may all beings be happy

122
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:35,200
may all beings be safe

123
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,840
may all beings be peaceful

124
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:47,759
may all beings be free

125
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:55,840
and may my peacefulness

126
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:05,919
create the conditions that support them in feeling those ways

127
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:12,039
may all beings be free

128
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:28,910
[Music]

129
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,559
so the last step of the refrain for satipatanam

130
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:44,158
is one abides mindful

131
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:52,559
that there is a body just to the extent necessary

132
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:58,720
for knowledge and lucid awareness

133
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:05,840
being independent

134
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:13,440
of see dwelling independent not clinging to

135
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:18,880
anything in the world so

136
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:24,640
when abides again this is again a very important word when it rests when it just allows

137
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:32,080
at the abiding there's not a lot of work mindfulness because now has transitioned from whatever directedness whatever

138
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:38,880
efforts needed to show up and be present to allowing so just to be present

139
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:45,200
it's more almost like more of a being rather than a doing and when abides

140
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,640
um in awareness and but the awareness when abides

141
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:57,760
in awareness is present to this very simple recognition there is

142
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:05,679
a body so it's very simple it's you know just no judgment no complications

143
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:10,960
no analysis no that has to be different in any kind of way

144
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:18,000
it's just a simple simple recognition just to the extent necessary i love this expression just to the extent necessary

145
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:25,039
we're not looking for a really super high standard to do the absolutely the best we can but just the extent necessary so

146
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:32,640
awareness is established just to the extent necessary for there to be knowledge the knowing

147
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:39,919
a very simple knowing that's not work it's not like actively knowing but uh it's just kind of the

148
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:45,120
knowing like for example there is a body knowing that we're

149
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,159
independent not dependent on anything

150
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:57,440
knowing that we are not clinging to anything

151
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,399
and um and uh and so to the extent there's knowledge

152
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:09,840
and lucid awareness and this word lucid awareness is in in pali has the word

153
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:14,960
sati in it the word is often translated as mindfulness

154
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:20,279
it's uh has a prefix pati p-a-t-i so

155
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:25,679
p-a-t-i-s-a-t-i patti sati and it's a reflexive

156
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,360
prefix meaning kind of reflecting back on oneself and so it's here it's awareness that

157
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:37,039
kind of is aware of itself so i try and say this is a lucid awareness

158
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,720
there's a lucid because we know we're aware in a lucid clear way

159
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,320
and so the practice leads to this place where

160
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:54,640
there's a very simple abiding in awareness that's lucid

161
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:01,360
and is able to know very simple things including and that sets the stage for

162
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:07,440
moving into um this freedom of not being dependent on

163
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:13,679
anything in the world not clinging to anything in the world and what that means is not necessarily

164
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,000
that we don't depend on you know on shopkeepers having food for so we can

165
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,679
live but rather not the uh the awareness the mind the heart

166
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,679
is at rest in itself and the mind and heart don't need anything for suppressing a kind of

167
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:38,480
peaceful place and this uh last phrase

168
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:45,040
being independent not depending on anything not clinging to anything in the world

169
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:50,480
is one way of describing nibana the full

170
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:57,359
realization of practice so it's a you know you don't expect to sit down and just do that

171
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:02,640
quickly but it's something that grows over time and this idea of this practice growing

172
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:07,680
over time is inherent in this whole way in which satipattan is laid out it's

173
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:13,520
we're describing a path a process and um and so having a sense that

174
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,839
there's kind of an onward leading movement slowly over time but it's not an armored leading movement

175
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,320
that's linear that you can expect to just kind of steadily go make progress it's more like up and down back and

176
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:33,440
forth and our lives are so complicated the states of our mind are so different from different times but

177
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:41,680
slowly over time we're kind of moving in one direction and that direction is towards freedom

178
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,440
so there is this process there's this path a journey that unfolds over time

179
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:54,160
and uh so we don't get tripped up around that and caught up in striving and comparing ourselves and wanting to be

180
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,359
further than we are one of the principles that i love is the principle that

181
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:04,560
to go from a to b be fully at a

182
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,599
so for the purpose of mindfulness practice if you want to go anywhere in your mindfulness practice

183
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:15,839
don't worry about getting anywhere with the practice just focus on being fully present for what is

184
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,760
and that practice of fully present for what is is what is onward leading it'll it'll unfold the way it's supposed to

185
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,839
unfold if our our our dedication is not making progress but rather showing up

186
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:34,000
and being fully present here the progress makes that takes care of itself

187
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:40,480
um so the to summarize or to repeat kind of what i've said already to get a sense of this journey

188
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:45,760
that's described so far the buddhist talks about there's a

189
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,880
there's a path to liberation a path to nibana

190
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:57,838
and what is that it's uh observing the body and the body

191
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:04,960
uh ardent aware and clearly comprehending having put aside grief

192
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:11,839
and uh and uh covetousness for the world

193
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:19,040
so that's a high standard already to put put aside covetousness and grief for the world to stress for the world

194
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:26,400
to be you know and um so then he wants to say well how do you do that how do you practice this

195
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,000
practicing observing the body in terms of the body well you sit down to meditate sit

196
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:38,320
upright and you establish awareness and with awareness established

197
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:45,040
you use that first to become aware of your breathing and because the mind so easily wanders

198
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,599
off the tether to the present moment is knowing knowing the breath

199
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:57,920
and if some people will use the knowing or a practice of knowing with a mental

200
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:03,359
noting so as they feel the breathing they say in

201
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:09,119
out or rising of the belly falling of the belly or the chest

202
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:15,280
and that mental note is a little bit way of being emphatic slightly emphatic with the knowing of the breathing as you

203
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:20,640
know it and kind of as a tether to the present moment

204
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:27,040
as that practice deepens then we can become aware of our body and we just become aware of the whole

205
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:32,800
body at some point and then the onward leading movement goes

206
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:38,079
towards relaxing the body and this part of the process is can be

207
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:45,119
repeated over and over again um you know for a long time just getting used to it and knowing and feeling and

208
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:51,599
relaxing and some days one is emphasized more than the other sometimes we just stay at step one

209
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,520
uh barely stay there because the mind is so busy so

210
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:04,720
whatever you are just be fully at a practice with what you have that's what onward leading practice where you are

211
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:11,359
not where you think you should be but then as we settle in and there's more and more tranquility and we settle

212
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:17,359
into that tranquility then the awareness we observe we enter this phase of

213
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:25,040
practice where there's observation watching just this non-reactive non-interfering

214
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:30,480
perceiving of experience and we experience it um

215
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:38,720
internally and externally and one way of understanding that is that it's just open awareness is now open 360 degrees

216
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:45,280
and and we're aware of the body the full body in a simple relaxed way

217
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:52,079
and and as we settle into that further then we abide in a situation where a time

218
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:59,440
when awareness begins tuning in to the changing nature the flow of change the inconstancy of

219
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:06,240
experience and then constantly change things coming and going it becomes clear after a while

220
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:13,599
that it doesn't make any sense to cling to anything hold on to anything resist anything because everything is flowing

221
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:18,640
and if anything it's like we we surrender to that sense of flow in the body

222
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:24,400
that exists of everything arising and passing everything moving

223
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,839
and we see so clearly that we when we get up get involved in thoughts and concepts

224
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,359
that we kind of start solidifying our experience again

225
00:40:35,359 --> 00:40:40,480
and so then we dip back down into that the flow of the river of life that flows through

226
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:46,720
us with all experience and because we're not clinging at some point then

227
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:54,240
what happens next is that we're just there present in the simplest possible way with a lucid awareness

228
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:59,599
awareness becomes freed from how it gets agitated or contracted or

229
00:40:59,599 --> 00:41:05,440
cloudy with concepts clinging wanting not wanting it's just this lucid

230
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:11,440
awareness lucid consciousness that is not working to be mindful not

231
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:17,280
working to do anything it's more like something we abide in we rest in

232
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,040
we allow and that very still quiet mind

233
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:30,319
where we just allow things to be where we're not for or against anything is a very equanimous

234
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:35,839
and that allows for even a deeper letting go where we in that state

235
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:41,359
it's clear that our hearts our minds is no longer depends on its well-being on

236
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:47,599
anything at all there's no not that it's kind of self-contained or self-existing

237
00:41:47,599 --> 00:41:52,800
our sense of well-being and freedom so it doesn't depend on anything at all

238
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:59,040
and then and not clinging to anything in the world

239
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:04,480
and and to have that experience and have that as a reference point for what's possible

240
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:09,599
it brings a lot of wisdom a lot of inspiration

241
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:16,000
probably you'll cling again probably you'll have a sense of depending on things again but you you'll have a you understand

242
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,520
there's a different perspective now different way of being and you'll you'll hopefully hold your

243
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:27,680
clinging hold your feeling of dependence much more lightly and you have a sense that practice is

244
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:33,280
moving beyond it to be free of all that so this is a journey

245
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:40,000
and so now we've done uh the first exercise of the sattipatana gone through with the breathing

246
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:46,160
into the refrain and now the same uh there's 12 more exercises

247
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,160
each with the same refrain that we just went through and um and so on monday i'll start with

248
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,640
the second exercise contextualizing a little bit and um and uh

249
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,640
and uh but we'll never lose track of the breathing i mean the guided meditations will often come back to the breathing

250
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,480
it's like this it's like the anchor or the foundation uh that supports this i hope

251
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:16,400
and but the other practices are also relevant and so if some of you don't care for the breathing at some point these others

252
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:22,880
might be more meaningful for you so um

253
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:29,119
thank you and i when i now we continue on monday

254
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:34,559
i'll be back at um um

255
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:41,040
irc the insight retreat center i'm teaching a retreat next week so i'll be film i'll be broadcasting from the

256
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:46,800
meditation hall there and so you'll see um you know that i'm a different location

257
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:51,240
so thank you all
