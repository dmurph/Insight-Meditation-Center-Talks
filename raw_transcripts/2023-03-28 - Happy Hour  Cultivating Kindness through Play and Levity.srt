[Music]

129
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,240
thanks everyone

130
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:48,320
thank you for your practice

131
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:56,460
so so what we did

132
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:02,460
what I invited you to try to try on our size

133
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:10,799
is this sense of for many of us maybe not for everyone but but maybe for

134
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:17,039
for many the childhood there is a sense of curiosity and and likeness and play

135
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:23,399
so which which we lose when we become adults we become so serious everything

136
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:32,279
is so so important that there's such such a sense of gravity and I can also

137
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:37,860
um impact the way that we see everyone and see ourselves in the world can impact

138
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:43,260
our practice as the Grim duty this heaviness of it so this was an

139
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:49,380
invitation to try and and in whatever way that it worked for you to try on the

140
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:54,600
sense of lightness so the invitation was to see yourself playing just really

141
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:00,899
feeling to touch into the sense of levity play that that we knew as

142
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:09,779
children and then to have these Preposterous images of us playing as adults doing the same games and and

143
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:16,140
um and really just as an invitation to feel into the lightness and also meta

144
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:24,480
can flow so easily out of that that lightness this good will for ourselves for our friends so as so likeness play

145
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,299
as as a bridge to kindness you know you want your friends to be happy you want

146
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:36,299
to be happy you want to play happily together so that as a bridge and

147
00:32:36,299 --> 00:32:43,200
um it was an invitation to try it on for size I mean I worked for some of you not for some of you it's okay it's perfectly

148
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:48,380
fine it's not the only way it's just one exploration

149
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:56,299
so as we turn into uh to practice into small group practice

150
00:32:56,299 --> 00:33:03,360
the invitation is to feel into um to feel into the sense of lightness

151
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,600
levity play and maybe if you wanted to share one aspect of how the practice

152
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,480
worked for you or didn't it's perfectly fine or you can offer a

153
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,419
your silence and just say pass and maybe something I'll offer as an

154
00:33:21,419 --> 00:33:27,980
example so for me as I was guiding in many different things but one thing was that as I was inviting you to imagine

155
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:33,720
as an adult I had this memory that my cousins used to visit and were roughly

156
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,080
the same age there were like maybe five or six of us we would have this fake marching band we would just make a lot

157
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:45,299
of noise going from room to room to room like one after another and I just

158
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:50,880
imagined us you know banging on pots and pans as adults and just walking from how

159
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:58,860
how ludicrous there's a sense of play oh yeah we don't play but but I can imagine ourselves laughing as adults how silly

160
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:04,860
that would be we actually did that why not so I also wanted to

161
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:12,179
um invite you to to respect each other's privacy whatever is said in the Sacred

162
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:20,658
Space of the small groups stays in the Sacred Space of the small groups it's not repeated elsewhere

163
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:27,658
and the invitation is to take care of yourselves take care of others no questions no questioning no leading you

164
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:34,679
just offer one reflection one short reflection then the next person can share a reflection or say pass and then

165
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:41,878
the next person and then your turn comes so we'll just make the reflections really short maybe just 30 seconds or a

166
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:47,460
minute so that other people will have a chance and will come back to us and maybe we'll share something is another

167
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:55,440
story or something else or another way that our hearts may be found its way into lightness into a meta into yeah

168
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,339
there's more lightness about my body and my mind my heart um I can have this child like this

169
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:10,320
lightness about me as I go about my my adults practice and adult ways of being

170
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,140
so and let's go uh all in alphabetical

171
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:22,859
order um and again you can always just say pass and maybe the next time your turn

172
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:28,320
comes you can you'll offer something or not it's perfectly fine so I'm creating

173
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,359
the rooms and take care of yourselves take care of each other and have fun

174
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:38,520
this is a Sandbox see it as a Sandbox for play for the levity don't don't all

175
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,220
of a sudden get so serious with with uh with your

176
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:48,619

177

178
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:04,920
Reflections for reports how was the practice for you how were the groups you

179
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,560

180
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:17,119
the chat is now open to everyone if you want to talk to everyone you're welcome to if you just want to send it to me

182
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:30,480
um Anonymous reflection so what uh what came up what did you notice

183
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:36,780
in this practice either for yourself individually or in

184
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:39,079
the group

185
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:52,338
person who is an iPhone I don't see your name hi sujan

186
00:36:53,820 --> 00:37:00,180
um so when we talk about you know want me to try food and I

187
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:07,680
thought of one um friends um I visit their family and had a fun

188
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:13,260
together but the thing is that I in my life I'm very

189
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:23,040
playful now I'm like yes I was like and then I realized when I grow up in Korea

190
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,940
um our family was like more of a lot of like strict and I was not allowed to

191
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:36,300
have really fun as a kids um you know like you know when I wanted

192
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:45,720
to have a really fun my mom doesn't like it and it's just all those things reminds me of how I have not have fallen

193
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,540
so long and then I finally when I grew up now since 20 years ago I came here

194
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:59,339
from I mean from Korea and I learned so much of so much of fun in life so yeah

195
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:06,540
yeah thank you for sharing that so so what I'm hearing is that for you actually the bringing back the memories

196
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:14,099
of childhood and friendship and and and fun actually that doesn't work so well and and I bet there are others for whom

197
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:19,200
I know for others actually another person uh chat or send me a chat uh but

198
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,859
it doesn't quite work because childhood wasn't a happy time or a playful time and and and

199
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:31,079
absolutely so that's not a very helpful way in these are just invitations and

200
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:38,060
yet what I'm hearing for you sujang as you've become an an adult you've re-parented yourself in in in

201
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:43,740
playfulness in the ways of having fun actually having a light-heartedness so

202
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:50,400
so basically the point of these invitations was for us to find a way to bring light-heartedness a little bit of

203
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:58,079
Light art and it's unusual it's in it's in childhood for many not for everyone and it's okay but there are other kids

204
00:38:58,079 --> 00:39:03,839
you know where do you find light-heartedness where do you find lightness can you bring that and it

205
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,599
sounds like you found that in your adult life and so bringing a sense of that

206
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:16,560
into your life and into your practice otherwise it can become so heavy as I said this morning of course you guys may

207
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:21,599
not have been there really this is an invitation to see them

208
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:29,820
the fullness in emptiness because it every it The Emptiness is the mark of

209
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:37,079
existence nothing exists independent of other things and so so there is a sense

210
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:43,320
of freedom of emptiness lightness of emptiness and yet there is this fullness

211
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:49,380
there is this Joy there's the joy of possibility so so that's what I'm trying

212
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:55,440
to invite us to not be fixed into it's only this way and it's only this and

213
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:01,859
it's very heavy and it's very tight and but open up so that and each of you

214
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:07,920
might have your own way it may not be in the childhood but it might be in other ways so thank you for bringing that in

215
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,359
really appreciate it thank you

216
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:20,900
any other realizations aha moments

217
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,869
[Music]

218
00:40:36,720 --> 00:40:42,180
you still wait let me try again bear good work the first time oh I did

219
00:40:42,180 --> 00:40:47,820
okay so right I mean this was like a lot of fun I thought I mean I that was sort of

220
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:54,119
you know it was playful I guess um by the way I did imagine myself as an adult playing with a little kid on a

221
00:40:54,119 --> 00:41:00,660
seesaw it was it was hysterical something right at Looney Tunes um you know one of the things I noticed

222
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:05,820
was you know when you think about little kids you know it's hard not to like wish

223
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:12,660
them well you know right and you know right even the ones who like were really

224
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:19,200
difficult for me right it really made my life miserable right it was obvious they were having a freaking hard time back

225
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:25,079
then you know and you know they grow up into adults who maybe are still having a

226
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:30,660
hard time you know and and it was like you know it really felt just warm and compassionate

227
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:38,460
to you know you know people I probably would have been up here not knowing because you

um it was really fun um I got to um

236
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:38,460
um play with um my childhood friend and then it kind of transformed into my

237
00:42:38,460 --> 00:42:44,700
five-year-old and my ten-year-old parts of myself and the five-year-old is the

238
00:42:44,700 --> 00:42:51,839
parts that I see in myself today the jovial the playful the brat you know um and it was really nice it lifted my

239
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:56,940
heart I love that word you used was levity oh I could feel the levity in my heart

240
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:03,119
connecting to those parts of myself and the 10 year old was kind of like there was some sadness

241
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:10,200
there and it was like comforting that part of myself it was just amazing this it I don't it was transformational for

242
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:17,160
me it was wonderful to get in touch and have so much fun it was really really fun it was like I've been like in this

243
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:24,839
place where like serious decisions and it's like I got to get out and just play it was so fun thank you Nikki oh thank

244
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:30,480

245
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,960
movement of your heart to you know towards compassion and kindness for the 10 year old five-year-old these

246
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:44,940
different versions um of yourself that's that and and also to get out of this this fixation of

247
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:50,460
seriousness that we get into as adults habit patterns so beautiful thanks so

248
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:57,540
much for that report um I'll go to chat a couple of chats here uh one person said my group and I agree

249
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:03,540
we need to find a deck of cards or board games at home and use them an accessible form of play as long as we don't fall

250
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:09,540
into feeling competitive yes and kitty says publicly likeness is okay but the

251
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:15,720
permission to be happy without expecting the other shoe to drop not so that meditation made me realize my automatic

252
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,760
thinking in that way thank you so much for sharing that that inside guitar yeah
