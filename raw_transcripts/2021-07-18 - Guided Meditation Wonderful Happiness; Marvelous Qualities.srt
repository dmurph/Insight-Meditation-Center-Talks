00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:07,440
good morning good morning hello everyone or good afternoon depending where you're coming from or even evening

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,320
nice to be with you i'm francisco gable and i'm here in berkeley california

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:20,720
and uh i'm going to sit with you together here

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:30,800
and um so let's just jump in and get started and do our meditation

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,109
[Music]

6
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,920
sometimes at the start of a meditation a good idea to

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:55,520
get a line with uh kind of a north star a north organizing star that um

8
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:02,239
that's lighting us along the way that's imbuing us with light

9
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:10,400
and for this meditation let's make that north star be

10
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,240
something like unshakeable happiness or immaculate happiness

11
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,520
why not it's a good guiding light to point to

12
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,040
happiness and joy for the reason that it allows us helps

13
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:37,280
us to to see and move through this path together

14
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:45,600
move through the pieces and parts of our minds and hearts

15
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:55,360
and it provides a resting place for the mind that stabilizes the mind

16
00:01:55,360 --> 00:02:03,680
if we have just a light general orientation toward some form of joy and happiness

17
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:08,959
in this moment

18
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:17,040
sometimes if we sit with that it helps us to find uh deeper levels of

19
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:24,239
stillness and presence as we

20
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,640
slowly and firmly and assuredly move through see through and breathe through

21
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,840
all the different phenomena that come and present themselves

22
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:50,319
so to start this meditation taking your meditation

23
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:57,200
posture however it is most comfortable and conducive to being alert

24
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:04,480
and a little bit diligent with little zeal from joy maybe

25
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,200
closing your eyes if that feels good to you

26
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:16,959
and going in and we're going to

27
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:26,000
receive the touch of this body it's just a general sensation of the

28
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,920
body noticing the breath

29
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,080
such as it is

30
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:50,480
and noticing where it might be more comfortable to rest your attention

31
00:03:50,480 --> 00:04:02,720
in the cycle of the breath as it arises as it's present as it ends

32
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:15,840
breathing allowing breathing to happen

33
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,199
all on its own

34
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:32,400
and almost as if you were being touched by a soft delicate finger

35
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:38,000
or a feather or something very comfortable and soothing

36
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:44,960
let's receive some touch sense from this body

37
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:56,000
turning our attention to the crown

38
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:01,680
relaxing as if we're just being touched

39
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:11,840
the earlobes

40
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:20,400
the back of the neck those occipital bones

41
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:26,560
just receiving whatever is there

42
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,400
the chin

43
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:39,840
the chest bone

44
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:52,160
feeling the touch of both shoulders

45
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:57,680
and those two bony things back there the scapulas

46
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:05,520
feeling them as if they're like two floating clouds just floating the touch

47
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,638
of floating clouds behind our back

48
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,440
continuing further down feeling the belly button

49
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:30,160
maybe just a gentle soothing touch that [Music]

50
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,840
eases

51
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,000
and the bony sit bones

52
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,840
how might they feel more relaxing

53
00:06:54,080 --> 00:07:03,840
the top of the thighs and the back of the thighs

54
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:10,400
and the top of the knees and the bottom of the knees both of them

55
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:18,160
like a gentle soothing feeling receiving whatever's there

56
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:27,280
or not all along we breathe allow the breathing to just

57
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,479
go in and out on its own gently

58
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:41,039
proceeding down to the shin bones the bony front part

59
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,360
the calf muscles in the back of the shin bones

60
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:59,840
the top of the feet and the soles of the feet

61
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:09,840
relaxing if it's possible how it's possible soothingly

62
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:27,840
receiving any gentle waves of sensations

63
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,080
and if there are unpleasant sensations

64
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:41,120
noticing them

65
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:48,800
maybe saying without words oh

66
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,880
it's okay i care about you it's okay

67
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,000
we're together here

68
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:10,959
and continuing with the rhythm of the breath in out

69
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,279
air moving in you're moving out

70
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:28,720
air persisting while it's present and then exhaling ending

71
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:39,040
[Music] sometimes uncomfortable sensations just

72
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,440
kind of evaporate away on their own

73
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:51,120
sometimes they don't and we just engage them with a caring

74
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,360
really really soft awareness

75
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:04,800
letting them being here with all of this all of these touches

76
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:19,839
from the body all over

77
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:43,759
and to return to our intention of joy and happiness in this moment

78
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:53,279
receiving the overall well-being of the body breathing

79
00:10:53,279 --> 00:11:01,839
sensing feeling

80
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:15,839
noticing there's a joy of just simply the body being

81
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:21,760
nothing going on no doing of any sort

82
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:30,240
right now for just a little bit just breathing and sensing

83
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,920
these soft touches all the touches

84
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,839
allowing them to settle

85
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:51,120
calming as much as as possible

86
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:57,839
but receiving that calm

87
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:10,720
maybe at the end of every exhale there's a little bit of calm

88
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,600
to be noticed

89
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:25,839
at the beginning of an inhale that brings in wonderful air

90
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,800
is a calming

91
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:39,360
this is joyful for the body to be seen

92
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:43,440
and it's mostly calmness

93
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,000
it's good to be touched

94
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:56,240
by the body's sensations

95
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:07,839
and calming relaxing releasing

96
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:18,079
the mind can stabilize

97
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:35,839
in this calm joy of the body in its wellness its well-being

98
00:13:53,199 --> 00:14:03,760
and finally to continue with the theme of joy and happiness

99
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:12,399
touching in on that happiness of the body and the mind calming and stabilizing

100
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,000
together tuning in to that

101
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:26,800
pleasant sensation of the mind stable

102
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:32,160
calm when it is

103
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,120
in the moments when it is

104
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:47,440
and with this same happiness of mind

105
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:56,000
resting on that along with the breath the in and the out

106
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:05,279
joining the two together to what notice

107
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:14,560
it's like we're bolstered our noticing is bolstered

108
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:21,519
with this soothing happiness in out

109
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,839
and we can observe

110
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,079
the other things that keep arising from that point

111
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:45,759
from the whole space of the body and the mind and joy and calm and stability

112
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:51,360
we can observe the many trains of

113
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:58,800
different appearances of thinking

114
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:14,639
and from that vantage point you can let them just be there

115
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,839
maybe observing them gently caringly joyfully

116
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:27,360
saying how interesting

117
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,120
let them play along

118
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:42,079
perhaps resting on a foundation of

119
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:56,399
resting on a foundation of happiness in joy embodied

120
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:07,360
continually being touched by that touch of the body

121
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:18,720
in its many many many sensations of goodness

122
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:33,840
let's practice this way for the time that it remains

123
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:13,120
being touched by the touch of the body's sensations

124
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:23,520
being touched emotionally in the heart that we're touched

125
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:37,840
by so many sensations with the through the in and out of the breath

126
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:48,799
the body's natural joyfulness and all its wellness full of well-being

127
00:23:48,799 --> 00:24:05,840
are those touches of life moving through coursing through

128
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:19,840
knowing the pleasant feeling of a mind that's resting within this

129
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:32,080
joyful stability of body

130
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:38,720
yourself be touched by that mind happiness

131
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:47,840
a pleasant feeling of mind

132
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:28,349

this uh charming little discourse called mark wonderful and marvelous

148
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:17,200
yes wonderful and marvelous and so it's you gotta imagine the setting

149
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,800
uh the monks are all together in a big assembly hall and uh they're sitting around chatting

150
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:30,320
they've had their alms meals so they're satisfied and and they're sitting around trying to

151
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:35,440
outdo each other on stories about the buddha to see who could

152
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:40,800
come up with the greatest stories of the wonderful and marvelous qualities of the buddha

153
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:48,640
and they go pretty far out uh out there each one trying to outdo each other with bigger and higher

154
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:53,920
and bigger achievements about the buddha and then

155
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,480
the buddha comes in and asks them what were you all talking about and uh and then they recount all the

156
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:08,640
wonderful marvelous qualities and some of these things are crazy interesting it's uh how the buddha was

157
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,760
born well i'll redo a little bit of the tenero

158
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:20,800
i heard and learned this from the blessed one's own lips

159
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:26,240
mindful and fully aware the bodhisattva appeared in tucsita

160
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:31,920
heaven and then to see the heaven he's

161
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:37,119
he does all kinds of things and to see to heaven before he descends to his mother's womb and

162
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:43,760
makes her totally pure and wake was born walking and standing and a great light

163
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:52,320
and shining light appears in the heavens and each one of these comments ends and

164
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:59,440
and this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the blessed one

165
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:08,400
so this goes on and on and on uh and and then uh the buddha speaks and uh

166
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:14,800
but before he speaks look look how over the top uh these things are uh i heard and learned

167
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:21,119
from the blessed one's own lips when the bodhisattva came forth from his

168
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,720
mother's room then a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods

169
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:34,480
appeared in the world with its gods its maras and its brahmas in this generation with its recluses and

170
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:42,280
brahmanas with its princes and its people and even in those abysmal abysmal world

171
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:49,680
interspaces of vacancy gloom and utter darkness are you there

172
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,880
where the moon and the sun mighty and powerful as they are cannot make their light prevail prevail

173
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:03,359
thereto a great immeasurable light surpassing the splendor of the gods appeared

174
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:12,160
and then it ends this too i remember as a wonderful and marvelous quality of the buddha and then the buddha speaks

175
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:20,160
so this is all kind of like a setup for the buddha to have his word and then the buddha says

176
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:27,359
that being so remember this as a wonderful and marvelous quality

177
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:32,400
of the blessed one here for

178
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:39,200
the tatagata himself feelings are known as they are as they are

179
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,960
present and as they disappear

180
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:54,079
and then he says the same thing about perceptions and thoughts so you might think wow what a come down

181
00:38:54,079 --> 00:39:00,960
um when all these wonderful qualities but this is the wonderful quality knowing feelings

182
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:06,079
and the feelings that they're talking about that he's referring to are the feeling tones it's not

183
00:39:06,079 --> 00:39:14,000
feelings as an emotional feelings it's feeling tones so he points to feeling tones above

184
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:20,880
every other wonderful and marvelous quality of all possible because and he

185
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:26,240
points to this throughout many of the discourses it's like he keeps pointing this arrow

186
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:32,160
to feeling tones feeling tones feeling tones

187
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:37,680
and feeling tones contain these

188
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:43,760
these different categories but one of them is the unworldly feeling

189
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,960
tones those pleasant unworldly feeling tones

190
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:54,400
and uh i'd like to point a little bit of attention to those

191
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:02,079
today because um well why not uh i it seems that uh to me

192
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:08,400
that we just kind of are very dutiful and diligent here in our

193
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:13,440
practice and and sometimes don't really orient so much

194
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,839
toward uh the joy and happiness of the practice and rest in the joy and

195
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:25,280
happiness of the practice and have that maybe be the guiding light

196
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:31,040
have that maybe be the starting point of everything that we do in this practice

197
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:37,440
we're kind of riveted by so many so many facets of dukkha so many facets

198
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,720
of the afflictions the pains the difficulties

199
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:49,280
the sufferings the challenges the confusions of thinking

200
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:54,720
that embroils us and we're kind of swimming in this environment that's

201
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:01,040
telling us to well maybe we need to do more maybe we need more security

202
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,520
there is more it's not really just enough being here and breathing

203
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:14,160
um what could be there but a lot is there maybe we touched a

204
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:21,760
little bit in our meditation that in breathing and sensing and noticing

205
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:29,200
and feeling there's a joy that is found that is

206
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:35,520
probably always available if your body is mostly healthy

207
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:42,560
because this body is resting in this field of wellness and well-being and uh

208
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:49,839
we can tune into that and we can be oriented by that by the practice

209
00:41:49,839 --> 00:41:55,599
because that joy becomes a happiness a happiness that allows us to see the

210
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:01,040
mind allows the mind to show itself and that's what the feeling

211
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,480
tones help us do uh feeling tones help us to see

212
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:15,040
what's going on at the core they're kind of a map to the core of our being by sensing and noticing

213
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,720
because we notice feeling tones as uh in the body and the mind as unpleasant

214
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:26,480
pleasant or neutral and each one that we notice and there are

215
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:33,920
billions of them to notice billions of them to notice in our experience

216
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:42,000
and as we notice more and more and more of them we get to the roots of the things that

217
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,880
lead to the most unhappiness and that's why we're pointed to them each joyful each

218
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,920
pleasant feeling that comes has a root of

219
00:42:53,920 --> 00:43:00,880
kind of wanting more wanting more that root of greed these are latent roots roots in us so

220
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:08,079
it's the latent root of aversion the not wanting and then there's the latent root of

221
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:15,280
ignorance of delusion and so each feeling that we sense into allows us to get to those

222
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:22,640
roots allows us to see them kind of evaporate again and again if we

223
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,359
if we rest on them like we maybe did in our meditation a little bit

224
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:37,200
and so that then we can come to that kind of emotional tone of insight

225
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:44,560
what does insight feel like when it's happening we

226
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:50,880
see more through seeing our feelings and seeing our feeling tones seeing

227
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:56,640
what's going on in there how involved i am

228
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:03,119
with my desires how involved i am with my little cravings because feeling

229
00:44:03,119 --> 00:44:11,359
tones have this powerful link that helps us to see very far far into ourselves

230
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:17,040
each feeling tone is like a product it comes with a whole product of our

231
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:23,280
mind of our intentions our histories our

232
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:29,839
deepest roots of wanting clinging not wanting aversion

233
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:36,800
and just by noticing that oh that's unpleasant we can stop

234
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:43,760
that whole link of that leads to the craving that then goes on goes on

235
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:50,640
so when we notice we can really penetrate through which is why we

236
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:57,520
develop more vision because we begin to see more how much how much

237
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:04,960
how much how much we are embroiled and knotted up by the senses

238
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:12,960
and and when we can come to the joy the joy of enjoy the body

239
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:20,720
without sensual desire we get to know more what it's like to

240
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:27,200
experience the pleasures of the mind those pleasures of the mind

241
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:35,119
the happiness of the mind that is not tied to uh anything sensual

242
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:42,240
uh that's kind of the flavor of insight that we like to to touch into

243
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:47,520
and um and we could touch into it a lot more than we do

244
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:55,119
uh by orienting toward a happiness simple happiness simple joy of

245
00:45:55,119 --> 00:46:02,640
being in a being present doing an argument and being more present

246
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:10,319
than being in the argument for example noticing a beautiful sunset

247
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:17,119
and appreciating it more because it's beautiful and because we can see it we're seeing

248
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:25,440
that we're seeing it because it's a changing phenomena we see the changing aspect of it and

249
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:32,880
we appreciate it all the more because we're connected to an appreciating

250
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:39,200
seeing and unknowing so knowing is something that keeps increasing by

251
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:44,720
knowing our feeling tones how do we feel feeling tones are not the same as

252
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:50,560
feelings obviously feeling tones are is the tone

253
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:57,599
of different contexts the ouch the ooh

254
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:04,720
i like that uh there's a touch of sense oh i want more coffee

255
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:10,960
and then there's a oh yeah i want a second cup that second

256
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:17,280
mental little thing we add to everything that we push and pull or

257
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:23,200
ignore and we ignore a lot a lot

258
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:30,000
so the more that we notice and go with that through the

259
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:38,160
flowing of the stream of the sensations involved in all of this because this is all a

260
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:44,000
living flowing experience we can sense that that's why the body is

261
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:49,040
so important to show us that there is a ton of

262
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:54,720
touch going on and there's a ton of touch that gets interpreted as

263
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,640
pain for example and uh and it is painful

264
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:07,920
and then we can get close and notice it we receive it and notice it and maybe

265
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:14,720
with time notice more and more how it transforms and in noticing that transformation our

266
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:21,599
our vision increases because we're sensing the change we can sense the change and every little

267
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:29,760
bit that we do it just keeps adding up and uh and it's just a glorious thing because um

268
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:37,680
well it helps us to get out of some of the really bad things in life

269
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:45,440
like major depression for example um just comes to mind uh i came into this

270
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:53,920
practice with clinical major depression i didn't even know what that was i couldn't understand the

271
00:48:53,920 --> 00:49:00,800
category the diagnosis when it was placed before me and

272
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:06,160
and it took a long time to really work that out i had a major depression for a very good reason

273
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:11,760
i had a big accident and became disabled overnight i got a disease

274
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:18,640
that made my spine and the equivalent of a 95 year old person's spine and it was

275
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:26,160
collapsing and producing a lot of pain and i became disabled and basically withdrew

276
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:33,920
from almost all my life so yeah i was very depressed and it was a it was a long process of

277
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,400
of finding joy again i couldn't understand the word joy for a long time it was the most complicating thing in

278
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:46,559
the world when someone asked me how are you for years and years and years people ask me how are you

279
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:54,720
and i could i never knew how to answer that because i always hurt physically and i was depressed

280
00:49:54,720 --> 00:50:03,359
and it took a long time to understand being depressed depression is very tricky to see sometimes and um

281
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:10,160
so finding the word good i'm i'm good took some

282
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:17,359
long long long years of care and treatment and meditation

283
00:50:17,359 --> 00:50:24,240
attention to those deep inner inner recesses of

284
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:31,040
affliction that were looking to be noticed and understood and

285
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:36,480
reorganized accepted and healed

286
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:42,079
and by coming back into the body this practice is a body-centered body

287
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:49,640
mindfulness as maybe you probably have heard many times i hope mindfulness is a

288
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:56,319
body-centered activity half of the practices of mindfulness

289
00:50:56,319 --> 00:51:03,520
are about the body and the other half are about the mind and right in the middle

290
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:12,319
is our feeling tones the body is this field that registers

291
00:51:12,319 --> 00:51:17,599
what's going on in the mind and it's this mutual registration that we

292
00:51:17,599 --> 00:51:25,440
begin to understand and know more by touching in allowing to be touched

293
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:32,240
letting ourselves gently understand the touch of the body the

294
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:39,359
registering of thinking in the body how it shows up and sensing it

295
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:46,960
sensing it and getting to know emotions gosh getting to know emotions

296
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:53,839
that took some work for me being able to understand uh not

297
00:51:53,839 --> 00:52:00,160
ignore not be comp where emotions are are interesting they're on this range like

298
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:06,480
for example anger we are either we really know anger we're really full of anger or we

299
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,920
can't feel it at all um and there's this this range of emotions

300
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:17,359
and teasing out emotions um through the help of the practice

301
00:52:17,359 --> 00:52:23,040
because each tone is full of a tone that's creating

302
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:30,880
eventually overall moods our moods are big complex cognitive processes

303
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:37,440
that we can start teasing away a lot with understanding the tones the tones

304
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:42,880
of our the tones of what we think is unpleasant and pleasant

305
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:50,079
and it sure helps a lot to be rooted in a joy and we

306
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:57,920
often find the joyf can find the joy in the body or the mind if the body is

307
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:03,599
not available understanding the pleasantness of

308
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:09,119
the present beingness so to speak just being here

309
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:17,119
for a moment just being with this and just really being with this without

310
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:23,920
without thinking about it um to appreciate it a lot more because i can

311
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:30,160
just be with it to be with this nectarine that i'm having

312
00:53:30,160 --> 00:53:37,680
for breakfast without thinking about anything um to just kind of be with that

313
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:45,599
that's the unworldly pleasure to know to know that we are

314
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:55,119
experiencing to be able to see that we're experiencing and that seeing is evolves through a mind that's stable

315
00:53:55,119 --> 00:54:01,280
a mind that's stable that's finds a stability in happiness and joy

316
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:07,280
it's this um this kind of fountain of giving the stability that's provided

317
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:15,280
by by tuning toward happiness um which we kind of don't do

318
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:24,319
uh so much um not as much as we could and we are swimming in a place that

319
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:31,359
mostly is giving us the the signal to to

320
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:37,440
to to not be here in full body to do more you got to do

321
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:44,799
more you gotta do more in order to be relaxed you gotta do more in order to be

322
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:52,079
liberated we've got to work hard at meditation so we can have this concentration that's

323
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:58,880
going to solve all my problems or the worldly things of security

324
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:06,079
and worries but we can provide for ourselves and

325
00:55:06,079 --> 00:55:14,799
that's what i've learned in this practice the most how much i'm the custodian of of this world of mind that i'm in

326
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:23,280
and and that i build it and i create it by simply

327
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:28,880
noticing sensing and feeling

328
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:34,319
and being maybe that's just being being

329
00:55:34,319 --> 00:55:39,359
that way being without doing

330
00:55:39,520 --> 00:55:48,000
just noticing learning to notice what i'm noticing sensing understanding the sensing

331
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,760
through and through and through and and being emotional uh understanding

332
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:01,440
where we are it's very helpful to understand where

333
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:08,559
i am in my emotional state about it being right now

334
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:16,400
to um be able to understand it first of all so that it can flow along

335
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:24,160
instead of being blindly constantly possessing the whole mood of my mind

336
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:31,200
the mind that we liberate is this vast thing that has uh this one this wonderful

337
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:36,559
knowing capacity of emotion uh and it's much more it's much much

338
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:42,079
more than that but we have to work through emotions it's good to

339
00:56:42,079 --> 00:56:50,319
be intelligent of what leads to my emotional state um what do i add

340
00:56:50,319 --> 00:56:57,280
and again it comes down it can come down to the feeling tones uh what is

341
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:02,720
what is the been the driving set of uh feeling tones that have been driving me

342
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:09,920
this morning where they can do how conducive are they

343
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:18,960
to happiness to the happiness of insight the happiness of being in the present

344
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:26,319
being in the practice um being in the presence of just the wisdom of

345
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:32,400
how things are flowing through coming back to flowing through flowing

346
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:40,240
through flowing through i was um look at the time here

347
00:57:40,240 --> 00:57:48,240
last uh last week week before last i was getting uh a test uh one of those i have to

348
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:54,640
check my bod i have all kinds of physical spinal things that need a continuous checking

349
00:57:54,640 --> 00:58:01,280
and i was checking the visual field they were checking the visual field and this big machine it's just really

350
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:06,319
cool big it's like a big eye and you look into this machine at these

351
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:12,000
little dots um and then there are four little dots that you look at to

352
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:18,960
move between the one dot and then the four dots and then they give you this little clicker like a little video game

353
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:24,720
and so you're supposed to click on this every time you see these other little dots all over the place

354
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:30,880
and they're checking to see the periphery of the field and so

355
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:36,960
it's like this cool game and but what i noticed was that he they kept

356
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,720
saying keep looking right at the dot and uh notice the field all around

357
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:49,599
and just click when you see the field and i thought it was so interesting

358
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:55,359
because we talk about knowledge and vision we talk about vision we develop this vision

359
00:58:55,359 --> 00:59:02,240
of seeing um but the vision of insight is not at all like this

360
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:10,400
vision of my eyes it's it's somewhat like it but

361
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:17,920
it's doesn't have a specific location it body sensations are all over the

362
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:22,960
place and and then the mind sensations once the mind is liberated

363
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:30,000
um the mind this is the mind that knows space endless space this most endless

364
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:35,520
benevolence where's that it's not in this little

365
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:43,440
field of vision it's this embodied mindful experience that comes from

366
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:49,920
understanding and familiarizing ourselves with the endless flows of the energies of the body

367
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,119
changing and contracting and

368
00:59:55,119 --> 01:00:02,079
always linked up to a feeling tone and each time we disengage a feeling tone we

369
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:09,040
release the flow and are more aware and more aware of

370
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:16,640
more body for example more aware of more mind when the mind is stabilized and

371
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:23,359
the pleasant feeling the pleasant feeling of knowing the changing

372
01:00:23,359 --> 01:00:32,000
sensations is a very helpful guide they call it immaculate happiness

373
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:40,839
to have this understanding of the kind of the emotion of

374
01:00:40,839 --> 01:00:46,480
insight so i hope

375
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:52,799
that maybe you might tune in a little bit to

376
01:00:52,799 --> 01:01:00,079
the joy that is present the wholesome joy that is present around

377
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:06,799
within here and there in little bits every little bit counts because

378
01:01:06,799 --> 01:01:15,440
it's around a lot more if we have a living breathing body and we're not doing

379
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:22,640
and we're not thinking and we're not wanting and not wanting and we're simply

380
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:29,280
just noticing sensing and feeling

381
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:38,960
there is a surgence of joy from well-being that's available

382
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:45,599
and a happiness of mind happiness with a very pleasant feeling and it's a

383
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:50,799
wholesome pleasant feeling the pleasant feeling that is not attached to

384
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:58,000
the doing and the clinging and wanting more and the not wanting that joy that's

385
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:05,920
attached to insight to watching the flow being with the flow of the sensations of pleasant and

386
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:14,079
unpleasant of the mind and the body so i hope that um maybe

387
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:20,319
we can tune to that as well as our other diligent practice parts um

388
01:02:20,319 --> 01:02:25,359
and uh take advantage of this living life

389
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:30,480
that's the living life and it's going to end

390
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:37,599
and then there will be no more of that so um we can enjoy that now

391
01:02:37,599 --> 01:02:46,079
and there's a lot to be enjoyed here and now of this life with a capital l

392
01:02:46,559 --> 01:02:55,280
and on that note um i'd like to just dedicate uh some good feelings of

393
01:02:55,280 --> 01:03:01,920
this moment um to a teacher of mine who died very recently in the last past few weeks

394
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:08,319
dr bing kung-hu he was a qigong master who was the

395
01:03:08,319 --> 01:03:14,160
trainer of many many many many teachers around the world and i was very blessed to live

396
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:20,640
close to him here in berkeley and he was my teacher for a long time and really helped me to get back on my

397
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:26,319
feet literally because i didn't walk for three and a half years and

398
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:35,280
so i want to send him the good vibes of merits and with a lot of gratitude

399
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:41,119
because in this tradition here we we're doing this for ourselves and for

400
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:48,400
others always already at every moment it's an internal and an external practice

401
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:53,839
so the more feeling good that we do the more we extend that to others the

402
01:03:53,839 --> 01:04:02,960
more feeling of the wholesome joy the more room we create for others to uh just be how they are

403
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:11,359
so may you be very very joyful may you be very very

404
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:20,160
happy this week and may our practice nourish others that we touch

405
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:26,640
may everyone be peaceful may everyone be joyful and may everyone

406
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:41,839
be at ease thank you for your attention and you have a great week

413
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:44,559
so uh francisco so shauna has a question uh she said uh how did and this is something that i'd

414
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:50,559
be interested in hearing too is like how did you kind of move through your depression um

415
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:56,720
you know that you were going through um i think just specifically for me like i'd like it'd be interesting to

416
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:02,720
see like you know was it was it just like an epiphany all of a sudden or like were there setbacks since you

417
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:08,160
tried to you know how did you stay the course through

418
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:15,760
kind of coming back out of well you've answered my question wow

419
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:22,160
that smells like you know about depression but a lot of people know about depression um and

420
01:06:22,160 --> 01:06:28,079
depression is very difficult to to know uh because uh sometimes it's different

421
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:34,720
it's difficult to see it and uh mine was very clear

422
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:42,240
and so it was a very long process of persisting and enduring and

423
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:48,160
persisting and i have to say that it was very supportive to have love in my life

424
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:53,920
that helped me to endure and persist um without it i would not have been able to

425
01:06:53,920 --> 01:07:00,559
continue um it was uh such a it was such a bad situation for me

426
01:07:00,559 --> 01:07:05,839
because of my body because of i lost work and because of the pain that did not

427
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:12,240
improve at all for years and years and years despite all the pain medication in the world

428
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:20,960
it just seemed like i was just getting losing more and more capacity and not and going downhill entirely

429
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:27,200
and in pain uh i i pretty much uh i didn't pretty much i sat my family

430
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:34,079
around and we talked about ending my life because it just wasn't worth living so i

431
01:07:34,079 --> 01:07:39,440
had suicide ideation for many many years so it was pretty

432
01:07:39,440 --> 01:07:46,720
complicated and just like all our knots we begin to just tease them out

433
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:54,160
you know we try to tease out one thread at a time we just tease them out and

434
01:07:54,160 --> 01:08:01,119
persistence and endurance is so so key to to to keep

435
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:08,880
unthreading and finding the trust that each which she thread it builds the

436
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:16,238
foundation of stability and um slowly i learned to find stability

437
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:21,600
mostly through my mind and my body and when that stability started to build

438
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:28,318
it really started to heal things fast i think the body

439
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:35,359
and the mind for me was about coming back to the body because the accident had taken me so far

440
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:41,679
out but the body is this tremendous repository of life

441
01:08:41,679 --> 01:08:48,640
and being and um nourishment that that holds us

442
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:56,318
together that provides a big big space field for um

443
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:04,400
for the worst of the mind terrors so learn how to learn a lot from

444
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:11,520
each layer of knot and going back into its deep old roots

445
01:09:11,520 --> 01:09:18,719
and finding bigger knots there that needed to be unknotted and understanding how they

446
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:26,318
came to be and incorporating them into the present moment giving them room

447
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:32,960
that's where the body really helped me to give them room to be all here together

448
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:39,758
and learn learning to just sense and and feel

449
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:47,440
um and noticing noticing again and again to just um come back to these simple things of

450
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:53,040
this practice so the practice uh this practice is huge

451
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:59,600
uh it's there's so many supports i was supported by tons of things of this practice you know

452
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:05,040
we have these big fat books and they're full of these beautiful

453
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:12,960
helpful guiding points for going on and

454
01:10:13,840 --> 01:10:19,920
thriving because you we do become liberated in this life we do have this extraordinary mind

455
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:27,199
that is a mind heart that is vaster than anything we can suppose and uh

456
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:31,840
it's it's really a wonder of life

457
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:39,520
yeah cindy also had a question uh maybe this would be the last one um so what led you to the dharma was it

458
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:44,560
a person or a reading

459
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:51,440
it was a person it was a yoga teacher who taught me back care yoga and

460
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:59,840
showed me how being quiet and how nourishing being quiet was

461
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:05,360
and then i just went to mbsr mindfulness-based stress reduction

462
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:10,960
because that's where they put the people who are really sick and you can't do anything more with them

463
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:18,400
i was in you know not walking and stuff so i ended up there and had my first day of silence in an mbsr

464
01:11:18,400 --> 01:11:25,840
and after that i was hooked forever onto this practice and and just started

465
01:11:25,840 --> 01:11:31,360
looking into it and getting very very very engaged much to

466
01:11:31,360 --> 01:11:37,120
my poor good fortune wait when you say like to be quiet like

467
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:43,840
what can you kind of like uh just elaborate on that i guess concept

468
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:52,400
well silence like like that moment of silence

469
01:11:52,400 --> 01:12:00,880
taking a breath we take a breath and we're just silent doing one breath

470
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:08,640
and we take two breaths and we're silent for two breaths and we take three and

471
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:15,440
on and on each one that we are intentionally just with

472
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:20,560
the sensation itself is a moment of silence

473
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:27,600
just being with with it as it is um you know before

474
01:12:27,600 --> 01:12:34,320
the train the deluge of thinking uh presents itself and as what

475
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:41,760
it is but there's something else just that

476
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:48,158
thank you so much have a great week
