1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:08,800
so welcome welcome folks um yeah it's it's lovely to uh see all the

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,960
names streaming past and uh i know a lot of them actually and uh

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,119
anyway i'm happy to uh happy to be with you

4
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:30,640
so i'll just uh read a paragraph say a few words before we

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,960
sit here so this is uh

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,000
quoted from her this book before in different context

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,800
this catherine schultz lost and found a book about

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,559
losing her father finding her love partner

9
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:01,199
woman she she married so she writes

10
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,960
even the strongest sentiments are intermittent and inconstant forever

11
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,600
obliged to share the stage with other members of emotions ensemble cast

12
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,520
grief with gratitude anger with boredom happiness with irritation

13
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:27,240
frustration with amusement and on and on in endless permutations

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,640
most of us instinctively resent this intermingling when we're happy we want

15
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:38,000
to be wholly happy not also missing our father or worried about work or

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,399
infuriated by the awful customer service at the phone company

17
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:51,200
that appetite for contentment makes perfect sense but we often long to experience our

18
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,920
disagreeable feelings uninterrupted as well

19
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:06,960
in part that's because misery has a kind of inertia to it

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:12,000
there is something about a bad mood that wants perversely

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,400
to persist i have felt at various low points in my life that i did not want to venture out

22
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:23,840
into a social event because i would have to pretend to be happy

23
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,280
for getting the very real possibility that once there i would actually be

24
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,120
happy or perhaps more accurately believing that i did not want to feel

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:40,319
better worse i have sometimes persevered in a

26
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:47,920
pointless argument simply because i was in a kind of sour mood that would rather fight than be improved

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:55,920
this kind of emotional intransigence is common anger wants only to be angry

28
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:02,000
levity's deadly to it as is compassion accordingly it resists them both

29
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,280
boredom rejects anything as boring uh rejects as boring everything that

30
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:15,440
might vanquish it loneliness wants only to be left alone and grief as i noted earlier is so

31
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:23,120
terrified of betraying itself that it wants only to grieve

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,239
she is not a meditation teacher but um that uh

33
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:39,120
the wisdom of that was um very apparent to me and uh

34
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,040
very dharmic in spirit and

35
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,449
in dharma practice we really [Music]

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,560
have no fidelity to the moment that has just passed

37
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:10,959
we are attending to what's arising and passing but we have no fidelity

38
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:18,000
to the mood of the past hour or the past day or the past

39
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:24,400
year yeah mindfulness is neither trying to

40
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,880
engineer the persistence of one state nor engineer the

41
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:37,840
vanishing of another in other words we're we're wide open to

42
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,759
things continuing and we're wide open to discontinuity

43
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:47,720
or wide open to discontinuity

44
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,080
and as we sit there's this kind of

45
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,479
sense of of

46
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,400
kind of radical openness to what comes next

47
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:16,320
and not trying to structure the next moment based on what has happened not assuming

48
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:23,120
continuity not having fidelity to what has just passed

49
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,879
and so there's this like moment-to-moment openness

50
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:36,560
and over the course of our practice i i feel like part of what this frees up is

51
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,680
that even really intense experience doesn't leave the same trace that it

52
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,039
used to that we actually are are more flexible

53
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:54,800
and fluid and begin to kind of find our way into some

54
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,639
homeostatic balance even immediately after real intensity

55
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,120
there's no fidelity to what's just happened even though it's been blessed with awareness

56
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:13,280
and love and this means that a moment of

57
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:20,120
grief can be followed by a moment of levity or delight

58
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,240
yeah or peace

59
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:31,000
let's uh let's sit

60
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,280
just uh landing

61
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,840
letting the the words just uh melt away

62
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:43,719
just landing in the intimacy of attention

63
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:26,240
we breathe deeply into the body we're conscious of the whole body

64
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,839
breathing so as to settle there

65
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:44,000
and it's almost like we breathe deeply into the meditating mind

66
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:55,519
that might lose touch with the intimacy through its own frenzy and doingness

67
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:03,959
and doubt trying to get it right

68
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,880
trying to tame thought

69
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:14,920
don't miss the intimacy right here

70
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,640
okay

71
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:10,760
no matter how well known or well loved by others you might be

72
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:20,720
no one can know you and precisely this way

73
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:30,279
with precisely this level of intimacy

74
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:51,720
until we listen listen to herself with a wide open heart

75
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:03,800
with space to let our life unfold

76
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:22,720
to be open to that which persists

77
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:28,240
the mind states or moons emotions that persist

78
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,440
but not assume persistence

79
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:43,160
in other words we're open wide open to discontinuity

80
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:54,120
to the morphing of experience

81
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:35,600
we're even intimate with the longings that underlie

82
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,159
our discursive meanderings

83
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,919
and we're practicing not assuming

84
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:25,559
our life is what we've always assumed it to be

85
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:48,320
we are not rejecting what just has passed nor

86
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:56,919
are we maintaining fidelity to it assuming permanence

87
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:23,280
radically open to the unfolding of

88
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,080
a sensory experience

89
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,440
part of our openness to discontinuity

90
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,600
means we're we're not uh

91
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:59,760
narrativizing our meditation in complex ways we're not telling

92
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:04,799
a story about where it's gone and what its trajectory

93
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,799
is

94
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:27,400
a kind of freshness moment by moment intimacy

95
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,840
who knows what comes next

96
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:16,760
who knows where insight comes from

97
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:42,679
just keep offering ourselves up to the moment

98
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:47,840
so over uh the next uh next four days i'll

99
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:56,480
highlight um four four mechanisms through which uh dharma practice

100
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:02,158
gets under our skin into our system

101
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:09,360
and the the first uh first mechanism wanted to

102
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:14,799
yeah i said yesterday you see this these are the

103
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:23,360
kind of um core mechanisms how they're classically framed how the practice transforms us

104
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,039
and um i wanted to lay out a kind of another

105
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,880
framework of this not to replace silva samadhipanya of course but just as a way

106
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:42,880
of looking and um and so the the first um

107
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:51,919
first mechanism is dharma as a kind of attention therapy

108
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:58,640
the dharma is an attention therapy so our attention attention is our most

109
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,960
basic currency and really the sense of directing

110
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:13,279
directing our attention to what we deem important that's very close to our sense of agency

111
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:18,399
and sense of self for the core of who we think we are

112
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:24,799
um william william james said

113
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,840
volition is nothing but attention

114
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:36,559
volition is nothing but attention and this of course is part of why

115
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:44,880
um the commodification and extraction and fragmentation of our

116
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:51,679
attention by modern life technology is actually a profound threat

117
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:57,840
it's it's like um as ahad akhtar said the bright pliancy

118
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,360
of mind itself attention

119
00:33:03,679 --> 00:33:08,720
is um under assault actually um

120
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,840
and so we as meditators become connoisseurs of attention

121
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:19,440
and indeed in the scientific uh uh

122
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,320
literature meditation sometimes described as attentional training that's the language that's used

123
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:32,480
and in the first iteration of what would become mindfulness-based cognitive therapy a

124
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:36,559
kind of mindfulness-based intervention

125
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:45,440
it was originally called attentional control training yeah i'm glad they changed the name to

126
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,679
mindfulness-based cognitive therapy but that was originally the name

127
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:59,278
and um and attention attention

128
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:06,640
complex relationship with our own well-being and it's notable that um

129
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:13,679
that attention is fractured when we experience psychiatric

130
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:20,000
distress so in depression for example there's a

131
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,040
the attention is disrupted there's an intentional bias towards negative information

132
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,878
and disrupted concentration is one of the symptoms of

133
00:34:32,879 --> 00:34:39,638
depression or in post-traumatic stress or some other anxiety disorder

134
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,878
obsessive-compulsive disorder there's intrusive thoughts that disrupt

135
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:51,358
the flow of attention or generalized anxiety there's kind of a

136
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:57,760
tension that's being constantly directed to the unknown future and

137
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:03,240
worrying in an uncontrollable kind of way

138
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:11,599
and in addiction there's attentional bias towards the drug cue or whatever the cue is

139
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,960
or adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder like attention's

140
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:22,079
right there in the diagnostic name

141
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:27,920
and um and even when we're not in psychiatric

142
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:32,960
distress not

143
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,599
in clinical distress or suffering yeah even low-grade suffering often includes

144
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:47,200
an attention that is pinging all over pinging from memory to future

145
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:52,800
to emotion and narratives

146
00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:02,079
and so we we train in attention we train in attention

147
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:06,640
why is it tension where to place the attention

148
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:16,400
on the four noble truths rather than constantly engaging worrisome scenarios

149
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:22,320
we practice how to attend steadily patiently

150
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:30,320
we we train in steadying the attention so that the spotlight the spotlight of

151
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,039
attention isn't shaking and darting around so much anymore

152
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:45,280
we train the attention to to relinquish uh distractions

153
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,720
yeah like to the movement from

154
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:57,200
being absorbed in discursive thought to back to the object of focus maybe that's

155
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:04,079
the breath maybe that's your work maybe that's the person you're listening to but there's less stickiness the

156
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,960
discursive thought is less sticky more flimsy less compelling

157
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,839
we train in attention because life feels uh

158
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:25,920
very fast to the unconcentrated mind feels kind of overwhelming

159
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:32,720
and and so we slow it down

160
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,800
yeah and as our attention gathers is less fragmented um

161
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:44,160
there's a sense of seclusion yeah even though we actually can come into

162
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:51,119
states where we're noticing more change there's a sense of seclusion and protection from the bombardment of

163
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,640
samsara and

164
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,720
we train we train in the effortlessness of

165
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,760
awareness so when attention can go

166
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:12,880
anywhere but not stick to anything

167
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:20,079
yeah when the spotlight of attention can go anywhere in experience but not

168
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:26,720
stick to anything and there's a kind of

169
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,240
deep poise that happens when we're not

170
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:39,200
mesmerized by phenomena we're not mesmerized by

171
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,000
our notions of our life our so-called life

172
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:50,480
and sometimes you hear

173
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,200
kind of divisions between samadhi and insight concentration and

174
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:02,240
mindfulness but my understanding is that the buddha spoke about these capacities

175
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,359
in tandem not a rigid separation

176
00:39:07,359 --> 00:39:15,520
and a lot of of fanfare about the kind of

177
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:23,040
bliss of the gathered attention um is understandable um

178
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,880
but as far as i can tell uh the bliss is um it's

179
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:36,800
maybe most mostly good as faith and encouragement to keep going

180
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:46,000
um aspects of of samadhi this gathered attention they are uh indeed closely

181
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:52,240
related to to insight and mindfulness um

182
00:39:52,240 --> 00:40:01,839
when we begin to stabilize the attention we can perceive suffering more clearly

183
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:07,839
when we begin to stabilize the attention we can perceive suffering more clearly

184
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:15,839
and it's so important to actually perceive suffering with a lot of vividness

185
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,680
and that that entails a stabilizing of the attention

186
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:29,280
when we we stabilize the attention there's there's no

187
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:32,720
just some of the buddha's

188
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,800
injunctions become so clear there's no there's just no doubt that clinging

189
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,880
hurts when it's perceived from the stabilized attention

190
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:52,319
there's no doubt that clinging hurts there's no doubt that hatred

191
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:58,960
hurts no doubt that greed hurts

192
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:05,200
and it's through this stabilization of attention that the the kind of fantasy

193
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:11,680
of the close-hearted happiness ends

194
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,319
that insofar as we will know deep happiness

195
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:22,920
it will be a function of openheartedness

196
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:34,800
the training of attention dharma as an attention therapy this is part of what

197
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:41,760
gives the mind its sense of depth yeah

198
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:48,480
the the stabilizing the kind of settling of the

199
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:54,160
mind it gives the mind its sense of depth the matter of life

200
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:59,599
this matter of life becomes serious

201
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:06,400
and as our attention becomes stable dharma lessens the insights we have the

202
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:12,400
seeing we develop those lessons make deeper impressions on

203
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,640
our mind

204
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:25,200
sometimes we have an insight or understanding or something but what kind of legs does it have

205
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:30,640
right often often what we once knew

206
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:38,000
what we learned is overpowered by subsequent learning and lessons and the fragmentation of

207
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:44,240
life and so we go on retreat maybe and we

208
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:51,839
know once or for all something we discover something uh this is

209
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:59,839
this fill in the blank this self-harshness is delusion we know it

210
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:06,400
deeply but how does that lesson stick how does it get its legs

211
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:12,720
and my sense is that samadhi allows our understandings this training of the

212
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:19,520
attention allows our understandings to etch themselves more deeply into our

213
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,520
being yeah our insights

214
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:29,838
uh stick

215
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:40,240
and so there are these very interesting interactions between this kind of um

216
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:47,760
attention this gathering of the attention and the learning aspects of dharma

217
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:56,400
much more to be said about that of course but um

218
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:02,319
yeah sometimes sometimes dharma is reduced to

219
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:09,839
attention training uh but it's it's much more than that

220
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:16,720
and so we'll keep going tomorrow that's why they're three more days

221
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,960
but uh for today yeah dharma as an attention therapy

222
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:28,960
all that comes with that so i'll pause here and

223
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:34,960
wish you all a good uh good day and

224
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:43,040
um thank you for your your attention and uh i'll hang in the chat for a moment

225
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:49,400
and um see you see you tomorrow thank you
