00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,220
hello hello everyone my name is Maria stratman I've been here this week for Gill

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,360
it's been a delightful week for me thank you all for being here

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,779
what we've been talking about this this week is began from a place of how do we deal

4
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:26,840
with self-criticism silk blame

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,780
and so we've been spending the week thinking about what what gives rise to self-blame and

6
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,840
self-criticism and how can we cultivate the state of blamelessness

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:47,239
the state where we are not turning against ourselves and constantly criticizing what we do at the same time

8
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,379
as we are doing our practice and living our lives with all of the fullness that

9
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:59,360
is inherent in that so we talked about the effective impermanent impermanence the

10
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:07,159
unsatisfactoriness of things because they arise and pass away cannot be dependent upon

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,600
we talked about judgment the effect of judgment and how judgment and comparison

12
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:20,400
drives us to think something less of one thing over another less of ourselves

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,860
over another less of ourselves over an ideal we talked about doubt the effect of

14
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,340
doubt that doubt undermines everything it clouds everything it is it's like

15
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,900
walking in fog and then we talked about forgiveness

16
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:45,360
which is really the act of not placing blame not placing blame

17
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:51,979
that condoning or excusing but not placing blame

18
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:59,159
not denying the effect of impermanence and today what I'd like to talk about it

19
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:06,000
turns out I have 15 minutes to talk about three different topics which is clearly not going to happen so I'm going

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,039
to try to limit to to something that makes sense when I was in my late 20s I

21
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,379
went to work for an engineering firm I was a chemist I was also the only woman

22
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:22,080
uh so I was the only chemist I was the only woman in a

23
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,780
outside of the the accounting office and the and the uh the secretaries in the

24
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,060
front office and I I was very confused about who I

25
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:38,520
was and how I fit into this very heavily Machinist

26
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:43,680
environment that I existed in and one day a painter came up to me and he said

27
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:52,800
I am totally confused by you so this was someone had just come in to paint he said some days you are you're like this

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:00,540
you're wearing a tie-dye you look like a you look like a hippie you have a T-shirt and jeans and and then some days

29
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,319
you have a suit on who are you

30
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,980
and that has stuck with me you know who are you who are you is it accumulation of all

31
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:19,739
kinds of things all kinds of aspects of yourself all kinds of conditions that you find

32
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:28,260
yourself in whoa am I is changing all the time

33
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:34,800
all the time so I don't wear tight eyes as often as I used to though do I remain

34
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:40,920
very attached to them for enlivened by them

35
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:46,440
the colors and the brightness but I also have days when what seems appropriate is

36
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,620
the closed in quietness of just black and that these colors reflect attitudes

37
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:58,099
changing pieces of myself things that I need to see

38
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:08,959
and I've given up the habit of it needing to be a certain way

39
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:16,919
because here's the thing our suffering depends not on

40
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:23,820
having things the way we want them but seeing things just as they are

41
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:28,919
just as they are and not expecting them to be a certain way

42
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:35,880
even though it's very human to expect things to be a certain way but to see when that's what's operating

43
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:42,960
seeing things clearly seeing things clearly leads to non-blame

44
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,660
leads to blamelessness to see that

45
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:53,880
suffering co-arises with wanting things to be other than they are

46
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,699
I want more of this I want less of this I want you to be this way I want this

47
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:05,520
conditions to be that way all of this wanting

48
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,940
and not being happy unless what we want is realized

49
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:18,000
this this is what leads to suffering so how do we get to the point where we

50
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,160
can really see things clearly where we're not confused by our the views that

51
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,320
we bring into the moment or the attitude that we have when we get up in the morning or whether we're wearing a

52
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:35,220
tie-dye shirt or or a suit not to be confused by this

53
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,740
but to just see this is what's happening this is what's happening

54
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:44,120
this is what's happening

55
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:54,960
because our suffering depends on seeing things clearly checking in with our intentions

56
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:02,240
and then taking the next step that's all we have control over is just the next step

57
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:08,460
what operates from Our intention so if we have in our hearts ill will

58
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:14,220
irritation anything that that creates tension and

59
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:20,160
ugliness in in our lives if that's what we're feeding that's what's going to feed into this moment

60
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:27,180
that's the condition of this moment that's what I can see I can see

61
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,639
my being angry with that person or being upset with that person and really

62
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,300
wanting not to be I really don't want to carry that into the future I heard Gill say one time something that

63
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:46,500
was just absolutely wonderful he said if you can't let go of the ill will at least notice that you're a person who

64
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,900
wants to let go of the oh well this is a softening of the heart

65
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:58,860
I want to let go of that I want to let go of it just that very Act is shifting

66
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:05,039
the small shift is what makes a difference that's what changes everything

67
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,680
that's what changes everything I want to but only if you want to

68
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:19,220
and that's the part about seeing clearly that's the part about seeing clearly

69
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:28,860
being in touch with our intentions means noticing what our intentions are we have Global intentions

70
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:35,280
I have the intention to be open-hearted I'm not always open-hearted but it is my

71
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,620
overwhelming attention and sometimes I will find myself

72
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,979
that person cut me off on the freeway and I'll feel myself

73
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:54,539
feel the anger if they go into my body I feel my my belly tightened I feel the adrenaline rising in my body and then I

74
00:07:54,539 --> 00:08:01,080
notice that all of that's happening and I say yes but yes but

75
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:06,840
and then I see it isn't that this is a bad person that's not what's happening what's

76
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:12,840
happening is I was startled I was frightened by someone pulling in front of me in the freeway

77
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:18,660
oh that's what was happening now I go to oh

78
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:24,479
I want to be safe I want everyone to be safe and suddenly I've gone from the ill will

79
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:29,780
to May everybody on the freeway be safe

80
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:35,339
including this driver who may not have had evil intentions when he cut me off

81
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:41,940
maybe it was the last chance he had to get off the freeway and he didn't know where he was

82
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:50,940
but I don't have to make those conditional statements about this person I can just change what's happening in me

83
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:58,080
I can notice I don't want to go there and see that there's something else that

84
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,500
act of noticing I don't want to go there I don't like this feeling this is uncomfortable allows us to see something

85
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,980
else because we're not spending our time justifying that ill will when we don't

86
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:17,399
spend the time that way we don't use the precious time that way we have time in

87
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:23,279
that moment to see something else to see something else is happening

88
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,360
to give space for uh I just wanted to be safe

89
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:37,220
we live in a world where bad stuff happens

90
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:43,860
now we can say that if everybody was good bad stuff wouldn't happen but somehow I don't think so good and bad

91
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:51,060
being comparative terms what's good for me may not be good for you and what's bad for me may not be bad for you

92
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:55,700
and there are gradations all along the Spectrum

93
00:10:00,839 --> 00:10:07,800
so what do we do when we discover a family member is hurting themselves

94
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:16,620
they're lost in alcoholism or drugs and we care about them and we see very

95
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:23,000
clearly if they just did this it would be so simple

96
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:31,680
or receive for ourselves why can't I do this why can't I stick to this plan why can't I always have in

97
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:37,260
mind kind speech why is this happening because it happens

98
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:43,260
it doesn't have to have the meaning that someone is at fault that someone is

99
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,260
blameworthy

100
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:58,740
nor does it mean that we excuse deliberate actions of ill will that's not necessary

101
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:03,959
but it turns out that taking responsibility for everything in life being wonderful

102
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:10,320
is a large part of suffering and what can we do about that what we

103
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,339
can do is try to arrive at the place where we say okay I my intention is to see

104
00:11:17,339 --> 00:11:22,920
clearly so my route to this at one time I felt

105
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:28,320
uh totally destroyed by how alienated I had

106
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:36,300
become from my family over something that had happened something that I did in response to something

107
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,700
and it was roundly not everybody in my family condemned it their their life I

108
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:47,720
have eight siblings so there are lots of people with lots of voices

109
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:54,959
but I did something that I felt was essential that was important for me and to not support bad behavior

110
00:11:54,959 --> 00:12:00,899
and uh I was not well liked in my family as a

111
00:12:00,899 --> 00:12:07,740
consequence of doing this and I I was plagued by that I went off on a month-long retreat at

112
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:14,220
the forest refuge and I told Joseph Goldstein oh I have this really problem this great problem you know my family's

113
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:21,420
so disappointed in me and and I know I'm right and and he said ah I know what you can do he

114
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:26,760
seemed so excited he knew just what to do and he told me to do Equanimity practice

115
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:32,880
so which I never really practiced before so what I did was take a few phrases a few

116
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,940
standard phrases and I will try to give you those phrases let me see I'll put

117
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:46,620
them here I'll put them in chat and if maybe Kevin

118
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:53,279
can you put them or or in

119
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:02,279
in on YouTube okay there are the phrases

120
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:07,920
all right so they are I am heir to my own Karma

121
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:14,700
my suffering or lack of suffering depends on my own intentions and actions

122
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:19,920
not what others may wish or what I may wish

123
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,100
despite what I may wish things are as they are

124
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,220
may I see things just as they are

125
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:37,440
may I meet the arising and passing away of all things with Equanimity and

126
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,500
balance so for this month on Retreat every time

127
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,740
I did walking meditation I repeated these phrases in my head

128
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:55,440
that's thousands of times I just repeated these phrases over and

129
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,560
over again I would occasionally insert that opening through the dhamapata which is easier for me to see the route of

130
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:06,660
karma than to just refer to Karma so I don't want to get off on what does karma mean

131
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:14,959
but just that I am heir to my own attitudes and conditions that I create

132
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:21,180
not what others may wish or what I may wish and you can say this for others as well

133
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:26,899
despite what I may wish things are as they are

134
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:33,300
their happiness depends on their own intentions and actions not what I may

135
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:39,480
wish for them and over time after after about two

136
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:43,579
weeks I came to the place where I realized

137
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:51,380
my suffering is the result of my actions and my intentions

138
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:57,839
that's it it comes home right there

139
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:06,899
right there my happiness is caused by my not accepting my mind

140
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:13,160
being unwilling to see things just as they are

141
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:22,399
so I offer these phrases to you they've been life-saving for me they've allowed me to continue

142
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:28,980
reevaluating my entry point to the moment

143
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:36,720
for evaluating where am I now despite what I may wish things are as

144
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,100
they are let me see them clearly let me see them bright as they are

145
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:54,420
what's happening for me now what's the energetic state in my body how am I feeling where in my body am I feeling

146
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:00,300
that rest in the here and now and don't get pulled off into the story

147
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:06,620
don't get pulled off into the story just here and now

148
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,940
just this

149
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:20,579
is another Jane hirschfield poem from the same book that I seem to be hooked on this

150
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:26,279
week the book is ledger the name of the poem is you go to sleep in one room and wake

151
00:16:26,279 --> 00:16:31,380
in another you go to sleep in one room and wake in another

152
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:37,800
you go to sleep in one time and wake in another men land on the Moon

153
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,259
viewed and blurred black and white and static on a big screen in Central Park

154
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:49,560
standing in darkness with others your grandfather did not see this

155
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,699
your grandchildren will not see this soon no 50 years back

156
00:16:55,699 --> 00:17:01,560
unemphatic the wheelbarrowed Stars hung above

157
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:08,880
many days like a nephew resemble the one beforehand but they are not the one beforehand

158
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,100
each was singular spendable eaten with pepper and salt you go deep in one

159
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:20,938
person's bed and wake in another go sleep in one person's bed and wake in another your face after toweling changed

160
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:26,400
from the face that was washed you go to sleep in one world and wake in another

161
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:31,620
you who were not your life nor were stranger to it you who were not your

162
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:38,580
name your ribs your skin will go as a suitcase that takes inside it the room

163
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:45,660
only after you know this can you know this and a knock glass that loses what has

164
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:52,620
been spilled you will know this only after you know this will you know

165
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:59,520
this my saying it you're hearing it doesn't do it once you know

166
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:06,740
then you know and it's always with you

167
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:20,220
may we all see clearly may we all see what is before us and what we are part

168
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:27,480
of to see it not as meaningful but in the being of it

169
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:34,320
may you be in this moment and be free thank you for your time thank you thank

170
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:43,440
you so I'm open to questions comments

171
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:49,260
hey thank you Maria we've got uh Layla from YouTube she asked

172
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:56,100
um I guess you had an earlier comment this week uh related to around judgment lies all

173
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,140
Buddhism so that sounds Gloria she said she she

174
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:07,140
uh was hoping that you'd elaborate on that I don't quite remember saying that but

175
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:12,240
but I might have because I don't plan everything I say

176
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:20,400
so uh um apparently I was thinking about

177
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,360
Buddhism as being uh [Music] it's one of the four noble truths of

178
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,679
Buddhism being that suffering exists suffering arises we can see this is the

179
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:36,780
cause of suffering this is what leads to suffering this is what leads to the end

180
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:44,520
of suffering and in that process that that realizing that things arise and pass

181
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:50,880
away and that we have some effect on whether we choose the rising of

182
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:59,100
suffering or the ending of suffering and that judgment is the place that very often we go astray and instead of saying

183
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:04,519
uh this is what gives rise to suffering and then stopping

184
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:11,900
vowing not to do that again we get lost in

185
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:17,700
establishing blame for for what has happened by ourselves or others and we

186
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:25,440
get lost in the story and we forget to just look at ah this gives Rises to suffering this end suffering when when

187
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:33,660
the Buddha was instructing his son who had done some horrible thing he turned over a monk's Bull and um so the monk

188
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,900
didn't get to eat that day and instead of castigating his son and telling him how wrong it was he said you know rahua

189
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:47,039
this is it this is all of it before during and after any action

190
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:53,340
think does is this causing suffering for me for you for either of us if it's

191
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:59,820
causing suffering stop if it's not causing suffering

192
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,600
cultivated this is Buddhism

193
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:11,940
and requires seeing really clearly so I'm not sure exactly what I was

194
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:19,039
thinking at the time Layla but I hope that answers your question that's how I relate to it now

195
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:25,620
thank you Maria also if people want to raise their hand in Zoom um

196
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:32,580
please go feel free to do so or you can post your question in chat uh kind of like a follow-on question that happened

197
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:39,419
in uh YouTube was how does one see clearly when I was from Marlene

198
00:21:39,419 --> 00:21:44,700
yeah yeah so the seeing clearly has to do with not taking the first piece of

199
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:50,760
information you get like that person hurt me by running over in

200
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:56,419
front of me in their car by tearing in front of me but to say

201
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:02,580
if I let go of that string of that story what else is true now and so it's a

202
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:09,120
process of just saying well I'm a little scared and noticing that shakiness

203
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:14,220
noticing that shakiness and not causing that calling that shakiness more about

204
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,440
anger well yes I'm shaking in Anger no I'm shaking I'm just shaking what does

205
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:24,480
that does that have to signify what the Mind

206
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,840
automatically goes to so it's a process of over time learning one's mind habits

207
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:38,520
what does my mind do when I get shook last night I was sitting uh having

208
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,039
dinner with our family and the the dog was under the table and I didn't realize

209
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:49,500
she'd crawled over close to my chair and and suddenly she stretched and her claw

210
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:56,039
hit the side of my foot that with my sandaled foot and I leapt up and everybody said what's wrong and I said I

211
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:02,940
didn't leap up but I jerked up and people said what's wrong I said oh it's nothing I was just startled

212
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:10,260
okay never underestimate if you're startled you're startled it doesn't have to mean

213
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:18,480
oh that crummy dog shouldn't be under the table just notice oh I'm startled that's how

214
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:25,020
you get to don't be in a hurry to name something naming something is very useful in

215
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:30,179
meditation but not so much if you're just trying to see what else is here

216
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:36,320
because whatever you name something creates a story

217
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,139
so it just leave space thank you

218
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:48,900
thank you and you can go ahead and unmute yourself I am

219
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:55,200
hello Maria hello everybody I'm going to be a cheerleader for Maria but because I

220
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:01,020
just thought this week was terrific and secondly that the lines that did you say

221
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:06,720
they were from Mr Goldstein um so you told me those lines about 10

222
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:12,000
years ago and I have to say it was an amazing turning point for me and it has

223
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:18,299
opened up a whole world of looking at myris you know conditioning as part of

224
00:24:18,299 --> 00:24:25,799
my responsibility as opposed to selfing myself um and I just hi And I memorized them at

225
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:32,520
the time you said them to me and I use them almost every day to just ground me

226
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:38,700
so I recommend them really highly to everybody it's it's it's just it just

227
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:45,840
brings you right back to the essence of this moment and it does really help with

228
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,940
that tendency to blame that because you're seeing conditioning as part of it

229
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:57,059
and anyway blah blah so thank you Maria for everything and I just I'm a cheerleader for that those lines that

230
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:01,820
you passed on thank you

231
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,760
it came from YouTube asked Maria are there any suggestions for working with

232
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,159
tight areas in one's body EG tightness around the heart area which

233
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:19,450
occurs with me often [Music]

234
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,940
though um

235
00:25:24,659 --> 00:25:29,760
so the natural thing is to want that typist to go away I would want it to go

236
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:37,380
away and when I noticed that tightness rather than trying to think of ways to

237
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:44,580
ease it I focus on

238
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:50,480
the tightness as the the core of

239
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:58,260
the rawness in me this is the place where that

240
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:05,100
that I feel the physical pla pain of whatever my emotional state is

241
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:11,100
and in seeing that I empathize with myself

242
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:16,260
I see it oh you're trying so hard

243
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:21,840
and in that in that shift to oh I see you're trying so hard

244
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:29,039
there is a a shift to compassion for oneself

245
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:36,179
and that being able to empathize and see clearly oh that's painful not not

246
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:45,140
pitying but oh I see that I see that in you softens the heart

247
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:53,220
it isn't in that moment going to just change everything but it is a gradual seeing

248
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:58,640
oh there's there's tightness here it is

249
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:05,360
does it feel like a crushing tightness does it feel like a stretched tightness

250
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:13,140
does it can I see something else about this tightness other than it's tight does it

251
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:20,960
feel protective does it feel over extended does it feel

252
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:29,279
camouflaged does it feel like it's hidden from B I was very aware at one time I I had the

253
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:36,419
the reason I talked so much about an open heart is that when I first began meditating I became very aware of how

254
00:27:36,419 --> 00:27:41,640
protected my heart was and I literally imagined it with a brick

255
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:47,400
wall and iron gates in front of it it was it was a formidable formidable

256
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:53,700
structure and first the gates kind of opened a

257
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:59,299
little bit but the wall was still there that brick wall was still there

258
00:28:00,299 --> 00:28:07,260
and then one day it wasn't there anymore but it's a gradual crumbling so so I

259
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:12,600
don't know the nature of the of the the tightness in your heart

260
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:19,500
but never underestimate that some of the tightness can come from over efforting and trying to break it loose

261
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:26,580
and sometimes what's required is to just say May the tightness in my heart relax and

262
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:34,260
then you'll notice sometime yeah so one of the breakthroughs for me was suddenly recalling that when my dog

263
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:41,039
had cancer and had they they just sewed you back up and they tried to give her some

264
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:47,580
some drug to ease her pain and it was she had a uh the obvious opposite

265
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:54,779
reaction to which became very agitated and I went and I climbed into the cage with her and I thought anybody that will

266
00:28:54,779 --> 00:29:01,340
climb into a dog cage to comfort the dog is not heartless

267
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:06,720
so I couldn't see it for myself but I could see it in another way

268
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:15,200
so so don't give up on yourself the way to work on it is to befriend yourself

269
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:21,320
befriend yourself be your own grandma

270
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:29,580
thank you Catherine you can go ahead and unmute

271
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:36,179
hi Maria thank you it's been so helpful this week I'm really really grateful

272
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:41,279
um I want to just name what I find to be the

273
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:47,820
particular challenge of like chronic conditions that

274
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:56,640
feel like they lead to a lot of suffering like for myself I'm on day eight of a migraine and they and I live

275
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:02,159
with chronic pain all the time but then sometimes it it flares and on you know

276
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,260
day two I'm like okay Equanimity okay let me observe but there is something

277
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:16,200
that happens as for me um as the as the these conditions that are

278
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:22,860
very painful continue that's something it gets harder it gets tiring these

279
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:27,899
intentions get harder to hold the perspective clear perspective gets

280
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:33,600
harder to hold and at the same time it gets easier to start to blame myself for

281
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:40,080
the conditions am I air what have I been doing that has caused this Karma which

282
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:47,039
is awful um and I'm speaking this because I think many of us live with

283
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:53,279
um causes and condition or conditions or experiences that don't just change and

284
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:58,440
it's very easy I think for the mind to be like okay do I believe in

285
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,480
impermanence when it's been 30 years of intense pain

286
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:08,580
um so and then starting to be like well then it must be my fault that I can't

287
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:14,460
just keep continually coming to the present moment and seeing it afresh when

288
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:20,059
it seems so repetitive so I I know that compassion I know the like basic

289
00:31:20,059 --> 00:31:28,200
approaches here it's just hard and um any any sort of support and boosting

290
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,020
um for those of us in similar situations I would be grateful for thank you

291
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:41,120
oh I'm sorry I'm sorry for all your suffering really they the um

292
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:48,600
Buddhism is not a bolster against pain only the additional thing

293
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:55,980
ourselves for that pain so um so so

294
00:31:55,980 --> 00:32:01,559
once again I think the the the the Refuge the the place of Refuge is to

295
00:32:01,559 --> 00:32:06,720
befriend oneself and to realize that this this is painful

296
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:12,960
and unlike other instructions around mainefulness it is not useful to

297
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:19,620
concentrate on that pain is that useful it is just there it's rather like ate in a restaurant the

298
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:26,279
other night and well walked in and the noise was so loud all those surfaces were hard and it was so loud it just

299
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:34,140
hurt my ears and after about 10 minutes I was no longer noticing it was still loud but I just wasn't my awareness had

300
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,840
kind of moved on whereas if I had focused on that loudness it never would have improved it would always have been

301
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,460
very very very very loud now that's not the same thing as the pain from a migraine which I understand is

302
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:52,500
overwhelming or can be overwhelming and so when one is faced with overwhelming

303
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:57,960
business this is what's true In This Moment the condition is overwhelming to

304
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:05,820
to admit to oneself this is overwhelming and despite everything I am still here

305
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:11,279
there's a sort of reinforcement of the confidence that comes from saying I am

306
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:19,639
still here here I am with all the things that are true

307
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:25,760
it may feel like this is killing me but it hasn't I'm here

308
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:31,340
I'm here wounded weary

309
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,980
and undaunted by that woundedness and that weariness

310
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:44,299
we do this in the presence of grief we do this in the presence of of

311
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:50,600
catastrophe all sorts of catastrophes that happen in life

312
00:33:52,799 --> 00:34:00,559
and when we feel like there's nobody else to blame it must be my fault that I can't overcome this

313
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:10,800
existence is not about overcoming anything but to just be here and say ah

314
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:17,280
damn that hurts and then to let that go not to stay with

315
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,040
that story not to stay with one's awareness in that place it's not I'm not

316
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:28,980
saying to divert one's attention but merely then to notice something else

317
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:34,320
to light a candle to look outside and see something that pleases you

318
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:41,659
and know that that's here too not instead of two

319
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:49,679
there are some recordings on Audio Dharma on how to deal with chronic pain

320
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,618
and those teachers are maybe more useful to you than I am but

321
00:34:55,619 --> 00:35:01,980
so you know you you could go you can go to our click on Audio Dharma and you can

322
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:08,160
get you can search by topic or you can search by teacher

323
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:13,560
you know so if you went there you could go to the menu for teachers and you'd

324
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:20,880
get you know all of the things if you put in my name you get all of the things that I've recorded over the last 15 plus years

325
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,660
so there's lots of resources there that you might find useful and uh and as

326
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:33,859
Friedman has done a lot of uh really lovely things on the subject of pain

327
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:47,540
thank you so much okay Theresa you can unmute

328
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:56,160
my Teresa hi Maria um I have a quick question yesterday you said that there were some openings on

329
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,859
the group um sessions and I went there after

330
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:07,980
um yesterday and um there was nothing left and

331
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:14,480
I I'm having trouble getting to that site the genus genius sign up site

332
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:19,680
through IMC I can do the individual ones but I I'm

333
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:26,880
having trouble finding the group one but yesterday I found it except there wasn't any more slots left no they went very

334
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:35,300
quickly okay um so I used to do more sessions but uh

335
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:41,280
it was oh I've I've cut back a little bit on

336
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:47,099
the number of sessions so okay well don't they open up each month oh

337
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:53,940
and the other thing they do they open up uh they're on a rotating basis and they right now I've set them to three weeks

338
00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:03,420
in advance because and I used to do three a week and now I'm doing just one extra every other week so oh and on the

339
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:09,800
number that are available so I might change that in the future but that's how it is right now because I'm quite busy

340
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:17,700
app is fine um okay all right so so and yeah and and

341
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:23,339
the way to get to those though is through IMC there is there must be a

342
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:28,980
link in IMC to those sign ups yes there is yeah okay

343
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,680
and um the other thing I would say is check back because people often when I

344
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:42,420
mentioned that there were slots the the this Saturday's group was full and then two two people canceled and you know

345
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:49,280
shortly before sometimes those those positions open up okay thank you

346
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:58,200
so Roni thank you Maria um I think I want to clarify something

347
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:04,320
in my mind which I'm a little confused by when I am struggling with judgment or

348
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:09,480
inability to forgive to find that Equanimity It's mighty hard

349
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:15,060
and I think usually I would end up going to some form of compassion practice to

350
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:20,280
offer myself that um I I maybe in my mind right now I'm

351
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:27,300
not sure where to look at that going to look for Equanimity when I'm so stuck in my pattern can you offer some advice

352
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:34,880
on that so um so

353
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:40,859
on the on the practice of on say do loving-kindness practice meta

354
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:47,579
practice uh it it can be useful to use it to soften your heart not not to sort of

355
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:55,079
repair what's going on but as a as when you when you find rigidity being established I can't let go of that

356
00:38:55,079 --> 00:39:00,240
I just can't let go of that then sometimes a meta practice will just for

357
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,640
yourself not for others just for yourself wishing yourself well wishing

358
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:11,520
yourself well will will do that little shift I mentioned before where you can shift

359
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,640
from from the all that heavy effort to just

360
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:23,040
I'm not really trying and there's a there's a kind of letting go and a

361
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:28,920
little relaxation of breath the the thing is when in the Dharma Pata

362
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:35,339
where the phrases I read yesterday about a hatred only Ends by non-hatred that

363
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:42,480
that's usually often has been translated or uh hatred Never Ends by hatred but by

364
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,520
Love Alone does hatred end but we don't have to go so far as to

365
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:53,820
love what's causing us pain and suffering we just have to stop hating

366
00:39:53,820 --> 00:40:00,359
and so it's the letting go of the story so every time I hear myself justifying

367
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:06,540
well yeah I'm mad because or I hear myself say oh you always do or any of

368
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:13,500
those triggering things that are the messages in my brain I I say I I relax

369
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:18,540
that story I'm not going to keep telling that story sometimes I stop in the

370
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:23,820
middle of a sentence it's so it's so familiar to me and and it's repeating in

371
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:31,320
my head I'll stop in the middle of the sentence and just say I don't have to say that I know the source of that pain I don't

372
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:37,380
have to tell myself about it so that it it steps down from

373
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:43,440
both having to defend how I feel the rigidity

374
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,099
I feel to saying this is this is where it is and to and to rest and even I wish

375
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:55,560
I could let go of it to this there's there's a place where one finds refuge

376
00:40:55,560 --> 00:41:01,680
in resting in one's good intentions it's not giving up it's not saying it's

377
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,680
okay it's not excusing but it's it's seeing very clearly

378
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:15,780
how how much one wishes to be free

379
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:23,119
of the the curse of not being able to lay it down now yesterday Susie reacted to my saying

380
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:29,240
refusing to let go of because she'd never heard me say that before

381
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:37,260
it's recognizing that sometimes that harm that we have received has become a

382
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:44,820
familiar partner and feels somehow right it's that making it part of me

383
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:51,720
and the refusal is not overt or conscious it's just oh yeah just what I

384
00:41:51,720 --> 00:42:01,500
was expecting the the familiarity of a chronic issue

385
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:06,720
the feeling how familiar it is not your friend

386
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:13,619
you have to notice oh I'm becoming I'm becoming used to this has this

387
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:18,900
become a habit as opposed to how I'm reacting to what's

388
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:24,599
happening right now so the closer you can get to just what's happening now the

389
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:31,200
closer you can get to seeing things clearly and to realize that that what you think about it the opinion you have

390
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:38,280
about what's happening is not What's Happening Now what's happening now is the pain of that opinion

391
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:46,820
does that help kind of consider it just see if that opens anything for you

392
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:00,060
hey Maria well thank you for your teaching this week I think that's pretty much everything all the questions and

393
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:06,500
raised hands so thank you very much thank you everyone
