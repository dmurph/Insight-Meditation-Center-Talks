Sid I am taking the side of peace peace which I will not abandon even when

53
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:12,680
its voice is drowned out by hurt and hatred bitterness of loss cries of right

54
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:20,880
and wrong I am taking the side of Peace whose name has barely been spoken in

55
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,520
this winnerless War I will hold peace in my arms and

56
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,280
share my body's breath lest peace be added to the body

57
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:39,680
count I will call for deescalation even when I want nothing

58
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,440
more than to get even I will do it in the service of

59
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:55,360
peace I will make a clearing in the overgrown Thicket of cause and effect so

60
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:01,479
peace can breathe for a m for a minute and reach for the

61
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:09,319
sky I will do what I must to save the life of peace I will breathe through

62
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:14,599
tears I will swallow Pride I will bite my

63
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:21,440
tongue I will I will offer love without testing for

64
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:28,319
deservingness so don't ask me to wave a flag today unless it is the flag of

65

85
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:03,079

letting the practice be very simple tonight with a lot

95
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:54,160
of Silence just the breath the breath ever so

96
00:11:54,160 --> 00:12:00,720
simply being breathed through the body and if there are thoughts

97
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:06,560
preoccupations [Music] plans releasing them for the sake of

98
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:12,240
Peace in this heart and mind releasing them for the sake of

99
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:21,079
peace in your own heart in your own mind not disturbing the

100
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:33,160
peace was said Years Ago by famous teacher that it's so quiet in here I

101
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:40,880
think a famous Swami that it's quiet inside it's always quiet and peaceful inside we just stare

102
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:48,399
it up we stare it up so if you notice steering up has

103
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:55,040
happened can you release into peace holding peace in your

104
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:04,320
arms like a little newborn sharing your breath whatever metaphor image works for

105
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760

breath

109
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,440
connecting with each in breath and each out breath in

110
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,840
the body just here just

111
00:18:22,159 --> 00:18:28,840

their PE letting there be peace connecting with with release releasing into

114
00:18:45,159 --> 00:18:50,240
mind that metaphor works for you or holding peace cratering peace like a

115
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:56,120
newborn in your arms and sharing each breath with

116
00:18:56,120 --> 00:19:01,320

breathing in peace and breathing out peace with every

120
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
breath

121
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:31,399
in the last couple of minutes of this sitp is there any area of our hearts or

122
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:38,399
Minds any area of our thinking or habit patterns that would be helpful to

123
00:26:38,399 --> 00:26:42,840
bring bring the blessing of peace

124
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:53,080
to breathing a couple of peaceful breaths that way if something has come

125
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:59,919
up letting go releasing and trusting

126
00:26:59,919 --> 00:27:10,000
that no matter how we deem or practice to be how we gr it to be how we rate it to be

127
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:16,080
trusting that we are planting seeds of presence seeds of

128
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:23,039
Peace as we keep turning our hearts and our attention towards

129
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,520
it may all beings everywhere

130
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:37,399
be peaceful wishing

131
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:40,399
goodness

132
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:46,760
gladness peace

133
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,720
safety for all beings

134
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:01,919
everywhere may all beings beings be happy may all beings be

135
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:28,720
free everyone thanks for your practice may we all serve as as peace

136
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:34,810
mongers as hope mongers not fear mongers but peace mongers

137
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:41,840
[Music] and and hope mongers what what a beautiful play on The Words the author

138
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,559
of the poem uses Ain Keller so practicing peace being peace

139
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:56,519
with each breath again not judging or practice I was distracted

140
00:28:56,519 --> 00:29:04,679
I was thinking even if there was just a couple of breaths where you con connected with a sense of

141
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:10,640
Peace that's enough we're planting seeds we're planting seeds just trusting the

142
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:17,960
power of this practice in ways we can quite understand

143
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:26,159
so so I'd like to invite us for an exploration the question for

144
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:32,600
the small groups today is this question we'll do it as a

145
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:38,519
question that a repeating question the question is what supports peace in your

146
00:29:38,519 --> 00:29:44,760
heart what supports peace in your mind what supports peace in your life

147
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:50,200
what supports peace cultivating peace what supports

148
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:55,919
it [Music] and hello everyone welcome back the

149
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:03,399
rooms are closed and we have a few minutes for any

150
00:30:03,399 --> 00:30:10,080
Reflections questions and I'm going to also change the um chat setting so that

151
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:17,120
you can um send your Reflections if you like through chat if you send them to me

152
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:25,039
privately I won't read your name if you send them to everyone I will read your name and your Reflections so so what did

153
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:31,360
you discover in this practice either the meditation as we meditated together or

154
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:39,600
in small groups as you explored what supports peace for you what did you

155
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,760
discover we'll take a couple of Reflections

156
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:52,279
um couple of Reflections one private part of me is feeling so much grief

157
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:58,240
tonight and I'm trying to allow peace and grief to be present at the same time yes

158
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:04,919
exactly of course not trying to get rid of one or the other another reflection

159
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:10,679
hearing from others what brings them peace brings me peace yes isn't that

160
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:16,519
lovely that's really lovely I feel kindness which leads to

161
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:23,639
peace oh beautiful such beautiful Reflections thank you all and SAR I see

162
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:30,120
your hand thank you so much

163
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:37,039
um there were many words of wisdom in our group U but also lots of

164
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:43,880
silence and then I realized silence can bring peace and we know we did that teaching

165
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:53,159
also a few weeks ago when you um asked us to practice that and

166
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:59,000
many of us were actually surprised that we expressed that wow there's something in this

167
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:06,559
silence um and I also reflected on the teaching in a way that this teaching brings peace

168
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:12,440
also for me but you also added a sentence today

169
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:20,960
that in a way that I can't quite explain and I find that A very wise

170
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,000
added piece because sometimes I feel like I I really want to know what's

171
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,639
happening and I can't tell um I want to know the nitty-gritty

172
00:32:31,639 --> 00:32:36,880
of all this and you know s scientifically dissect everything and

173
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:42,799
figure it out and I can't figure it out and and just that's like I can't quite

174
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:49,559
explain it's it's giving me fruits but I can't quite explain so that was also very peaceful for me thank

175
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:55,399
you thank you thank you so much thara John beautiful to hear your your

176
00:32:55,399 --> 00:33:01,440
Reflections and your practice yeah wow nice nice and and this last piece that

177
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,399
you said I'll pick that up especially about we can't quite explain we just

178
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:13,240
know that we start to feel different or be different in the world or re or react

179
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:22,000
differently or not be as reative there's just something starts to shift slowly ever so slowly it's like by osmosis it's

180
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,279
it's like the Zen s story actually I just told this on the retreat it's like

181
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:34,880
you know you you walk in the fog you know if it's really foggy there's moisture in the air you keep walking and

182
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:42,159
walking and before you know it your clothes will become wet with the Dharma they will

183
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:49,279
become drenched by the Dharma you don't can't quite tell when it happened and how it happened but just slowly as you

184
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:57,639
keep walking and you keep putting one step ahead of another in these practices it shifts it happens which is beautiful

185
00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:05,080
