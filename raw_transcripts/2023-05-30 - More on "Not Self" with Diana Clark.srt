1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
this so like this I suppose yeah there you go hi I'm Michael from San Jose Milo

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:12,300
Michael Michael Alex from Vancouver BC

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:18,180
Alex yeah oh from Vancouver fantastic well welcome welcome

4
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:24,539
Jim Bill Natalie Michael and Alex and I'm Diana

5
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:30,300
at least today I am we'll see you how I am later so thank

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:36,600
you all for that so

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:41,700
turn on the recording so last week I spoke a little bit about

8
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,219
this concept of not self and I thought I'd build a little bit on that

9
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,280
and that is this idea that or the teaching or that

10
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,000
realization or the notion that we there we don't have like a core we don't have

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,840
an Essence oh are you looking for this here we go

12
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:12,740
we don't have a core or an essence unto Which

13
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:19,799
experiences get added it's not like we have this thing in the middle that stays the same

14
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:27,600
that then I guess it tastes good food comes from meditation or

15
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:34,380
speaks into a microphone that doesn't work necessarily there there isn't like this core thing

16
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,640
that experiences get added onto instead there's just experiences that's

17
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:51,060
all there is and this is one of the key teachings of the Buddha and it's one of the characteristics of

18
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:57,060
things and people that they don't have this inherent stable

19
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,240
core or Essence this is a teaching that's a little bit

20
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,700
difficult to understand and sometimes it feels a little bit silly

21
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:15,720
because like well of course of course things have existence I'm here you guys are there there's

22
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,480
chairs there there's a bell here but we're talking about there's not a

23
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:29,760
permanent unchanging core Essence at the middle

24
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:36,420
is that it's just a collection a collection of experiences all kinds of like

25
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:42,800
experiences being anything that arises in the senses including the mind

26
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:50,040
so one thing I wanted to talk about a little bit today is these like misconceptions some of these ideas that

27
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:56,480
we might have about the teachings of not self that when we hear this we might like

28
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,060
misinterpret it we might think well let me something else and this is something from Jack

29
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,940
cornfield and he writes that um sometimes there's this idea that okay

30
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,280
well there's this egocentric or there's this self-centered

31
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:21,000
ego and we have to get rid of that but that's not not actually right

32
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:27,180
because it's not there's nothing to get rid of it's not actually there this is like an

33
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:33,239
old religious idea that some religions have that there's like this bad part that has to be gotten rid of and there's

34
00:03:33,239 --> 00:03:38,760
this good part that has to get rid of the bad part so that's not what we're talking about

35
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,000
here when we talk about not self-teachings it's uh this idea that we have to get

36
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,780
rid of a bad part is sometimes like why there's aesthetic practices or why sometimes people will do some extreme

37
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,680
things as they think that it's going to purify or get rid of or something that's

38
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:05,959
unwanted part of themselves but that's not how the Buddhists see this practice

39
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,200
it also this idea of not self doesn't mean that there's this inner sense of

40
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:18,239
apathy or meaninglessness it doesn't feel like there's

41
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,880
it doesn't mean and it doesn't feel like there's this emotional poverty we might

42
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:30,259
say that there's just this uh sense of

43
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,180
hollowness as opposed to some Vitality or juiciness

44
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:42,600
or um some some thing that uh

45
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:48,240
it's going to say innervates us or excites us instead there's this way in

46
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:56,639
which we might have this feeling that there's this lack of well-being inside and that somehow

47
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,759
that's what's being pointed to when we talk about not self it really couldn't be further from the

48
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:09,720
truth or than the experience so we might hear these and feel like oh there's a reason

49
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:17,280
in which we might have this um sense of like inside of ourselves might

50
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:24,600
feel a little bit hungry or desolate or something like

51
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,360
that and that's really is not what's getting pointed to with the not self teachings and I'll talk a little bit

52
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:36,419
more about that sometimes when we hear this we might think oh yeah I do have this inner

53
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:42,120
hollowness that's inside that and so I must be on the right spiritual practice

54
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:47,639
or write spiritual path but that's not what's being pointed to

55
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,800
and it's it's this idea or this teaching this experience of not self also is not

56
00:05:52,800 --> 00:06:01,259
an excuse to withdraw from life it's not a way to reinforce any of these

57
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:06,539
maybe underlying depressive feelings like where we kind

58
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:14,639
of feel diminished and don't really have energy to be with the world or nor do we even want to want to be with the world

59
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,759
or maybe we even have this fear of the world or maybe we have this lack of motivation

60
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:26,120
so not self is not pointing to that either

61
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,100
maybe one thing I'll say is that these not self-teachings are not suggesting

62
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:39,000
that we should like wipe out any of the ways in which we can function in our

63
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:45,780
lives in a way that we can get up get dressed have a breakfast go

64
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:52,139
to work or you know do or stay home at work or do whatever it is that we're going to do with our days

65
00:06:52,139 --> 00:07:00,060
so it's absolutely not pointing to that either that somehow we would like lose capacities that we have or

66
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:07,259
the way that we can just run our lives I'm trying to think of a

67
00:07:07,259 --> 00:07:13,440
way to say that but just our normal way of operating not self-teachings is not

68
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:19,159
pointing to like okay we're gonna get rid of that or somehow it's going to fall away

69
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:25,580
in contrast to some of these ideas that we might have

70
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:30,919
this uh joy and freedom is what

71
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:36,599
characterizes the experience of not self so it's this joy and freedom that's

72
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:43,620
getting pointed to when you talk about not self this maybe this beautiful spaciousness or this

73
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:49,440
unburdening that arises

74
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:56,940
and so we definitely need to like honor our personal identities so we're not

75
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:02,340
saying that to get rid of those either with us at not self-teaching

76
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:10,460
so that we can recognize the Deep patterns and the archetypes that we have that make up our individuality and then

77
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:16,440
honor them and transform them in a way that really

78
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:22,080
support us and so this practice is about how we can do this transformation so

79
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:29,220
we're not getting rid of anything or discarding something or

80
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:35,339
throwing something away instead it's it's all about a transformation

81
00:08:35,339 --> 00:08:40,979
so some of these uh personal identities or maybe we have like this uh a critical

82
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:47,820
intellect there's a way that we use that to have some discriminating wisdom

83
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,459
that helps us with this path of practice or maybe we have this appreciation and

84
00:08:53,459 --> 00:09:02,279
desire for beauty maybe you're an artist then we use that as a way to notice and

85
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:08,880
build and cultivate Harmony to use this force that creates Harmony so that we're not in contention with our

86
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,300
experience or maybe that we have this capacity for

87
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:22,200
this intuition of a way of sensing the way things are then we can transform that into a

88
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:28,140
capacity for healing ourselves and others being sensitive to what's needed

89
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:35,220
next so again this not self-teaching is not pointing to that we have to abandon or

90
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:40,560
somehow be different than how we are it's more of a transformation that

91
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,620
allows This Joy and freedom that arises

92
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:54,180
so and to be sure that it's strong and healthy sense of self is needed for this

93
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,880
about the practice definitely required in part of this path

94
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,480
of practice is developing this strong and healthy sense of self

95
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:13,080
part of the reasons why we need a strong healthy sense of self is part of that is just the developmental course of a human

96
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:20,580
is to have a distinct sense of self the Buddha certainly had that he had no uh

97
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:26,220
confusion about who he was he had no confusion about what he did or was going

98
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:33,180
to do or anything like that used to the personal pronoun all over the place in his teachings so he certainly had his

99
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:39,540
very strong sense of self had a sense of boundaries this is appropriate this is not appropriate

100
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:45,120
and so for us having a strong sense of self really supports that in some

101
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,860
meditative experiences regular can start to be a sense of dissolution a

102
00:10:52,860 --> 00:11:00,600
fading away or maybe even pixelating or something like a sense of self

103
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:06,060
can be a meditative experience and this can be really disorienting or even

104
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:12,060
frightening if a person doesn't already have a strong sense of self so we need

105
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:17,839
one as we so that as we go deeper into this practice and not start having more

106
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:25,320
experiences that they it doesn't derail us or frighten us or confuse us or

107
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:30,540
make us run away or because we feel like oh I'm

108
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,120
definitely going the wrong direction or something like this

109
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:42,360
so the interesting thing is this development of a strong sense of self

110
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:49,680
as well as a greater recognition or realization of not self so that this

111
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:57,300
recognition that there isn't this this core or this Essence at the inherent or inside any of us that's

112
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:04,320
permanent and going along with us in our life these two ideas evolve together

113
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,959
so a strong sense of self supports this insight into not self having experience

114
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:16,920
into not self also supports him in a strong sense of self and in our path of practice there might

115
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:22,320
be times in which or Seasons we might say in which uh one or the other of

116
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:29,060
those are emphasized but they're definitely part of the practice both of them are part of the practice

117
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:36,959
but one thing is you know sometimes when we hear these teachings about not self we might think like

118
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:43,079
either like some puzzlement like really what I certainly feel like I have a self

119
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:50,339
I'm not quite sure what they're talking about those Buddhists so I appreciate very much that uh Andy

120
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:59,279
olensky he's a scholar and an author he wrote uh something about he's uh he

121
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:06,180
titled this article said I think I am and he pointed to different ways in

122
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,339
which we think that we are I think it can be helpful to point these

123
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:18,660
so one Andy olinski says I feel like the occupant of my body

124
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:25,860
okay this makes sense that when we like stand or sit in one location

125
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:31,139
like everything around us seems like it's relative to us like that's farther

126
00:13:31,139 --> 00:13:36,240
and this thing is near and that's to the right and that's to the left so it seems

127
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:41,399
like everything is like we're the center and everything's around us

128
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:48,720
and when we walk when we go somewhere right the center moves kind of like the

129
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,180
whole world is kind of like moving with us in some kind of way

130
00:13:54,180 --> 00:14:01,200
like intellectually we understand that uh it doesn't it's not exactly like that

131
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:08,459
but if we're if we're just with our experience we will notice that what's near and far of course is adjusting as

132
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:15,920
we're moving through space so we're still the center

133
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:23,880
and so there's a way in which we might view this body as the basis of this world that's surrounds us

134
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,480
we might even say the world that we're constructing so the first one is I feel like the

135
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:36,120
occupant of my body is the first way in which we feel like we have a self

136
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,600
the second is I have a strong sense of being the beneficiary of the feeling tones

137
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,000
when things are Pleasant or unpleasant I'm the one that enjoys things that are

138
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:53,399
Pleasant and when they're unpleasant I'm the one that wants to get rid of the things that

139
00:14:53,399 --> 00:15:01,019
are unpleasant and when the we feel like maybe I'm the victim of the pain or of the discomfort

140
00:15:01,019 --> 00:15:08,279
I'm the one to whom it happens so when there's Pleasant or unpleasant

141
00:15:08,279 --> 00:15:14,040
or neutral experiences we feel like oh that we are the beneficiary

142
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,160
for whether it's positive or negative of those feeling tones

143
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:26,399
and then the third one is I am a person who expresses myself

144
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,980
I am the artiste I find there's so many different ways in

145
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:37,620
which we express ourselves you know artistically or just speaking or writing

146
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:42,720
or sending emails or the way that we dress the cars that we

147
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:49,380
drive there's so many different ways in which we express ourselves so we might feel

148
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:55,019
like that we're the ones that are expressing something something unique

149
00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:01,019
about ourselves and we might even feel like

150
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:08,000
no matter like how humble these creations are or maybe even how subtle they are there's a sense that they are

151
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:14,220
uniquely coming from us like nobody else could do it like

152
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:20,579
like just from only I could do this only you could do this only you could do whatever it is that

153
00:16:20,579 --> 00:16:28,860
you do and then this the fourth one is I feel

154
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:33,959
like an agent I feel like the one who makes choices

155
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:41,220
I I feel like the one that has the decision and affection and responsibility and moving through the

156
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:48,620
world doing things and I inherit that and consequences of those things

157
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:56,820
that's the fourth one and then the fifth one is I have the view that I am some sort

158
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:02,759
of essence this idea that well it seems like

159
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:11,280
there's a continuous sense of self inside so maybe it is permanent

160
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:17,160
or maybe the sense of that there's just something inside around which everything

161
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,678
else congeals but there's something inside that's

162
00:17:22,679 --> 00:17:28,260
feels like the heart of what's unfolding

163
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:32,720
of whatever it is means to be me

164
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:40,860
for some of you might have recognized there's these five ways in which we might we feel like

165
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:45,919
I am that we that we have a sense of self

166
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:52,919
the Buddha categorized all experiences into groups of five Andy olinsky I kind of I appreciate he

167
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:59,520
used the language to put this into something that we can relate to different ways these five different ways

168
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:06,299
in which we feel like we have a sense of self we could say this one way in which we

169
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:13,500
are constructing a sense of self or we feel like we have one is we feel like the center of experience

170
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:20,039
the beneficiary of feeling tones the artiste the agent and

171
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:25,500
the essence some of you will recognize that this is

172
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:33,000
the five aggregates the Buddhist teaching on these psychophysical

173
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:38,840
expressions or experiences five different

174
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:47,039
aspects of what it means to have experiences and as humans we often in one of these

175
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:53,460
five ways we feel like a self things where there's a certain type of clinging onto one of these five

176
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:59,220
Aggregates and I'm not going to go into the details about the aggregates

177
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:06,419
this all that really matters is that there's five different ways in which we can hold on to something some part of

178
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:14,600
our experience and it's that holding on that's creating a sense of self in that moment

179
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:21,960
but there's a way in which right to all of those experiences of course are not

180
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:28,320
constant they're changing all the time and they're unfolding

181
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:33,740
without any Essence without any

182
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:40,559
core they're just unfolding there isn't a me that's making them

183
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:46,260
happen whose experiences aren't mine I don't

184
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:52,980
own them I'm not controlling them they're just arising and passing away

185
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:58,740
and we're clinging to them in a really subtle way and it's the

186
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:04,880
subtle way that makes us believe that we have this sense of self

187
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:10,860
and the sense of self is always changing depending on what it is that we're Clinging On whether we're the

188
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:19,399
beneficiary of feeling tones or whether we're the artiste or we're the one who is expressing or the one who is doing

189
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:26,220
so this sense of self is actually just a collection of

190
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:32,100
the variations of these five different types of experiences

191
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:38,580
so rather than a core this Essence there's just five different types of experiences that are always

192
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:45,980
changing and this this is The Human Experience

193
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:53,400
and so but what I describe to you is kind of like this more conceptual way of

194
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:00,480
understanding it and some of the Buddha's teachings certainly are conceptual certainly in this tradition it's these

195
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,440
aren't like philosophical but maybe there's a way in which it's more

196
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:12,840
helpful to feel into this experience of self or

197
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:18,360
not self and certainly that's been my experience

198
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:23,880
is that it's more of an meditative experiences that helped me to really understand what's being pointed to

199
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:32,240
because intellectually or conceptually these paradigms like of the five aggregates

200
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:38,340
I don't know they've okay I guess you know I just didn't when I heard them I

201
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:43,440
felt like okay am I supposed to believe this what am I supposed to do with this

202
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:50,039
so it wasn't until I you know I had some meditative experiences and started to feel like some of the freedom that's

203
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:57,480
possible when the clinging gets less and less and less and less right the suffering is

204
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:04,279
diminishing and more and more Freedom more and more ease

205
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:14,299
so there's this way that we can go beyond like the intellect and instead have this like this visceral embodied

206
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:20,640
experience of not self so rather than a theoretical or abstract

207
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:27,720
exploration so when we are

208
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:33,200
sensitive to the sense of self or not self

209
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:40,580
well actually I think I'd rather like point to this with a poem

210
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:48,360
and this poem is entitled zazen many of you will recognize it know that

211
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:54,900
this word this is individuals in the Zen Community the zod's and is the word that says

212
00:22:54,900 --> 00:23:01,400
meditation practice sitting in meditation and this was written by a practitioner

213
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:06,720
perhaps beef Virginia Hamilton Adair she was in the

214
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,960
Zen tradition and maybe we can imagine that she's describing what happens

215
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,220
during a retreat

216
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:24,960
and maybe I'll make one explanatory note uh early in the poem she uses the

217
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,080
expression Saratoga trunk and that's just like one of these big uh

218
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:36,720
trunks that we could imagine that long ago people were like put on the

219
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,760
ships when they were going across the ocean or something like this big giant uh

220
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,480
giant suitcase we might think something like that okay so here we go zazen by Virginia

221
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:56,780
Hamilton Adair and I learned about this poem from Brian lessage I should say

222
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:04,679
when I first floundered in no one knew me not even myself

223
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:10,260
staggering under a Saratoga trunk crammed with humiliations bottled like

224
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:17,880
urine samples nail kegs of anger carbons of abusive letters chemistry quizzes

225
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:23,640
with F's even the horse I never had and two casseroles left over from the

226
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:28,980
diamond dip supper no one remarked that I had brought too

227
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,620
much I was wearing three fur hats donated by

228
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:40,260
opulent cousins my feet encased in cement ever since the failure of the

229
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:46,860
patio project and my mouth full of barbs as an old trout

230
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:51,440
no one praised my appearance

231
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:57,620
the trunk fell off my back disgorging its unusual contents at my stone feet

232
00:24:57,620 --> 00:25:04,140
which also came off the fur had stumbled like a moth eaten

233
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:09,240
Avalanche bearing a small Monk

234
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:17,000
no one noticed my sweat began to dry

235
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:25,640
I folded myself into one piece no one

236
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:34,200
that's the end of the poem the love of the sway right that all

237
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:41,039
these things that we put in these trunks that we carry around these memories these things that we are making up the

238
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:48,000
sense of what we think it means to be me things that entangle us with this sense

239
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:54,240
of self that we get tangled with the stories and the narratives about what it means

240
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:00,419
things that happened to us before I appreciate so much in this poem

241
00:26:00,419 --> 00:26:05,820
he talks about like these casseroles from this dinner or the horse she never

242
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:12,900
had or grades she got and and chemistry

243
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:20,279
so these stories that we mean like what does it mean how we were as a student are you really smart or maybe not so

244
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:25,740
smart or these casseroles maybe we're a good cook a bad cook or maybe nobody

245
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:35,179
likes our cooking whatever it might be but we think that these things Define Us in some ways

246
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:44,700
and we carry them around and it's heavy it's burdensome

247
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,799
so there's nothing wrong about having narratives with our life but it's the of

248
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:57,019
course we have narratives about our life right we want our lives to make sense so we create these narratives

249
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,940
we need them but what's being pointed to is the

250
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:09,600
clinging to them the way that we can we can

251
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:16,640
pick them up but can we also put them down when they're not needed

252
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:23,640
because there's a way in which we start accumulating all these ideas about ourselves and things that it means to be

253
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:29,340
our set what it means to be me and then we have this contraction this clinging

254
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:36,779
binding tension stress this way in which we feel limited we feel penned in we

255
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:43,200
feel imprisoned we feel burdened by this sense of self

256
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:48,019
and we're so used to it we don't even notice it

257
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:55,559
until we have some other experiences some of them may be in meditation but we

258
00:27:55,559 --> 00:28:04,320
all have Expressions maybe of ah beautiful sunsets seen big vast expenses

259
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,900
of Ocean City being on a Mountaintop and seen for large distances there's a way

260
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:17,400
in which the sense of self often diminishes there and we can have this bigger sense of what's possible

261
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:24,500
but it might mean to be a human so instead we might have this

262
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:32,460
experience of this ease or spaciousness or flexibility or

263
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:38,840
softening allowing relief freedom

264
00:28:39,299 --> 00:28:46,380
for this type of healing or this strong sense of like just putting down

265
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:54,059
everything that's extra and it turns out everything is extra

266
00:28:54,059 --> 00:28:59,580
we can just pick things up when they're needed and put them down

267
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:06,900
and so this not self-teaching is pointing to this movement from feeling imprisoned and trapped by this idea of

268
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:15,539
what it means to be me and instead to align with notice be

269
00:29:15,539 --> 00:29:24,140
sensitive to just the flowy nature of experience things are unfolding

270
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:31,860
and there's a caricature there's a there's a an

271
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:40,740
individual who makes decisions and then does things but it's more of a flowing

272
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:47,039
as opposed to this stayed self that's at the center and making things happen and

273
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:53,760
to which things happen so this idea or this notion of not self

274
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,860
it's not a belief that we have to adopt it's not something that we have to

275
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:10,679
pretend or make force ourselves in any way that's just pointing to a potential

276
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:16,080
potential for all of us as the sense of self softens

277
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:21,419
and this will happen right is it in when we're doing our favorite things dancing

278
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:31,020
to our favorite music humming maybe when we're doing sports or dancing

279
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:36,360
and these types of things when there's there's not so much self-centeredness or self-consciousness

280
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:42,299
pointing to the same thing the same movement not self-teaching

281
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:48,840
so maybe I'll end there and open it up and see if there's any

282
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:53,658
comments or questions thank you

283
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:15,860
now I know now I know your names I can I can call on you I want to worry

284
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:23,100
any comments or questions you don't have to but

285
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:29,720
I just like to make this space in case you do you're thinking okay

286
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:35,419
Bill's trying to come up with a doozy of a comment

287
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:48,500
we we don't have to we don't have oh Alex has a

288
00:31:51,899 --> 00:31:57,360
all those people online okay

289
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:05,279
um I think my question is like I've been meditating for about two and a half three years like kind of

290
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,559
more seriously and before that I meditated sort of on and off

291
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:18,600
um do you think could you talk a little bit about how like the experience of not self might

292
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:24,260
like evolve over time as we meditate more

293
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:31,140
how it might evolve over time or how it maybe evolved for you yeah maybe I'll

294
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,899
say this that sometimes uh when we maybe this is part of the way that I

295
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:43,620
think about it and I end up using this little analogy and all kinds of different uh teachings this idea of a

296
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:51,299
children's slide or you know a slide that's in the playground so there's a ladder up and then there's a slide that

297
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:58,020
goes down so often there's effort that uh you know for this slide it has to go up and often

298
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:03,899
there's a sense of self that's like okay I have to do this I have to cultivate this I have to develop that I'm

299
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:09,960
you know we have all these lists right a full path some factors Awakening all this kind of stuff right

300
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:15,480
so there's a sense of self that's developing and cultivating qualities and

301
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:20,640
behaving ethically meditating all this kind of stuff so that is probably like

302
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:26,340
maybe doing the sense of uh getting up onto the top of the slide but then

303
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:31,440
there's a a way in which oh things are just unfolding

304
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:37,740
there's a sense that not so much effort and this can be experienced a little bit of maybe in concentration States when

305
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:45,059
the when the mind and the body start to settle it doesn't have to be really giant concentration States but sense of

306
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:51,000
settling then there can just be a sense of sometimes you use this expression

307
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:56,039
effortless effort that's more like oh things are happening

308
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:02,640
but I'm not like making it happen I'm here I'm not a victim it's not happening

309
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,820
to me but there's this ease and just this way of flowing with what's arising

310
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:15,020
does this make sense you're welcome

311
00:34:17,879 --> 00:34:20,299
okay

312
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:33,300
lately I've thought that I would like to cut through the philosophical Thicket of

313
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:40,138
weather there's a self or not and instead just think of not self this

314
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:49,138
way whenever I think in terms of myself I create my own suffering oh

315
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:56,099
and I think that relates to something that you said but maybe you'd

316
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:01,260
like for you to remind me of what you said about when when you have concepts

317
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:06,660
of self you you're trapped yeah did you say that yeah yeah can you

318
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:12,420
kind of reiterate or elaborate yeah so often these ideas of self-rich there are

319
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:18,599
limits right I'm a person who likes vanilla but I don't like chocolate and

320
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:24,240
you know I'm a person that does this but doesn't that every time we Define something about ourselves implicit in

321
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,700
that is what we're not and some of that might be true but there's also a way that we're kind of

322
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:35,640
like defining or imprisoning or trapping ourselves as opposed to yeah allowing

323
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:43,380
kind of like the flowing of experience or something like this your your self-limiting

324
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:50,040
yeah and then very actually there's a way in which it's a it's a subtle feeling of

325
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:56,280
contraction too well maybe I should use this word separation when there's a strong sense of self then there's a real

326
00:35:56,280 --> 00:36:02,760
strong sense of me and everybody else so there's a strong sense of separation

327
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:10,020
and that's also a certain amount of suffering to feel isolated and to feel disconnected from others or from around

328
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:15,359
and our experience our experience around yeah

329
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:19,519
