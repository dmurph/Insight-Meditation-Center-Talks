1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,480
hey it's nice to see everyone arriving hello

2
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:12,540
it's been nice to share this week and perhaps just before we get started with

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:19,440
the meditation I'll mention that next week it will be May Elliott

4
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:26,100
I think some of you know her she's a wonderful young teacher at IMC and

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,320
I hope you'll join her I don't know what her topic is so you'll have to come on

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,399
Monday so let's go ahead then and get started for

7
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:44,520
today finding your meditation posture

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,940
settling in for the sit this morning or afternoon or evening

9
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:59,239
I know we're all over the world and just gently closing the eyes

10
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,260
and bringing the attention inward

11
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:19,320
sensing into the touch points of the seeds against the chair or the cushion

12
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:25,380
the legs or feet against the floor or if you're lying it's what you're

13
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:32,580
lying down on just finding a place where you can feel

14
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:42,060
balanced on what you're resting on so there's very little effort to hold yourself up

15
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:49,740
if you're in a chair it's sometimes nice to sit a little bit forward not to be leaning back

16
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:56,579
of course if you need to that's fine but if you don't it's actually more stable

17
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:04,399
to be resting in a balanced position

18
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,820
on your own sit bones

19
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,340
and softening the eyes and the eye sockets

20
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:24,620
softening all the little muscles of the forehead and the face the jaw

21
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,760
down through the throat and the shoulders

22
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:40,220
putting the shoulder blades slide down the back

23
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:50,659
and releasing the arms and the hands so they feel natural

24
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:05,239
and through the Torso softening the chest area

25
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:11,000
belly releasing the diaphragm

26
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,599
letting go in the muscles of the lower back

27
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:31,019
the body is balanced the belly and the low back can both relax in the spine

28
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,420
just supports the weight upright

29
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,700
down through the hip joints

30
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:47,580
thighs

31
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,420
the Achilles the ankle joints and even the feet

32
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:09,299
so connecting connecting through the whole body and if there were parts that are sore

33
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:15,420
today or you couldn't even feel them very well that's okay

34
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,919
let me just have ease in the mind about how the body is right now it's fine

35
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:36,740
connecting in with the sensations of the breath

36
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:44,639
we've worked with the breath in several different ways this week

37
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,340
in the invitation for today is to connect with

38
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:56,040
gentle whole body breathing nothing effortful

39
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:02,759
but you're sensing throughout the body the way the breath

40
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:08,060
can connect spread and connect the different parts

41
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,259
natural breath

42
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:30,360
on the out breath we can continue to soften any parts that we

43
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,080
notice are tight and on the in-breath we strengthen the

44
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:47,280
sense of uprightness in-breath is energizing and that's the that bolsters the support in the body

45
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,478
the uprightness and then everything else relaxes around that

46
00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:00,900
so when I keep saying relax we're not just turning into a lump

47
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:09,440
it's more that we're relaxing more and more around this upright support of the spine

48
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:14,960
or if you're lying down the spine is still the straight support

49
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:29,220
there's a way that the breath can feel like a bath or a massage

50
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:34,280
yes it just flows gently throughout the body

51
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:41,340
it can even flow through any thoughts or emotions that are there

52
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:47,400
and just emphasize we put the breath more on the in the foreground

53
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:52,800
and those other things can be in the background with the breath touching and

54
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,000
connecting those too

55
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:40,740
this way of resting with the breath

56
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:46,460
as our favored place of attention

57
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:53,039
will slowly generate some stability in the mind

58
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:59,360
if we keep our continuity of attention in a gentle way

59
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:06,560
and we can feel into the ease and rest of having a little bit of stability

60
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,519
just the Mind begins to gain even a bit of stability

61
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:05,899
bit of steadiness

62
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:13,980
we can gently now open the awareness a little bit wider

63
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:19,920
if it used to be kind of curved in around the breath

64
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:29,279
you just soften that curve so that the awareness includes sounds

65
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,440
other Sensations in the body

66
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:44,300
into the space of the mind we feel there are any emotions present or thoughts

67
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:54,300
you don't have to move the mind or just widening it

68
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:01,260
we're not going looking for things or just

69
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,220
opening

70
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:28,339
for the same amount of energy is going toward staying in the present moment

71
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:36,420
but we don't direct it to add to the breath anymore so it feels like the mind is becoming a

72
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:44,480
vast sky or a vast space in which all experience occurs

73
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:57,320
the mind is just there and other things can be noticed within it

74
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:06,079
this is the space element

75
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,100
the space element is not established anywhere

76
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:21,240
so it's free positionality time

77
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,339
of a particular View

78
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:34,200
of a focus like ourselves it's just there

79
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,980
it is an element also because it

80
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:45,540
connects all things by extending between them

81
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:52,880
and because it can be experienced all of the elements are experiential

82
00:12:53,279 --> 00:13:00,180
so just allowing the mind to be this vast space in which

83
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:09,680
other things occur and notice the deep rest of that

84
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,380
clouds and wind and leaves and birds all go through the sky but none of them

85
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:25,519
touch the sky none of them taint the sky

86
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,279
sort of at the space of the mind just be there

87
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:42,060
and each time we get caught up in something that's in the

88
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:49,459
sky and we notice just open and become the sky again

89
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,639
even if this doesn't quite make sense that's okay too

90
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:09,920
just rest as well as you can with the openness to all experience

91
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:18,920
in the present without getting lost so resting with the space element

92
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,360
foreign

93
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:54,660
foreign

94
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:51,440
foreign

95
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:02,059
and as we move toward the end of this notation

96
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:11,299
connecting again with the sensations of the breath in the body

97
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:20,340
perhaps taking a little bit deeper breath and on the exhale sensing

98
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:27,080
the groundedness of the body sitting or standing or lying

99
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:34,400
so we're bowing the line to re-enter it's

100
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:39,620
orientation in the body in space

101
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,860
in time

102
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:53,000
but perhaps we still retain a lingering sense of a

103
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,260
large space that's possible in awareness

104
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:04,559
even as we reconnect with our own

105
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,020
back shoulders knees

106
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:19,080
the heat of the body we can still remember this sense of

107
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,419
being part of the sky and that's something that we can carry

108
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:30,360
with us throughout the day this breath

109
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:37,500
spaciousness [Music] largeness of Mind in which things are

110
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:43,200
happening so this is a great way to approach

111
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:51,000
situations that might feel a little bit intense um it's all weather happening within the

112
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:56,279
sky of the Mind or if there are people who are

113
00:27:56,279 --> 00:28:02,159
challenging for us in some way if we just broaden awareness

114
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:10,380
they become a smaller part of the whole so it's a great gift really

115
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:16,200
to have the ability to touch into this wider mind

116
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:22,380
even in the everyday world that we live in as a way that we're not going to be so

117
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:27,960
reactive a way that we cannot take a larger perspective

118
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:34,679
are a way that we can be give space and feel compassionate for

119
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,840
someone else's caught up-ness

120
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:47,279
it's not such a usual way of being in the world in our intense

121
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:53,279
self-focused view oriented world

122
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:57,380
so it can be a nice contrast

123
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:03,679
and a protection for us and others

124
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,140
thank you

125
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:54,539
we continue to survey the emotional tones called rasa in ancient Indian

126
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:59,940
cultural understanding there are more than five of them but

127
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:06,860
this week we're touching upon the key ones for Dharma practice

128
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:13,980
and today's flavor is one that connects into all of them and is the direction

129
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:20,399
that they're all heading and that is the the Savor of peace

130
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:25,980
Santi in Pali some of you may be more familiar with the Sanskrit version which

131
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:32,279
is Shanti but in early Buddhism we would say sunti

132
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:39,419
in the Suites the flavor of Peace refers to the peace that comes with the

133
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:46,679
Fulfillment of the path so it's the piece of liberation and it also includes some Associated

134
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:51,899
qualities like Tranquility rest Purity

135
00:30:51,899 --> 00:30:59,399
and happiness so peace could be thought of as a a

136
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:05,399
spaciousness and presence that can underlie any of the other flavors

137
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:11,580
kind of like a Baseline and it gets stronger and Stabler all

138
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:19,200
along the path until it reaches or full fruition I mean we can

139
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:25,740
so it's said to be like the like the string for a set of jewels which are the

140
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:33,240
other flavors that we're talking about for many people the idea of peace is not

141
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:40,620
so glittery or emotionally exciting the way the string is not as glittery as the

142
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:48,720
jewels but nonetheless it's there and it gives support to all the others so peace might

143
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:56,700
be the deepest and most pervasive essence or emotional tone that there can be in

144
00:31:56,700 --> 00:32:02,279
these teachings there's a verse in the dhamapada

145
00:32:02,279 --> 00:32:10,340
that uses the word well this translation says flavor it uses the word flavor twice

146
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:18,440
tasting the flavor of solitude and peace one becomes free of distress and evil

147
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:26,760
drinking the flavor of Dharma Joy and the word there is Rasa and Nepali

148
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:33,299
so this mentions the flavor of solitude and peace and it mentions the flavor of Dharma Joy

149
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:40,980
so those all go together this nectar of peace is woven so

150
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:47,940
thoroughly throughout the sutas that we could never talk about all of them here that have this tone

151
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:55,440
so we'll just focus on two questions um what is needed in order to attain this

152
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:03,419
peace and once a person has become peaceful how are they you know what is that like

153
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:09,419
so the prior conditions and the result of course even those topics are too big

154
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:17,159
but they give us some kind of focus for today um so it's possible to approach the

155
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:22,980
Peace of Liberation more from the heart side or more from the wisdom side we see

156
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:28,019
both of those in the suit that's so if we look at here's one that sort of

157
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:33,600
exemplifies the hard side also a verse from the dhamapada

158
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,600
a practitioner dwelling in loving kindness and pleased with the Buddha's

159
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:47,840
teachings attains happiness distilling of formations the state of peace

160
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:55,679
so we see some important qualities along this art Faith art-based path to peace

161
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:00,720
right so there's dwelling in loving kindness dwelling in meta

162
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:08,520
and then it says the person is pleased with the teachings so I associate that with having deep

163
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:15,480
faith in the teachings and also spiritual Joy sometimes we think we'll be happy once

164
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:23,099
we get liberated when I'm finally free then I'll be happy but the teachings are pretty clear that happiness is a

165
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:28,919
prerequisite for for awakening we're going to be happy before we become free

166
00:34:28,919 --> 00:34:35,820
so that's something that we can cultivate along the path and then it also mentions the stealing

167
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:43,500
of formations so the Deep Tranquility that the mind can get into such that it's no longer making stories

168
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:48,839
too willing to let go so this is a path to peace through the development of the

169
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:55,378
heart through love and happiness and faith and then there also sutos that talk

170
00:34:55,379 --> 00:35:01,500
about a path that sounds more like it comes from the wisdom side they're not so different but there are different

171
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:06,780
sides so there's a Sutra that says specifically

172
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:14,880
or one of going along the path toward Freedom one should not neglect wisdom

173
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:22,440
should preserve truth should cultivate relinquishment and train for peace

174
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:27,780
so this is an orientation that's more focused on seeing things as they are

175
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:34,140
seeing truthfully restraining the Mind from its habits of grasping and aversion

176
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:41,220
and reactivity and being willing to let go very deeply cultivating relinquishment

177
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:48,800
so this too is a path to peace more from the wisdom and

178
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,680
restraint side so what about the result you know how is

179
00:35:55,680 --> 00:36:02,940
a person who is attained peace these students that talk about the flavor the essence of peace

180
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:09,060
what's that like so the Buddhist teachings as I read them

181
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:15,300
are clear that someone who has reached freedom and peace

182
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:21,359
sees things from a very different perspective than our usual ways

183
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,579
so this is a quote that I think captures that

184
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:33,359
when the tides of conceiving no longer sweep over one one is called a sage at

185
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:39,119
peace I am is a conceiving I am this is a

186
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:45,540
conceiving I shall be and I shall not be our conceivings

187
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:51,420
by overcoming all conceivings one is called a sage at peace

188
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:59,280
and the sated peace is not born does not age does not die they are not shaken and

189
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:06,000
do not yearn so this term conceivings refers to the

190
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:11,280
way that we imagine things to be or that we imagine ourselves to be

191
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:18,540
which is different from how they actually are we're concocting stories we're seeing ourself as a being that's

192
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:24,260
navigating a challenging external World we're Imagining the past and the future

193
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:31,380
and you know in a way that's conventional it's not that we you know it's not that that doesn't have some

194
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:36,780
value but it does work against being deeply at peace

195
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:43,800
and I think we can see that in our practice so you know worrying too much about who

196
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:49,680
we are what we are what we're not what we're going to be whether this is going to work can the future be like this was

197
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:56,940
the past like that so tiring so this this Sage of Peace who doesn't

198
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:02,640
do that in the mind is quite radical you know and it's not something that we can

199
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:07,980
really imagine or think about with our rational mind or you know even through

200
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:13,440
our emotions we can't quite touch into that but the teachings offer these sort of

201
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,500
inspirational and Visionary words so that something in us can feel and

202
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:25,079
respond to that something that's not part of our usual rational and emotional

203
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:31,200
mind something deeper so there's something in our heart that can know

204
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:37,920
what that is and move toward it uh kind of the way a seed knows which way to

205
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:45,420
send the root and which way to send the stem even when it's buried in the soil right it orients even though it's buried

206
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:50,780
in the soil so there's something in us that can do that too

207
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:57,839
here's maybe a simpler version of the same idea of seeing things differently

208
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:04,260
um it's a verse Victory gives birth to hate the defeated

209
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:11,700
sleep in anguish giving up both Victory and defeat those who have attained peace

210
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:19,980
sleep happily so giving up both Victory and defeat

211
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:27,480
those at peace can sleep happily so there's a way of being that doesn't conceive of winning or losing that's one

212
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:33,660
more conceiving that has to be let go winning losing being better being worse

213
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:41,880
or even being equal all of those are conceivings and you know like this age at peace

214
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:47,280
we're learning to see in a different way so our life is all about did I win or

215
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:54,839
did I lose did I get that or not did I come off okay or did I look kind of bad

216
00:39:54,839 --> 00:40:01,680
both of those lead to suffering one of them because we have to defend it then and keep living up to it if we actually

217
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:08,579
succeeded and the other because we were defeated both of them harm us so giving up both

218
00:40:08,579 --> 00:40:13,740
Victory and defeat those who have attained peace sleep happily

219
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:21,839
that's maybe a little more pragmatic way of saying that can we find ways in which we're playing this game and can we start

220
00:40:21,839 --> 00:40:27,859
to soften and ease that you'll find it's much more peaceful

221
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:35,000
so although the full attainment of Peace may seem far off this flavor of Peace

222
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,000
can seep into our practice from the very beginning we've all tasted peace this

223
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,119
Savor of Peace in some form so you know I'll just mention a few that

224
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:54,320
are very very practical and see if any of them resonate for you so right when we start

225
00:40:54,320 --> 00:41:01,260
we use basic mindfulness to be able to observe what we used to fall into

226
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:07,500
so for example if we're having difficulty with anger when we start mindfulness practice we're taught to

227
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:15,300
observe our anger can we see that we're angry at a given moment instead of just becoming that and acting on it right

228
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:21,300
there um that's the beginning of a growing presence of Peace something where we're

229
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:26,880
not getting caught so that's something that we touch into right away this idea of having an

230
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,900
observer being able to see what's happening in our mind and then as we go along farther we may

231
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:42,780
be able to feel our body a little bit better and then we can start feeling Equanimity or peace as ease in the body

232
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:48,660
we start to have an embodied sense of Peace So if we are feeling tight we

233
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:55,740
realize oh you know even if we don't connect in exactly with what view we're carrying or even what emotion we have if

234
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:01,680
we feel the tension in our belly or our throat we know that there's some cleaning there and just feeling that and

235
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:07,560
then being able to ease that that too is an embodied sense of peace that starts

236
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:14,339
to grow in US we can then we can if we follow that along and continue to try to find more

237
00:42:14,339 --> 00:42:21,599
and more ease in the heart and the throat in the shoulders in the belly we will find more and more of this Savor

238
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:28,020
of peace and we'll start to be able to navigate our life better so that's a lot of the path we'll do that all along the

239
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:34,320
path and then at some point we may have experiences that are quite deep feelings

240
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:41,160
of Peace you know they they visit us at times we'll have a moment out in nature

241
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:46,619
maybe or on a retreat where we really something drops away and we feel

242
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:53,760
something very peaceful it may not last but we have that as a reference point so

243
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,780
our practice can take on a new dimension where we start to use our deepest experience of Peace as kind of a

244
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:07,980
reference point that we can touch into at times when we realize we're caught up and we can maybe even remember a little

245
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:13,380
bit a little bit of that Savor of that time that it was peaceful and that can

246
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:20,700
help us in moments that are that are challenging and then at some point maybe we gain the

247
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:26,579
ability to have this emptiness or awareness that's inherently peaceful be

248
00:43:26,579 --> 00:43:32,400
in the background of our experience yeah the Mind still moves here and there and occasionally

249
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:38,940
gets caught up but we have almost a background or a baseline of awareness or

250
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:45,480
peace or emptiness or Equanimity I'm going to use different words because it appears different ways

251
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:51,900
and that's something that we carry with us through the world so all along the spectrum of the path

252
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:58,319
there are these ways that this the flavor of peace is there in subtle or or

253
00:43:58,319 --> 00:44:03,859
more manifest forms to where the path is going

254
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:10,319
so we've looked this week at some of the main emotional tones that run through

255
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:16,920
the Buddhist teachings and looked at all of them but a wide range that captures much of the essence

256
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,500
of Dharma practice if we could move through this set of emotions carry these

257
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:29,400
Savers we might find them to be resonant and helpful in our path they're always

258
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:35,339
supportive of the path so we talked about love and compassion and care

259
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:41,960
sense of warmth and care that we can have in the heart we've talked about energy and heroism

260
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:48,859
having the strength to meet the challenges of the path it's not an easy path I know

261
00:44:48,859 --> 00:44:56,400
and there are times when we can rise to that have a heroic kind of stance in a good

262
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,859
way there's humor ah we don't have that on

263
00:45:01,859 --> 00:45:07,740
this path oh the this mind that we're trying to tame right

264
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:12,839
and then wonder and amazement we have no idea what we're capable of

265
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:19,319
what's possible in the heart and the mind what's wrapped up in there in the knot that we're carrying when that

266
00:45:19,319 --> 00:45:27,480
starts to free we can be amazed at what's possible this human life there's so much

267
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:32,640
and peace it's all going toward peace

268
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:39,660
it all connects and is wrapped up in peace and that's what the heart really wants

269
00:45:39,660 --> 00:45:47,220
to rest upon itself in peace so may you have all of these flavors and

270
00:45:47,220 --> 00:45:52,260
Savers may they make your life a wonderful rich

271
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:59,960
experience for you and for all that you touch thank you for this week
