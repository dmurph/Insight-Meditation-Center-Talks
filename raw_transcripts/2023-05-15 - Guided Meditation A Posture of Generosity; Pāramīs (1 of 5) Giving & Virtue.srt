1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,940
well hello nice to be with all of you again

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:11,519
it has been some time you know so I feel I feel the the pleasure and the

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,279
privilege of being back with this robust

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:24,600
so kind IMC 7am Sangha great guy great gratitude to Gil for

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:31,439
inviting me back uh this week as you might see the theme

6
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,800
will be the part of these the Perfections I saw these recently described as the

7
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:43,140
noble qualities that are accompanied by

8
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:47,300
compassion and skillful needs

9
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,399
so we'll talk quite a bit about the parmes over the next over the next five days

10
00:00:53,399 --> 00:01:01,100
but first let's um let's meditate

11
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:28,340
the focus of this meditation will be the the first part of me of generosity

12
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:36,119
so even as we're taking the posture

13
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:40,939
giving the posture setting up the posture

14
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,618
calling in calling in

15
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,479
generosity giving

16
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,820
the support that's given by the the seat holding us up

17
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,540
the relaxation of the face as we close the eyes

18
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,420
maybe rolling and aligning the shoulders

19
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,519
and a few deep breaths really connecting with this body

20
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:59,000
this body that accompanies us through so much

21
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:04,379
settling in yeah

22
00:04:04,379 --> 00:04:11,599
there's something is there something in the posture that

23
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:19,440
expresses an attitude of generosity

24
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,860
the kind way we regard the spine

25
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,400
or let the belly loosen

26
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,440
the space we give for the breathing to come in and out

27
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,939
rather than controlling the breath

28
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,380
something you may experiment with

29
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,639
is to see if you tend to meditate with your hands

30
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:14,039
Palms down see if it Taps into any of your

31
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:22,800
generosity to turn them up open Palms open-handed

32
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,319
that gesture of giving and receiving

33
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:38,839
not only generous with the body

34
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:44,959
generous with the mind and mental activity

35
00:08:50,339 --> 00:08:55,100
what kind of attitude am I bringing to distraction

36
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:59,300
wandering

37
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:08,100
or to the senses the sounds that are just coming and just

38
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,500
going Sensations

39
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,600
emotions whatever is coming

40
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:33,800
can that too be regarded with an open generosity

41
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:41,959
by this time some of the

42
00:13:41,959 --> 00:13:49,680
needs or impulses of the body are the habits of the Mind

43
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,899
may be making themselves known

44
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:03,680
welcome dear friend I have some tea

45
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,000
stay as long as you like

46
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:26,360
is there some way that a generous welcoming or hospitality

47
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:36,320
allows us Stillness to accompany the movement

48
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,960
foreign

49
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:33,840
foreign foreign

50
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:41,840
foreign

51
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:06,380
and for these last minutes of the sitting

52
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:19,700
if the attitude of generosity has been favoring the side of giving

53
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:27,799
how now with the sight of receiving

54
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:38,600
maybe it's receiving the support of what's outside of you

55
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,760
community leave in your chair

56
00:25:48,779 --> 00:25:54,980
may be receiving something inside

57
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:02,580
your intention to practice or the results of this half hour of

58
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:09,260
sitting any little buds of goodness

59
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:18,259
so a minute just to receive with generosity

60
00:26:54,260 --> 00:27:04,820
[Music]

61
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:38,658
foreign

62
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:11,840
thank you very much everyone uh hello again

63
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:19,380
[Music] um I suspect we had some folks joined while we were sitting to

64
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:25,380
reintroduce myself my name is kodo very very happy to be here with the 7

65
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:32,940
A.M Sangha thanks to Gil for the invitation and the topic for the week is the

66
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:40,080
10 parties the 10 Perfections uh Tennessee well-known teacher

67
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:47,640
introduces them this way he says the ten Perfections or part of these

68
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:56,520
are the Buddhist teachings that are probably the most useful for bringing the path of Awakening into everyday life

69
00:28:56,520 --> 00:29:03,720
there are a list of qualities that you can develop in any situation he says as you're working with your family at home

70
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,720
at the office as you're driving as you're meditating and the qualities are these

71
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:15,720
so generosity virtue

72
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,419
third renunciation fourth discernment or wisdom

73
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:28,260
fifth persistence or energy sixth is patience

74
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:34,679
seventh is truth ape determination resolve

75
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:40,200
ninth Goodwill and ten equanimity

76
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:45,899
it's the word parame relates uh to the word paramam which means something of

77
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:51,960
foremost importance it really got my attention at tennis robiku says that these are the most

78
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:58,399
useful for bringing the path into everyday life how many of us wonder how best to do that

79
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:05,580
so I remember when I I first encountered these teachings I was practicing at a Burmese Dharma

80
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:10,620
Center here in the U.S and what I heard was that for the

81
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:16,919
practice to ripen an Awakening that is for the practice to develop into

82
00:30:16,919 --> 00:30:22,679
just the sort of Freedom that I was looking for the teaching was that all of these

83
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:29,340
paramis needed to be sufficiently developed and I thought oh

84
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:35,399
I thought this was all about concentration I thought this was all about meditation mindfulness

85
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:42,299
but what this opened up for me is the opportunity that any moment whatsoever in the day could be a moment for

86
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:47,700
practice and you can hear the broad application if you hold this in mind as I list them

87
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:53,399
again so giving ethics renunciation wisdom

88
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:58,559
energy patience truthfulness resolve

89
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:06,360
Goodwill and equanimity So the plan for the week is to discuss

90
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:12,720
the parmes in pairs and why is that in part because 10 part

91
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:18,059
of these divided by two equals five days um also

92
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:24,659
one of my hopes is that because we because we discussed two parmes each day two Perfections each day

93
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:31,080
that we can see something about how one wholesome quality is supportive of another wholesome

94
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:36,600
quality to say this another way one wholesome quality brings others

95
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:43,700
along in the way we talk about in the suit as Right View being the Forerunner

96
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,820
um one way uh in this regard that I think about the part of these is um you might

97
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:57,659
know someone who has a good friend that brings out the best in them one good quality brings out the good

98
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:03,600
qualities in another one of the ways the parmes are talked

99
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:09,299
about is um is like each one being a bucket

100
00:32:09,299 --> 00:32:14,460
that's being filled with water to strip drip drip drip by drip drip by drip

101
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:21,120
slowly patiently and because of these parames mutually support you might think of all these 10

102
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:26,520
buckets very closely together and when the water of one fills up it spills over

103
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,799
into the next our giving supports our virtue our

104
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:36,139
renunciation supports our wisdom and so

105
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:44,460
so the what can I say

106
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:52,200
practitioners have been making sense of and relating to the Buddhist teachings for a long time and that means a lot has

107
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:57,960
been said uh so I like to I like to relate to one

108
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,240
specific teaching that can represent the practitioners of a specific time

109
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:10,260
so a lot of what I'm going to say this week is inspired by Reflections on a

110
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:15,360
text called the treaties on the parmies by acharya dhamapala

111
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:21,240
all that I'll say about dhamapala other than being prolific is that to me he seems like someone who did the very hard

112
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:27,120
work of reflecting on his tradition in such a way that he could respond skillfully to

113
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:32,960
his times and that way he sort of reminds me of The Dalai Lama

114
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:39,120
so the the application of the parmes

115
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:45,779
is every day it's it can be in all sorts of things and the tradition regards the

116
00:33:45,779 --> 00:33:53,539
great potential of these practices is nothing short of complete Awakening actually of buddhahood

117
00:33:54,899 --> 00:34:01,679
so let's begin with some of the basic principles of the parmes that will apply to to a discussion of all of them we'll

118
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:09,540
hear these sorts of things all week first is that the the Pyrenees the

119
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:14,580
Perfections they're both practices and their virtues

120
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:20,099
so they are both actions things we can do and they are the

121
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:25,800
results and say the sort of Tendencies the qualities that arise over time as

122
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:34,440
the basis of those practices so part of these can be both we practice giving to develop generosity

123
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:40,378
we become ethical by practicing ethical conduct and so on

124
00:34:40,379 --> 00:34:46,020
What's um something that's beautiful about the part of these being both a practice

125
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:51,540
and a virtue practices and virtues is that we we are

126
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:57,839
were allowed is that the right word um that's not that's not exactly right but

127
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,000
we get to practice them imperfectly

128
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:09,420
we get to practice as best we can and this we can trust that this is developing Something Beautiful in us we

129
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:15,060
practice renunciation imperfectly but we're growing in the skill growing

130
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:20,640
in the tendency so as dhamapala says the paramis they're

131
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:26,940
Noble qualities which is giving renunciation Etc accompanied by compassion and skillful

132
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:36,140
means and when mature untainted by craving conceit and views

133
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:42,960
here we hear again how skillful qualities bring each other along the skillful skillful qualities of

134
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:49,140
compassion the skillful qualities of skillful means which is a form of wisdom the form of discernment

135
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:54,920
bringing along our generosity maturing our generosity

136
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:03,500
good let's see so

137
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:09,300
let's say you hear the word Perfections

138
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:14,700
and your first thought is oh great now I have to be perfect in these 10 ways in

139
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:21,359
order to be a card-carrying practitioner let me say at the outset that it's not

140
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:27,420
what not what I'm hoping to emphasize or propose instead of Perfections as

141
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:32,700
um measuring sticks that we have to say oh I must be perfect now

142
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:38,760
instead maybe consider that these can be 10 powerful powerful reference

143
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:43,800
points for wholesome growth as if the Buddha and the teaching the

144
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:50,700
teachers are saying oh look here look here there may be something useful here to to examine and practice and reflect

145
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:57,300
on for example in a very plain way how's my generosity

146
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:04,980
is that accessible to me is that something that lives in my life what role does it play

147
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:11,160
and here's the part where we don't have to be perfect you also reflect on the opposites

148
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:17,460
how's the opposite of generosity showing up in my life and taking a real honest look and just

149
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:24,420
seeing it's almost like play experimentation what role does stinginess play in my life Wow check

150
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:34,140
that out so consider them rather than demands of perfection as these high leverage points

151
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:41,339
just like our meditation we have this we have this reference point of the breathing for many of us or

152
00:37:41,339 --> 00:37:47,520
if it's another object same same works we don't demand that the Mind stay with

153
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:53,700
the breathing a hundred percent of the time we we get skilled instead of the process

154
00:37:53,700 --> 00:38:01,200
of attending to the breathing seeing the mind wander and bring and the mind coming back

155
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,440
and we get skilled in this whole process but all the while we have this really useful reference point of the breathing

156
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:10,280
of the body

157
00:38:12,619 --> 00:38:17,760
so one of the keys that I'm going to emphasize throughout is that dhamapala

158
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:23,760
encourages with all 10 of the parmes a certain method of reflection

159
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:29,940
and that is um to reflect on the drawbacks of their

160
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:36,140
opposites the drawbacks of their opposites and then

161
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:42,300
to to also reflect on the particular benefits of

162
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:47,820
that quality so you'll see this you'll see this fleshed out as we go

163
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:54,480
but I want to emphasize this at the beginning because this sort of reflection what's the drawback the

164
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:00,660
hazard the the harm in the opposite of generosity versus the benefit of practicing

165
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:05,880
generosity to reflect in such a way as precisely where we will discover where the

166
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:11,820
practice can live all over our life in so many situations

167
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:17,540
and it's also where we can start to notice the paramis supporting one another

168
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:25,160
so just a couple of minutes on Donna paramita giving

169
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:31,680
teaches that Donna's function is to dispel Greed for things that can be

170
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:36,960
given away and let's take up this approach so the drawbacks that he talks about

171
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:43,560
um we might recognize is the drawbacks of possession are clinging to our possessions particularly the sort of

172
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:50,040
worry that that can generate you can think about how um we may have something that's quite

173
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:56,160
dear to us but it's subject to loss we may have a beautiful teacup that's subject to breaking

174
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,640
um our possessions can not only spark clinging in us but others may want them

175
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:08,040
um it can they can give rise to conflict they can even give rise to enemies he

176
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:16,500
says not in all cases of course but these are the possible drawbacks of clinging to our possessions

177
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:23,160
so we're meant to reflect on someone we can give our things away to as a best friend

178
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:28,980
someone who someone who's helping me to rid myself of my possessions that I'm

179
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:37,260
clung to and also helping me to develop this opposite the quality of generosity

180
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:46,619
so beneficial the other side is the practice of giving that we're encouraged to arouse joy in

181
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:51,900
three cases in the case of a dear person asking us

182
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:57,119
for something in the case of a neutral person asking us for something

183
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:02,460
and the case of a hostile person asking us for something all three Were Meant to

184
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:08,280
arouse Joy because if a dear person asks us for something we can arouse some Joy on the

185
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:14,880
basis of oh this one I care for so much is asking me for something and I have the opportunity to give

186
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:22,140
if someone uh neutral to us an acquaintance we might not know so well asks us for something we can arouse Joy

187
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:28,200
knowing that um giving so often

188
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:35,359
um supports develops um a relationship

189
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:42,720
and I love this encourages reflection on the arousing Joy Based on a hostile person asking us for something

190
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:49,320
and this is the rationale that if if um he says my foe is asking me for

191
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:55,680
something though he is hostile to me by means of this gift he will surely become

192
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:01,740
my friend I hope that's true I hope so

193
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:07,020
in all three cases arousing joy and also arousing loving kindness and compassion

194
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:12,800
when we give one good quality brings another along

195
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:20,040
so a few words about Sila virtue in the practice and the quality

196
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:26,099
the function it said is blameless conduct that's the ideal that's where where

197
00:42:26,099 --> 00:42:33,540
we're headed and we practice it imperfectly dhamapala has a series of beautiful

198
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:41,880
metaphors in order to communicate the power of Selah the power of the practice of Sila things like a fragrance that

199
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:47,040
pervades all directions a staircase ascending to the heavens

200
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,619
a highway leading to nibana and he says even the Waters of the Ganges cannot

201
00:42:52,619 --> 00:42:58,440
wash away the stain of hatred but the water of virtue is able to do so

202
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:03,900
so he communicates the power of Silo with these rich metaphors

203
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:09,540
and we can think for ourselves of the bent the benefit of Selah as a protection

204
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:15,540
it has a basis for our own security and one of the ways that Sila and generosity supports each other

205
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:20,819
is that when our Sila when our virtue is well developed

206
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:26,160
then we're said to be we're said to give the gift of fearlessness

207
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:32,000
to all beings no one need fear or distrust me

208
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,220
so as an encouragement to bring the practice of the parmes into the everyday into your day today

209
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:46,440
uh what I would suggest is to for yourself reflect upon observe and take

210
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:53,579
note a few very very straightforward questions where does giving

211
00:43:53,579 --> 00:43:59,520
generosity show up in my life today and where does its opposite show up where do I notice that

212
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:04,740
what are the conditions for its arising and do the same with virtue or ethical

213
00:44:04,740 --> 00:44:10,740
Behavior if you know the list of the precepts or the 10 skillful actions how does virtue

214
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:16,619
play a role in my life and where does its opposite show up and it's again not for any sort of

215
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:22,680
judgment or push toward Perfection that we're practicing the Perfections

216
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:29,880
but right now just play experiment get to know what is what is this mind what is this heart how does it how does it um

217
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:35,040
manifest in the world so we'll begin here the beginning of the

218
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:42,300
session tomorrow there may be some time to to share in the in the chat what you found and then we will proceed with the third

219
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:48,900
and the fourth armies Perfections pronunciation and wisdom

220
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:54,920
thanks so much for being here it's a joy see you in the morning
