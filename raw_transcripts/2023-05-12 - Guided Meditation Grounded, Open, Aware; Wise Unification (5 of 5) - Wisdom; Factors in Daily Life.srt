feeling a sense of being connected

20
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:14,959

sense of rootedness belongingness here

and allowing the breathing to return to normal

24
00:03:03,739 --> 00:03:08,840
softening relaxing on the out breath

25
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:19,040
appreciating nourishment of the in-breath

26
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,900
and connecting to the felt lived experience of this

27
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:38,120
moment this breath this body

28
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:52,640
will be giving instructions for mindfulness of breathing

29
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,920
if you connect more with another object of attention

when any ease motion contentment of the in-breath and the out

34
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,659
breath

35
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:59,280
allowing the heart and mind to soften into the Still Point at the

36
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:05,660
end of the out breath and rest there just for a moment

37
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,699
for feeling into enjoying

38
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,120
the flow of the in-breath

39
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,419
all the way to the top of fullness

40
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,500
and pausing there for just a moment before releasing

41
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,360
inviting relaxation letting go

42
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,439
on the out breath

43
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:03,199
turning into the felt sense of the whole body

44
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:15,020
and allowing any other thoughts concerns to feed into the background

45
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:20,840
to voting the attention just for now

46
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:27,500
being fully completely cure

47
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:05,100
loaning in and if it feels right on where in the body the breath feels

48
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:10,460
most soothing relaxing pleasurable

49
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,720
it might be a sense of the transpiration of breath in your whole body

50
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,240
the Rhythm breathing and aliveness

51
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:36,360
might be the full body of the breath and it's more obvious form and the tip

52
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:41,880
of the nose back through the throat to the chest

53
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:48,560
like singing of the ribs diaphragm and belly

54
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:56,900
for all of the little sensations of warmth

55
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,800

settling in no matter the way

57
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:15,500
the rising and falling waves of sensation

58
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:05,240
perhaps each out breath feels like an offering

59
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:16,220
each in-breath for receiving

60
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,959
in writing the breath to massage your body

61
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,300
from the inside out

62
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:19,800
maybe noticing it in the chest the back of the rib cage

63
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,300
massaging the back

64
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,180
or the movement of the belly and diaphragm and perineum in up and down

65
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:36,320
out and in

66

68
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:29,839
needing awareness through the whole body

69
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,899
cripples or lands

70
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,339
foreign

71
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,399

72
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:02,120
to collect and gather In This Moment

73
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:23,779

74
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:34,940
the energy your ease contentment imagining it like

75
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,940

filling the whole body with awareness

77
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:54,320

00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:35,179
through all of the processes all the things coming and going

85
00:24:35,419 --> 00:24:40,340
rising and passing in the present moment

86
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,480
Sensations sounds

87
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:54,679
General sense of mood the sense of knowing

88
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:03,679
anything floating through the mind and heart

89
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:07,820
all seen

90
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,880
flowing through unimpeded like birds flying through the sky

91
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:52,399
who does this meditation draws to a clone

challenge this too is a beautiful thing to do

99
00:27:55,559 --> 00:28:02,039
and then you feel ready casting your internal gaze outwards

100
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:09,620
towards the others in this world in your life directly and indirectly

101
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:20,240
in considering ways that nourishing yourself this practice

102
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:31,158
might be refracted outwards to shine on their lives to benefit them

103
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:37,340
if only through your kind gaze

104
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:47,600
may all beings be happy [Music] may all beings be saved

may all beings be peaceful and to me everyone everywhere

106
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,539
be free of suffering

107
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:08,839
[Music]

108
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:14,459
[Music]

109
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,200
thank you

110
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:31,100
thank you for your practice

111
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:39,430
[Music]

112
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:34,799
so good morning Sangha good morning and welcome to the fifth

113
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:42,240
and Final of five talks on factors of mine that support stability of meditation practice

114
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:48,799
deepening of practice and that can support us in daily life

115
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,240
so a brief recap we started this week with the fundamentals of

116
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:59,880
mindfulness and practice intelligence kind of a queer comprehension and

117
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:04,919
curiosity about the present moment we've uncovered connecting and

118
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:11,779
sustaining the taka and Bichara and the emergent mental faculties

119
00:31:11,779 --> 00:31:19,740
embodied faculties of Joy PT and happiness their contentment sukkah

120
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:25,380
and then how it all collects together unifies

121
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:33,000
into a kakata unification today I'm going to talk about how wisdom

122
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,100
supports fruitfully working with these mental faculties and how these factors

123
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:43,740
also support wisdom they can help us attune more to our own

124
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:50,520
wisdom inwardly for the purpose of freedom from suffering for the purpose of

125
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:56,220
happier and more content lives and for awakening

126
00:31:56,220 --> 00:32:02,039
I'm also going to take a few minutes in the middle to answer some of the wonderful questions that came in through

127
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:06,980
the chat so

128
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,899
as I mentioned yesterday remember I translated as unification or

129
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:18,419
collected calm is also translated as the capacity to

130
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:27,659
make distinctions the capacity to make distinctions discernment wisdom is cultivated right

131
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:34,559
in the process of what you've been learning which is how to recognize distinctions between these different

132
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:42,559
mental factors and others and how they contribute to the meditative process

133
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:51,179
wisdom is also cultivated in the process of learning to savor and be nourished by

134
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:56,700
the goodness of these qualities the Piti the sukkah the mindfulness

135
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:02,880
itself and wisdom is developed by learning to

136
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:09,000
let go of eventually any energetic or exciting pleasurable aspects of

137
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:15,779
experience and letting go into the more refined experiences of peace

138
00:33:15,779 --> 00:33:22,799
Equanimity even little tiny glimmers of it there's wisdom in learning what feeds

139
00:33:22,799 --> 00:33:28,919
our practice what is onward leading for us at different phases in our own practice

140
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:34,820
lives and at different pages in our own development as humans

141
00:33:36,299 --> 00:33:42,659
so equanimity Equanimity which is

142
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:50,039
um part of that fourth most soft still Fades is very closely related

143
00:33:50,039 --> 00:33:55,679
to wisdom and to a kagata unification

144
00:33:55,679 --> 00:34:01,860
wisdom and Equanimity in particular both have kind of a settled back quality to them

145
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:09,080
there is a wise separation from reactivity to events in the moment

146
00:34:11,179 --> 00:34:17,398
mindfulness and practice intelligence the five faculties cultivate a greater

147
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:24,839
stability capacity that can be directed towards this big picture towards

148
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:32,220
wisdom of knowing and seeing what's hard to see wisdom about conditionality

149
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:37,320
cause and effect and a lack of self-centeredness or even

150
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:44,480
sense of a separate solid reified concretized self

151
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:51,378
that wisdom can begin to develop through seeing the impermanence and inconstancy

152
00:34:51,379 --> 00:34:59,280
in life and moment to moment experience and that can yield a sense of gratitude

153
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,599
for what is the precious and kind of um

154
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:12,619
ephemerality of experience

155
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:22,020
so that wisdom that also develops can understand the contributing factors of

156
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:27,200
Duca or suffering in the heart and mind

157
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:35,099
as I mentioned earlier in this series mindfulness is kind of a gatekeeper

158
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:41,940
maybe see a comment in the chat about this too that discerned what's helpful to let in and what's not helpful to let

159
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:47,099
it and guides that's helpful to nourish our practice the most

160
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:52,220
this is where mindfulness and wisdom begin to shade together

161
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:59,660
mindfulness and wisdom and this naturally develops

162
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:07,859
so for all of this the attention does not need to be completely totally unified in Jonna one pointed

163
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:14,099
and that said there are powerful forms of wisdom that can be cultivated by Deep

164
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:21,000
Retreat and experiencing these states particularly industrating between them and in letting

165
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:25,520
go of them and reflecting back on them

166
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:33,500
so that brings me to answering a few of the great questions people put in the chat yesterday

167
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:40,380
so the first question is a kagata unification Serenity the

168
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:48,240
same thing as samadhi and I'll just say this briefly at kagata

169
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:54,980
unification refers to being focused on one meditative object or on one point

170
00:36:54,980 --> 00:37:01,380
especially in somebody overall meditative concentration or stability so

171
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:08,280
in that sense the terms are synonymous but ikogita is one small part of a

172
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,859
broader experience of samadhi settlements

173
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:22,020
the territory of samadhi is varied and vast and ikogita is one part of that

174
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:29,160
much larger landscape so I'll just say now for details on more

175
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:35,880
detailed answers each of these questions for time's sake I did not I'm not speaking all of it but you can

176
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,819
go to my website and I did post

177
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:46,260
detailed answers to these questions and that is in the chat right now

178
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:52,200
please don't read it right now wait till I'm done talking but um there are more detailed writings on

179
00:37:52,200 --> 00:38:00,359
this if you're interested in it second question is the unification and serenity

180
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:08,220
of ekakata the same thing as equanimity so they can be is the answer in the

181
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:14,640
refined mind state of fourth Janna in particular that place of complete

182
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:20,160
Stillness unification and Equanimity have merged

183
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:27,180
and that kind of unification is indeed one way that Equanimity shows up and

184
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:32,400
there are many others there are other forms of equanimity that

185
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:41,700
are not so still or gathered around a single meditation point that are part of a broad flexible awareness

186
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:47,640
and then there's Equanimity in these forums

187
00:38:47,640 --> 00:38:53,700
that's receptive to this wide variety of experiences many many things coming and going

188
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:59,579
so both kinds of equanimity are very powerful and beautiful and each can be

189
00:38:59,579 --> 00:39:05,760
healing and transformative however Equanimity is experienced it

190
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,480
tends to be onward leading towards Freedom onward leading

191
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:20,160
the third and last question kind of overlaps with the one I just answered

192
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:25,200
someone wrote when I try to do single pointed meditation my mind guides me

193
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:32,940
away it feels like it's not skillful yet I remain interested because so many people report that it's very healing

194
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:40,320
so if this is you and I'm confident there's more than one of you I really want to encourage you to work

195
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:47,460
with what feels skillful in your own practice in your own mind trust your practice

196
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:53,099
some Minds benefit more from single pointed concentration unification than

197
00:39:53,099 --> 00:40:00,180
others do in the way that we've been talking about it this week that said if you're still curious an

198
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:05,400
option is to experiment with other objects of attention like meta or full

199
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:13,140
body breathing there's many many different objects and

200
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:19,220
it's helpful to know that some people's minds are just more naturally inclined

201
00:40:19,220 --> 00:40:25,320
towards samadhi in general and unification in particular

202
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:31,800
one of my teachers talks about these differences in our minds as being like left-handed or right-handed it's not

203
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:37,800
good or bad it's just different and if your mind isn't inclined that way

204
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:46,920
right now there's still plenty of wisdom healing open awareness that can

205
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:54,140
develop I hate so

206
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,720
different kinds of practices work for different people at different phases

207
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:08,400
and to maybe back off from a style that doesn't seem to be working and experiment with something else for a

208
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:14,099
while let the practice mature and experiment again in a few years if

209
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:19,520
it's still of interest but there are many different Dharma doorways into

210
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:24,200
maturity greater freedom

211
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:33,838
so those are some of the answers I do want to acknowledge that

212
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:43,500
um how do I want to say this I want to acknowledge that there were a few questions that came in that I didn't have time to answer one in particular on

213
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:50,820
Yogi mind and that doesn't fit so well into this very short talk but I will post about it

214
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:59,480
sometime in the next week or two on the website the longer kind of discourse to talk about

215
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:05,460
so as I mentioned for some people meta Rama biharas are another way into this

216
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,099
kind of unification that was how I started concentration practice in my own practice

217
00:42:11,099 --> 00:42:16,320
and there are resources available if you're interested in that

218
00:42:16,320 --> 00:42:21,780
so to wrap up as I mentioned yesterday we don't need

219
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:28,320
uncommon states to learn and start to develop wisdom and maturity

220
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:34,020
Discerning relating to factors of Mind as factors of mind starts to train our

221
00:42:34,020 --> 00:42:39,420
capacity and our ability to experience beautiful

222
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:44,880
qualities in ourselves and our meditation practice and in others

223
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:51,540
and the five factors have corollaries in daily life we can bring mindfulness and

224
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:57,480
intelligence to that bigger picture in relating to our lives and to others

225
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:05,960
we can connect and give full attention to other people or to whatever's in front of us

226
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:11,160
sustain those important connections develop relationships

227
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:17,338
based on respect close attention consideration

228
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:23,040
notice and resonate with joy PT

229
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:28,500
and allow any initial Joy of connection deepening

230
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:35,900
to soften into contentment practicing contentment with what is

231
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:43,200
that would be a corollary to sukkah and finally allowing different ideas and

232
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:50,460
deliberations all to occur in the field of understanding and acceptance

233
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:57,720
of ourselves and with others and when appropriate Gathering Together towards any Harmony

234
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:03,920
common purpose integration that happens to be present

235
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:11,460
these are not the soul guidelines for interpersonal relationships just a few Notions of how these particular factors

236
00:44:11,460 --> 00:44:18,119
might apply so and finally I'll just say these

237
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:23,640
capacities these factors are also helpful to tap into within yourself in

238
00:44:23,640 --> 00:44:28,859
daily life there's kind of this feeling of being at

239
00:44:28,859 --> 00:44:34,500
home in our own bodies and Minds that can be tapped into an inner access to a

240
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:40,800
certain kind of Stillness or contentment that can then be like carrying around

241
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:46,500
our home with us inside us wherever we go a little bit like a snail carries its

242
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:54,720
shell or a turtle carries it show home is always there and this this can reduce grasping

243
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:00,060
and discontent so these are some of the gifts of

244
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:07,619
finding stability and connection to new practice however you practice however you find it

245
00:45:07,619 --> 00:45:14,060
thank you Sangha for your kind attention it's been a joy to be with you this week

246
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:19,160
be well
