1
00:00:01,319 --> 00:00:07,080
so good morning everyone from California and good day around the

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,759
world and uh big

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:20,760
welcome so one of the characteristics of many of our

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,359
minds is that we will

5
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:35,280
um not know it's so well and we kind of go onto a certain kind of business as

6
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:42,559
usual as we go about our life and we don't really pay attention to the quality of our mind how the mind is

7
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,840
working and the opportunity of meditation is to certainly learn about

8
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:54,640
the Mind learn about the different ways the mind can be the quality of the mind

9
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:03,320
and also to um uh to how to adjust the mind in a way

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:10,240
that is supportive for us and um and so in the topic of

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,119
samadi um the mind is becoming uh unified being

12
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,320
organized and um an organized mind and the mind will do that on its own if the

13
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:30,119
conditions are right if we're not distracted if we're not cut up in preoccupations the mind will begin begin

14
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:39,560
to come together and um and uh and uh and come into a kind of

15
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,719
an a settled unified organized matter

16
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:52,000
man manner where all the parts are kind of working together and so one of the steps towards

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:02:00,719
that then a step towards uh samadi is to orient the mind and Orient the mind is

18
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,200
different than focusing the mind uh focusing or concentrating mind is all

19
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,800
too easily interpreted as a laser focus on the control tower and we're kind of

20
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,519
kind of zeroing in almost like using our eyes to kind of stare something

21
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:27,000
down and um and often it uses maybe the front of the mind and to orient the mind is something

22
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:37,319
different uh it's to set the Direction uh a a sailor on a boat might

23
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:42,519
Orient the boat towards a lighthouse towards a

24
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:48,640
harbor and then but then be completely involved with the wind the waves the

25
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:54,280
currents the whole situation kind of open and available but with it but still

26
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:01,200
there's no the boat and the orientation is towards that Harbor going in

27
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:09,000
and so there's a way of orienting ourselves that is a gathering and a settling and a that comes almost from i'

28
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,799
like to just the back of the mind and um and that orientation then

29
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:23,120
allows for everything else to kind of begin joining and supporting that

30
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:29,400
orientation and so again with a with a sailboat once it's oriented we know where it's going we know where the

31
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:37,000
harbor is a lighthouse at the edge of the harbor perhaps then all the choices in sailing

32
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,200
are in support of heading in that direction and uh and there's many

33
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:51,680
different little pieces of choices but everything is for that purpose at that point um so I'll will guide you through

34
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:58,439
this idea of orienting the mind today is a beginning of unifying the mind in

35
00:03:58,439 --> 00:04:05,959
somebody so to assume a uh posture where you organize

36
00:04:05,959 --> 00:04:12,360
the posture you Orient the posture to a

37
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:18,880
wonderful balance between being

38
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,800
alert and being relaxed a posture that

39
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:31,720
promotes a heightened relaxed heightened attention

40
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:40,759
and promotes an alert body allowing to soften and

41
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,039
relax and even if you have a lot it's easy for you you know exactly what

42
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:56,240
posture to be in and you just plop into that posture you might slow

43
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:02,160
down and S way from side to

44
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,400
side forward and back to really begin to

45
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:14,039
find the balance almost as if each time you

46
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:20,280
meditate you rediscovering the appropriate posture

47
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,560
for

48
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:31,639
meditation gently closing the eyes

49
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:45,759
and if you have a settling spot for the beginning and end of each

50
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:53,720
breath starting there you might take a few long slow deep breaths

51
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:08,199
and relax as you exhale where the body can settle into

52
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:16,599
that settling Place deep within a grounding

53
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:22,159
place place within where you can feel rooted

54
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,599
here and then letting your breathing return to

55
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,840
normal and again with an ordinary

56
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:55,039
breath feeling the breathing arise from the grounding Place settling

57
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:03,160
place that place within where the in breath first sensations of in breath

58
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:11,280
begins and if there's more than one place the place maybe that's lowest most

59
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:18,720
grounded most settled within or the place that's most

60
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:31,520
comforting allowing receiving the inhale through your body

61
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,720
and relaxing the body on the

62
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:48,720
exhale kind of allowing all things to slide in towards that settling

63
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,599
point the grounding place

64
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,240
and then if you have this place some little area

65
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:25,840
where maybe where the breathing begins or where the breathing Sensations are

66
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,479
most nice nice to feel maybe it's just a small

67
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:36,680
area in the middle of it

68
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:49,720
all there's a long tradition finding that spot in the

69
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:56,320
belly maybe a couple inches below the belly

70
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,399
button an inch or so in

71
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,120
in from the

72
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:13,040
skin it could be a spot in the middle of the chest as the chest

73
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,680
moves it could be at the

74
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,120
nostrils it could be the whole breath body the whole way that the body expands

75
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:38,120
and contracts as you sit so it's a very broad Harbor big

76
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:50,680
opening or it could be a very small narrow opening in the harbor for the

77
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:58,639
boat and whatever it is whatever you feel

78
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,839
the breathing can be the home

79
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:11,560
base see now if you can feel or sense or

80
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:26,199
imagine being aware of that spot from the back of your

81
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,440
skull kind of we in the brain sits all the way to the

82
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:41,120
back a place we normally don't feel or sense or have much relationship

83
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:47,000
to often thinking and doing and

84
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,920
motivation might feel if it feel comes from anywhere in the brain it might feel like near the

85
00:10:53,920 --> 00:11:03,000
front place where the eyes tense so the forehead scrunches up as we

86
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:09,639
focus but to kind of feel even if you don't feel anything just imagine

87
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:15,399
yourself sitting there at the back of that

88
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,320
skull and from there as you

89
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:32,600
exhale Orient yourself to the experience of

90
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:46,920
breathing this Skipper of a boat usually sailboats usually is in the back of the

91
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:53,680
boat looking forward towards the harbor

92
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:15,240
and as you exhale Orient

93
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,480
yourself

94
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,320
towards the center of your breathing

95
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:34,320
experience oh almost like there's a l a

96
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:41,519
light from the back of the skull

97
00:12:41,639 --> 00:12:45,800
shining softly

98
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,959
gently onto the

99
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,639
breathing without any tension

100
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:16,720
on the inhale feeling the

101
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:24,920
rising the growing of the inhale in your

102
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:34,240
body and and as you exhale counting the

103
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:41,160
breath 1 to 10 but with every

104
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:50,000
count being oriented towards the

105
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:02,519
breathing there might be a way waves in the sea

106
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:11,480
that push the boat this way and that way but the harbor is always there

107
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,360
ahead on which to be

108
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:34,639
oriented every exhale with the

109
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:45,800
count sense or imagine or allow the awareness of

110
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:50,880
breathing to begin in the back of the

111
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:59,600
head where there is no tension

112
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:05,800
maybe in the back of the head there is no distracted

113
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:16,759
thoughts but there is awareness that is

114
00:15:16,759 --> 00:15:24,000
oriented directed towards the exhale towards the

115
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,000
breathing

116
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:38,519
maybe like a Rudder of a boat that's at the back of the

117
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
boat for

118
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:39,440
as the inhale grows and

119
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:47,800
expands allow it to grow and expand into your awareness

120
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,880
almost as if the inhale as it

121
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:23,600
grows grows and touches the back of the

122
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,240
head so that when you exhale

123
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:37,480
there's an orientation of awareness all the way from the back of

124
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:45,760
the head towards the settling of the

125
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,240
exhale settling into the grounding

126
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
spot

127
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
e

128
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

129
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

130
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

131
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

132
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

133
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
for for

134
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:28,519
a soft orientation

135
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:35,679
but a clear orientation kind of a direction from the

136
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,840
back of the Mind back of the brain

137
00:22:40,919 --> 00:22:47,840
skull that shines out down towards the breathing

138
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,799
kind of like a light a beam of light that attracts

139
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:16,520
welcomes all other things to join

140
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,159
it from the

141
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:29,679
sides so that on the exhale everything is settling relax

142
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:35,480
relaxing into the experience of the body

143
00:23:55,480 --> 00:24:04,720
exhaling thoughts let go relax and slide into that

144
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:08,960
light quiting the

145
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:17,559
mind this orientation towards the settling

146
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
spot

147
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

148
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
e e

149
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:05,440
and then as we come to the end of this

150
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:17,440
sitting do again let your awareness let the source

151
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:24,278
of how you know see with the Mind's

152
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:34,120
Eye let the place from which you Orient your attention to anything at

153
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:45,278
all let it Orient be oriented from all the the back of the head

154
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:50,120
or the back of your

155
00:26:52,080 --> 00:27:00,240
body as a Radiance that's relaxed and open settles back

156
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:07,760
so that looking out upon the world is not done with

157
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:14,600
tension not done with wanting or resistance

158
00:27:14,679 --> 00:27:20,080
aversion not done with a narrowing of the

159
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:28,600
focus but settling back to the back as if awareness

160
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:33,760
shines or begins from a relaxed

161
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,600
place where there's no tension in the

162
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,880
back and gaze Upon This World Imagine you're looking out across the

163
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:54,799
land your neighborhood your town or Province County

164
00:27:54,799 --> 00:28:00,880
State looking out across the land for all all that is wonderful and difficult

165
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:07,159
in this world gazing upon

166
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:13,519
it from this soft relaxed place in the

167
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:23,039
back so awareness is not centered or doesn't begin in places of fear or

168
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:30,440
tension or wanting or even places of me myself and

169
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,200
mind gazing upon the

170
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:47,960
world and from there perhaps to Gaze on the world with kind

171
00:28:49,159 --> 00:28:54,200
eyes with Good Will and well

172
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:04,159
wishing offering the world Well Good Will in the way You' wish all

173
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:10,039
that everyone would do what a world it would be if everyone wished each

174
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:18,799
other the best contributed to goodwi into this difficult

175
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:26,200
world and whatever way you wish everyone could do it may you do

176
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:35,200
it may all beings be happy may all

177
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:44,840
beings be safe may all beings be

178
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:50,360
peaceful may all beings be

179
00:29:51,960 --> 00:30:00,518
free and may the way and Way by which we Orient ourselves to to the

180
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:14,760
world provide some of this to those we encounter may all beings be happy

181
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,720
thank you

182
00:31:10,919 --> 00:31:16,080
so hello for this uh second talk this week then

183
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:23,080
the 16th talk on samade and as I've often said samade is

184
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:32,559
a unification of Mind mind and body the Gathering to together more than a laser

185
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:40,600
focus and that unification of the mind has many different characteristics one is uh it's

186
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:47,679
inclusive the the idea that we don't settle the attention on something

187
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:54,519
in particular get absorbed in something but pushing things away there's a way in which there's a kind of feeling of

188
00:31:54,519 --> 00:32:02,159
availability and openness that makes room to be inclusive of all

189
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:09,960
things and uh and that movement of inclusion receptivity um is a wonderful attitude

190
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:19,279
for receiving and including the primary uh subject of the samade so the

191
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:28,159
primary subject might be the breathing that's the standard which we're using for this uh sumati course and so this

192
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:34,720
inclusion this receptivity that in particular can be felt on the inhale and then there's a kind of

193
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:40,960
settling into it all settling into the body into the body breathing so that

194
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:49,159
it's a settling where we allow all things to settle into it almost like we're including everything without

195
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:56,639
focusing or on everything without thinking about everything or reacting to everything just on the edges everything

196
00:32:56,639 --> 00:33:03,360
kind of settle and so um and so there's different aspects

197
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:09,360
of this unification so this inclusion is what I I talked about yesterday and

198
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:16,240
today the focus is this idea of orientation and um so if some of what

199
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:23,559
I'm talking about doesn't make sense to you it's okay maybe you could translate it in the way that does make sense to

200
00:33:23,559 --> 00:33:28,639
you or you can just take it as being interesting and or not and um and just

201
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:34,639
kind of hang in there and as we kind of go through this especially for this week there might be different parts of this

202
00:33:34,639 --> 00:33:44,039
week that speak to you um uh you know so today is this

203
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:51,120
orientation and that's a very different word than or idea I would hope than um

204
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:59,240
focusing or concentrating in a tight way and narrow way uh focusing is very much

205
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:07,919
associated with the eyes I think for some people and there's sometimes meditators engage their eyes um

206
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:14,200
unnecessarily in meditation if they're focusing looking trying to see their experience and they're can actually be

207
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:22,000
tension around the eyes because of that and so in a sense because of that tension that's kind of the the place

208
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,560
from which we're being oriented to do the awareness practice um um it might be that it's

209
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:36,158
more uh thinking uh knowing or even labeling the experience even counting

210
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,200
the experience it might engage someplace behind the the forehead or you know even

211
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:49,200
the forehe forehead can get a little tight um there might be a s a sense of there's a little voice or a little

212
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:54,919
Operating Center control tower that's doing the work um uh the mental work

213
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:00,160
that we have to do and uh and so again then the orientation the place from

214
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:07,000
which we're doing it might be behind the forehead and kind of in maybe cerebral cortex or

215
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:15,000
something and um sometimes it might be some other place where there's some tension or holding uh even if it's we

216
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:21,359
might be feeling kind of knowing or exper experiencing feeling the experience and so the orientation is

217
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:27,040
from the body itself and how it feels there might be the one who is

218
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:34,560
experiencing it the one who's enjoying it or or um UNC the one who's uncomfortable because of it and that the

219
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:42,000
one who's doing the awareness the one who's the experiencing or the one who's the victim the one who's the enjoyer

220
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:48,800
might reside some place in the body or someplace in a disembodied place that U

221
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,200
is kind of like the place from which the orientation is happening and one

222
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:04,720
opportunity is to find uh an or a place from from which we can get

223
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:12,160
oriented that that has no tension in it that maybe has no obvious association

224
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,599
with me myself in M um and so uh the

225
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:23,960
suggestion I've made was the back of the head kind of in the back of the skull uh

226
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:29,520
generally kind of the back of the brain the back near the back of the skull um

227
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,160
maybe there's an maybe if if someone has headache or something there might be some Sensations there but there's a

228
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:41,960
place there where where maybe there's not a lot of sensing neurons to really

229
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:48,599
sense and feel and so it's a little bit maybe free of all the associations of Me

230
00:36:48,599 --> 00:36:54,560
Myself and mind free of the associations of doing a work and straining to make something

231
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,800
happen and um and you can say Well that's arbitrary it's made up to to find

232
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:07,560
a place like that in the back of the head to orient from um and maybe so but

233
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:13,839
that's not doesn't make it wrong that's mostly what we're doing the mind is doing anyways making up things making up

234
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:21,079
a place from which we're oriented it's arbitrary or it's kind of it's not really inherent in being aware that it

235
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:26,760
has a a a spot for from which to be oriented so if it's from the eyes or

236
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:33,400
forehead or something some other thing um uh we that that's made up too and so

237
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:38,480
we're using our capacity maybe for imagination to find a place from which

238
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:45,440
we can be oriented and um and some so one possibility is the back of the skull

239
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:50,599
and almost like there's a light there light of awareness um almost a light that's not a

240
00:37:50,599 --> 00:37:59,640
light it's just kind of maybe Clarity or just a sense of directedness that um that uh is not

241
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:06,680
there's no tension or no grasping or pushing there exact exactly but there is

242
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:13,000
an intentness there is a sense of purpose that um that oh this is the

243
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:19,800
direction we're going and I myself love the idea of because I spend a lot of time on a sailboats on a sailboat going

244
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:25,280
towards back to the harbor you see the harbor and um but the boat is the waves

245
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,079
are pushing boats this way and that way the wind you have to adjust by the wind and you can't always actually be

246
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:37,560
directly focused on the Harbor there might be kind of going back and forth some but the harbor is all the always

247
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:43,000
the orientation always yes and the the the skipper of the boat can be quite

248
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:50,400
relaxed um doesn't really it's not troubled by the fact that we go a little bit to one side or the other side in the

249
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:58,359
waves but just because the orientation knows where they're going and just kind gently kind of stays keeps it on focus

250
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:06,560
and the mind is relaxed the awareness is relaxed softened moving in the direction and so

251
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,880
from the from the this this place in the back orienting ourselves oh this is the

252
00:39:11,880 --> 00:39:17,920
direction and it's more like a kind of a wide field than a very tight

253
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,400
little one but it's orienting itself you know the harbor might be in the distance

254
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,760
it might be in the Horizon a very small little spot so there is a place that is

255
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:35,680
very teeny up ahead but there's an orientation that takes it in without getting tight and narrow and

256
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:42,079
focus and so the orientation with breathing is to find this orientation

257
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,720
towards the breathing that yes this and a and a kind of commitment and in wonderful soft

258
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:55,200
intentness a sense of purpose that this is what I'm doing now and if you feel

259
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:03,280
like other things are more important to think about imagine or feel or have emotions about uh with this

260
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:11,319
intentness or this kind of orientation towards the breathing uh it's um it's not to push

261
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:16,560
anything away but uh it's to allow it to

262
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,480
be there on the edges in the peripheral awareness so that you never forget about

263
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:27,640
the harbor you're going to the skipper might have all kinds of things going on

264
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:34,079
but uh it's always Focus there it's like driving a a car in the freeway you always know the direction you're going

265
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,760
ahead on the freeway uh even if you're talking and having a difficult conversation with someone in the car

266
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:48,000
you're always there there there so that's the orientation and then with that it allows

267
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:54,359
kind of a gathering a gathering of everything that supports that more like

268
00:40:54,359 --> 00:41:00,319
it's almost like it's a the orientation is a slot SL maybe a big curved slide

269
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:07,480
and everything can slide in as we exhale and sliding down towards what I call the

270
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:15,640
settling spot or the Gathering Spot or the grounding spot which I find uh to be the very end

271
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:22,280
place where the last sensation of breathing occurs for me and that could be a different places depending where

272
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:27,680
you focus your body on the Torso but I do I do it right at the end of the out

273
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:32,720
re down in the belly and because it's the most grounding settling place inside

274
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,960
it allows everything kind of to feel settles there and then as I and that's

275
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:45,040
the small little spot of the harbor so everything is oriented towards and that little spot even if this feeling of

276
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:50,599
inhale grows and expands through the Torso it grows out of and continues

277
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:58,119
being rooted in that um that uh settling spot there and so what this is doing

278
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:05,280
hopefully is to create a a um

279
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,319
a welcoming or an appropriate or a wise

280
00:42:11,319 --> 00:42:17,440
un way of orienting the attention towards something that's going to

281
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,480
develop a unification a gathering a wholeness a sense of of being kind of

282
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:30,839
really here and alive in the present moment without the uh too easily being

283
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:35,920
scattered and being fragmented by thoughts and concerns and feelings and

284
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,200
reactions we have um it's because we're on this wonderful we're doing this

285
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:47,599
wonderful thing we're in this boat heading towards the

286
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:53,160
harbor so don't get and that's what's important to do uh don't lose track of

287
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:59,040
that because you know may you know it's uh

288
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,760
you could get in trouble if you don't last thing you want to do is for it to get dark

289
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:11,280
before um you know you've reached the harbor so I hope that these analogies

290
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,880
and this way of talking um uh works for

291
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,800
enough of you that it's worthwhile and if it doesn't as I said um just kind of

292
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:27,880
follow along imagine always use your imagination in the sbody course

293
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:33,760
um don't try to understand all of it only logically or rationally or as a

294
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,800
technique of what to do but it's also the idea can just imagine it uh to some

295
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,319
way um and the imagination might give something on your inner system your

296
00:43:45,319 --> 00:43:52,520
inner life something to orient yourself to something to to support you so that

297
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:57,920
you have an uh a uh maybe a better way of meditating

298
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,000
than if you just left your mind to its own devices

299
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:12,920
so so thank you very much and we'll continue with this uh theme of of

300
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:18,680
um of unification tomorrow
