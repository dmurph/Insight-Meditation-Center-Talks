14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:37,040
well either in northern or southern hemisphere if you're in the northern hemisphere um if the fall is coming and and

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,759
the colors on the trees in california we're finally having rain yay there's a transition there's a

16
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,960
transition in the air and if you're in southern hemisphere like mari christine

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,799
or dear sangha member different transitions yes spring spring

18
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,399
is springing right now i i trust and and so this sense of

19
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,000
transitions transitions um and

20
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,840
and transitions change change is a part of life is a

21
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:18,720
part of life we know this of course we know this uh yes change happens and yet how do we

22
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:26,959
feel how do we approach change how do we hold change as it arises for ourselves for others

23
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:33,920
and can we bring both menta to the wisdom of being with change

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,120
can we be can we bring equanimity can we bring a

25
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,920
sense of care warm-heartedness friendliness to change and again change somehow the

26
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:52,160
word change sometimes brings up this sense of fear like oh change goodness

27
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,159
change whereas sometimes change is positive change is good

28
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:04,959
changes yay rain um so change change how do we so so the

29
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:12,720
invitation tonight in our practice would be to open our hearts and our senses can we be

30
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:19,680
with with change whatever you know the waves of the ocean will always be here can we

31
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,360
be with them can we surf them with with warm-heartedness with metta

32
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,080
with equanimity which is one of the four brahmaviharas one of the four heavenly

33
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,760
abodes so so transitions change however they're

34
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:46,080
showing up for us um and drinking more awareness

35
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:54,730
um yeah that is basically the theme and we will explore it more in our um

36
00:03:54,730 --> 00:04:02,560
[Music] yeah in our practice tonight so let's let's check it out let's try

37
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,720
let's start let's start by sitting let's start by landing

38
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,120
let's start by landing in our seat

39
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,400
hmm

40
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:39,919
can we arrive can we arrive transition can we embrace this transition

41
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:45,840
can we embrace the transition from busyness

42
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,560
can we transition busyness

43
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:01,600
to stillness

44
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,400
to being here

45
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,520
just here

46
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:37,160
can we just arrive and embrace this transition

47
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,400
what does this transition entail for us

48
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,960
landing settling arriving with the breath

49
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,039
with each breath each breath

50
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:21,840
and each breath each breath itself is a transition

51
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,560
each breath itself is the transition

52
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,800
constant movement

53
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,120
constant change

54
00:06:53,919 --> 00:07:03,240
can we settle in open up to this constant sea of change

55
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,639
with each breath each in-breath each out-breath the

56
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:26,720
entirety staying staying steady

57
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:34,479
staying warm-heartedly steady with all the transitions

58
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:41,440
the in-breath the pause between the in-breath and out-breath

59
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,840
the out-breath and the pause again

60
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:53,080
each moment change

61
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:53,000
present present to change

62
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:07,880
with each breath relaxing into the change

63
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:31,040
embracing opening up our hearts and our awareness to the change

64
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,839
with each breath in each breath

65
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:36,240
and can we open up to all the changes in the body happening all the sensations

66
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,279
coming and going

67
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:49,920
there is a stillness of sitting and yet all the inner movements

68
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,079
the breath the sensations of breathing

69
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:06,880
all the sensations shifting

70
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,519
moving vibrations

71
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,800
can we receive them smilingly yes this is to be alive

72
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,480
transition change is part of being alive

73
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:33,600
can our awareness be steady steady and warm

74
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,600
steady and warm with the transitions

75
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:46,519
not turning away and not falling into

76
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,120
as our minds might wander away into thoughts and

77
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,079
memories of planets like little puppies running around it's okay it's all right

78
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:49,279
it's okay notice the transition away from the breath away from the body

79
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:58,320
to thought to memory yes yes movement transitions

80
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:05,519
can you not frown upon it to smile yes here it is that's what minds do

81
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,560
smilingly invite invite awareness

82
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,519
to transition back to settle

83
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:24,399
with the body with the breath steady with these transitions in the

84
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:32,959
body transitions also in the sound escape

85
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:39,279
sounds in the environment sound of my voice

86
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:46,959
noises they're not a problem nothing is a problem

87
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,240
all these transitions

88
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,360
from silence to sound from sound to silence from one note to another

89
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:08,160
can we embrace them wholeheartedly aware of them awareness unmoving

90
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,480
awareness kind wholehearted

91
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,360
it's warm-hearted

92
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:58,079
and notice that the mind can become very still the heart can become still

93
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:02,199
with the awareness of change

94
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:19,519
the mind the heart can become quite steady noticing change

95
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,839
how interesting

96
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:33,440
if you notice again your mind moving to a thought memory

97
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:39,680
coming back it's all change it's all change be

98
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:44,399
open and spacious with all these transitions

99
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:53,120
no need for judgment and for you to chastise yourself

100
00:16:53,120 --> 00:17:02,399
noticing change aware of change with kindness

101
00:17:02,399 --> 00:17:05,639
and wisdom

102
00:17:52,880 --> 00:18:01,760
maybe you're sitting comfortably and then maybe part of your body starts to feel uncomfortable and painful ah

103
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:08,799
bring your awareness to change with kindness oh here is change

104
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:13,480
hello change hello transition

105
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:23,520
so not focusing on the content and oh yes akina but the process the process of

106
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:30,559
transition it wasn't here a moment ago now it's here

107
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:38,519
can i be warm-hearted open kind to the transition

108
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:52,480
or maybe you were sleepy and now you feel more awake or feel more relaxed more spacious more calm

109
00:18:53,039 --> 00:19:01,440
yes you can receive the content let's say the calmness more calmness more peace

110
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,720
with appreciation

111
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:13,280
but instead of just the content see the process the transition from less

112
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:19,039
peace to more peace this transition this change

113
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:24,960
can we open our heart to change

114
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:32,960
not turn away receive it with kindness

115
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:43,360
with curiosity with stability steadiness

116
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,679
equanimity

117
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:48,200
relaxing interchange

118
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:18,840
with each breath change

119
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:38,520
notice how relaxing interchange with the breath

120
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,120
brings non-reactivity

121
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:59,720
stability of the heart and mind

122
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:48,320
transition from thinking into stillness stillness into thinking

123
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:53,000
stability with all the transitions

124
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,799
me

125
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:05,559
bringing an attitude of meta open-heartedness

126
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:14,559
to our awareness of change every moment every breath

127
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,760
sounds etc

128
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:31,960
can bring a sense of steadiness stability peace and joy

129
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,120
not the fear of change but the joy of change

130
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:58,720
the interest

131
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:06,760
the energy zest of change

132
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:23,440
if you notice your mind is thinking just notice the transition ah

133
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:31,120
interesting transition from peace to thinking ah interesting

134
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:38,440
noticing change no need for self-flagellation

135
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:43,320
notice change notice transitions

136
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,840
and maybe the transition back into stillness

137
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,799
the breath and body non-thinking

138
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:16,559
change is the nature

139
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,120
of the force of life of the life force

140
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:31,840
in us and others in life in general in the universe

141
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:45,039
aliveness entails change transitions

142
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:53,360
it's not to be dreaded or feared

143
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:59,360
it is the nature of the life force

144
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,360
change

145
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,079
change

146
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:21,440
nature of life force the nature of nature all around us

147
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,960
nature outside nature inside this body nature

148
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:37,280
this body as nature

149
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:48,679
embracing opening up to change transitions wholeheartedly

150
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,800
it is the dharma the unfolding love the universe

151
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:04,560
change to embrace it wholeheartedly

152
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:10,040
is to step into the stream

153
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:23,400
and to be carried by it not fighting

154
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,520
may we all embrace change

155
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:56,359
with wisdom and an open heart

156
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:07,200
maybe may we be free in the midst of change

157
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,480
may all beings be free and happy in the midst of change

158
00:36:19,340 --> 00:36:25,519

163
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:02,000
have noticed this was a practice of bringing in wisdom practices together with metta

164
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:08,599
meta and wisdom meta and wisdom together so the meta aspect is the

165

openheartedness the warm-heartedness like yes here it is yes

166

three characteristics of wisdom teaching so bringing a warm

169
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:42,320
open-hearted awareness to change in this way in this unusual way can really help

170
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:48,320
us befriend change because instead of being afraid of change so it's the way

171
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,359
of the universe it's the dharma it's the unfolding law

172
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:58,400
of the universe change you can't stop it so might as well

173
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,400
embrace it so i'd like to invite you all for

174
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,520

180
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,040
notice that your mind actually became quite steady quite stable

181
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,240
noticing change noticing the breath changing sounds changing yes i see

182
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:55,359
one at least one thumbs up from neil yes so noticing oh

183
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:01,200
yeah and some people yeah i see notice the total opposite mario christine says

184
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:06,880
great i love all the variety of experiences coming up so so i'm going to

185
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:12,320
ask you actually if you'd like to comment so i'll ask neil you first if you want to say anything about it then

186
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:18,079
mario christine so you can just both if you like you don't have to you're

187
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:28,079
welcome to yes you're unmuted yeah sure um

188
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:34,640
i just found it you know very calm you know in many ways it felt like a

189
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:40,160
continuation of wednesday's practice you know

190
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,079
you know i mean things just change and so they just move on

191
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:52,640
you know and as long as i don't get hung up in them being the way they are it's okay

192
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:59,280
right it's the grasping that you know and that seems to be the problem

193
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:05,040
right right exactly it's grasping to the content of oh this chain thing's changed

194
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,880
and it's this way now and why is it this way why is it it's like oh yeah it just changed it's just like pump

195
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:16,880
uh buffing of one level yeah yeah right many of the changes are from pleasant to

196
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:22,079
less pleasant yeah right which is a bummer i guess but

197
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:27,520
you know it's the way it is yeah exactly so if you stay not with the

198
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,920
content but with the process oh yeah this transition no that's interesting there's a

199
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:39,200
the mind has spaciousness there's more spaciousness that comes

200
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:44,560
and you notice that yeah great that's one thing i wanted to

201
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,839
for uh hopefully to get across and if it didn't get across no problem there are plenty of other opportunities to

202
00:40:50,839 --> 00:40:56,240
practice with this this is a significant insight this is this can be

203
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,680
a significant insight on the path of practice seeing change and how the mind can

204
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,200
stabilize actually seeing change not the content the from pleasant unpleasant and

205
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,240
back but actually oh yeah there's change there's change so

206
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:20,160
thanks neil larry i do see your hand up i wanted to invite murray christine if she wanted to to share anything in you

207
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,599
don't have to worry christine yes no yes you would like to yes so

208
00:41:25,599 --> 00:41:32,960
please for me it was interesting i was trying to observe i've got a bit of body pain i

209
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:39,760
wanted to observe as opposed to get absorbed by the content yeah but as all the pain as

210
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:47,040
every pain a symptom kept coming up in my body it meant that my my monkeys were just moving around a

211
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:53,920
lot because my monkey mine was literally trying to stay with the change the ongoing change but and that then it

212
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,359
didn't settle my mind it was the opposite became super active [Music]

213
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:05,920
but right right it does make sense absolutely yes so so what i'm hearing you say is that there was so much going on in the body

214
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:11,200
and and not and and what you were trying it wasn't to be with the content of the

215
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:17,520
pain but to notice the transitions but it seemed like there was so much movement that it was just like whoa this

216
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:24,079
is this is too much yeah and that sometimes when there's so many transitions like and that can

217
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:30,880
happen exactly it's like wait too many transitions like i can't keep up with these there's like too many right great

218
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:35,920
i'm so appreciative that you brought up that i went back to my phrases what would you advise

219
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:42,160
yeah yeah great um so so one thing you could do we could go back to the phrases that's lovely that's great that's

220
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,839
something that kind of anchors you and stabilizes another thing is if you if you wanted to still dip your toe with

221
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:55,119
this uh transition is to to invite it back to be with the breath because the breath has simpler transitions right it

222
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:01,680
has simpler like clips [Music] and like afterwards the mind the mind is

223
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:08,720
like a lullaby yeah right it calms down and then you could open up to the to the body sensations

224
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:14,319
again you know the body transitions again with the mind that went back backwards thank you mario christine

225
00:43:14,319 --> 00:43:21,920
that's lovely thank you so larry i see your hand please

226
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:30,160
um i really appreciated the guidance um

227
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:38,319
watching change sort of the ever-changing existence at times it it does really calm me

228
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:44,000
and i can get very still and what i felt this time was i would get still

229
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:50,560
and then i would move to the future i was like do i listen to should i listen to this

230
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:57,040
talk again and then i'll be in the same place or how do i stay in this place and as soon

231
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:03,760
as i went to the future i could feel the clinch of you know the self coming right back

232
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:10,079
and then i could see that and then i could go back to the still place again so it was that

233
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:15,119
watching that watching that watching that it felt very useful nice

234
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:22,000
what a wonderful insight that came out of this with noticing that yes when the mind went to the future that's when the

235
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,839
clenching the self came in the selfie me am i going to be in this place like whoa whoa wait just

236
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,359
beautiful wonderful thanks for sharing that insight how how important yeah

237
00:44:33,359 --> 00:44:40,400
that's great thank you see a couple of shares and then we'll transition into

238
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:46,319
the group bill says thinking became more stable but not completely stable that's fine

239
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:52,400
that's all good is this more focusing on awareness than on what is noticed

240
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,760
ah kind of kind of it's it's um

241
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:04,400
we're not focusing we're not aware of the content but we're aware of the transition so we're not actually aware

242
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:10,240
of awareness itself it's not that and we're not aware of the cut we're not uh

243
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,359
focusing on the content either it's kind of in the middle where it's it's the

244
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:20,400
transition we're aware of it's like the derivative or for those of you who like

245
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:27,599
mathematics it's the that that's what we're paying attention to so yes i hope that makes sense bill

246
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:33,040
r says i feel like i need to practice this more to really drop in it felt like

247
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:40,560
open awareness practice and my mind kept trying to decide what to focus on ah right right so what the invitation i i

248
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:46,640
have is to stay with the breath to stay with the transitions of the breath that is

249
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:53,359
your anchor here so usually our anchor is the breath itself the content of the breath

250
00:45:53,359 --> 00:45:59,119
the sensations of the breath here i was suggesting for the anchor

251
00:45:59,119 --> 00:46:04,880
to be the transitions the from the in on the breath in breath out

252
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:11,119
breath all those transitions so so that could serve as the uh as the anchor here

253
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:17,920
or if you wanted to try this again so that's what i would invite you excellent questions beautiful

254
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:24,079
reflections everyone so touched with your practice everything that's coming up for you so juicy

255
00:46:24,079 --> 00:46:32,640
everyone thank you so much so so let us transition now let us transition

256
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:38,400
uh to um practicing in small groups and and

257
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,240
bringing a theme from wednesday listening with our hearts listening with our hearts

258
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:51,040
sharing with our hearts and whatever transitions we would like to share or not it's all good and let's start

259
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:56,480
with 15 seconds of of silent meta

260
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:03,200
for one another before we engage uh and i've created the rooms the rooms are

261
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,319
made take care of yourselves take care of each other

262
00:47:08,319 --> 00:47:13,520
here we go okay welcome back everyone

263
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,800
um we have just about a minute left for any reflections

264
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:25,040
that might have come up um [Music] either during or before so i'd love to

265
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:33,640
hear from you especially if you haven't shared for a while don't be shy go for it

266
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:49,599
yes jerry i do see your hand please uh anyway i can talk and talk a lot but

267
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:56,160
try not to like i learn more when i listen but anyhow just add i joined late but it really helped when

268
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:03,599
you said that the essential of life is change and a reflection came up in the group

269
00:48:03,599 --> 00:48:08,720
and they said you know so often in our lives we we don't well

270
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:15,359
we either want something to change now which it will eventually or we don't want to lose what we have and

271
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:22,160
so we get sad thinking of the loss or loss aversion and so i was thinking about that that

272
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:27,280
happiness or content might be more contentment which i think is the greatest wealth as they say in

273
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:33,839
buddhism that it's to embrace change that it's inevitable

274
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:39,760
is essential of life actually makes the enjoyment of the moment that we're

275
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:45,119
here for such a short time so rewarding so thank you

276
00:48:45,119 --> 00:48:52,319
thank you jerry well said well said thank you thank you for that and and larry quickly

277
00:48:52,319 --> 00:48:58,079
asks uh or i'll quickly answer why do we need an anchor

278
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:05,599
uh is we are watching everything change if not is wait um

279
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:12,240
i think there was a typo there but i think i get the gist of the question why do we need an anchor if everything is changing or something like that the idea

280
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:18,400
is that um so that our awareness can can be stable otherwise it becomes overwhelming other

281
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:24,400
because it just it you know it's like if you're looking through binoculars it just if it's

282
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:30,480
shifting and moving too much like it right you can't really look through so but you want to look through the

283
00:49:30,480 --> 00:49:36,319
binoculars so that they're stable so you can see everything that's shifting really

284
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:42,960
clearly so that's the idea that's the reason for that and thank you thank you for all your

285
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:48,640
practice showing up your beautiful reflections and and that was a lovely

286
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:53,680
point to end on jerry love that thanks for that reflection and everyone thank

287
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,960
you for coming to happier practicing cultivating your heart your minds

288
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:06,250
for yourselves and the sake of all beings everywhere may all beings be happy may all being be safe

289
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:10,520
[Music] okay
