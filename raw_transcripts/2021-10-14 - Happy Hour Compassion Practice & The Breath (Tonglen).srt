1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,799
so hello and welcome everyone lovely to see you to be with you

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,639
so for today's practice um i'd like to invite us

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,480
to explore the practice of compassion

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,560
for others in a particular way so the practice of compassion compassion

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:32,398
is where meta love good will meets meets challenge meets

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,440
suffering either ours or others and holds it with kindness

7
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,600
and one way to practice um this beautiful practice of compassion

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,360
cultivating our hearts towards compassion is um called tonglen tonglen i've mentioned it

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,719
before we practice it before some of you might be familiar some of you may not be

10
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,000
it's all good so so the idea of tonglen and something

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:09,280
that some people find actually perhaps challenging with tanglin which is really the crux of what i'd

12
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,960
like to focus on is this connecting the

13
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,799
our breath breathing in breathing out breathing in breathing out that's one

14
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,159
part of tongue line breathing in suffering breathing out

15
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:33,920
good will love kindness compassion soothing but what really makes this possible what

16
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,520
really makes this tongle impossible and actually makes it a beautiful

17
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,880
practice not a heavy practice of oh my god i'm breathing in the suffering of others

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,280
which is where sometimes people go off and like i don't like tongue line because it's heavy i'm breathing in

19
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,399
suffering of others is the idea that actually when

20
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,600
breathing in happens the idea of this this um transformative capacity

21
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,959
in our heart that suffering gets transformed suffering that's breathed

22
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:16,560
and gets transformed without us doing anything it's not ours so we take the self out of it because if

23
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:24,480
you make it about me i'm breathing in the suffering of the world like it's too heavy it gets too much how does the

24
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,560
little me do that well it's not about the little me it's about the

25
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,879
this me that's unfathomable that's that's much

26
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:42,400
more dimensionally divine and and

27
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:49,200
the capacities of this heart this mind are much more expansive than the little me

28
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,720
has access to or the little me can even envision so so

29
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:02,400
it connects so this practice connects with the bodhisattva vow that i vow to

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:08,879
free up all human beings to support the freedom of all human beings which if you take it as face values like are you

31
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:15,280
kidding me the little me is going to do all that well it's not the little needs it's the sense of

32
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,400
tapping into something that's bigger than me i am part of something that is

33
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:27,440
so bigger than me um then i can't even envision but in imagine but i trust i trust this heart

34
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,360
this kindness goodness of my heart um as suffering is breathed in is

35
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:40,000
transformed as if there is this fire this holy fire this um

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,959
this this fire that transforms this the suffering into good will into

37
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,560
light into light of well-being that then shines out so i'm

38
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,599
just being a i'm being a be i'm supporting this

39
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:03,519
process that's happening on its own i'm not doing it i'm witnessing it so you

40
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,599
participate as a witness as something that you witness and you

41
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:14,959
you take um you're even maybe even amazed by and it

42
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,120
inspires you wow wow this is beautiful this is amazing

43
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,479
i also want to connect it to something else that thing was brought up

44
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:32,720
in the google groups that is practiced that yes my suffering there's a particular way to

45
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:40,639
see that my suffering is a part of is a part of this uh this transformation

46
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:46,880
it's a part of this transformation it's part of of this transformation of suffering into

47
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:53,360
goodness suffering into care into love and that's one way that we can see our

48
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:02,160
own suffering as a way to to support the the uh well-being the compassion um

49
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,440
that that it's an act of compassion it's an act of taking on it's an act of

50
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,080
taking on of course not in the way of making it heavy and and um

51
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,320
and like oh i have to take on this suffering of the world it's not about that it's a sense of aspiration

52
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,639
so without saying so much more about it and let's just engage with this practice see

53
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,039
what arises and not get too heady about it because the more i talk i'm afraid we'll get

54
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:38,320
more heady about it trying to analyze but see what comes up see what you might

55
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,840
explore or realize discover that may not have been [Music]

56
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,160
evident like discover something new wow this is beautiful this is amazing with each breath

57
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,840
this being is providing is shining more love is shining more compassion onto the

58
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,680
world wow what a capacity i didn't know my heart was capable of that so let

59
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,199
yourself be surprised and if at any point it gets too much then

60
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:12,880
step back take a step back turn the compassion to yourself to your

61
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,080
own heart to your own body to your own mind there are no shoulds in this

62
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:23,919
cultivation see what is nourishing see what is supportive so

63
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,919
so without further ado let's engage let's practice together and as always we

64
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,800
start by landing landing in our bodies landing with the

65
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,120
breath

66
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,639
in this moment in time

67
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,840
letting go of the words of the thoughts of the thinking

68
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,199
and just connecting with the breath with the body

69
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,520
feeling receiving the breath in the abdomen

70
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:45,840
and relaxing softening into the body

71
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:57,639
with each breath arriving taking refuge nowhere to go nothing to do

72
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:51,360
and if thoughts are arising and if awareness

73
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:57,200
is now resting on thoughts plans it's okay it's right

74
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:03,519
it's okay have compassion kindness humor

75
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:11,519
to your own mind it's okay come back to your mind

76
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,959
come back sweet little puppy of the mind running away

77
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:26,560
here and there it's okay come back come back rest rest rest on my lab

78
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,560
with the breath in the lower abdomen

79
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,360
each breath

80
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,839
helping us land dry more deeply here now

81
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:22,519
each out breath relaxing softening

82
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,200
can be so delicious just to sit and receive the breath

83
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:58,920
rest rest rest now

84
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:57,120
i'd like to invite you to mention as if the breath was entering through

85
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,200
center of your chest the breath entering through your heart center

86
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:08,800
as it would enter would enliven

87
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,800
it would set a light bring a life

88
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,600
a sense of kindness good will

89
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:24,480
shining

90
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:33,839
it awakens this light this brightness in your heart

91
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:39,200
good will care shines out

92
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:46,760
as it shines out it touches you first touches your body first

93
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,760
and this heart this center of your chest this heart center proverbial heart center

94
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:24,399
it's both yours it's personal

95
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:29,560
it's also not yours

96
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:40,480
it's connected with goodness with grace with beauty with

97
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:45,839
with love

98
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:59,839
that you are a part of but you don't own it's too big for anyone to own

99
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:08,240
but you are definitely a part of as if it's an ocean

100
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:17,839
it's an ocean and yours is a drop of the same taste

101
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:31,279
same quality this good will this care this

102
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,920
unconditional love

103
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,880
that you are a part of

104
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:56,800
whether or not you see it in this moment where it's

105
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:03,959
accessible it doesn't matter no problem

106
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:17,279
and each breath entering through the heart center

107
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:23,360
at the vacancy it awakens it's enlivens brightens

108
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,480
the spark this light

109
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,839
this fire

110
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:52,839
the light shining

111
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:23,120
let's imagine that your own suffering

112
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:28,240
your own challenges in this life whether it's physical pain

113
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:35,440
difficulty in the body and the mind and the heart and your life

114
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,840
let's imagine that it's like a fog or

115
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,480
some kind of a cloud maybe

116
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:59,360
and it gets breathed in the suffering this challenge

117
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,320
into the heart center and it gets transformed it gets transformed this suffering

118
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:12,639
and this bright light and this holy fire

119
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:19,600
whatever vision metaphor works for you

120
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:35,120
one thing that works for me is to imagine this bright burning

121
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,000
alchemical fire

122
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,000
our suffering gets transformed

123
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:57,679
and it becomes light becomes soothing calming

124
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:04,480
lovely loving light that just shines out

125
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,720
ah

126
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:14,320
and it brain brings comfort and ease

127
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:22,320
the transformation happens on its own the breathing even the breathing happens

128
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:27,440
on its own there's nothing for you to do the body knows how to breathe

129
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:31,720
you are just holding witness

130
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,280
nothing to do

131
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,840
too well

132
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,760
pain suffering your own is breathed in

133
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,520
as if a fog smoke

134
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:23,840
to the heart center transformed to bright soothing

135
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:30,480
light brings comfort and ease and healing

136
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:34,200
this heart

137
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:39,200
this heart center

138
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,000
transformative transforming

139
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:57,120
powerful [Music] energetically powerful beyond

140
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,240
our imagination

141
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,520
the power to transform

142
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,760
let yourself feel drenched in the light of your own healing

143
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:49,240
of your own heart that gets shona outward

144
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:41,840
now if you like to invite someone you care about whom you're close to

145
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:55,840
imagine their challenges their suffering something that's difficult for them

146
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:12,400
is this cloud it gets breathed in

147
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:19,280
the heart center naturally and transformed into healing light

148
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:26,080
compassion love care and breathed out

149
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:33,039
through the heart center and bring them ease care love

150
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:41,720
your soothing wishes for their ease from their challenge

151
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:03,960
and witnessing the process happening on its own

152
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:30,240
this being breathed in breathed out it's an offering it's an offering of

153
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:37,440
generosity of compassion that you make

154
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:44,399
you give knowing the other person's suffering

155
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:54,440
how challenging this situation is for them it's your offering to them your offering of love and care

156
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:23,440
for their suffering to be breathed in and transformed into love

157
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:32,279
into healing your offering to them

158
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,960
do

159
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:39,600
oh if this heart is this heart

160
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:47,440
if this heart could take away

161
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,919
suffering of loved ones offering this wish

162
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,720
offering our goodness

163

213
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:55,599
claire please thanks nikki um i i i couldn't help but

214
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,320
get my hand up because what you worked on tonight is so closely integrated into my personal life

215
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:08,079
that i can't begin to tell you i'm an only child both my parents died when i was quite young

216
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:13,359
so i went about my life in pretty normal way until about

217
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:19,920
15 20 years ago i got very involved in spiritual work and

218
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,400
within about 10 years of that i started experiencing situations where people died

219
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,440
unexpectedly and i was asked to help the survivor and the most dramatic of it came and

220
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:41,119
will always be with me because it was so moving someone who knew my story uh asked the red cross to send me down

221
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:48,000
to ground zero to do grief counseling and it was just it was amazing

222
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,440
uh and you know sort of a testimonial to what she said because

223
00:38:53,440 --> 00:39:00,000
for me it is so enriching to be able to make that gift to others

224
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:05,440
i can't i can't describe it it's just it's like i'm a channel and i'm just giving to them

225
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:11,920
what i was given um and it's just a very important part of who i am so i wanted

226
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:18,880
to share that with you thank you claire thank you so much for

227
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:26,480

231

232
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:57,599
towards it not shying away but turning towards it and builds up the courage of our hearts and you going to ground zero

for thanking claire for the uh reflection and this

266
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:56,880
idea of this archetype of a wounded healer that jung brings up the more we suffer the more we're able to identify

267
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:03,680
and support other suffering yeah indeed so dear ones the time has come

268
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:10,880
for us to to open our hearts to each other in small groups such a

269
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:16,480
rich practice for us to sit just for six minutes seven minutes with each other

270
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,040
you can share your meta your compassion in silence or you can speak if you wish share your

271
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:30,480
practice or just breathe breathe in breathe out um practice together however use this

272
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:36,640
time in whichever way it's helpful for you in in your little

273
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:44,640
group you decide so so i'm creating the groups now and uh opening the rooms take care of

274
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,319
yourselves take care of each other here we go group so welcome back everyone we have a

275
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:57,599
couple minutes for um reflections what came up for you what did you notice observe

276
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:02,800
when practicing with each other in groups it makes me so happy

277
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:08,240
um group practice fred please

278
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:17,119
i wonder if you would say a little more about the in in the practice

279
00:45:17,119 --> 00:45:25,599
how it happens without without our willing it without without effort that it's how it's like breathing

280
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:31,599
yeah yeah so the way to bring that in that sense

281
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:39,119
in and it takes a while you know there's with tong len there's so many pieces it's it's

282
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,480
like you know multi-multi-ring circus there's the breath there's this there's so it takes

283
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:50,880
a while to get it all together and then so so it may not be immediate what i'm saying

284
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:56,000
that becomes a print but at some point it just seems like the breath comes in

285
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:04,720
this suffering is breathed and it gets transformed and it it's it's it's shown outward the sense of kindness

286
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:10,800
love healing it just all happens instead of okay now i'm gonna make it better there's not a sense of

287
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,400
willing it it's just a sense of witnessing and it's connected what's beautiful about this practice of

288
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:22,880
compassion this way of doing compassion practice i mean there are lots of beautiful ways one way as we've done

289
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,000
before is you know may you be free from suffering you know bringing up the the

290
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,240
suffering of the person in mind meeting it with kindness saying the phrases so it's more active there's a sense of

291
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:40,400
phrases whereas here this there's this sense of the breath comes in birth comes out and

292
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:45,920
it's just so there's a sense of witnessing what's happening of course we are

293
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,119
part of this but it's it doesn't feel so willful um

294
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:57,040
so it's it's just witnessing this it's it's not so much willing it happens

295
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:04,960
does that does that help does that clarify a little bit yeah thumbs up great thanks fred

296
00:47:06,079 --> 00:47:11,800
any other last minute questions or comments

297
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,240
it's a beautiful practice it can take a little while at first could be clunky

298
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:27,839
i'll tell you that i learned this practice years ago when i was going through the teacher training at

299
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:32,880
stanford seacare center for compassion and

300
00:47:32,880 --> 00:47:40,000
what is secure center for compassion and altruism research and education that's what it stands for a mouthful it's going

301
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:45,520
through the teacher training it was nine months and this is when i really got to

302
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,960
practice this and and at first it was like okay all these pieces and then at some point

303
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,160
it really became a lie for me and i loved it i just loved it became my

304
00:47:56,160 --> 00:48:01,839
primary practice for a while i just love the sense that wow with each breath

305
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:07,040
with each breath it's i'm holding witness there's a sense of

306
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:14,319
goodness i'm not turning away from suffering and it just became easy it was just compassion practice justice feel

307
00:48:14,319 --> 00:48:20,960
like it happened on its own so when it when it gets going can be really really

308
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,960
lovely so so it's seven o'clock

309
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:32,079
and we have come to the end of the session then click i see your hand if

310
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:37,280
it's really quick it's yes no

311
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:44,319
you tell me i just wanted to add really quickly

312
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:50,079
because what you're saying my original buddhist practice preceded all of these events

313
00:48:50,079 --> 00:48:57,280
and was i worked on the sutra of compassion for two years so there you go there you go exactly

314
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:04,160
yeah beautiful thank you for that so yes may compassion

315
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:09,200
be our way of being may it support us

316
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:14,240
to meet the challenges in our lives not to turn away and also the suffering in

317
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:20,480
