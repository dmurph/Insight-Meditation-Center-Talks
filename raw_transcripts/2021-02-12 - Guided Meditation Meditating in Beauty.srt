1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,160
so good day to everyone

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:13,519
here we are together and from all over and

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:20,960
uh gathering ourselves for this period of meditation

4
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,000
and this topic they one of the subjects is practicing with

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:39,120
mental activity which has been my most common translation for sankara

6
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,800
sometimes translates mental formations

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,120
and

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,760
so say this about it is that these mental activities that we have as we practice as we settle in

9
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,840
meditation as we begin to let go of attachments and clinging

10
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:15,360
the direction the mind is going is to becoming beautiful to have a beautiful mind and that

11
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,479
the feeling that not just a feeling the experience or the quality

12
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,200
of physical calmness that happens when the body relaxes and the quality of mental relaxation

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,360
tranquility that comes as the mental activities calm down it's referred to in the

14
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:40,079
buddhist tradition as beautiful as beautiful qualities of mind

15
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:45,759
and that many of these uh factors of mine that start coming into play

16
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:52,840
uh that of faith and and engagement with the practice

17
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:59,759
attention wisdom mindfulness samadhi all these things

18
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:05,040
they're they're considered beautiful qualities of the mind

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,479
and so we are we one of the orientations for

20
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,680
meditation one of the things to kind of

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:23,360
kind of be considering is how do you practice how do you do the activity of meditation

22
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:32,160
so it itself has some quality of beauty or maybe another word is harmony

23
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,519
i love the hopi indian the indigenous people of new mexico

24
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:43,280
the i love their expression of walking in beauty

25
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,800
so what would it mean to engage the mind in beauty

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,640
and sometimes there's such a strong orientation towards avoiding which what is not beautiful

27
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:00,400
what's difficult or painful or there can be a lot of criticism in the mind

28
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,480
self-criticism and a lot of judgments that whatever the mind is doing wandering often thought is

29
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:13,440
somehow wrong or worse and maybe so but

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,599
but uh what we do how we show up to be mindful to be present

31
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:26,239
to be engaged with the breathing how would you do it if you did it in a beautiful way or in a

32
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:31,760
harmonious way because that's the direction that this

33
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,680
practice is going and especially with this calming of mental formations calming of the mental

34
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,000
activities we're feeling our way into a place of harmony or beauty

35
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:51,200
of peace of clarity of lightness of uh sometimes the ancient tradition

36
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:58,319
talks about a kind of a clean mind a cleansed mind

37
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:04,080
so for this sitting today maybe you can um

38
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:12,640
you can um orient yourself a little bit with um

39
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,400
what would it be like to sit here in beauty not because you're looking for it it

40
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:25,520
might be there it might be here but also because you engage in the practice that way

41
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:30,639
that the very way in which you are present the way very way in which you are

42
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,919
mindful is in harmony or is in beauty what would

43
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,880
that look like and i know it might be a stretch or it might be you might not have an easy reference for

44
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,919
this but i would suggest that you imagine you do

45
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:54,240
imagine yourself in this way and if

46
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:01,039
so to assume a meditation posture and even here as we get into as we take

47
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,000
the posture how would you do it

48
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:14,080
as if the activity of assuming your posture meditation posture was itself a movement

49
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:20,720
in beauty maybe in gracefulness

50
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:28,560
and maybe gracefully kind of rocking forward and back maybe slowly

51
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:37,520
maybe not sideways and then slowing down and finding

52
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,639
a balanced posture most balanced for what's available to

53
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:53,520
you with all the different challenges you might have and so your your posture itself

54
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,199
begins to feel like a small stepping stone to beauty

55
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,919
to harmony

56
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,840
and then

57
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:20,000
softly peacefully closing your eyes

58
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:26,880
and then what would it be like if you approached your breathing with

59
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:34,800
trust with care

60
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,319
with relaxation with some quality or feeling of

61
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,680
approaching your breathing

62
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:51,039
in a harmonious way or in a beautiful way

63
00:06:52,000 --> 00:07:00,840
what would your attention what would attending to your breathing

64
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,400
be if you were attending in a beautiful harmonious way

65
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:22,800
and perhaps it could be that you invite your body

66
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,160
to gently breathe more fully

67
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:35,520
expanding the chest expanding the belly as you breathe in

68
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,599
maybe three quarters full so you're not straining

69
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,720
and perhaps allowing for a longer

70
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:59,840
peaceful exhale as far as it's useful to exhale

71
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:17,280
and then to as you exhale

72
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:26,720
to relax the body to calm the bodily activity of tension

73
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:41,839
holding contraction in the body releasing it

74
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,160
and letting your breathing return to

75
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:41,440
normal and then as you exhale

76
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:48,080
to also relax and soften the thinking mind

77
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:56,160
if the if you can recognize any tension or holding contraction

78
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:04,320
or hardness agitation or forcefulness

79
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,680
associated with breathing

80
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,839
as you exhale relax the mind

81
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,240
and if you can't relax it that's okay

82
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:36,399
perhaps you can recognize that awareness attention to the tense

83
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:43,040
mind is larger it's distinct and different

84
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:49,760
than the mind itself the activity and then hold the tense

85
00:10:49,760 --> 00:11:01,839
mind in the beauty of open awareness

86
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:38,959
and then entering into the body breathing breathing naturally and easily

87
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,200
with a very light touch not trying too much

88
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:53,200
seeing if you can attend to breathing in a way that feels harmonious even

89
00:11:53,200 --> 00:12:00,399
beautiful with its care its tenderness its openness

90
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:05,680
its willingness

91
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,959
perhaps with its feeling of respect for breathing

92
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,079
a reverence

93
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,839
for being here

94
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:34,240
and perhaps there's something in the breathing itself

95
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,639
which feels harmonious or beautiful pleasant

96
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,839
and to sit here

97
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:04,240
present for your breathing while attuned to

98
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:12,399
that which is harmonious or beautiful here and now no matter how small it

99
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:21,839
might be

100
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:30,639
if possible relaxing the mental activity of anxiety

101
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:41,160
mental activity of

102
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:48,480
discouragement or resentment

103
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,839
letting those settle and recede to the background

104
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,399
and in the foreground as you're sitting here

105
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,839
sitting meditating in beauty

106
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:20,639
some of them which might be whatever feeling of pleasure

107
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:27,279
well-being joy or happiness

108
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:37,839
that might be here right now breathing with it breathing through it

109
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:57,760
as you breathe is there any little place inside of

110
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:05,039
tranquility calmness peacefulness

111
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:17,440
a calmness of body a calmness of mind

112
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:22,080
breathe with that breathe through it

113
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:33,520
gently allowing that calmness tranquility to spread and grow

114
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:44,159
so that its influence perhaps a beautiful influence

115
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:50,320
can begin to move through you breathing in and

116
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:59,840
breathing out

117
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,840
so

118
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,080
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

119
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:52,639
looking inside of yourself to see if there's any

120
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,120
shift inside in the course this meditation

121
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:12,000
are you a little more settled if not more settled are you more

122
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:17,840
aware a heightened awareness of how you are

123
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:31,840
both the subtleness and the heightened awareness can both be seen as something beautiful

124
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,200
or you're more open more peaceful more

125
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:49,600
more sense of well-being have you learned something about your

126
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:59,840
own capacity to attend beautifully harmoniously

127
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:08,559
in whatever sense you have of an inner beauty or harmony or well-being

128
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:17,120
bring to mind some people that you know and imagine that they too have the same

129
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:21,919
capacity they have the potential for this

130
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:30,080
and that more than worldly success

131
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:37,200
that to experience this inner harmony this inner peace or beauty

132
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:41,840
is one of the great potentials they have

133
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:49,360
a potential which is not dependent so much on what happens in the world

134
00:29:53,120 --> 00:30:00,720
and perhaps you can very gently lovingly harmoniously

135
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:08,080
have the wish that in fact they could feel this inner

136
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:11,440
well-being and harmony

137
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,519
that they might know their beauty

138
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:26,559
and beyond the people you know even the people you don't know and the

139
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,799
people who are a challenge for you

140
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:36,960
how wonderful would be if they could stay closely attuned aligned

141
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:46,398
with their own inner harmony and beauty their own potential for an inner

142
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:55,600
well-being that is so ethical in nature because it doesn't depend on

143
00:30:55,600 --> 00:31:05,840
getting anything or making anything happen in the world

144
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:12,640
may it be that all beings

145
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:20,320
touch into their capacity for happiness may all beings

146
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:25,360
experience safety within

147
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:33,840
peacefulness within

148
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:44,320
a full inner freedom the heart set free at ease

149
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:52,480
this beautiful heart that we all share may all beings

150
00:31:53,039 --> 00:32:01,840
be happy

151
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,840
you
