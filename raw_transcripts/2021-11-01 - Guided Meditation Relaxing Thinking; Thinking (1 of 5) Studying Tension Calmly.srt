1
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:15,120
so good morning and welcome to our meditation monday

2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,560
morning meditation beginning of a new theme for the week

3
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,840
and we're continuing kind of in the ongoing

4
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,800
series on the basic foundations for meditation and the way i we teach it here at imc

5
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:40,640
and this week it's going to be talking about or working with practicing with thinking

6
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:48,879
and i'd like to use an analogy that is somehow you received a gift

7
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:57,280
of an amazing thousand-year-old clock with all kinds of gears very very

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,719
precisely made and sophisticated that as gears that keeps the time for

9
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:10,560
nanoseconds and seconds and minutes and hours and days

10
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,400
the years including the leap years and the cycles of the moon

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,840
the seasons and light and dark through the year

12
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,799
centuries so it's amazingly precisely made and sophisticated math and arithmetic and

13
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:34,560
engineering to make it all work and all the gears and

14
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,560
it's a great present to see in awe of it but then it turns out after working

15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:46,799
perfectly for a while one of the gears decides to

16
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,479
go faster than everything else and suddenly

17
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,000
the gears start getting confused and not working properly and and

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,360
we put under a lot of tension and and uh the whole clock doesn't seem to

19
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,319
work very well anymore it worked well for a thousand years but under your watch one of the gears started up to

20
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,400
go too fast so we as human beings are

21
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:22,080
even more sophisticated complex system then

22
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,599
such a complicated watch um amazing amount of

23
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:34,959
you know uh interconnected parts of the human being that all all have to work harmoniously for us

24
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,519
to stay alive even and uh it's kind of an amazing it's amazing

25
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,519
that we exist and all that it takes to keep us going all the interconnected

26
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:54,480
kind of complicated deep uh gear work of this biological systems

27
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:59,599
that we have and there's one system one of those

28
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,519
gears that if it works faster than the others it kind of begins messing it all up

29
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:12,480
and that is our capacity to become tense that anything that becomes tense

30
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:18,080
anything that begins working faster makes it difficult for everything else to go smoother

31
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:23,599
and if we can relax the tension then the whole system that we have begin

32
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:31,519
to operate much much more smoothly emotionally intellectually biologically physically

33
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:40,319
emotionally all these begin to kind of come into kind of a more of a harmony more working together

34
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:48,400
and um so relaxing in meditation is really good

35
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,840
it's possible to focus on it too much it's possible to in a sense get too relaxed

36
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:01,439
but in a sense then some some of those gears in the clock you know stop working if they get too too relaxed

37
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:08,400
but if there's identifiable tension in the system your in your body

38
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,239
it's really good to relax it it helps the whole thing so today we'll focus on relaxing the

39
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:21,680
body so that you prepare the ground so the mind can

40
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:27,520
relax the thinking mind and i use an expression called the thinking

41
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,759
muscle and this is the the activities of the mind that are

42
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,120
constructing and spinning out thoughts and

43
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,840
our brain is also a complicated neurological event and when there's tension there and

44
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:53,919
something's working too fast there that also kind of messes up the whole neurology of it all the mind

45
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,040
and that thinking muscle is uh you identify it by the physical

46
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,240
manifestation of thinking and if there's a lot of tense thinking

47
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:11,039
the jaw might be tight the eyes might be locked the forehead might be scrunched there might be a lot

48
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:17,600
of whirling and agitated energies in the skull and the area of the brain the brain itself might feel contracted and

49
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:24,000
tight it might be other parts in the body that get activated the muscles of the hands even or the

50
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:29,039
shoulders the belly and all those together i call the

51
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:35,039
the the thinking muscle especially the ones that are up in the head

52
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:41,039
so at some point to recognize the physicality of this and then relax so

53
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,800
so assuming a meditation a posture and

54
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,800
seeing if you take a posture that allows you to be alert but also to

55
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:02,080
be sensitive be aware of where there's tension in your body

56
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:09,360
and the upright cross-legged meditation posture

57
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:14,560
it's not required or needed for meditation but it has some advantages

58
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,478
and one is that it is a a posture that can reveal unnecessary tension

59
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:30,080
while not kind of relaxing and giving up or just or collapsing from it

60
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:38,080
to stay upright reveal where it's tense in a healthy way and begin to relax

61
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:47,039
lowering your gaze relaxing your focus

62
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:53,880
of your eyes enclosing your eyes

63
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:09,120
and to enter into this body body and mind that we're here with for this minutes

64
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:15,319
taking a few long slow calm deep breaths

65
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,479
as you breathe in deeply really feel the global body whatever is easy to feel

66
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:30,918
of your body the three dimensionality of the body

67
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:42,880
in a long slow exhale just letting go relaxing softening

68
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:50,000
wherever in your body your mind lands where you feel there's tension

69
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,879
let it soften

70
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,280
breathing in and feeling the body exhaling relaxing

71
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,918
and then to let your breathing return to normal

72
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:22,960
and continuing as you exhale to gently

73
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:29,199
without ambition relax your body

74
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:37,880
exhaling and softening the muscles of the face

75
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:50,800
sometimes feeling a coolness in the face can help relax the heat of

76
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:59,079
tension maybe the coolness of the air around the face

77
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:15,040
on the exhale to relax the shoulders

78
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:18,680
softening

79
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:32,680
sometimes feeling the weight of the shoulders can help relaxing

80
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:44,000
sometimes shifting where your hands are if moving the hand someplace allows the

81
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,040
shoulders to not be propped up

82
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:56,200
but we allow them to hang more

83
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,600
and as you exhale to soften the belly

84
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:26,680
and maybe in the belly if you feel the warmth there if there is

85
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,720
perhaps the warmth of the belly can give a kind of comfort to support some

86
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,959
kind of relaxation

87
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:14,440
and then take a few moments to notice your thinking

88
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,680
for these moments you have permission to think

89
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,560
and notice if your thinking is fast or slow

90
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,760
forceful or gentle

91
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:51,160
if your thinking is insistent or at ease

92
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:07,920
and if you think in images is there a location for where those images occur like on a screen

93
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:13,519
if you think in words or an inner voice

94
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,480
is there a location where that voice is coming from

95
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:25,839
there doesn't have to be a location but if there is

96
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,360
sometimes it's possible to notice if there's any tension

97
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,639
in that area that location

98
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,839
there might be a physical association or manifestation of thinking

99
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:53,560
tightening tension pushing pressure

100
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:01,519
contraction something that feels stressful in the

101
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:09,920
body connected to your thinking and as you exhale

102
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:16,199
see if you can relax the thinking muscle

103
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:30,360
relax the tension in your body that you associate with thinking

104
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,959
if there is a location for thinking let the location get larger spread out

105
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:51,920
maybe like the surface of a lake that the waves get quiet the surface spreads flat

106
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,399
out to the horizon

107
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:12,000
sometimes a thinking mind has been working so long

108
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:19,600
that it's tired weary of all the ongoing the ongoing thinking

109
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:24,360
often repetitive

110
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:36,959
to relax any ways in which you are investing in your thoughts

111
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:43,120
relax even the interest that keeps you glued

112
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,839
to thinking

113
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:56,920
allowing thinking become calmer and slower

114
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:13,839
and then returning now to breathing

115
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:22,160
wherever you feel be breathing most pronounced in your body

116
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,079
feel the inhales and the exhales

117
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:47,759
and gently on the exhale

118
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:57,120
either let go of your thoughts or relax around your thinking

119
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,399
relax your thinking mind

120
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:12,320
feel your inhale riding the exhale

121
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,360
relax the mind

122
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,200
so

123
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:38,400
on the exhale relaxing the thinking mind

124
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:50,960
softening either feeling comforting warmth

125
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:57,200
surrounding your thinking mind or maybe you can imagine or feel

126
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:03,840
coolness that relaxes an overheated mind

127
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:58,880
and for a minute or so can you allow your thinking mind to

128
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:05,840
become quiet the kind of quiet you would have in a

129
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:14,000
library or a cathedral or a sacred grove of trees

130
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,360
a quiet where you would listen

131
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:25,520
better let your mind thinking mind become quiet

132
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,720
so you can listen better to your breathing

133
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,720
here

134
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:33,600
and then as we come to the end of the sitting not only are

135
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:41,039
we individuals finely tuned biological system

136
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:50,398
with all these interlocking gears so we are socially as well societally

137
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:02,159
it turns out the society works best too if the individuals are relaxed

138
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,000
free of tension and stress

139
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:14,799
and to learn something new about being relaxed free of tension stress

140
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:20,720
from meditation and considering how you can bring it

141
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,799
into your social world

142
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,840
how can you not sacrifice your ease

143
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,919
how could you learn to recognize stress as it begins tension

144
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:47,360
and remember how important it is to relax

145
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:56,440
and in doing so it's our gift to our society

146
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:05,520
a gift at least that we don't contribute

147
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:12,480
to the ongoing momentum of stress and tension that's so

148
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:17,679
much part of many of our societies

149
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:25,200
but rather we contribute peace calmness

150
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:30,158
care love

151
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:36,799
respect may it be that as we

152
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:43,919
come out of this meditation may we aspire that this meditation

153
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,398
supports us in helping make this a better world for everyone

154
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,840
may all beings be happy

155
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:01,760
may all beings be safe

156
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,720
may all beings be peaceful

157
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,640
and may all beings be free

158
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:27,280
[Music]

159
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,399
so

160
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:50,559
so so this is the beginning of uh the

161
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:57,120
five-week the five-day series on mindfulness of thinking

162
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,880
and we'll follow the pattern we followed over this last weeks of relaxation

163
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:11,278
recognition respect restoration and release

164
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,559
so there's a tendency in meditation circles to sometimes be frustrated

165
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:23,760
around our thinking or even worse to sometimes thinking uh thinking that thinking is our enemy

166
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:29,760
that it's a problem to think and if only if i didn't think then i could meditate

167
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:34,559
in mindfulness meditation we are

168
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:41,519
learning the art of bringing a

169
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,679
clear awareness clear attention to all aspects of our life

170
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,919
the inner life the outer life personal life social life and all that but in meditation

171
00:32:53,919 --> 00:33:00,159
particularly all the different parts that are become clear in the present moment

172
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,760
in the present moment in our whole

173
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:10,880
you know psychophysical system that we are

174
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,960
and so one of the things that will stand out sooner or later for some of us sooner or later

175
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:23,679
is how much thinking there is some days there's a lot going on in life and we have a lot of concerns and the

176
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:29,919
mind can be going you know really fast spinning out sometimes it seems like the mind has a

177
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:36,399
mind of its own we're just like churning thoughts and thoughts and thoughts and there's no chance to stop it

178
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:42,399
and so rather than making an enemy what we can do in mindfulness meditation we turn

179
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:49,200
our attention to be mindful of thinking but the art of that

180
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:55,360
is to make sure that the mindfulness is not thoughtfulness it's not thinking

181
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,880
about thinking some people will confuse mindfulness with thinking

182
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:06,559
that we're kind of thinking what's about what's happening in the present moment and then i'll talk

183
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:13,118
a little bit more about that tomorrow but um we're not having discursive thoughts we're not having commentary

184
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:20,240
interpretations we're not um it's not like you're having a conversation with yourself about what

185
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:26,240
you how you're thinking what you're thinking about there's a kind of almost a silent awareness that we're using in

186
00:34:26,240 --> 00:34:31,520
mindfulness that kind of silence that happens if you

187
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:36,878
have a dirty windshield in a car and you clean the windshield

188
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:42,240
the windshield now is clean and it's still silent it doesn't speak or say anything

189
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:48,158
but you see through it you see through that silence he threw that clarity to see clearly what's on

190
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:54,480
the other side so to the mind's ability to see or to sense

191
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,800
quietly um is the movement we're going and so to listen like you're listening

192
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:08,720
to your thoughts with a qui you're listening with a quiet mind even though your thinking mind is busy

193
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:15,680
um or you're feeling and some people find it very helpful with thinking to feel thinking

194
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:22,400
and in terms of relaxation this physical sensations that we can feel connected to thinking

195
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:28,800
can be really key sometimes it's difficult to see the physical connection between thinking and

196
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:35,440
the muscles and other times you can really feel it there are times when i'm particularly sensitive and quiet

197
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,040
that it feels like the mind is a puppeteer and it's all these strings

198
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,280
i'm the puppet kind of all these strings coming down from the thinking mind connected to all kinds of little muscles

199
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:53,040
in my body and they're all kind of like micro muscles are being pulled or tightened or released

200
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:59,280
as i think about different things some thoughts are really powerful

201
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:04,720
resentments that maybe i have at some point and i could feel my stomach pull up

202
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:10,480
or my shoulders go up or i think about the wonderful conversation i had with a friend

203
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:17,520
recently and something releases in the puppeteer as they relax the muscles and even though it was tense or holding but

204
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:24,000
in thinking about this nice conversation something ah that's good and i relax

205
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:29,520
and the more relaxed we become the more we can feel the

206
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:36,240
this micro muscle strings tugging and all the muscles that go on if we're really tense or really

207
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:43,119
preoccupied in our thoughts so we can't notice our body we haven't we won't have a clue what i'm talking about

208
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:51,119
uh chronic tension where there's no relaxation at all uh can become normal for people and they

209
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:58,000
just this is how it is as if you know this is the natural way to be um and there's no movement in the

210
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:03,119
chronic tension for anything to relax as people meditate most people find

211
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:09,680
slowly that the body relaxes um some of the surface tension that we

212
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:15,920
carry with us begins to soften and relax and the same thing with the mind

213
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,119
that there's maybe in the thinking doesn't stop but thinking calms down it gets slower

214
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:30,320
so uh i i was going to emphasize again that we're not making thinking the problem

215
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:36,400
but rather we're turning our attention when thinking is strong and when it kind of captivating

216
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:43,040
we calmly turn our attention to to be mindful of thinking itself

217
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:48,720
and the whole week will be spent talking about how we can be mindful of it in different ways

218
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:55,280
but what i want to emphasize today is uh we be mindful of

219
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:01,119
uh the tensions there the energetics of it the um

220
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:06,800
the stress the forcefulness the pressure the contraction the tightness

221
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:12,560
the insistence the hesitation the

222
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:19,119
closed down-ness the shutting down the dullness the numbness all these things can be associated with

223
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:25,680
thinking and and those things

224
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,520
need our care if we're distracted by the content of

225
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:37,920
our thoughts and thinking the content is what's most important we might miss

226
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:44,880
the underlying kind of tension that is much closer in actually to who

227
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:50,880
we really are it's kind of like a deeper layer that um a way to do our way into the

228
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,079
depth of who we are is not by thinking ourselves and remembering and figuring things out

229
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,640
their mind and and reinterpreting the past the way to really

230
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:09,440
have a doorway into the heart into the deep inner life is this ability to relax

231
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:14,720
so when there's thinking and we're really pulled in the world of thoughts

232
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:22,400
one of the things that be really helpful to learn to do when it takes time is to relax the interest in thoughts

233
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,560
to break the enchantment with the content of the thoughts

234
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:35,280
some of us have had similar thoughts over and over and over again for years

235
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:41,280
the amount of repetition that goes on in many people's minds is kind of astounding if people could hear any of

236
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:49,119
us how often we think the same thing they would wonder about you know our sanity or something

237
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:56,000
it's normal enough to be repetitive but it's also not necessary but what's interesting for a meditator

238
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:01,760
is to recognize that part of the reason is a lot of repetition part of the reason why there's

239
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:07,920
often oneself is a central character or centrally involved in their thoughts

240
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,960
is that we're there's an uh intense interest in

241
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:22,000
the content interest in self and me myself and mine and so that interest that investment

242
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:29,040
can be felt distinct from the content of what we're thinking about

243
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,640
sometimes i've had the feeling in my mind that i'm glued to my thinking and i could feel the glue or i could

244
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:39,680
feel the bungee cord pulling me in to it close by

245
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:45,280
uh and if it no matter what it doesn't matter what i'm thinking about i can feel the glue or the bungee cord or

246
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:51,280
something that's there and and then to feel that tension

247
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:56,480
and sometimes you can relax it but sometimes we can't relax the tension

248
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:01,839
the physical tension the mental tension and you can't relax it as a will as in

249
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:08,160
something we do but here's a real key to really long-term mindfulness meditation to

250
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,839
really find your way with it and that is it really helps if you have a willingness

251
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:18,960
to allow yourself to be tense allow yourself to feel the stress

252
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:24,800
the contraction the pressure as if it has permission to be there it's

253
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,720
okay but hold it in awareness and i have i love the image of two

254
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:37,760
cupped hands that come underneath where awareness and mindfulness is like two cupped hands that gently come along

255
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:44,160
and hold the tension hold the stress uh kindly supportedly

256
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,400
and and learn the patience you can do that forever because some of the tensions that we

257
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:58,400
carry within us are not really amenable to being directed or told to relax

258
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:05,040
or we in charge that's just one more time sometimes one more insult that we're in charge we're going to do

259
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:11,359
something to this whole wonderful system we have but if we can come with respect and care

260
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:16,640
and kindness and say okay here i am i'll be with you forever long

261
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,319
it takes and um and then uh and then

262
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:27,520
amazingly uh things begin to shift under that kind of attention

263
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:34,480
something maybe something unexpected begins to relax something unexpected softens

264
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:42,160
and um and our job is to bring bring that attention that is soft the attention that is kind and caring

265
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:47,680
and the attention that's slow the attention is not in a hurry or

266
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:54,480
insistent the attention that's not um forcing the issue or the attention which

267
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,760
is not tense so relax

268
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:06,000
learn about your attention become a student of your attention

269
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:13,680
maybe before you can relax you have to really recognize and get to know it and chances are that for most of us

270
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,440
there's more tension through the day than is necessary and so to study the unnecessary tension

271
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,920
and stress that's there in the body and the mind and so in the next 24 hours in

272
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,119
preparation for the teachings tomorrow you might think of yourself more of a

273
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,119
student of tension than a student of relaxation get to know it well

274
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:43,839
but if you feel like you know it and recognize taking time to know it then if it's easy to relax please do

275
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:49,280
and uh and maybe maybe this can be a fun day of uh

276
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,520
of studying and hanging out with tension and relaxation and

277
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:01,680
and see what happens if that's the subject of the day the theme of the day for you

278
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,480
and then we'll continue tomorrow and in some ways this series i'm doing

279
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:14,319
with starting with breath and body and emotions last week and now we're thinking each of

280
00:44:14,319 --> 00:44:21,040
what proceeded is building up towards our capacity to really work with thoughts so work

281
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:27,680
mindfulness thinking is not meant for people for beginners but really have the foundation of these earlier types

282
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:36,240
and then what i'm going to talk about through the week is also builds on what proceeds proceed so the relaxation

283
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,079
is supports what i'm going to talk about tomorrow and so forth so

284
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:48,480
so i say all this with the idea that

285
00:44:48,839 --> 00:44:54,319
um i'm not expecting you to be able to do all this suddenly like if you're a

286
00:44:54,319 --> 00:45:01,680
brand new beginner but really it builds on the skills and the understandings that have been growing

287
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:07,520
by ongoing meditation practice so hopefully that's the case and

288
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:14,839
that this is supportive and i look forward to tomorrow thank you
