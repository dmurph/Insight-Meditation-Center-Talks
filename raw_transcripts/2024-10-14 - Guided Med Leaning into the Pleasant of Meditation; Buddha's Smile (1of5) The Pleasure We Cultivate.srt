1

morning to those on the west coast here but good day and welcome good

3

afternoon good evening to people signing in from all

4
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:31,359
over say good morning those on the west coast here

5
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:43,120
and I see some friends good morning Richard and Cindy and many others

6
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,640
friends old and new Julie good morning and thank

7
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:57,520
you for your support lovely to see everybody checking

8
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:01,640
in greeting one another

9
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:20,960
and it's seven here on the West Coast so we'll get

10
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:30,840
underway and before we sit together I'll introduce uh a theme for the week

11
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:40,720
sort of following on and inspired by Kim Kim's uh Kim's theme last

12
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:48,079
week which she shared with me uh the other day a a theme I'm going to call the five

13
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:55,159
knowledges or the five understandings and I thought to myself this morning oh that's kind of a

14
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:02,079
technical sounding thing and uh uh it's too late probably now to change it with

15
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:10,920
the uh people who title the week's talks but I think I want to call it the Buddha

16
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:17,560
smile I don't know if you've noticed this you probably have but Buddhist

17
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:25,519
statues like this one here uh very frequently show the Buddha

18
00:02:25,519 --> 00:02:32,760
with a a smile sort of a mysterious you could say Mona Lisa

19
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,640
smile and uh I've always kind of been curious about that

20
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:46,879
smile and I think this week we could we can we can explore aspects of the meditation five

21
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:54,120
and number that arise as as part of the meditation practice that uh bring sort

22
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:02,720
of an inward contentment and with it sometimes an inward smile and sometimes a smile that that uh is expressed on our

23
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,040
on our faces or in our spirit both in the meditation and

24
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:15,280
through the day so I'll say more about the theme it's five understandings or five

25
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:23,680
knowledges uh as we go the first one of them I'm going to call something like

26
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:32,319
the um cultivating the pleasant and even the pleasure me in the

27
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:39,239
meditation so let's sit bring our attention Inward and downward maybe

28
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:44,680
closing the eyes if that feels comfortable bringing the eyes into

29
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,920
relaxed um sort of middle distance if one wants

30
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,439
to keep them open and let some light

31
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:04,000
in and what we'll bring our attention to as we settle in as we make contact with

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,319
the breathing or with the body with whatever object of meditation

33
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,840
we take as our first connection with the Here and Now

34
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,238
of our

35
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:27,479
experience we can bring our attention to the Pleasant in the meditation

36
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,280
it can feel quite easeful bring us to rest bring us to

37
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:45,400
ground can Center us and ground us this meditation practice and this bringing of

38
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:51,600
the attention directing the attention inward downward

39
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:12,680
sometimes we characterize the

40
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,919
meditation it's qualities and perhaps it's objective as

41
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,520
as ease or

42
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,960
easeful and even if it's incremental marginal even if it's just greater ease

43
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:41,560
for this moment greater ease than when the mind is busy planning remembering

44
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:48,479
Fring thinking about other people thinking about ourselves casting itself into the future looking into the past

45
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:57,080
again all useful qualities of Mind none of which we seek to stamp out or root

46
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:05,120
out as we cultivate an inner calm and peace and

47
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:12,560
ease and maybe today we can connect in this ease even if it's just a greater

48
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:20,639
ease we can notice that it's Pleasant and even that it's

49
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,360
pleasurable and this is a deep aspect of this practice that this

50
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:33,280
pleasure that comes in the medic meditation isn't to be

51
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:42,440
feared the Buddha encourages us throughout the texts on which we base our practice to

52
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:47,599
cultivate this this pleasantness this pleasure of

53
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:55,599
the meditation practice isn't to be feared but rather to be

54
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:04,000
cultivated why because it's an uncomplicated simple

55
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:11,639
pleasure it's not sticky it doesn't entangle us it doesn't rest on external

56
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:18,800
conditions it rises from within and it's a deep knowledge a deep

57
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:26,800
knowing a deep understanding that comes with the cultivation of the meditation practice that this contentment this

58
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:34,360
ease this is wholesome it leads

59
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:44,080
onward it points toward Freedom we can trust it we can rest in

60
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:51,960
it as we do so as we rest in it as we become comfortable with

61
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:01,440
it it becomes stronger this is how it's cultivated

62
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:08,960
so just rest easy in this today whatever pleasantness comes whatever ease

63
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,840
comes it's part of the path it supports our

64
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:19,879
practice it has benefits now in this

65
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:25,319
moment provides a pleasant abiding in the here and

66
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:32,680
now and it bears fruit in the

67
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
future

e e

106
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:46,559
so as we rest in the

107
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:53,600
meditation and pretty much no matter what's happening in the

108
00:28:55,440 --> 00:29:02,039
meditation whether the mind is busy preoccupied with the day to come or the

109
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:07,600
day past we can seek

110
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:15,440
out any greater ease that comes with the meditation and enjoy it

111
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:26,398
fully confident in the knowing that this pleasantness of the ease is

112
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:33,919
wholesome and that in addition to providing a benefit for us personally in the in the

113
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:40,799
Here and Now of the meditation that cultivating it results

114
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:46,759
in skillful action and and benefit to

115
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:54,600
others so we can bring the meditation to a close with this with this idea that we

116
00:29:54,600 --> 00:30:02,880
cultivate the meditation for our own benefit and we share that

117
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:09,639
benefit the ease we find in the meditation the pleasantness the pleasure

118
00:30:09,919 --> 00:30:16,679
even provide a quietness in the mind

119
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:23,720
that is useful to us as we meet the world meet others in it

120
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:38,200
so let's share the benefits of our practice confident in the knowing

121
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:44,080
that far from depleting the benefits to ourselves when

122
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:51,399
we share the benefits of the practice it increases the benefit for all

123
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:57,639
beings may all beings benefit from this ease may all

124
00:30:57,639 --> 00:31:05,039
beings know this ease for themselves may all beings be free

125
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:16,279
[Music]

126
00:31:38,679 --> 00:31:44,600
welcome again everyone good morning I hope you're

127
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:49,679
well good afternoon good evening if those are the appropriate salutations

128
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:56,399
where you are and I'd like to devote the teaching

129
00:31:56,399 --> 00:32:02,960
this week to uh sort of an unusual and

130
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:10,720
obscure teaching that that comes through one of the more obscure

131
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:19,039
texts that underg our practice that refers to something called the five knowledges or the five

132
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:24,679
understandings and as I said at the outset today that seemed to me as I

133
00:32:24,679 --> 00:32:31,880
reflected this morning sort of a technical design ation and so I also want to think of the teachings this week

134
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:39,639
as being about the Buddha's smile when we see representations of the Buddha here's

135
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:45,039
one here for example here's another on the I guess that would be the far right of our

136
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,200
screens of the Buddha resting preparing for his final

137
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,279
Freedom Parana the Buddha has a smile gentle Mona Lisa

138
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:02,360
smile that plays on his features

139
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,440
and perhaps the smile comes from understandings that grow with the

140
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:13,600
meditation practice and in this text from which I draw these teachings and

141
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:20,639
I'm going to quote with some some Liberties taken with the

142
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:27,519
poly the Buddha encourages us to develop the meditation and saying develop your

143
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,840
med meditation practice deepen your meditation practice

144
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,360
and as your practice deepens and this isn't an encouragement it's a statement of

145
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:44,720
fact that as the meditation practice deepens there will be five knowings

146
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:50,559
understandings knowledges if we have to give it a noun uh that will arise

147
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:57,159
naturally as part of the practice the those gathered to hear this

148
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:03,320
teaching ask what five and five are shared and I'll share them in turn this

149
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:11,079
week but the first one is this and again here I'm um working with the with the

150
00:34:11,079 --> 00:34:16,118
language to express it a way that I think is

151
00:34:16,119 --> 00:34:23,000
useful for us today I mean here today says this this

152
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,398
meditation is pleasant and pleasurable now and it results

153
00:34:29,399 --> 00:34:35,079
in benefit in the future so let's let's unpack that a

154
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:42,599
little bit in the next few minutes and before sort of getting into this

155
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:47,960
specific idea of the pleasure of the meditation and cultivating it instead of

156
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:56,320
fearing it um there's an important um use of words

157
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:01,400
right here at the at the in the in the beginning that as our meditation

158
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:09,480
practice deepens these understandings arise all by themselves and for

159
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:14,520
ourselves so um this is the mechanism by which or

160
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:20,480
one of the mechanisms by which these teachings um come to us from the

161
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:25,640
meditation practice from our own experience from our own

162
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,119
internal uh meeting of our experience instead of something that is um comes

163
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:38,040
from outside through a teacher through a reading this is a reminder that the

164
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,320
meditation practice is primary and that we can trust it to provide all the

165
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,000
teaching we need and it's useful to have guidance that's why we're here in part

166
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:54,960
today um with together right with spiritual friends with companions in the

167
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:00,240
path and with teachers um and yet the injunction here

168
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:06,680
the encouragement here is to pay attention to what happens naturally what arises naturally in each of our

169
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:12,880
experiences in the meditation itself so this idea of a pleasant

170
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:18,200
abiding now with beneficial results in the future runs throughout the teachings

171
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:24,680
about the meditation that it's not only something that's pleasurable and uh even

172
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:30,599
Blissful in in the meditation but something that has future benefits at

173
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:35,960
well let's let's focus on each of these two briefly

174
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:41,040
um the idea that the meditation is pleasant and even pleasurable I

175
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:48,280
introduce other teachers introduce with a certain um hesitance

176
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:55,160
because we sometimes um are afraid of

177
00:36:55,160 --> 00:37:01,240
pleasure that uh we some sometimes are not sure how it fits into the practice

178
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:08,200
how it becomes or can be part of the path of practice and there can be a shying away from some of the pleasant

179
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:14,119
that arise in meditation I laugh because you know a lot of times we look for trouble in the meditation we're like

180
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:21,640
yeah you know here's this difficult thing arising here's this difficult thing arising we look for H we look for

181
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:27,720
the suffering suffering comes to our attention as it as it as is natural and

182
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:32,920
as it should and yet there's also in the pleasantness of the meditation there's

183
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:39,440
also path in other words sure understanding suffering and its arising

184
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:45,000
is critical to having a path away from

185
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,920
suffering knowing the pleasure of meditation the pleasantness of the ease

186
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:59,079
of mind the openness of mind the collectiveness of mind that develops in the meditation as it deepens this too is

187
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:03,040
part of the path

188
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:09,560
and just to make sure that it doesn't sound like

189
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:18,599
it's just me saying that I want to quote the Buddha who says in several places but in one

190
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:24,160
particular discourse that I love says this this pleasure this ease of

191
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:30,480
meditation I call the pleasure of letting go the pleasure of separating

192
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:36,160
ourselves from the world of mental activity and regular daily

193
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,200
life the pleasure of seclusion the pleasure of Peace pleasure of the

194
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:48,680
meditation the pleasure of being awake in the world and then such pleasure should be

195
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:55,359
cultivated and developed and should not be feared this is very strong encouragement

196
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:01,760
and in providing this encourage encouragement the Buddha is basing it on his own experience of becoming

197
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,960
awake many of you probably know this story but the Buddha after years of

198
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,480
seeking different paths working with different teachers to in particular that

199
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,599
we know of um among other practices does

200
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,640
a lot of practices of aestheticism privation starvation um living with very

201
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,520
few clothes being open Living Without Shelter living with very little

202
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:36,000
food and eventually realizes that none of these practices seem to lead toward

203
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,800
the freedom that he seeks and one day sitting under a rose

204
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:48,000
apple tree he falls into a deep meditative

205
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:54,680
state of the sort that we cultivate in our practice and he realizes ah this

206
00:39:54,680 --> 00:40:01,800
pleasure that comes with the meditation it's not dependent on external conditions it arises from within it can

207
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,920
be trusted and it leads toward Freedom it's part of the

208
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:15,400
path and there's a bunch of reasons why this might be so but I'll just give you one since our time is

209
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:21,720
short um this is so in part because our brains and our bodies are

210
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:29,319
very oriented towards pleasure for good reasons and reasons that sometimes come complicate our lives

211
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:36,520
and if we can find and develop in our meditation practice Pleasures that are wholesome Pleasures that bear fruit in

212
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,640
skillful action in the world those can be cultivated

213
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:49,720
safely and the beauty of the pleasantness the pleasure the ease that come with the meditation is that if we

214
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,920
bring it to attention and if we rest in it we can see we can understand it's a

215
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:02,160
knowledge it's a knowing that arises from within the meditation itself we can understand that it's not sticky it

216
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,440
doesn't have the complications and entanglements that other Pleasures sometimes

217
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,960
do you'll notice for example that although it's very pleasant we don't want more of it in

218
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:20,160
quite the same way that we want more chocolate or more you know um

219
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:28,200
more um more um more PE experiences of

220
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:36,160
various kinds let me let me put it that way to cover a broad range of activities behaviors

221
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:42,200
substances uh and the like and so that knowing going oh this

222
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,839
this pleasantness of Mind of body this restfulness this groundedness this

223
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:54,200
centeredness this collectedness of mind this Stillness of mind with a feeling of

224
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,240
well-being this can be trusted this is part of the

225
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:04,599
path this does seem to lead toward greater Stillness greater

226
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:12,319
ease the more it's rested in and the more it's thus cultivated the more it leads onward

227
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:19,800
toward the sort of ultimate peace the ultimate freedom of of this

228
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:25,359
path so in a way that's the pleasant abiding in the here and now that this

229
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:31,400
phrase speaks of a pleasant abiding in here that produces produces yields maybe

230
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:38,880
is better yields gives way to yields beneficial results in the future and

231
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:46,599
this is where I think as at the end of the guided meditation we can also um understand the

232
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:51,640
wholesomeness of this pleasantness in the meditation it's an interesting thing

233
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:56,720
that if in the meditation practice if in our practice more broadly we find ease

234
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:02,920
we find Stillness we find pleasure we find pleasantness we're a greater ease in the

235
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:12,040
world in the world of interactions with other beings perhaps in particular we are not seeking um the same kinds of

236
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:18,800
externally conditioned pleasures satisfactions and it makes it much more

237
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:24,599
likely that when we interact with people we can do so in a way that's free that's free of clinging that's free of

238
00:43:24,599 --> 00:43:32,920
attachment that's free of projection that's free of um that's free of

239
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:42,599
suffering one thing I think is important about this teaching is that important

240
00:43:42,599 --> 00:43:48,839
useful um inspiring is that it doesn't encourage us to do

241
00:43:48,839 --> 00:43:55,839
anything except for as it says in the orig the opening encouragement deep in our meditation practice keep going back

242
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:03,680
to the meditation practice and notice what arises naturally in the meditation what can be the knowledges that arise

243
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:09,880
without us having to seek them if we pay attention we can notice oh this feels

244
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:15,359
good now and it seems to have benefit later

245
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,680
and it doesn't suggest that it's linear or that we have to pay attention to that

246
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:27,359
we can trust that it has good effects later could be really useful to notice how that's so but we don't have to do

247
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,280
anything except notice you may notice that after and I think this is true for

248
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:39,040
a lot of us here after meditating for half an hour on a regular basis in the

249
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:46,119
mornings with Gil with other uh wonderful teachers my

250
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:52,359
colleagues in uh in supporting Gil in this way um that the day is easier and

251
00:44:52,359 --> 00:44:58,800
our interactions are I say easier I mean more easeful they may not be easier but

252
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:05,000
they may have greater ease in them and it is always the case it's it's

253
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:10,680
axiomatic at least in this practice that it's always going to be more skillful to

254
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:17,000
act with some peace of mind than not so we don't have to go looking for oh I

255
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:22,079
meditated this morning and then you know I I was my my speech with this my my

256
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:29,079
interaction with this person involved more skillful speech may be useful to notice that but we can trust that the

257
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:35,440
meditation produces that effect without our having to do very much at all except

258
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:42,319
return to the meditation and watch what it teaches us so I'll leave you with that thought

259
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:49,160
just watch what arises naturally as a knowledge as a knowing as a deep understanding in the meditation and

260
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:54,760
trust that and if it's Pleasant or pleasurable trust that know that that's

261
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:59,880
part of the path that it provides a Pleasant abiding in the here and now and

262
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:06,960
that it results in beneficial action and beneficial interaction in the

263
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,000
future so thank you all appreciate you being here together supporting one

264
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:19,079
another in our practice and I'll see you tomorrow morning take care
