00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:13,599
to be with you in this moment in time so

3
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:20,240
so today we continue with our practice with our exploration of the refrain

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:25,680
of the satipatana which turns out to be very

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,359
important very important as as we explored

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,840
yesterday the spatial expansion internal external

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:45,120
and today we explore the next part of the phrase of the refrain

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,360
which is expanding the temporal aspect which is the rising and passing away and

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,480
arising and passing away so

10
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:03,840
during the guided meditation i will um in make make some invitations bring some

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:08,880
invitations after we've settled uh with our body with the breath i'll

12
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,479
bring some invitations for us to explore this temporal aspect of

13
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,960
arising passing and rising and passing away as the refrain

14
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,640
invites and there's a lot more i'd love to share

15
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,479
with you during the uh the brief darmet afterwards because this this part if you

16
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:39,840
thought yesterday the internal external dimension was was important um

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:44,880
yeah the the temporal aspect is even more important for for reasons i will i

18
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:51,680
will explain is of of the highest importance in in

19
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:58,479
in our practice for the purpose of awakening and for the purpose of insight

20
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,520
so so

21
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:10,560
so let us begin let us begin our practice together let us land let us land in our

22
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
bodies

23
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,800

arriving arriving arriving [Music]

25
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,720
in this moment in time

26
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:54,160
and releasing relinquishing everything that has come before

27
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,280
relinquishing the past

28
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:07,280
relinquishing thoughts of the past as well as the future

29
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:14,720
planned thinking not that there's anything wrong with planning thinking in our daily life

30
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:21,840
but in this moment in time in this moment in time

31
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,239
we relinquish what's not needed

32
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:34,799
we give up joyfully we give up

33
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:44,080
ah we release entanglements in order to arrive here

34
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,560
in this precious important ever fleeting moment

35
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:03,120
of aliveness taking refuge

36
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,480
taking refuge

37
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,200
in our hearts

38
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:27,880
in the goodness of our practice and the goodness of coming together of our intention in this moment

39
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,960
ah and relaxing the body

40
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,759

47
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,600
onto the cushion or the chair your sit bones

48
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,560

releasing relaxing taking refuge

51
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,240
allowing the sensations the sensations throughout the

52

body to be prominent

53
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,880
the sensations of hardness softness

54
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:12,479
the contact points between the cushion

55
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,240
and our bottom

56
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,520
sensations of

57
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:42,400
coolness warmth soften this hardness

58
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:49,080
at our hands where our hands touch each other or our lap

59
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,399
feeling of warmth and coolness

60
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,320
in our face

61
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:58,440
maybe at the nostrils where the air rushes in and out

62
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,760
perhaps sensations of tingling

63
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,720
anywhere in the body

64
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,480
with a feeling of expansion of the breath the flow

65
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,760

66
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,360
internally pushing

00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,480
mindfulness turns to it tends to clearly knows

73
00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:00,480
clearly knows clear comprehension sample

74
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,399
a dance of sensations

movement

82
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:43,120
at the touch points contact points of the body with the cushion the chair

83
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:50,389
the hands the lips the breath [Music]

84
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:59,600
or just simply anywhere in the body these sensations so many of

85
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:06,800
them let awareness be wide

86
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:13,040
let awareness be why to notice to contain

87
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,240
this dance

88
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,600
and notice how sensations arise

89
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:47,880
let yourself be curious about sensations arising

90
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:06,000
see them witness them know them arising come into being

91
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,560
being known

92
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:22,680
and sensations passing

93
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:32,240
the knowing passing maybe for something that was prominent

94
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,680
minutes ago or moments ago

95
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,360
no longer sensed

96
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:05,800
uh

97
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,160
you can also open the sounds if you wish

98
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,960
of the sphere of awareness sphere of the sentence

99
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,039
sounds arising

100
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,279
sounds passing

101
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,559
sensation sounds arising in passing

102
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,240
river of experience constant flow

103
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,640
not constant

104
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,799
a waterfall of experience so many molecules of water

105
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,360
moving moving moving

106
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:45,360
giving the impression of the waterfall has a fixed thing but it's

107
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:51,120
always moving shifting

108
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,760
sensation sounds

109
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:06,440
pleasant unpleasant neutral feeling toned vaden

110
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:19,679
they're rising and passing arising

111
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,840
staying for a little bit perhaps and then passing

112
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:02,640
choosing one of the spheres i named sensations or sounds

113
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:09,679
or feeling tone for some people sounds are easiest

114
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:17,120
for some others know your own

115
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:26,720
proclivity to be aware of arising and passing of this phenomena

116
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:40,039
the aspect of the phenomena

117
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,240
choose one sphere let's say sounds and stay with it

118
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:34,720
not switching back and forth in the soundscape notice

119
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:40,280
the soundscape sounds arising and passing

120
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,200
arising and passing

121
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,120
of a phenomenon

122
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:37,760
arising and passing

123
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,520
of thoughts

124
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,760
a river of experience

125
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,279
and as we bring this sitting period together to a close

126
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,200
letting there be appreciation for ourselves

127
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:05,440
for having shown up as best as we've been able to letting go of any judgment

128
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:12,799
even if there was one moment of clear comprehension seeing arising and passing

129
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:20,080
that's enough it's planting a seed appreciating that you showed up

130
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:27,000
one moment is infinitely more than zero moments

131
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:36,720
and appreciating there is goodness in our intention in our practice in the seeds

132
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:41,840
that we sow individually and collectively

133
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,679
trusting trusting that inner goodness

134
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:54,640
and offering offering our practice offering our efforts

135
00:29:54,640 --> 00:30:02,480
our intentions our actions aligned with our intentions

136
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:14,080
today this period of practice to the benefit of all beings everywhere

137
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:21,200
may all beings everywhere especially those especially those

138
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:28,880
who are unsafe afraid feeling threatened

139
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:38,398
with a lot of suffering in war zones around this world of ours

140
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:46,240
offering offering our practice our hearts

141
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:53,760
to them specially not turning away

142
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,760
human beings just like us

143
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:08,480
may all beings everywhere all things everywhere including ourselves

144
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,278

147
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:36,360
be free

148
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:01,840
thank you thank you for your practice everyone

149
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,840
so hello again hello again everyone

150
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,600
so for today's practice we're continuing with

151
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,679
exploring the significance of the instructions in the refrain

152
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:10,960
of the sati patana

153
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:16,169
[Music]

154
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,480
invitations to practice with arising and passing away

155
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,399
of different phenomena the um the

156
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:39,440
refrain actually just for to remind us just as a reminder

157
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:47,880
i will put up again the structure and the structure of the satipatana

158
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:58,640
there are four sections just as a reminder and from the bottom there is body feelings or feeling tone

159
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:05,039
which you've already studied with guild the past few weeks there is mind and there's dharmas

160
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:11,358
and the refrain shows up between [Music]

161
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:17,839
or after every teaching after every teaching as an emphasis

162
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:25,280
and as i discussed yesterday and on monday the significance of the refrain

163
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,638
and you can listen to that again if you wish by the way this um drawing

164
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:38,560
this this is from piccolio's book and i have this uploaded into audiodharma

165
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:45,118
if you want to look at it it's associated with the talks from these mornings

166
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:52,800
and also the refrain itself the paragraph of the refrain i have it included

167
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,320
in the text of the the youtube if you go back to youtube

168
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:05,520
you'll see the text of the the refrain so so today we have come to this part of

169
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,680
the refrain which is one abides contemplating the nature of

170
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:17,119
arising in the body or one abides contemplating the nature

171
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:23,520
of passing away in the body or one abides contemplating the nature

172
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:31,200
of both rising and passing away in the body and again the word body here repeats

173
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,960
after the six sections having to do with the body the word is feelings for the section

174
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,800
after the feeling section and of course mind and dhammas so it's

175
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:48,240
not always the body it changes so so one contemplates the nature of

176
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:55,200
arising and passing away of all phenomena all phenomena and in the

177
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,880
guided meditation i was inviting you to to uh explore a rising and passing of

178
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,240
sensations in the body and also sounds

179
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:13,119
is part of the experience of the body too it's in that sphere it's in the sense spheres the first satipatana

180
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:18,720
also invited you to explore a feeling tone which you've already explored with

181
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:25,440
with gil feeling toned pleasant unpleasant neutral oh yes it rises and passes away

182
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:30,560
maybe we didn't focus on that i just brought it in and even thoughts you can

183
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,760
see gosh they just arise and pass away it's this stream it's a stream of

184
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:43,599
experience like a waterfall of experience waterfall of experience

185
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,119
oh so i'd like to speak a few minutes about the importance of this instruction

186
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,760
even perhaps maybe i would i would yeah i would venture to say even more important than the one we discussed

187
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:05,440
yesterday which already seemed wow this is important the internal external aspect instead of just being internal

188
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:12,560
so here we go so according to the discourses not seeing the arising and passing away

189
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:19,200
of phenomena is simply ignorance while regarding all phenomena as

190
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:24,800
impermanent is is knowledge and understanding is

191
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:29,920
wisdom so the one definition of wisdom

192
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:36,079
is seeing arising and passing away seeing arising and passing away as well

193
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:42,160
as seeing a rising and passing away which is impermanent on nietzsche

194
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:47,760
which uh also seeing a nietzsche

195
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,119
leads to seeing dukkha unsatisfactoriness

196
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:58,800
and also seeing the nature of the selfless nature and personal

197
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,200
nature of all things they're all connected and in fact in the sutas

198
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,800
there is a central importance placed on the direct experience

199
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,960
of seeing the impermanence of all phenomena all phenomena

200
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:22,640
it is so important it's of central importance and as some of you might be

201
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:28,400
new for you some of you know the teachings have heard of the teachings on

202
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,160
on the three characteristics anit duka annatta impermanence

203
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:40,400
unsatisfactoriness and and not self or selflessness or

204
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:47,200
ungovernability so many ways to translate that it's not no self by the way it doesn't mean that there is no

205
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,680
self yes there is a self it's not not it's not self it's not personal

206
00:38:53,680 --> 00:39:00,560
so so coming back to the refrain studying observing

207
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:06,400
knowing contemplating one abides contemplating the nature of arising

208
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:13,359
one abides contemplating the nature of passing one abides contemplating the nature of both rising and passing

209
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,480
this contemplation one gets to see experience impermanence

210
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:24,000
ah it's a river of experience it's just passing it's passing

211
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,160
and what is impermanent cannot be satisfactory

212
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:35,680
because it just changes all the time you can't hang your hat on it it's it's like it's

213
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,640
satisfactory one moment it's pleasant one moment it's not possible another moment it's it keeps changing so it's

214
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:47,760
unsatisfactory it's just doesn't give me lasting satisfaction

215
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:52,800
and whatever does give lasting satisfaction

216
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,560
what is unsatisfactory also it appreciate the selfless nature

217
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:03,599
it's not personal it's not personal so

218
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,880
so impermanence really is the foundation for realizing

219
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:15,119
dukkha for the other two the other two uh

220
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:21,280
uh marks of existence the three are called the three marks of

221
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:26,560
of existence and

222
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:34,960
the insight into arising and passing away is the key aspect of insight insight

223
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:41,760
knowledges that opens up the four stages of awakening again some

224
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:46,800
of you might have heard about the four stages of awakening the four

225
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:54,240
stages of nibbana the unfolding of those four

226
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:00,079
stages the progress of inside what's called progressing through those stages of

227
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:06,800
awakening what unleashes this progress or what is

228
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:15,280
significant what is really significant is insight into impermanence that unleashes

229
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:22,000
all the other key insights and in fact in the vibhanga sutta in the

230
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,520
samyuttan nikaya insight into arising and passing away or

231
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:33,200
phenomena is highlighted as the distinction between

232
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:41,520
a mere establishment of satipatana and its complete and full development

233
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:46,880
let me say that again that this point is so important that i want to say it again

234
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:53,119
so in the vibanga suta of samyutta nikaya they make a distinction between

235
00:41:53,119 --> 00:42:01,599
just establishing sati patana and its complete and full development

236
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,520
okay so the difference is establishing the four foundations of mindfulness for

237
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:14,160
foundations of awareness the establishing is becoming aware of the phenomena itself the

238
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:20,400
feeling tones the sensations the breath just knowing them right

239
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:26,560
but what leads to the full development complete and full development which is

240
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:32,720
bhavana bhavana is this inside interarising and passing

241
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,880
away a phenomena so it's not just phenomena itself studying the phenomena itself but studying that it rises and

242
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,319
passes away that leads to the full development that leads to awakening that

243
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:47,599
peace is needed

244
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:56,079
so that this highlights even further the importance of the refrain

245
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:02,079
that the teachings of the satipatana sutta may not suffice

246
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:10,160
on their own might not suffice on their own for the task of developing penetrative insight

247
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:17,040
but actually developing a comprehensive and equanimous vision of impermanence is

248
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,960
needed and quoting also from bikonago here but

249
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:29,920
but for us to really appreciate seeing arising and passing away is so important

250
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:38,079
it's so important so a couple more words and then wrapping up

251
00:43:38,079 --> 00:43:43,680
um it is said that when the buddha gave the

252
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:49,520
first sermon to the five monks who became fully enlightened in the anata

253
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:55,200
laka nasuta he act he did he took them through the same door

254
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:01,680
through the five aggregates uh which yeah you'll actually study in in a few

255
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:08,400
weeks and it's in the fourth satipattana the five aggregates of existence

256
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:13,599
which really cover all aspects all aspects of existence

257
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:19,040
so the buddha invited them to see the arising and passing away of all

258
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:25,839
aspects of the five aggregates of experience five aggregates of experience

259
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:32,000
after they saw impermanence then they saw that oh

260
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:37,760
what's impermanent cannot yield to you lasting satisfaction and therefore does

261
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:44,640
not qualify um as i me or myself and they they became

262
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:51,839
fully enlightened through this doorway so and and this seeing the impermanence of

263
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,839
the five aggregates is so important that by the way when you get again in a few

264
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:05,359
weeks when you get to the aggregates in the satipat as gil covers it you'll notice that the

265
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:10,480
arising and passing away to see the arising and passing away

266
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,520
isn't just in the refrain but it's also in the text of the sati patana sutta

267
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:22,480
itself it shows up in both places it's pretty cool so watch out for that when that comes

268
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:28,800
fascinating so so just the last word to say that

269
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:34,800
through this insight into impermanence we lose this assumption of

270
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,839
stability temporal stability of both the perceiver which is

271
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:46,079
the perceiver us and the perceived objects internal external there's no

272
00:45:46,079 --> 00:45:52,400
permanence it's it's always shifting and moving

273
00:45:52,560 --> 00:46:00,720
and in this way all notions of of stability in the way stability or

274
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,920
fixedness fixedness like i'm this way i'm always this way like oh the world is

275
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:12,480
always it just they vanish and one experience is a radical paradigm

276
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:19,040
shift when you see it in every aspect of phenomena no leaf

277
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:25,760
left unturned no stone left unturned and

278
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:32,160
a distinctive feature of stream entry which is the first stage of enlightenment

279
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:39,119
is this comprehensive realization of impermanence let me say that one more time

280
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:46,720
distinctive feature of stream entry is this comprehensive realization of

281
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:51,760
impermanence so cannot highlight the importance of this

282
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:59,280
part of the refrain strongly enough [Music]

283
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:07,040
these teachings are so sublime so beautiful and so freeing and they can

284
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:12,560
completely change our frame of reference completely change our frame of reference

285
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:19,839
and lead to freedom it's not just stories that are told for reserved for some special

286
00:47:19,839 --> 00:47:27,839
beings this can happen to us in this very life it can happen to us so trust

287
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:33,520
trust in your practice thank you dear sangha thank you for your

288
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:40,480
practice and thank you for your kind kind attention i look forward to being with you

289
00:47:40,480 --> 00:47:46,800
tomorrow to continue this exploration with sati patana oh one whole invitation

290
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:51,839
i always like to give you invitations for the day notice arising and passing notice

291
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:58,240
arising and passing internally externally notice arising and passing of all

292
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:05,599
phenomena thoughts preoccupations sensations sound just notice arising and

293
00:48:05,599 --> 00:48:12,119
passing internally and you'll see this perceiver and the perceived is the

294
00:48:12,119 --> 00:48:19,400
cc of experience thank you so much
