1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:07,480
good evening can we have the volume up just a little bit

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:16,039
Jim so that um I don't have to feel like I have to yell how's this is is the volume okay

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,640
back there

4
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:28,640
okay so tonight I'd like to start off with a story that uh we find in the

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,520
sutas that is like the early Buddhist literature and it's about the day that

6
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:40,280
the Buddha dies it's not about the Buddha so much but that's the occasion

7
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,719
in which this uh happens and it's it's quite something

8
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,920
the Buddha has is talking to Ananda many of you know Ananda is his attendant was

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:58,079
his cousin but also somebody who helped take care of whatever need to be taken

10
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,120
care of at that time and he tells his attendant I'm going to

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,560
die today I don't know what his mood was but you know just kind of matter factly I'm

12
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:16,479
going to die he he knew he was dying and asks Ananda to prepare the

13
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:23,479
place where he's going to die so Ananda it's between these two Sal trees and he

14
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:28,640
bring pulls together stuff a soft place for the Buddha to lie

15
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,479
down and then uh it said that the Buddha laid down on his right

16
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:40,759
side and then did some meditation things

17
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:49,439
and then died but before that happens Anand says to abuda no no no no no don't

18
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:58,159
die here in this place he says um this is uh Maurice

19
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:05,000
Walsh's uh translation which I just love it's kind of fun he says so Ananda is speaking to the Buddha and he's saying

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,599
May the blessed one not die in this miserable little town of waddle and do

21
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:19,200
right in the jungle in the back of Beyond so he feels like the Buddha should die in a place where there's uh

22
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,800
people that can sub uh help put on a funeral or take care of what's Happening

23
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,760
he didn't want him to just die in some kind of uh I don't know just the back

24
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,879
Waters or something like this you know what Jim can we put the volume up just a

25
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,519
tiny bit just so it's a a little bit easier for me and in the bag there too

26
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,599
so I think this there we go maybe that's even a little

27
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:51,959
too too loud no I think it's okay thank you Jim I'll say a few words and then

28
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,519
I'll say no can you put it down and then no no can you put it up just

29
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:06,080
right don't say said it there yeah so Ananda is saying you know don't

30
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:12,360
die here in this place and that uh Ananda says well why

31
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:19,360
don't you die in all these other places and he lists a whole bunch of other cities and he says well there's more

32
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:25,000
wealth there there's like these more affluent communities and there are supporters of the Buddha and then we can

33
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,000
take care of the funeral and treat your death in the way that it's worthwhile

34
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,080
for somebody of your stature to take care of the death and then the Buddha says no NOP

35
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,760
NOP I'm going to die here and he tells the story how this

36
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:49,159
place it's at the time of the Buddha is called kusara and then he tells Ananda

37
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:55,040
it used to be called uh kavati and there at that time there was

38
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:03,040
this righteous King who was the ruler there and and kavati as a city was one

39
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:09,079
of the really uh robust prosperous cities and the King

40
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:15,000
mahasa was a righteous King and then the Buddha goes into this long story about

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:20,359
mahasa about the king who used to live at the place where the Buddha was

42
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:25,479
dying and then I'll tell you like the punchline of the end of the story uh the

43
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:31,000
Buddha says that he was that King in a former life so well hold that however

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,000
you like so um this King mahadasa the story is and this is a

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,120
story right this is very much a story he said that

46
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,479
um he saw a sign and he described it kind of like a

47
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:54,960
wheel like something that was up in the heavens he saw a sign maybe a star a

48
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:00,039
planet I don't know and when he saw it he took it as a

49
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:05,520
sign that he should go that direction so the King goes the direction of uh where

50
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:13,520
this wheel in the sky is and when he goes he's bringing his whole army with

51
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,560
him so his his uh elephants his horses and the uh attendants so they go

52
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,919
marching off in the direction of where this wheel in the sky

53
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:31,240
is and then when he he would get to this place where he felt like he was right

54
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,919
underneath it and he stopped and the people who were in that

55
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:43,919
location would go up to the king and says oh welcome Your

56
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:49,520
Majesty we are your subjects please rule

57
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,560
us so you know there was like no Army there's nobody taking over anything there's no Wars or anything like this

58
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:02,479
he's just getting invited in and said oh great okay you can be our new king you can be our new

59
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:08,120
Sovereign and the um King replied he gave them some

60
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:16,039
instructions his instructions are do not take life do not take what is not

61
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:23,440
given do not commit sexual misconduct do not speak falsehoods do

62
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,720
not take intoxicants and then this those many of you will recognize those five or the

63
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:36,080
five precepts and then the sixth one slips in there is and be moderate in

64
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:42,080
eating and so the people did and continued to be a prosperous place and

65
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:48,759
then this whatever it is in the sky that the king is saying is in a different place so then the King goes to that

66
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:55,720
direction same thing plays out the people are happy he's there he gives them instructions and they are a happy

67
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,879
Community you know this goes like all four directions all four cardal

68
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:08,360
directions so then he finally returns back to the capital and uh he's feeling

69
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,720
I guess particularly happy and generous and like this was quite something now

70
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:19,319
his kingdom is really large and there's people who are his subjects who are

71
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:26,120
happy to be his subjects and he says suppose I were to construct Lotus

72
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:32,879
ponds for the people and he did so and these Lotus ponds were lined with

73
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:38,639
these four colored tiles this gold silver barrel and Crystal Barrel I had

74
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,479
to look this up is a crystal like an aquamarine colored

75
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:52,360
crystal and there's in the there's these descriptions of these Lotus ponds they're very beautiful and and then the

76
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:59,520
king thought well what if I put flowers lotus flowers in these Lotus ponds and

77
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:06,599
blue yellow red and white flowers and he does and then he said well suppose I

78
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,960
were to place attendance on the banks of these ponds to help those who come

79
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:17,680
here and he does suppose I were to place charitable

80
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:27,080
posts on the banks so those people who wanted food or drink clothes transport

81
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:32,399
or sleeping place or money that they could go and get what they needed so

82
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,719
here's a king who's been very generous he's R he's giving them some guidelines

83
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:45,000
okay we're going to follow the pre precepts we're going to behave ethically but he's really taking care of

84
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:51,839
everybody there's a certain uh amount of a good will and a good feeling in this

85
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:59,720
uh Kingdom and so some of the wealthier members of the Kingdom said um let us um

86
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:06,839
make this great donation for you this King we're happy to have you as our King and he says no no I don't need

87
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:11,920
that um but then he says so they they

88
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,279
say okay we we'll just build you a palace and they build him a

89
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:25,680
palace and then the um the king becomes even more generous you can see where this story is

90
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,160
going right it's like this uh this idea where this king is just Bec enormously

91
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,040
generous and um and then he decides that he also wants to take care of all the

92
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:44,600
spiritual Seekers of the time you know like the the Buddhists at this time were mendicant such that they were have going

93
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,959
Ms every day right they didn't have any of their own food they had to go to Ms to get food from everybody so the king

94
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,760
helped uh support the Buddhist well the Buddhist didn't exist at that time in

95
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:06,360
this story but you know all the people that would go in um Ms rounds and then he decides to go to this

96
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,519
Palace that uh the wealthy members of his community had given to

97
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:19,079
him and he decides to and he go to do some uh to meditate

98
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:25,560
and to do some spiritual practice and then he he does something what I think is kind of

99
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:32,079
remarkable he decides he has this thought he has this question this

100
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,399
reflection of what action is it the fruit and result that I

101
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:45,639
am now so mighty and powerful he's asking how did I get here

102
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:52,160
why are things turning out so well why are people generous to me and

103
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:59,680
willingly becoming my subjects how did this happen and so often when things are

104
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,720
going our way we don't ask this question we just think like that's just the

105
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:10,720
natural order of the universe of course things are supposed to be go well for me and supposed to be easy in the way that

106
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,360
I want right we tend to think that and whenever it doesn't go that way then something's terribly

107
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:23,320
wrong but I appreciate this king is like how did I get here why is it this

108
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,399
way and so he um

109
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,440
he says this um why am I now so mighty and powerful and this expression that

110
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:41,720
gets translated as mighty and Powerful is also how the uh Buddha describes

111
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,920
himself and his students so that we can maybe draw some

112
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:54,399
parallels of how uh this king is is with how the Buddha was with this kind of generosity and supporting people giving

113
00:11:54,399 --> 00:12:00,200
them some guidelines on behavior and yet um being very generous

114
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,600
but then the king he has this reflection well how did I get here and he comes up with some

115
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:12,600
answers and the first one he says is it's that there's three actions one was

116
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:18,519
uh generosity I started by being generous he took care of his

117
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:25,240
responsibilities like to the town's people and to the spiritual Seekers and

118
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:33,160
he had this where he thought about other people's welfare not just about you know acre more and more wealth or gaining

119
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:38,279
more and more power but instead was being generous to

120
00:12:38,279 --> 00:12:46,199
others and we Al also can recognize how this so many good things come out of

121
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:54,240
generosity hopefully we've all been recipients of generosity when people have other people have helped us out or

122
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,279
like with the shared their resources whether it's time or money or expertise

123
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:05,440
with us and we know that uh what a big boom

124
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,959
that can be to be able to receive that but also how it's a good feeling in the

125
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:18,040
heart to be able to support other people in whatever way that's appropriate for us and what station we are in our life

126
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:27,040
at that time or whatever we feel that we can um offer this movement of

127
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,720
generosity because there's this way that that uh generosity like supports relationships there's a kind a little of

128
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:40,320
a knitting together of a relationship if uh somebody helps you or you help

129
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:45,440
someone and relationships are so important right we can't walk this path

130
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:52,320
this life this path all alone I mean we can but there's a a certain point in

131
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:59,720
which we also need to be aware of our connections with others and take care of our relationships

132
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:07,560
so the king reflects okay so part of his uh generosity is part of why he has this um

133
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:12,720
all these good outcomes from his life the second is this word that we don't

134
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,639
hear so much in the in the teachings is this idea of this uh inner

135
00:14:19,639 --> 00:14:25,920
taming so I kind of like this word taming in some kind of way because uh

136
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:32,199
often not everybody but some people when they think about their youth when they were young they can can think about like

137
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:39,759
the wildness of their of their youth you know like maybe we did some things that were some irresponsible or a little bit

138
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:45,560
crazy and I remember uh you know I wasn't

139
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:54,120
certainly younger than I am now but uh there was a kind time when I uh lived on the east coast and um on Friday

140
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:00,160
afternoon we'd say you know we should go to Florida it doesn't matter that it's a

141
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,440
12-hour drive but you know for the weekend we should just drive down there

142
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:11,040
you know like some of this craz things that uh we would do just get in the car and drive and drive and drive and drive

143
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:16,480
and sleep I don't know it's just you know quite something just for the weekend to go down

144
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:25,600
there you know all of us have done things I imagine that's what we consider a little bit of a wildness in uh one way

145
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:34,120
or other and so we might consider this idea of inner taming the poly word is

146
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:39,759
dhama it sounds like so many other words but it's spelled differently than the

147
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,880
word that we sometimes say is Dharma and different than Danna

148
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:50,399
dhama and it's um this dama kind of is related to like

149
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,959
domesticate or so it's like the way to we domesticate ourselves it's this uh

150
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:03,000
inner taming and this way maybe we could say like coming home to ourselves

151
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:08,759
also and something that I appreciate so much about this is the it's not that we

152
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:15,240
have to like turn into something else turn into somebody else we don't have to

153
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:22,800
be like completely transformed into be somebody that we're not we get to be who we

154
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:30,160
are of course of course and the same way like you know

155
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:35,279
just what I imagine like if we were to tame a lion we're not asking the lion to

156
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:42,399
become an elephant of course not just to be a lion that um doesn't

157
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:49,120
eat the caretakers or something like this so if we're Lions we get to be Lions if we're

158
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:55,560
elephants we get to be elephants but there's this way kind of this inner taming this Taming of

159
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:02,040
the wildness which often just Happ happens naturally right as we mature

160
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:09,720
this is something that uh sometimes just as we get older we I don't learn more or

161
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:15,798
maybe run out of energy we don't want to do some of the crazy things we did uh when we were

162
00:17:15,799 --> 00:17:23,520
young but I think importantly we can also we can tame our Tendencies to be

163
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:29,600
harsh with ourselves some of this wildness maybe is this way which we beat

164
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:35,840
ourselves up thinking that we're inadequate or insufficient oh you fool

165
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,919
you idiot why did you do that you shouldn't have done that or some of the things that we tell ourselves so The

166
00:17:41,919 --> 00:17:47,880
Taming is part of like okay let's let that soften let's let that kind of like

167
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:54,160
uh drift away and not have so much Authority if that's a habit to berate

168
00:17:54,160 --> 00:18:03,480
oneself it's not something that's going to go away quickly but we can take some of that power the energy away from

169
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,840
it there's also a way which you can taming is like to tame this uh our

170
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:20,679
tendency to want to distract ourselves all the time or feel like we have to be entertained or um not be experiencing

171
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:25,880
anything unpleasant and I know that sometimes I

172
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:32,400
do this that uh when I'm feeling a little bit agitated or or like I I I don't know just a little bit out of

173
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:38,520
sorts and sometimes I find myself you like jumping into a little project and

174
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:46,880
maybe the project doesn't have the highest priority but it's kind of a way to distract myself or do

175
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:53,640
something instead of just being with the feeling out of sorts or

176
00:18:53,640 --> 00:19:00,520
uncomfortableness and just letting that kind of letting uncomfortableness be there

177
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:06,000
and letting it unfold instead of like turning away and getting absorbed in a

178
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,679
project or something like this so that was the second thing that

179
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:18,320
the king recognized of one was the generosity the second was this uh inner

180
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:26,360
taming D that he realized was supporting him having this good life and the third

181
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:34,320
is this uh Sam samyama also a word that's not so common

182
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:42,240
and we could think of it as kind of like restraint or some self-mastery

183
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:47,679
or self-control something like that but I'm

184
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:55,679
hesitant to use these kinds of words because then it feels like that we have to clamp down really hard on ourselves

185
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,960
and you know only be one way the

186
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:07,400
time but instead it's like to like

187
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:13,280
understand and regulate our responses like how we show up for whatever life is

188
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:18,960
bringing us so not just to be

189
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:27,320
uh just respond or we um yeah the word just slipped my mind

190
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:33,000
but not to when something arises not to just do whatever is comes first to mind

191
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:40,400
and is the easiest and the fastest and we don't care if it's going to harm anybody just do whatever we want instead

192
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:47,039
to uh recognize yeah you know in the bigger picture I think if I respond this

193
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:54,080
way it's going to be the most helpful for everybody myself others and both myself

194
00:20:54,080 --> 00:21:00,799
and others but this um idea of like maybe self-mastery

195
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:06,159
first I want to reiterate we are not machines so we are not going to be

196
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:12,960
perfect like all the time of course not but this idea of kind of like

197
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,720
Mastery kind of like and I wish there were a softer word I'm not maybe some self- proficiency

198
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:25,679
or something like this it's this way in which there's this

199
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:32,360
uh encouragement for us to cultivate the talents and skills that we

200
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:38,679
have you know to become the best versions of ourselves as I said we don't have to be somebody else or something

201
00:21:38,679 --> 00:21:45,080
else but to be the best versions of oursel and for everything I don't think

202
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,400
there are any exceptions for everything to have a certain amount of Mastery

203
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:58,120
requires practice requires practice I think many of you know that

204
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:04,679
um Malcolm Gladwell who had that book now I don't remember the title of the book but

205
00:22:04,679 --> 00:22:10,039
uh Tipping Point maybe I'm not sure that one where he said you know 10,000 hours

206
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:16,559
right to do something in which you have some uh Mastery so practice right just to do something

207
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:24,400
repeatedly so but in order to do something repeatedly requires that we set the intention and that we value it

208
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:33,279
and and we're willing to put in some diligence and some effort and some

209
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:38,520
patience so these three things that the King when he did this reflection

210
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:44,400
generosity entertaining and self-mastery

211
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:51,520
but something I want to build on this so maybe I mean like what I'm saying isn't

212
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:58,200
a surprise like okay we can imagine that and we have this expression what goes

213
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:05,039
around comes around so if we're generous it's not surprising that people are generous to us as

214
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:11,240
well and if we practice on our skills and becoming the best versions of our s

215
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:18,799
our life unfolds in the best way it can but I also want to point out what I

216
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:26,120
started to talk about a little bit earlier this whole idea of reflecting how did I get

217
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:32,320
here when things are going well reflect that because so often we don't do this

218
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:37,559
at least I don't do this as much as I think I ought to or should or could or

219
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:43,799
one of those words right somehow when things are going well I'm just kind of going along with what's going

220
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:51,320
well it's when the difficulties arise is when we often are thinking like wait what how did I get here and how can I

221
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:56,840
remedy this so I want to just say here's a

222
00:23:56,840 --> 00:24:04,679
short another little story that as it points to something similar and this is the Buddha this time

223
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:12,440
is talking to his son rahula and he's

224
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:18,039
uh in the middle of admonishing his son who had told a

225
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:25,440
lie and this is um you know not a good thing at all and I can imagine that the Buddha is

226
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:33,120
really disappointed but uh this is a little exerpt from this conversation that they're having and uh the Buddha

227
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:38,600
says to his son right here's a father and a son and the father is having this conversation with his

228
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:46,640
son and he says um rahula what is the purpose of a

229
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:53,440
mirror and rahula answers the purpose of the mirror is to

230
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:59,320
reflect venerable sir and then the Buddha says that's

231
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:05,559
right before doing acts of body speech or mind you should

232
00:25:05,559 --> 00:25:11,399
reflect during acts of body speech or mind you should

233
00:25:11,399 --> 00:25:17,279
reflect after actions of body speech and mind you should

234
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:23,360
reflect you should reflect did this act lead to harming

235
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:30,080
myself did it lead to harming others did it lead to harming both self

236
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:36,880
and others was it unskillful with the suffering as its

237
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:43,399
outcome and result or if while reflecting you know in fact

238
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:49,360
this act was wholesome and had Pleasant consequences and pleasant results then

239
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:56,880
the Buddha says then you should be happy and glad and practice in these with these

240
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:03,960
wholesome States so to unpack this a little bit that Buddha is saying okay reflect before

241
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,120
during and after acts of body speech and mind that's pretty much everything we do

242
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:15,320
right it's one of these things and so often in the teaching is

243
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:22,080
like okay well before you do it consider the consequences and while you do it you

244
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:31,039
know consider like okay does this seem right is this I mean the way I was thinking but so often afterwards we're

245
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:39,360
not necessarily reflecting did that turn out the way that I was imagining was there any harm

246
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:46,320
caused and if not in fact if there was this increase and helpful wholesome

247
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,520
skillful states can we be happy about that can we

248
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:59,080
have some Joy about this can we have some gladness about that as a support for our practice and

249
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:06,440
as a recognition that okay we're finding our way I kind of want to highlight that

250
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:12,840
this you know this joy and gladness is like an integral part of the practice it's not like we always have to

251
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:17,919
be you know buried down and like oh got to do

252
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:23,760
this and chastise ourselves when we don't meet up with the measurements we

253
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,840
have for ourselves but instead to notice like oh okay that was a good thing but I

254
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:35,200
did I didn't know nobody got harmed and there's a little bit more peace or ease

255
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:38,278
or freedom in the

256
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,960
world so there's this thing about like to evaluate the results of our actions

257
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:52,480
is kind of what the Buddha is pointing to in these are two different

258
00:27:53,720 --> 00:28:01,519
stories it takes it takes some real honesty and it takes some

259
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:09,640
maturity it takes some honesty that um because so often we want to think of

260
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:17,559
ourselves as somebody as being a good person that's not harming anybody or not

261
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:22,960
uh doing things that are UNH wholesome unskillful

262
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,000
unhelpful so it can be hard to see like oh yeah that

263
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,440
yeah that actually wasn't a good idea there's some obvious things that we

264
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:43,240
do where it's very clear that people were harmed but maybe there's some subtle things that we do that aren't so

265
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:52,880
helpful and can we recognize that and learn from it without beating ourselves

266
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:58,399
up sometimes is the tricky part sometimes we can fall into this tra

267
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:04,600
like oh I can't do it I've I'll never be able to get it everybody else can do it

268
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:11,039
but I can't you know there's some version of that but there's a certain honesty of

269
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:18,120
saying you know actually I see that I had mixed motivations why I did

270
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:24,320
that and I was only when I was thinking of doing I was only thinking of this one

271
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:29,559
motivation that made me look good and made me feel good but now now I can see I

272
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:35,200
also wanted people to notice me or I wanted

273
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:40,519
to undermine that person over there that uh I don't get along with in that other

274
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:47,919
department or the neighbor or whomever it might be or maybe there's this way in which

275
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:54,360
we will feel like that uh maybe the motive is maybe we just wanted more

276
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,240
attention or we wanted more

277
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:05,279
anything really and we don't often want to admit that to

278
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:12,760
ourselves so to evaluate the results of our actions requires a certain amount of

279
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:18,279
honesty that rather than trying to just preserve our self-image or and our

280
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:26,120
self-image may be a negative one so rather than like oh yeah of course I didn't do it right or it might be one

281
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:33,279
that's like Oh I'm a good person I do everything right but just to see no actually it was mixed here and what can

282
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:39,720
I learn from that and it also takes some

283
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:47,159
maturity is being able to recognize oh yeah okay this is some of my motives

284
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:54,559
actually aren't so skillful and um even though I really want to I'm not going to do this even

285
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:59,639
though I think it's going to make me look good I'm not going to do it because

286
00:30:59,639 --> 00:31:07,039
it can cause harm or maybe there's this way that

287
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:12,919
um the maturity is maybe just even to recognize that the the this Minds have

288
00:31:12,919 --> 00:31:18,360
kind like a committee inside with these different motives and these different um

289
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:23,720
pressures to behave in a particular way or to be seen a particular way and it

290
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:28,919
takes some maturity to say oh yeah it's not black and white I'm not black and

291
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:36,399
white I have a mixture of stuff going on inside just like everybody

292
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:44,559
else and so is there a way that we can learn to say you know what I'm going to say no to those things that aren't

293
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:51,880
helpful but not know in a way that's like we're going to repress are those uh

294
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:58,519
motivations that we might have that aren't so skillful or wholesome

295
00:31:58,519 --> 00:32:06,080
so much of this practice is uh becoming whole like inviting in all aspects of

296
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,760
ourselves and so the majority to recognize oh yeah okay I have this I

297
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:19,159
really dislike my neighbor's dog who is barking all the time and I often have

298
00:32:19,159 --> 00:32:29,200
ill will towards this dog for example and then just to recognize that

299
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,480
recognize that this when you are filled with ill will kind of like the tightness

300
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:42,240
uh there's a collapsing it say your life isn't getting better and maybe you're not harming with your actions or your

301
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:49,480
speech but there's this way in which in the mind this kind of like a this ill will can kind of

302
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:58,720
fester and can really undermine a sense of well-being that we might have

303
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:06,399
and so there's this way that maturity maybe I would say also is about

304
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:12,000
recognizing that our sense our self-esteem our sense of being an okay

305
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,600
person it's really fragile if it's dependent on always getting things

306
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,320
right because we're not always going to get things

307
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:31,240
right it's we're humans and we're not perfect we not completely

308
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:38,519
awakened I suspect if any of you were completely awakened you wouldn't be here on a Monday night You' be out there

309
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:47,000
doing whatever completely awakened people do so there's this way in that uh to

310
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:55,159
recognize there's nothing demeaning by re by saying you know what I made a mistake I did that action it didn't turn

311
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:03,159
out the way that I thought or maybe it did turn on the way that I thought and now I realize that that was my I had

312
00:34:03,159 --> 00:34:09,480
some unskillful ideas there's a way in which we can

313
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:16,520
recognize that like our dignity lies in just being able to recognize our

314
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,679
mistakes our dignity lies in just making a resolve

315
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:29,358
like okay I learned something there what can I do so that I don't do that again

316
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:34,919
or to have this uh to remind ourselves that

317
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:41,599
oh yeah I've learned this before when I've I've been uh encountered a dilemma

318
00:34:41,599 --> 00:34:51,000
on whether my coworker who irritates me no end but yet uh wants my help am I

319
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:57,000
going to help them or am I going to turn them into the boss or am I going to put them down I don't know there's so many

320
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,280
different things here that we could say or

321
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,560
do so this idea of reflecting after our

322
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,880
actions and the story of the King was kind of like this long story but uh the

323
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:20,800
Buddha wanted to point out kind of like the power of just recognizing oh

324
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:26,119
yeah how did I get here and then to finish this story of

325
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:32,599
King mahasa he was so generous with the Lotus ponds and the all these things that he was

326
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:40,760
given to this people he went uh into Retreat decided to practice and this is

327
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:47,000
the before the time of the Buddha so Buddhism holds that you can't didn't

328
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:52,520
couldn't become completely awakened but you became as awakened as a possible

329
00:35:52,520 --> 00:36:00,000
without a Buddha so he had this like the best possible outcome for his life after

330
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:06,440
this so to reflect after we do things and then to have some of the honesty and

331
00:36:06,440 --> 00:36:14,760
maturity to just recognize yeah that wasn't so great and to have some the

332
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:21,920
words p and Poma have some joy and some gladness when we recognize oh yeah that

333
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,640
was good that was uh that was helpful for others from myself or both

334
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,119
self and others that was that was the right direction to

335
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:43,640
go so I'll end there and I'll open it up and see if there's any questions or

336
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:57,240
comments this idea of reflecting maybe I'll just say I kind of

337
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:03,880
like that uh here we are you know thousands of years ago there's a little bit of a word play that still um works

338
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:09,800
today like what's the purpose of a mirror to reflect and we still have that in the mind you know to reflect in the

339
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:17,400
mind so something that worked thousands of years ago is still working today

340
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:41,400
so um my question is cuz of the three things um you the second was this the

341
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:49,318
the tame oneself and then the third was self-mastery what what would be the

342
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:57,599
difference this is a perfectly reasonable question so I would say that uh

343
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:03,880
entertaining is more about um I kind of I was using this word of

344
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:12,920
wildness so some of the patterns that we do that are not so helpful to diminish

345
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:21,240
the amount we do those patterns and so so that's more about to not do things that are unhelpful and then Mastery we

346
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:26,520
could say maybe to do things that are helpful so there you know really do we

347
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:33,480
need to make a distinction maybe not but uh in this list there was there thank

348
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,760
you anybody else have a comment or

349
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,599
question and I appreciate this idea of rejoicing uh when we have realized we've

350
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:54,520
done something well just like how the world would be different if people were happy when they did things well instead

351
00:38:54,520 --> 00:39:02,920
of always beating themselves up yes Peggy hey um I don't I don't think I

352
00:39:02,920 --> 00:39:09,319
have a question but um you said reflecting after you do something and um

353
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:15,280
and I've had a really good week um I've been in a better mood than usual I usually lean a little towards being

354
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:23,079
depressed and um just kind of happy this week and um and a few encounters that is

355
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:29,880
sort of my work that um it was helpful to people and and I'm just feel grateful for that but the odd thing is when I

356
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,760
think like how did I get here I haven't meditated in a week well here I am and

357
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:43,079
this morning but um so I thought that was odd and my classes I have a couple classes that are part of practice and I

358
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,280
haven't been attending to them either so it was like that's kind of weird but

359
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:56,280
maybe I don't know I thought maybe I was putting too much pressure with too many things on myself possibly and um I think

360
00:39:56,280 --> 00:40:03,960
you sort of said I gave myself more of a break because I was busy with other things so maybe that helped I don't yeah

361
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:10,680
there is a way in which having a regular meditation practice can be like this oppressive thing that we feel like oh I

362
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:18,200
have to do this and I don't know if the course is the case for you but there can be some benefit to like backing off a

363
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:24,200
little bit and you know being able to see things a little bit differently I don't know Peggy if that was yeah I was

364
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:29,319
thinking that maybe like finding the balance somewhere yeah thank you it's

365
00:40:29,319 --> 00:40:36,078
hard to fit everything in in life it is it's hard to fit everything

366
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:46,920
in hi um I really appreciated what you

367
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:52,680
mentioned about um how um if we sort of

368
00:40:52,680 --> 00:41:01,960
Base our sense of self on whether we succeed or fail at something it's sort of a fragile sense of self um and I also

369
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:07,000
thought it was interesting and really useful that you talked about how um our

370
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,359
Dignity should come from the fact that um we sort of have the ability to

371
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:19,560
reflect on our actions and um make better

372
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:28,200
decisions following that yeah thank you yeah great great thank you

373
00:41:41,839 --> 00:41:50,559
okay so thank you thank you all for your practice and I'm wishing you a wonderful rest of the evening thank you
