1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:10,200
welcome welcome nice to see you all seems like the volume is just a little

2
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:15,420
bit loud it's a little bit echoey can we turn it down just a little bit and then

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:23,420
I have to talk non-stop while you adjust them yeah that sounds good thank you

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,059
so happy MLK Day it's a day of service

5
00:00:33,059 --> 00:00:40,379
not just a day off but a day of service and I was thinking like wow what would it be

6
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:45,960
like if everybody actually did a day of service today something to support their

7
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,780
communities and whatever way they wanted like what a

8
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,379
what how many things might shift if we had a day of Americans

9
00:00:58,379 --> 00:01:05,220
thinking how they might support others and of course part of this practice is

10
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:12,119
about creating the conditions in which we can import and serve others

11
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:19,220
and support and serve ourselves without making a distinction necessarily

12
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,799
I do also want to mention about the weather this kind of

13
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,460
sincere wish that I hope all of you are safe and things are going well it's a quite something that here in the Bay

14
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,579
Area right there's some neighborhoods that are like Wahoo all this rain and then there's other neighborhoods you

15
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:45,960
know just the mudslides some trees falling there's like you know different places having really different

16
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,560
experiences I saw in the news that just not very far from here in the hills in Belmont

17
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:00,479
there's a big slide wasn't clear to me I think a house maybe slid I don't know but uh

18
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:08,220
you know those people are having a very different experience than me that lives on the third floor

19
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,020
and I never worry about flooding

20
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,840
so I'm teaching this course on some factors of Awakening

21
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:30,180
and I was teaching yesterday and the factor is joy that we've been

22
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:36,120
talking about and you know the students they have some readings to do and like a little talk

23
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,879
and all these kinds of things and one thing that um

24
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:48,840
I hear my notes about Joy is something that Matthew brand silver said years ago

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:55,860
some of you may know he Matthew Prince or he's a teacher he teaches here on occasion and at The Retreat Center

26
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:03,120
and he talked about something that uh I just remembered it all these years later

27
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:12,360
something that you know is a support for the arising of joy and he talked about the joy of being wrong

28
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:20,159
and you might like wait what did I hear that right but just this recognition that this idea

29
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,700
or this notion that we have to be right or we need to be right

30
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:32,220
really constricts our lives really constricts our relationships

31
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,379
that's somebody quite some time ago tell me Well Diana

32
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:43,500
would you I don't remember exactly what it was but it this person said to me would you

33
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:49,860
rather be right or would you rather have healthy relationships

34
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:56,280
and I realized that I had this habit of like correcting people like no it's not actually like that it's you know this or

35
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:01,580
that and quite annoying I'm sure

36
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,500
so method runs over this idea of joy of being wrong

37
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:15,120
another way to think about it is the joy of learning something new you thought you might have a clear idea

38
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,820
of how something works or how it is and maybe it's not where you want or

39
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:27,300
whatever it is but then to realize oh actually it's a little bit different

40
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:32,180
than what I was thinking or maybe it's a lot different

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:40,380
because the truth is this practice is a little bit about the joy of being wrong

42
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,920
I have this idea or this teaching that there's these underlying

43
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:53,220
[Music] qualities that are the kind of the root of all of

44
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:59,520
our suffering greed hatred and delusion we could say that delusion right is just

45
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,919
not seen clearly or being completely ignorant of it

46
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:12,300
and so we're delusional until we're not until we see things more clearly and so in some ways we might say that we

47
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:20,900
were wrong and then we become right it's another way to say it so the joy of being wrong

48
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,460
but that's Joy is not the topic for tonight maybe it should be

49
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:32,280
but I want to also talk about this other way in which Joy arises joy and

50
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:40,080
happiness and this is um from a suit term and I talked about this

51
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:46,680
maybe last year I don't remember exactly when but just briefly here's a excerpt from this who does

52
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,340
where the Buddha says suppose a person were to take a loan and undertake business and their business

53
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:01,380
was successful so that they could repay all the money of the old loan and there would remain

54
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:08,280
enough extra money to maintain a spouse that I'm considering this they would be

55
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:13,800
glad and full of joy and then it continues suppose a person

56
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:19,199
were Afflicted suffering and Gravely ill and their food would not agree with them

57
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:24,660
and their body had no strength but later they would recover from the

58
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:30,360
Affliction and their food would agree with them and their body would regain strength

59
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:35,400
that I'm considering this they would be glad and full of joy

60
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:41,280
so this recognition that being in debt is kind of like burdensome and when you

61
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,759
get out of Dutch there's this this feeling of relief when you're sick and you recover from

62
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,360
that sickness there's this feeling of gladness and happiness or even when you might remember it bring it to mind is

63
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,819
this sense of joy and happiness and I like to read another little

64
00:07:01,819 --> 00:07:06,840
excerpt of a suit again this is um

65
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:13,800
the Buddha attributed to the Buddha one who removes the anger that has

66
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:21,120
arisen as one removes with herbs the snakes spreading Venom

67
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,740
that person sloughs off the here and Beyond as a snake says its old worn out

68
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:36,000
skin this expression sloughs off the here and Beyond here and Beyond is like this one

69
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:42,060
way we can interpret is this real concern about this and that and this other thing is this a sense of this

70
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,300
papancha like oh all these things that we're worrying about

71
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,819
but to Slough that off as a snake sheds its old worn out skin

72
00:07:53,819 --> 00:07:59,639
one who was cut off greed as if plucking a Lotus growing in a lake

73
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:05,580
that person sloughs off the here and Beyond as a snake sheds its old worn out

74
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:11,699
skin so these little vignettes that I've been

75
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:18,840
pointing to or the joy of being wrong and kind of the happiness and the way that happens

76
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:26,099
after being the let's see this was um having a loan or being ill some of you

77
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:32,399
may recognize these are assemblies for the hindrances things that kind of get in the way of our practice

78
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:39,060
shedding the skin the SE are all pointing to kind of like a letting go

79
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:45,740
sloughing off shedding what's no longer helpful what's no longer useful

80
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:52,519
and that not only that that there's a sense of relief afterwards

81
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:58,860
and I I watched it in order to understand this a little better I watched a video about how snakes shed

82
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:04,380
their skin it's quite some it's quite a process but

83
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:10,920
the I watched a video with some snake Handler describing it and he says you know the snakes feel very vulnerable as

84
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:17,700
they're shedding their skin and but then when they do and it takes some time but when they do they just feel

85
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:23,100
great they I don't know if we would use the word frisky but uh they feel

86
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:29,940
better so this idea of letting go

87
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:36,600
letting go of what's not helpful letting go of what's constricting us

88
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:43,220
letting go of what doesn't feel like it's supporting us

89
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:51,120
this is a natural process what I just describe these are natural things

90
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:56,279
it's a just a falling away of what it's

91
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:02,580
not needed anymore what isn't helpful it's often this falling away the

92
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:07,760
shedding happens due to we have like a new understanding

93
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:14,100
a new way of seeing things or we have this um see them in a way that we didn't

94
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,160
before like oh yeah this doesn't make sense to hold on to anymore

95
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:27,800
and maybe there's not even that thought maybe there's just this natural letting go

96
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:37,440
so letting go this integral to this practice of this Buddhist practice and in some way we

97
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:44,720
might say that all these practices come down to this idea of just letting go letting go

98
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:51,300
to be sure this idea of nabana Awakening Enlightenment greater Freedom

99
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,300
peace all of these are related to letting go

100
00:10:57,300 --> 00:11:02,760
shedding what's not needed anymore what's not helpful sloughing off what's

101
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:08,579
not helpful so this idea of naban is to let go thoroughly

102
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:14,640
completely in a way that's such nothing is left in

103
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,899
fact that there isn't even anybody to let go of anything

104
00:11:23,579 --> 00:11:30,360
but it to have the the confidence or the trust to do this when we so often with

105
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,399
our lives and certainly our society promotes this it's so much about like

106
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:44,180
kind of acquiring and getting having more and more

107
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:51,180
so this practice is encouraging us to look the to have this opposite movement

108
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:57,000
and I'd like to highlight here that this is a natural process it's

109
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:02,220
not something that is uh gets wrenched out of our hands while we're screaming

110
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:08,040
holding on to it something like that because one of the things it's not so

111
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:13,140
much about what we lose when we're letting go it's more about what we gain

112
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,300
and I've been pointing to some of the joy and the happiness but there's also

113
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:24,959
the sense of relief or unburdening lightening up or something that just

114
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,899
feels better this is a silly example but this is kind

115
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:36,060
of the way that I was thinking about that the other day I was in my kitchen and I needed to get something out of a

116
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:42,360
drawer and you know there's something like stuck in the drawer just because it was had too much stuff in it

117
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:49,139
like oh I don't need two of these okay I can donate this I can donate this and then you know just getting rid of things

118
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:54,720
that aren't needed and now the drawer just opens readily

119
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:00,600
it's kind of like that like things that are just oh this gets in the way

120
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:06,420
this can maybe support somebody else or may have some other

121
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:11,639
use but it doesn't need to be in this drawer right now

122
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:18,120
that's kind of the feeling I have this idea of letting go but we might feel uncomfortable with

123
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:26,279
this idea of letting go certainly because in some ways that might sound a lot like

124
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:32,519
uh renunciation which generally we're not so keen on or maybe it's this idea of

125
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,459
surrender which generally we're not so keen on I think of Americans that we don't

126
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:43,500
really like these ideas necessarily maybe because there's a sense of

127
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:49,079
deprivation or maybe a lack of safety if we were to let go maybe we would feel

128
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:54,600
vulnerable maybe we feel like all these things that we're holding on to literal

129
00:13:54,600 --> 00:14:02,880
objects as well as views about ourselves about the world

130
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:10,260
maybe we have this sense that they make us safe they help us keep the world orderly and

131
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:15,860
predictable and in a way that makes us feel more comfortable

132
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:25,560
but something that I um I think I heard this from Gail franstal first I'm not sure

133
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:34,500
some years ago I heard this and it this also really stayed with me what if we kind of said of this idea of letting go

134
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:43,320
sometimes we might see this word giving up but that doesn't sound so and so uh inviting either like

135
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:51,180
to give up so I was like that definitely feels like surrender but what if we think about like give

136
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:58,019
up as in higher Like to Move It Up

137
00:14:58,019 --> 00:15:03,959
that's the I think the origin of this expression is to like put up on the

138
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:11,360
altar so to give it up is in this way to maybe as an offering to

139
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:17,220
and the service of having a better life and the service of

140
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:24,480
what opening up to whatever might be available and for no longer holding so tightly to things

141
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:30,839
maybe it's an act of generosity to give up give up some of our

142
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:38,940
strongly held ideas or views about what it means to be successful or

143
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:45,959
what it means to be a good person or what it means to be a good practitioner

144
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:49,220
whatever it might be

145
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:57,000
but this we're not just letting go of I talked about nabana as letting go of

146
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,420
everything but this is a process it's a it's a path that we practice

147
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:08,459
and then we walk along and the path of so much of it is about kind of letting

148
00:16:08,459 --> 00:16:15,180
go shedding what's not needed but it's always in the service of what's wholesome what's

149
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:20,519
helpful what's skillful not

150
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:27,120
what causes more suffering it's more to move in to help support

151
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:34,560
these wholesome states of Mind beneficial states of Mind spacious states of mind

152
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,440
maybe we could say like in the service of creating this uh inner treasure or

153
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:45,839
this inner wealth maybe we're exchanging some of these

154
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:51,720
things objects or views that we thought were going to make us

155
00:16:51,720 --> 00:17:00,980
wealthy some kind of way but maybe we might still feel this inner

156
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:07,438
whole or incompleteness or something so there's some of this giving away giving

157
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:13,740
up letting go that really supports this inner wealth

158
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:20,339
these inner Treasures certainly joy and happiness are part of those

159
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:25,459
and we need joy and happiness all of us do

160
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:32,640
not only do we need it it's an integral part of the path absolutely integral

161
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:39,720
path of practice is not always easy first Noble Truth we're pointing to duka

162
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:46,080
this path cannot be just about duka duka duka right there needs to be joy and

163
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:51,179
happiness too otherwise we can't really open to the dukkha The Suffering The

164
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:59,039
difficulties it has to be a balance has to be wholesome otherwise we can't do it humans can't

165
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:04,640
just be with duka all the time

166
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,700
so the Buddha never says that we have to give away or renounce our wealth our

167
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:18,860
personal possessions instead we're letting go of that which is not useful

168
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:24,179
for letting go of things that don't serve us the obvious ones are

169
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:30,059
manifestations of greed hatred and delusion but those show up in so many ways that

170
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:34,460
sometimes we don't even quite recognize them

171
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:43,799
so this is this letting go is maybe it's part of the practice

172
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:51,240
and it's a gradual process it's a gradual process to unlearn a a

173
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:57,000
lifetime of clinging and craving I feel holding on

174
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:02,940
to and one way that this might have been

175
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:10,320
Gill so that I saw him give this example maybe some of you have seen him do this

176
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:15,840
too the way that we're talking about letting go we could give this example is um

177
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:22,020
with the striker here one way to let go is to drop it

178
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:27,660
so you're just let it go let go make a large sound that's a bonus

179
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:35,400
but there's another way and just to undo our fist we still have it that our relationship

180
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:40,919
to it has changed we're no longer really holding on to it so if we're doing this where we're

181
00:19:40,919 --> 00:19:46,559
letting it go maybe that's helpful and skillful but

182
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:52,919
sometimes that feels like a shoving away whereas this ways we're just letting go of the clinging

183
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,559
might still have a striker for just not clinging

184
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:05,100
so really this is the movement this opening the fist

185
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:10,980
anything and everything we could say that this whole practice is

186
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,559
to help us do that to learn how to do that

187
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:23,700
and so there's this poem from rosemary traumer she's a wonderful poet I just appreciate

188
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:29,100
her so much she's also a practitioner and she talks about this a little about

189
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:35,480
this short little poem and it's called a little pep talk

190
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:41,880
and it goes like this the swirling Ash doesn't try to become

191
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:49,320
log again the flying leaves don't attempt to return to the tree

192
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:55,860
The Girl Can't untwist her genome back into separate strands

193
00:20:55,860 --> 00:21:01,020
the flower and the bread can't return to the sack and can't undo the kneading of

194
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:06,179
hands in all things lives in memory of letting

195
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:13,380
go and the chance to transform into what it can't know

196
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:20,600
what do you say to that heart good self what do you say to that

197
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:26,820
so this I think Rosemary trauma is trying to give herself a little talk recognizing that she knows that things

198
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:33,840
are better with letting go this recognition that everything that's

199
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:39,059
possible or exists now is the result of a certain amount of letting go

200
00:21:39,059 --> 00:21:47,400
bread coming from flower Falling Leaves coming from trees Etc but letting go is also

201
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:51,860
the process of going forward to

202
00:21:53,880 --> 00:22:01,200
so along these lines um agara it's a another Dharma teacher I just saw

203
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:06,240
this title of his Dharma talk if I didn't listen to the talk I just looked

204
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:13,440
at the title and I thought this title was great he said the title is from let go to

205
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,659
let's go so instead of this emphatic you know let

206
00:22:18,659 --> 00:22:24,000
go something that you have to do is this movement of let's go it's part

207
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:31,200
of like this movement forward like let's let's go to a place where there's less clinging

208
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:38,280
more freedom so

209
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:45,919
maybe I'll just say that this letting go of this maybe the

210
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:53,640
we might call it a compulsion to really cling onto things

211
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:58,940
so it's not so much the objects themselves that we're worried about

212
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:04,940
but it's a clinging in the holding

213
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:14,000
and this includes letting go of a sense of self

214
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:22,260
so as we as our life unfolds we have these

215
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:27,960
outdated Notions of ideas of Who We Are

216
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:33,000
to let go of those they're no longer accurate

217
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:39,419
as we age and mature and grow and learn we might have learned things when we

218
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:46,020
were young When We Were Young that aren't so helpful for us anymore so can we let go of some of those ideas of how

219
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:51,080
we should be or how we shouldn't be or how we are or how we aren't

220
00:23:51,419 --> 00:23:57,780
but then this practice is pointing to something even deeper just to even

221
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,000
let go of the idea of any self

222
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,400
whatsoever this sense of a self that's at the

223
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:13,500
center of everything feels like the whole world you know our

224
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:19,860
world feels it can feel like there's this permanent stable steady entity at

225
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:27,480
the center around which everything is circulating

226
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:32,960
if you really look it turns out it's not there

227
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:39,900
it's these momentary ideas oh it feels like there's a center there but then when you go to look at it

228
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:45,840
it's not there oh it's over here and then you go to look at it over there and oh it's not

229
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:53,340
there either this is often makes more sense

230
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:59,039
if often it's like some meditative experiences when the mind is really

231
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:06,360
quiet you can see this more clearly but it's maybe similar to this idea of

232
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:12,120
um when we're doing something that we really love hobby that we really love

233
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:18,179
whatever it might be knitting gardening gaming whatever it is

234
00:25:18,179 --> 00:25:25,260
notice how there isn't a strong sense of self there there's just whatever it is you live to be doing drawing sketching

235
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:33,140
playing the guitar whatever it is it's just that activity

236
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:40,140
it's really an enjoyable experience because there isn't this sent this sense

237
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:45,840
of self in the center so we all have these experiences and

238
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:51,360
what this practice is pointing to is the freedom that we experience like in those

239
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:58,340
flow States but to have that all the time

240
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:03,139
and to feel the the freedom of that

241
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:13,640
and to be sure some things are worth holding on to

242
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:20,419
and some things are worth having in our life and are appropriate to have

243
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,980
relationships and values all kinds of things

244
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:34,919
but it it's this movement of just holding them like this with an open hand instead of like this

245
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:40,440
so again the emphasis is more on this movement as opposed to having to get rid

246
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:47,100
of any particular object or even our views I'm sure we have views

247
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:53,279
but what is it like to to have a view of this is this is what makes sense to me

248
00:26:53,279 --> 00:27:00,779
right now this is my current understanding the way that I understand it seems like this

249
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:07,020
that's very different then I'm right and you're wrong to say like you know my understanding is

250
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:14,760
this is what makes the most sense or this is my provisional thinking can't see any other way but this is this

251
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:20,720
is the way that I'm holding it right now or what I'm thinking right now

252
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:28,500
so I'm talking about letting go in terms of like this Buddhist practice but to be sure letting go

253
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:35,059
is essential for just whether you're a practitioner or not just for a happy life

254
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:42,000
and we let go all the time we let go of plans when the weather changes the

255
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:49,020
person we were going to meet no longer can do it you know we let go of that we change our opinions on things

256
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:55,980
our preferences I used to really dislike ketchup now I

257
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:01,200
think ketchup is okay [Laughter] it just happens right

258
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:06,779
but of course this is uh in daily life we are letting go of

259
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:12,779
things but often we don't notice and we do this right just effortlessly

260
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:18,900
that's when we have new information or new understandings and so this is

261
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:24,059
pointing to the same thing and so

262
00:28:24,059 --> 00:28:29,700
one thing that we could do in our daily life to support kind of

263
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:36,539
this movement towards letting go is to just let go of the clinging

264
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:43,260
for short moments oh

265
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:49,740
I think that um there's that ice cream in the freezer

266
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:56,400
or have this idea of like okay I really want this we have this desire and then clinging to this idea of

267
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:02,720
think that will definitely be a source of lasting happiness if I have more ice cream

268
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:08,700
but just say well what if I just let go of that idea right now

269
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:15,779
I have the desire but it's okay it can be there but I don't have to do anything with it so we're not holding on to it

270
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:21,600
tightly it's a little bit uncomfortable at the

271
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:27,120
beginning maybe but then notice that the Mind state it feels

272
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,600
kind of like strong and wholesome after doing that

273
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,059
maybe ice cream is too big of a

274
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:43,919
too big of a place to start because ice cream is often Associated when we don't

275
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:50,580
feel well we want to or have emotionally don't feel well we want to eat ice cream so maybe maybe we don't start there but

276
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:56,340
start where something that's easy I'm just like okay I'm gonna I want this

277
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:03,120
and maybe just to say maybe I don't need it right now something simple

278
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,299
maybe a cup of tea here at that moment like I'll wait a snack something like

279
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:15,840
this and so it's just one moment at a time

280
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:23,640
we're not saying that you forever you can't have a cup of tea or ice cream or a snack again but just to notice how

281
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,980
does it feel to have maybe like this desire and want

282
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:35,640
to hold on and instead to kind of lean back and say I don't think that I will

283
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:41,340
this moment I can next moment but this moment I'm not going to

284
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:46,620
and it's just like this it's just small moments

285
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:51,840
one after the other or maybe it's a moment of not clinging and then there's

286
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:57,899
a moment of clinging the next but just to notice how the mind feels

287
00:30:57,899 --> 00:31:06,600
when we've been able to soften or let go some of that clinging and this can be a tremendous support

288
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:11,640
I'm talking about how the joy and happiness after letting go of these

289
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:16,980
things the joy of being wrong or when you're no longer sick

290
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,980
getting better or like a snake shedding its skin

291
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:27,240
but see for yourself what does it feel like when you do a

292
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:33,179
little bit of letting go and notice how it feels in the mind in

293
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:39,980
the body and the Heart and let that knowledge be a support for you

294
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,799
this is a gradual practice we've been cultivating the habit of getting

295
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:54,140
chances are most of our lives so this is definitely a gradual practice it takes time

296
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,480
it's not a straight linear

297
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:08,880
process requires us to let go of some of our allegiances to things that aren't so

298
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:15,539
helpful that might be pleasurable that's a process

299
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:20,880
but maybe we can choose to be a little bit

300
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:27,779
more skeptical about these things that we're holding on to do they will it really make me happy

301
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:33,899
in a way that's supportive and fulfilling

302
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:40,158
helps build the life that I want to build the direction I want to go

303
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:44,899
so this idea of letting go

304
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:51,299
maybe not just letting go but recognizing the the relief the joy that

305
00:32:51,299 --> 00:32:57,140
happiness that's on the other side of that associated with it

306
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:03,360
so maybe I'll stop there and open it up to see if there are any questions or

307
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,020
comments

308
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:29,299
it's perfectly fine oh there we go behind you Jim foreign

309
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:41,220
my while we while you were speaking um I was thinking about

310
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:47,340
the relationships as something that is difficult to

311
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:52,500
you know shed but there's sometimes that urge to want

312
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,899
to shed certain relationships and things like that but

313
00:33:57,899 --> 00:34:03,740
um I don't know how to navigate

314
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:14,179
the not letting go versus pushing away

315
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:21,358
um as well as thinking about

316
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:28,618
how that impacts other people as well so you know if I'm not clinging

317
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:34,378
is that something that affects other people in a negative way

318
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:39,780
does that cause suffering or

319
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:45,559
I guess I just I just think so much of

320
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:52,858
the way that we Express care and love is

321
00:34:52,859 --> 00:34:59,539
by this clinging or at least in our culture right right you're you're here I have you

322
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:06,240
and trying to trying to navigate that better to hold it this way

323
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:12,380
um rather than than

324
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:18,960
saying it's hard to even put into words

325
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,020
um

326
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:34,200
even just holding sometimes doesn't seem like enough for relationships I will say that and when

327
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:40,079
you feel like I either need to hold on or push away and

328
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:46,740
I don't understand how you're supposed to determine that kind of Direction um so is your course so is your question

329
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:53,240
so to just be like this open-handed way yeah as opposed to

330
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:59,640
anything else right Holding On which either is bringing clothes or pushing away both of them are kind of like a

331
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:06,060
little bit of a yes but it's so much harder when it's in a

332
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:11,940
relationship because there's another person involved with it yeah and so if you're not you know it's

333
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:18,060
kind of like a tug rope that both of us are holding on to when we're supporting each other but if you let go then that

334
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:26,480
person falls yeah yeah it's quite something to just love

335
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,480
it's love Yeah and right and in relationships if one person right

336
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:41,420
exactly as you said starts to shift then of course it affects the other person and there might need to be some

337
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:48,960
renegotiating right maybe it doesn't even happen with words but uh this because often what happens when I need

338
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:54,960
to tell you this so I think we all know this that when where there's a little bit of holding then there's also there's

339
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,920
this little bit of well I want you to behave in this particular way and my preferences are that you do

340
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:08,099
it this way and not stop doing that thing that I think don't like and but um

341
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:14,160
part of this of to do this is to let go of that as well so they feel the freedom

342
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:24,720
but can they feel the warmth also so this is not easy right to re

343
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,660
defined renegotiate something in relationships but there's something really beautiful that happens when

344
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:36,119
people feel like you love them you care about them you see them you're with them

345
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:44,579
and you support them without insisting demanding that things be a certain way

346
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:51,000
people really Blossom under that right we all do does this I don't know if I'm answering

347
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:58,160
your question or not but but I feel like he did so okay

348
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:05,480
thank you does anybody else have a question

349
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:20,160
I think maybe more of a comment than a question um when you first started talking about letting go I thought of like subtracting

350
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:25,440
or getting what oh giving you know getting having less excess but then I started to think of it as a positive

351
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,160
maybe you let go of negative thoughts or or self-perceptions and it's actually you're gaining more more abundance of

352
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:38,280
things that you know make life a little bit more worthwhile and whatnot fantastic I love it thank you thank you

353
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:45,000
yep I could have said that too I could have kind of pointed to that letting go of negative thoughts but there's so many

354
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:50,640
things that we're holding on to that we're pretty convinced are gonna are really important that later turned out

355
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:58,320
not to be so important so maybe um not just the things that are negative thoughts but all kinds of things

356
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:02,240
but thank you for saying that I appreciate that

357
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:08,780
I don't know if our friends on the okay

358
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,420
okay thank you for your talk uh Diana I heard a talk Yesterday by a Tibetan

359
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:31,079
teacher about joy and uh he talked about

360
00:39:31,079 --> 00:39:37,079
looking at the blockages to Joy I was wondering if so that's sort of

361
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:42,900
been resonating with me because sometimes on here talks about Joy

362
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:50,220
there can be a little bit like oh I should be I should be having an experience of joy and I'm not

363
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:55,980
and you know what's wrong with me

364
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:03,200
so do you have any things that you'd like to say about what blocks Joy

365
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:11,760
do you have an idea Jim of what blocks Joy well on a tube tin does and I think it

366
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,940
resonated which was um aversion

367
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:23,700
um yeah I'd say a version I would say the idea that you're supposed to have joy

368
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:30,599
that that's oppressive to feel like oh I'm supposed to be happy that doesn't make us feel happy right something like

369
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:37,400
this these ideas that we should be a particular way but you have more in the list

370
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,140
well um

371
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:53,040
so maybe you could talk a little bit about how does one

372
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:00,000
support the values that they have in a way that isn't clinging

373
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:08,760
you know I mean because sometimes we're going to hear about well just let go you know it's it's it's that but

374
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,900
um there do seem to be things that I value

375
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:21,780
that I'm willing to I don't know if I'd say fight for but

376
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:27,079
put effort into uh upholding

377
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:33,480
so how does how does that fit into letting go

378
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:39,359
and yet still having uh values particularly about

379
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:45,060
qualities that we cultivate in the practice Yeah Yeah

380
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:51,180
thank you for asking us because that is kind of a danger in this talk that I'm going like letting go letting go and you can feel like oh it's just this passive

381
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:57,060
just let go of everything and then you're a lump of something

382
00:41:57,060 --> 00:42:02,640
yeah so it's in the service of what is wholesome and helpful and skillful

383
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:08,700
so I think the values that you have like we can use as a North star and the

384
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:17,760
letting go is to help what helps move towards that North Star so and some of the values of course are

385
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,380
maybe we might think of some of the parames or you know generosity or

386
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:30,240
loving kindness mindfulness the settleness of Mind honesty these types

387
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:37,800
of things so as opposed to grabbing on to the experience of them

388
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:43,500
using them as a direction and have our actions

389
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:50,220
go in that direction support that is that helpful at all using this kind of a different language as a North star as

390
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:56,540
opposed to something that you stop holding on to

391
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:04,859
yeah I think so so yeah thank you I I kind of appreciate how um maybe that that's maybe the

392
00:43:04,859 --> 00:43:09,859
danger of a talk of that like this is this feeling of

393
00:43:11,339 --> 00:43:17,119
like there's nothing to hold on to which turns out to be true but that's not

394
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,480
it's not uh what I um

395
00:43:23,880 --> 00:43:30,960
but that's so that some like it can be a meditative experience where you can see like oh things things aren't as solid as

396
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:39,540
I thought that they were and that's kind of odd to talk about and it can be off-putting and and and comfortable to

397
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:45,720
talk about but this does sometimes arise as meditative experience and that's perfectly fine

398
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:51,300
part of the way part of the practice but thank you for your question I

399
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:54,200
appreciate that

400
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:03,839
okay oh okay so maybe one do you do you can do if you can uh I'll give you a

401
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:10,260
quick answer yeah I think letting go you know for all

402
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:16,859
this it's you know easier said than done I think the part of it is you know there may be times I feel like if I let go it

403
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:22,680
will be an empty hand the results and I think you know when you can go

404
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:29,520
for Time After Time with an empty hand and you know you I get caught in the the train of thought

405
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,680
where I'm just like okay so what what are the possibilities with this empty hand now

406
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:42,480
I don't see any possibilities this is why this is why I'm clinging to this thing so you know I guess maybe I can probably

407
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:50,460
answer my own question but it's like you know it's like what in this path we're on you know do we cultivate that

408
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:56,940
almost like this courage I'm sitting with the word courage now to kind of open the hand open or even the thing

409
00:44:56,940 --> 00:45:04,380
might fly away that I'm clinging to and you know and that everything will be okay you know that's kind of the big question

410
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:11,339
I'm sitting with right now so I don't know if you have any thoughts I do I have a few thoughts one is

411
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:17,760
General letting goes that are just happening already when you're letting go of plans that you made or are you

412
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:22,800
letting go of a view that you had and you get some more information like oh wait oh that turns out not to be quite

413
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:29,460
right just notice those and you'll just start to see oh yeah this is a natural thing that you're doing already

414
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:35,040
we're just cultivating it and maybe broadening it so that's one thing a

415
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,980
second thing it's so much easier to let go if you have a feeling of abundance

416
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:48,300
as opposed to lack what supports a feeling of abundance turns out to be generosity in whatever

417
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:54,240
way if it's with your resources time money your generosity giving people a

418
00:45:54,240 --> 00:46:00,359
benefit of the doubt whatever way Jen this is part of the reason why generosity is a kind of a fundamental

419
00:46:00,359 --> 00:46:05,520
teaching is because it does gives a sense of abundance this feeling of like

420
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,980
oh yeah but I don't know to share it really touches us and affects us so

421
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:17,700
that also will support a sense of letting go and then I had a third one that just

422
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:23,700
slipped my mind let's see if it'll come back but some of them or you know it doesn't

423
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:30,480
have to be these grand gestures and as I said this is a long process it's a practice it definitely is

424
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:35,940
but just notice when unburdening happens

425
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:41,040
we tend to be dismissive of these things because we're busy trying to get something else and we're not even

426
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:47,220
noticing all the shedding that we're naturally doing but once you notice that and notice kind

427
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:54,839
of like how some of these um these suited quotes like the snake shedding its skin how it just feels like

428
00:46:54,839 --> 00:47:01,079
oh what a relief but maybe sometimes this relief is really subtle

429
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:07,079
so it requires a little more pain attention to and I keep on talking wishing that that third thing would come

430
00:47:07,079 --> 00:47:13,759
back into my mind but I'm afraid it hasn't so well I do with these two

431
00:47:13,859 --> 00:47:19,339
okay so we're a few minutes after the hour so thank you

432
00:47:19,940 --> 00:47:25,920
and if you'd like you're welcome to come back you to come up here and talk with me but otherwise I wish you all a

433
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,299
wonderful evening thank you
