4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:32,160

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,600

11
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:14,640

12
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:21,280
smiley face on you know the the round big smiley face on the yellow face i mean it's like no it's a it's a

13
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:27,119
different it can be a different kind of happiness there's a sense of peace there's a sense of ease there's a sense

14
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,200
of well-being that can come with these practices of course there are

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,400
various research studies nowadays that suggest that especially practices of

16
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,320
gratitude and loving kindness and compassion are conducive to happiness they haven't

17
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,720
done so much research yet on vicarious joy it turns

18
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,920
out actually i haven't seen too much on that because it's such an interesting concept in the

19
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,880
west to feel happiness for the happiness of others i think what usually comes up for people is envy but actually the

20
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:10,560
that that practice happiness for the practice of the happiness of others vicarious joy is the most happy making

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,840
is the most happy making practice as is equanimity there's a sense of

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,879
equipoise and ease and beauty that can come the sense of it's a deep happiness it's

23
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,640
a deep deep-seated happiness and and of course compassion

24
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:33,840
um it's not a sad difficult painful

25
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:41,120
experience people often confuse empathic distress when they're feeling

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,160
the pain of others so much that there is no cushioning of care

27
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,800
of love so they think compassion is painful and sad and difficult like i just i don't

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:03:01,840
want to you know compassion fatigue which is actually empathy or empathetic distress fatigue

29
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,120
so i just wanted to to uh

30
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:14,000
give a nod to why we're called happier um given that so many evenings it's you

31
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:20,000
know we we practice compassion etc which again for the old-timers you know you

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,760
know uh the change and the shift that this makes in your own

33
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,840
experience in your own um the landscape of your own mind

34
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:40,720
so so with that as the as the frame um

35
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:50,319
for practicing today um tonight i wanted to invite us um

36
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,640
this week given that there's so many challenges in the world uh especially

37
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:02,159
in the war zones um so much pain and suffering

38
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:09,360
that we turn towards it with the practice of compassion and equanimity

39
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,439
both to hold to hold witness both for ourselves and for the world

40
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:23,280
with this sense of care love which is stable which is stable it

41
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:28,800
doesn't topple over into into empathic distress or

42
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,600
or agony or grief but feels care and love meets the suffering meets the suffering

43
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,040
the love meeting suffering but with the sense of balance and spaciousness

44
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:48,240
because as you well know doom scrolling and exposing ourselves way too much

45
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,840
to to news that is challenging is

46
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,240
does not help us does not help anyone else it's important to be informed it's important to be

47
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,680
um to be aware and to help in every possible

48
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:13,440
way we can but to to be addicted to to have this addictive quality to bad news

49
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:18,639
and and challenging um uh

50
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:26,400
news that can actually veer us off into empathic distress is not helpful for anyone

51
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,919
so in that way i like to dedicate tonight's practice and happy hour to

52
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,960
compassion and equanimity both meeting suffering with care and

53
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,479
equipoise for the sake of ourselves as well as the world

54
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:48,320
um maybe i'll say just one last thing is in order to frame and the frame

55
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:57,199
also is as take not han said often on refugee boats if everyone

56
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:03,520
panics the boat capsizes but if there's one person who's calm

57
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,560
one person who cares cares enough to be calm

58
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:14,800
the boat can't survive so can we be the one who cares with a sense of calm in

59
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:21,759
the boat of our friends relative relative loved ones

60
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:28,080
for what's happening in the world now so without further ado i'd like to

61
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,759
invite us to to enter our practice

62
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:39,199
our meditation posture whether you're sitting or lying down

63
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:45,600

64
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,039

67
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:17,840
releasing what's not helpful [Music] as we take refuge

68
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:25,280
in the heart space in the quiet of this moment in this cultivation practice

69
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:32,638
relaxing the body here

70
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,000

and even releasing clinging to the present too hard

72
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,759
and abiding abiding

73
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,400
spaciously in the sensations with the sensations of this body there is a body

74
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,919
there is a body there is breath allowing each breath to be soothing

75
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:12,440
calming nourishing

76
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,960
in this moment

77
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:52,959
the thoughts arise as they will arise can we release them smiling with

78
00:08:52,959 --> 00:09:00,480
can we smilingly not judgmentally but smilingly release them

79

to connect to connect

89
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:36,399

91
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,510

94
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,919
and let there be a sense of expansiveness with the breath

95
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:20,880
as if the breath isn't just moving through the body but expands

96
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:29,120
and includes the whole body expands beyond the body

00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,880
goodness for the benefit of all beings everywhere may all beings

167
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:17,240
be happy may all beings everywhere be free

168
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:35,400
thank you everyone thank you for your practice

169
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:44,240
so so what

170
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:52,640
we were engaging with tonight today is a combination is a way into compassion

171
00:37:52,640 --> 00:38:00,320
through equanimity so that there is a sense of stability care spaciousness

172
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:07,280
and then there is care love permeating that then can hold suffering so starting

173
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:13,440
from equanimity into compassion into holding compassion sometimes this

174
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:19,920
practice can work the other way around people you can start with compassion and if it becomes too overwhelming you end

175
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,920
up in empathic distress then you can ah bring an equanimity but i like well

176
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:33,040
both are good all practices are great and this is a lovely way lovely way to bring in more

177
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:40,560
equipoise into your compassion practice so any reflections any observations that you

178
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:45,920
made [Music] any insights that came up you're welcome

179
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:52,640
to raise your hand if you haven't shared in the space for a while you can also type in chat if it's typed

180
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:59,359

182
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:11,440
what did you notice what was this like for you

183
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:20,480
was it different was it interesting was it this is something that opened up or not

184
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,480
maybe it was challenging maybe there was nowhere to land anything

185
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:31,720
for your own benefit and those of others

186
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,119
one reflection i thought of myself as a tree rooted to

187
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:57,119
the ground and offering shelter to others oh this is such a beautiful image thank you so

188
00:39:57,119 --> 00:40:03,599

194
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:45,280
distinction between the empathetic distress and the compassion which actually feels good

195
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:53,599
and i and i know that but it's so helpful to hear that articulated and i love the spaciousness of

218
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:22,960

deborah in chat um the practice offered a bomb i had to

220

deal with a lost stolen phone today ouch kept remembering that in the grand

221
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:42,160
scheme of things this was truly only an inconvenience a big one nowadays yes of

222
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,480
course throughout the day meta abounded

225
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:08,960
it is quite an inconvenience as our lives depend on it so much

226
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:14,079
and and reminding that it is an inconvenience a big one and throughout

227

00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:34,640
ah yeah and and [Music] what you shared actually um prompts me to say that often when

230
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:40,960
challenging things happen when challenging things or inconvenient or difficult things happen

231
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:47,359
they're an opportunity to to open us to push us to be more kind

232
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:54,720
and grateful and gentle to even open us more to meta and care and presence

233
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,200
otherwise sometimes we go through our day mechanically when everything is okay or

234
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:08,000
the same so beautiful how this was an opportunity i hope you made it into an opportunity

237
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:27,520
let's turn to practice together in small groups in small

238
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:35,280
groups of roughly size of three and the invitation is to start with 15 seconds of silence

239
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:42,160
meta for ourselves for others so equanimity caring for yourself caring for others

240
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:47,760
and you can share as little or as much as you like about your practice

241
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:53,839
holding each other holding witness and care for each other confidentiality

242
00:45:53,839 --> 00:46:00,640
is very important speak from your own experience please not from other people's experience not commenting on

243
00:46:00,640 --> 00:46:07,839
each other but really respecting holding holding close caring what does it mean

244
00:46:07,839 --> 00:46:13,119
