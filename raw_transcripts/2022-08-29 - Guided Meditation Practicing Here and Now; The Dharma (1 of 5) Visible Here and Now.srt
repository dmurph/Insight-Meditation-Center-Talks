1
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:06,880
so good morning everyone and

2
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:17,920
welcome to our sitting and and thank you for also for

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:26,720
welcoming back and nice to be back with you all after be gone for two weeks

4
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,480
and so for the meditation today

5
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,199
i want to evoke for you

6
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:46,399
one of the experiences that ideally

7
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:53,360
you would be inspired to enter into to really be interested in and

8
00:00:53,360 --> 00:01:00,480
dedicated to as you meditate and that is

9
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:07,360
that experience which can be experienced

10
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,400
here and now that which can be seen and felt and

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,200
heard here and now that which can be known

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,320
only in the present moment that the past

13
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,799
doesn't exist anymore except in the thoughts

14
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,759
about the past and those thoughts are in the present moment and so to know and recognize oh

15
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,040
this is present moment thinking about the past

16
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,398
the future doesn't exist except as a prediction

17
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,840
certain thoughts and ideas but those thoughts exist and can be seen

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,000
and known and felt perhaps even if there's tension associated with them

19
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:14,400
or emotions they can be known and seen and felt here and now in the present moment

20
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:24,879
to really enter into the world of our inner life

21
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:32,319
that it's only here in the present moment to enter the world of our emotions

22
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,840
emotions in and of themselves only exist now

23
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:45,440
and to stay here to be inspired to value to

24
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,840
be interested in what can be visible here and now

25
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,640
this is where the dharma opens up this is where practice opens up

26
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,280
and it's hard to do because of the tremendous pull into

27
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:13,360
past and future fantasy thinking about things

28
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,040
these are important things that human beings do we don't want to dismiss them

29
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:28,159
but there's something very radically different that happens if we are clearly grounded

30
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:34,480
in touch with how those things are happening in the present moment

31
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:41,760
that we're not blinded by thoughts about the past to not see that all these are happening now

32
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:47,840
in a sense anything that you experience anything that

33
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,720
is occurring for you occurs in the present and this is where mindfulness

34
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:02,159
finds its grounding finds its center finds its opening

35
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:08,959
for us to meditate so to

36
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:15,760
assume a posture that hopefully

37
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:21,840
gives you an embodied experience of being grounded

38
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:30,479
centered here and now if the posture is too casual

39
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,880
if the posture is just too much you know slumping against the back of the couch

40
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:52,638
it might be more difficult to feel an embodied involvement with the present moment

41
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,840
to have your body support you and encourage you

42
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,520
into here and now

43
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:13,039
and to gently lower your gaze

44
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:21,880
and gently close your eyes

45
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,560
and one of the reasons we focus on breathing in meditation

46
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,479
is that it's a rhythmic

47
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:54,400
experience that is continuously in the present

48
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:02,478
moment here and now and to ride the rhythms of breathing

49
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,280
to begin by taking a few long slow deep breaths

50
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:16,600
relaxing on the exhale

51
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,400
becoming centered or grounded in that relaxation

52
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:32,639
by settling into your place

53
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:36,720
here and now

54
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,880
and then letting your breathing return to normal

55
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:54,440
a bit more on the exhale relax throughout your body

56
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,840
and as you exhale relax the thinking mind

57
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:48,960
the more there is pressure in the mind agitation in the mind

58
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,160
anxiety or desires in the mind

59
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,840
the easier it is to slip away from the present moment

60
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,879
to be concerned about other things at other times in other places

61
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,000
but to relax the thinking mind soften

62
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:30,759
to gentle the thinking mind

63
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,680
um

64
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,399
and then to settle into your breathing again

65
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,760
the breathing being part of your lived experience

66
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,000
to call it a lived experience is another way of saying that which is

67
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,720
happening for you here and now right here and now

68
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:46,959
the only place you can experience your vitality or

69
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,560
whatever way it is for you to experience being alive

70
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,200
eh

71
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,440
and it's here in your direct experience

72
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:42,480
where we will discover what the buddha was pointing at the dharma

73
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,839
you don't need to look for it

74
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,079
but to remember how valuable and important it is

75
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,720
probably the most important thing at this moment is to be here

76
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:12,000
with your present moment experience not pulled

77
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,399
and lost in the world of thinking but pulled into the world of direct

78
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:22,920
experience breathing

79
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:48,919
um

80
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,120
so

81
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:17,200
perhaps after these minutes of sitting

82
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,760
you are changed a bit maybe calmer or settled

83
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,960
or maybe more sensitive

84
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:40,880
in being so you can better settle into your direct immediate

85
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:43,880
experience

86
00:23:55,840 --> 00:24:03,640
independent of the future and the past

87
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:19,559
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

88
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:31,440
our capacity to care for others to

89
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:39,039
have good will love kindness generosity

90
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,600
are all

91
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:51,480
things that exist only as we're doing them

92
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:57,278
only as they're present for us within us

93
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:05,200
to be centered grounded here in the direct experience

94
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:12,000
gives us the opportunity to know

95
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:21,158
connect with whatever degree of goodwill we have for this world

96
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,600
that we have for others that we have for all the creatures in

97
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,840
this world

98
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:42,398
and here in the present moment that's so important

99
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:50,080
it is the location place time from time to time

100
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:55,600
that we can give expression to this care for the world

101
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:04,399
and to take whatever benefit we've received from this meditation practice

102
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:10,398
and dedicate it for the welfare and happiness of others

103
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,399
at the benefit you receive you don't have to give it away

104
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:19,120
but you can

105
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,240
dedicate it use it

106
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:33,200
to support others may all beings

107
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,840
benefit from this meditation

108
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:45,600
may this time that we've meditated together support us in bringing

109
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:53,520
welfare and happiness peace safety to others

110
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:03,120
may this practice of the dharma be for the welfare happiness safety and

111
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:10,159
freedom of all the people and creatures that we

112
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:18,278
encounter may all beings be a beam

113
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:29,390
[Music]

114
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:39,179
so [Music]

115
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:51,158
thank you

116
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:35,278
so warm greetings to you all and for this week

117
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,679
i'd like to take the theme

118
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:46,080
the dharma the dharma that the buddha taught

119
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,919
and there is a ancient

120
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:57,120
teaching about this dharma that the buddha taught

121
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:03,519
that describes how someone understands the dharma

122
00:31:03,519 --> 00:31:08,799
when they have a confirmed confidence

123
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:15,039
in the dharma in the buddha in the practice that we're doing

124
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,919
and this idea of confirmed confidence means that we've we know something we've

125
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:29,919
experienced something for ourselves that we know what the dharma is about

126
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:36,159
we know something in the dharma that there's a confidence a

127
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:41,919
deep sense of maybe maybe faith maybe trust

128
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:48,240
but the most common way to talk about this is a confidence which is peaceful

129
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,159
a peaceful confidence and

130
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,919
this and so to practice to come to an enough

131
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:06,880
to have one's own personal experience that from that experience one feels oh

132
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:13,279
this dharma this teachings of the buddha this world of practice

133
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:20,880
is something i know for myself that well enough that i have confidence in it

134
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:26,960
and one of the kind of tests for this confidence is

135
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:34,000
if someone comes along and like for example i came along and came down sat down one of these

136
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:39,279
7 a.m sittings and i said well you know something

137
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:45,039
i was completely wrong that all this dharma stuff that we've been teaching and doing you know it's

138
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,559
not really you know right and and

139
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:55,600
you know there's probably better things to do with your life and you know i recommend you to kind of give

140
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:02,399
it up and when one has a confirmed confidence because one has experiences the benefits

141
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:08,640
and the transformations and the and the freedom from this practice

142
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,399
that it doesn't matter what i say because you would know you know well i'm sorry

143
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:20,080
for you guild you might say but i know for myself how much i've benefited i know for myself

144
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,679
the value of the dharma this practice that i do and i'll continue

145
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:31,200
and um because i know for myself and and so this idea of this really knowing

146
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:37,519
it and having this confidence so how does one come to that kind of

147
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:43,919
confidence and so the the five there's a five part description

148
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:51,120
of what this well proclaimed dharma the welcome proclaimed

149
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,840
we could say teachings of the buddha but the dharma is not a teaching in the abstract like a set of a creed or a set

150
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:03,440
of prophet propositions the dharma is

151
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,240
is part of our lived experience things that when we discover in our lived experience

152
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:15,280
that shows us a way to live a wise and

153
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:23,520
and good life so what is it about dharma that provides that what do we see what's going on here

154
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,599
and so there's a five-part description and of what we have confidence in and what

155
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:35,679
we know and and it's possible in a sense to do kind of reverse engineering

156
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,280
to understand these five parts and and this will tell us what the dharma is

157
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:48,720
um in some kind of deeper way so as opposed to just some abstract teachings of the buddha or some kind of

158
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:54,720
vague i don't know principles or

159
00:34:55,200 --> 00:35:00,640
natural forces that we connect to it's um you know we really discover it for

160
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:06,560
ourselves and these five qualities of the dharmak five characteristics

161
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:12,320
are frequently chanted when people do in a terrible tradition they chant

162
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:19,520
and the english goes like this the dharma is well proclaimed by the

163
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:26,880
buddha by the blessed one it is visible here and now

164
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:32,720
immediate inviting inspection

165
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:38,880
onward leading and to be personally experienced by the wise

166
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:44,960
so i'll take each of these days we'll take one of those and look at it more deeply

167
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:51,119
so the first one is that um it's called uh san ditico in pali

168
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:58,160
and um and it has it refers to the fact that it's directly visible

169
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:06,000
the dt here means to see what you can be seen and and we often say in english for this

170
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:12,480
phrase visible here and now the here and now is not in the word just

171
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:18,640
like if the word is to be is it's seen uh it's known

172
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,680
and uh the only thing seeing always happens in the here and now and so by adding here and now it's

173
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:31,359
really emphasizing the immediacy of the experience and the immediacy of the knowing of it

174
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:36,800
and it doesn't have to be only with the eyes it says the word is visible but it's

175
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,720
visible with the mind's eye with all the different capacities we have for direct attention

176
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,640
we can sense so we can hear we can feel we can know in the mind directly what's

177
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:55,200
happening and so this is so the dharma that well complained

178
00:36:55,200 --> 00:37:00,320
proclaimed by the buddha is not something that you have to believe or find in a book

179
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:05,359
it's something that we can see for ourselves and in fact sometimes it's said that

180
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:12,079
everything you need to know in buddhism can be discovered by your own powers of observation

181
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:18,160
all but you have to look carefully and maybe the what that the teachings do when the instructions do

182
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:26,320
is to point us to how to see in the present moment so that we that dharma really comes alive for us

183
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,440
but so for today that is the value of our direct experience

184
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:38,560
and to see it clearly when the buddha wanted to explain a bit

185
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:45,440
further what this means san ditiko that the dharma is directly visible here

186
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:52,160
and now he referred to our psychological states

187
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:57,359
that we can feel we can know we can see experience directly

188
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:04,320
that there is kind of unhealthy states of mind present there might be

189
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:10,320
greed or hatred and delusion there might be jealousy or envy or there might be

190
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,400
avariciousness it might be lust there might be

191
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:22,960
anger now there might be you know resentment all kinds of things

192
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:31,839
might be in the mind conceit one can know it directly that is

193
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:37,119
and there's two things that can happen without direct seeing this that

194
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:45,599
in the clear seeing we if the seeing is clear enough strong enough

195
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:52,480
that we are not then identified with those states we're not involved in participating in those states it's

196
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,599
almost like we can instead take a step back and observe what's happening

197
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:03,280
rather than being in the middle of the fray and this is a powerful thing to do

198
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:11,280
for all the kind of difficult states of mind activities and forces that exist within a human being

199
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:16,800
to not be invested in it not be caught by it not be reactive to it not be

200
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,800
struggling with it but to step back step back in a sense open up open up in a

201
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:30,800
sense so there's an over overview of it with mindfulness with awareness there's a clear sense

202
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:38,000
this is happening in the present moment this is here and uh and this is what it feels like

203
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,520
and this is what it's like to know it this is what it's like to step

204
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:48,720
back far enough or step get the overview high enough

205
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:54,960
so oh this is what it's like and then we're not caught in it and involved in it

206
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:01,200
and if we're not caught or involved if we really discover how to see it that

207
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:06,560
kind of way then the these unhealthy states of mind

208
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:14,000
have much less or maybe no power over us and to see the and to see that

209
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:20,640
to see the presence of unhealthy states of mind clinging and grasping and resistance and

210
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:25,839
hating to see it there and then see

211
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:30,078
ourselves being

212
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:39,119
unattached to it unentangled with it to see that we can clearly know it

213
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:47,040
without believing it or being pushed around by it or this is a phenomenal thing to discover

214
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:54,480
even more phenomenal is to see that these unhealthy states of mind can disappear

215
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,160
for some people certain kind of chronically unhealthy states of mind

216
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:05,599
can be so deeply ingrained with we don't even know we don't even know we have it

217
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:12,720
or we don't assume that it's always this way this is part the universe was built this way to have these states of mind

218
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:18,720
but to have these drop away to have the experience of

219
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:24,400
life without them can be life-changing for some people to know

220
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:29,520
that there's another way wow you mean i don't have to always be

221
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:36,079
afraid i don't have to always be aversive i don't have to always be

222
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:41,200
critical or always kind of

223
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:47,760
fighting for what i want it's possible to find some peace in a different way

224
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,200
so when so that's how the buddha kind of elaborate on this idea that the dharma

225
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:59,680
is visible here and now and and so what it means is that we want to

226
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,359
be able to see clearly what is happening for us here and now

227
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:11,920
and what is can be quite marvelous wonderful and wondrous

228
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,359
is we discover our capacity to see us unhealthy states of mind

229
00:42:17,359 --> 00:42:22,560
within us and and not to

230
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:30,240
believe in them or react to them or to use them as a basis for criticizing ourselves

231
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,520
all we're asked to do is to know it directly for what it is

232
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,920
and then we can start seeing the freedom from it the ways in which we can kind of know it

233
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,800
so clearly we're not caught by it so so to see that over and over and over

234
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:54,880
again to see that to develop this capacity to be here and now

235
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,680
is can be a that's kind of the direction that's going

236
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:07,359
so we're cultivating and developing our capacity to be in our lived experience

237
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:15,119
the experience of here the experience of now and the stronger that capacity can be

238
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:20,880
the more we're interested in this the more we decrease

239
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,680
the drive some of the unhealthy often unhealthy drive that pulls us into the

240
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,599
world to the past pulls us into the world of the future pulls us into the world of fantasy and

241
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:40,480
and rumination and and as we do this

242
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,680
we get to appreciate the richness and the

243
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:50,880
texture and the and the all the different

244
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:58,160
heightened opportunities potential that is available here in the present moment now

245
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:04,319
i think of the being fully present here and now as like a

246
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:10,560
like opening a door into it into a multi-dimensional

247
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:18,240
experience of life that is not available if we spend our days in our thoughts past future

248
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:26,560
fantasies desires whatever they might be so the dharma that the buddha taught

249
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:32,800
is something that's directly visible here and now and i'd encourage you for this day of

250
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:38,160
practice that stay that you have before we meet again tomorrow

251
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:44,400
that maybe you can begin

252
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:52,079
not begin but kind of make it make it a task make it a

253
00:44:52,079 --> 00:44:57,520
a real activity of the day to really be present

254
00:44:57,520 --> 00:45:03,119
in a relaxed calm way

255
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,880
with what can be experienced directly here and now

256
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,078
the dharma is visible here and now

257
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:17,318
thank you
