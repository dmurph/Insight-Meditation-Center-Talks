1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:06,240
so welcome so what i want to do today is to read

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,799
and then discuss a famous verse passage from the dhammapada

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,840
that is sometimes called something like the universal

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,640
discipline the word patimoca is the word that's used for the discipline of the monastics they have

5
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:32,238
all these rules they have to follow somewhere between 227 and 311

6
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:38,879
and more some others they stop counting at some point but there's many many rules for

7
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:46,480
monastics as part of their discipline and this one sometimes is considered kind of like the universal

8
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:52,640
rules of discipline the not just applying for monastics but for everyone

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,719
it's a relatively easy to memorize so you might want to

10
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,878
memorize it so this is my translation the first line uh

11
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,720
is translated as most people do and then i in recent times i did this 20 years ago

12
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,880
this translation of the dhammapada but i think i'll offer you my

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:24,320
my more recent doing no evil

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:30,720
engaging in what's skillful and purifying one's mind

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,920
this is the teaching of the buddhas so it's very poignant and it is ending

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,680
with this this is the teachings of the buddha puts this up elevates this as being a

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,320
pretty important little passage and maybe it's the kind of underlying principle that all buddhist teachings

18
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:56,560
can be kind of be an extension of and arise from

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,280
and so uh the word evil i think is a little bit problematic to use it to translate this word

20
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:09,520
the the pali word is papa and whether it should be evil or not i

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,360
doubt it should be evil because in english the word evil has such a huge

22
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:21,200
western judeo-christian association that i don't know if it's appropriate for

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:28,000
indian religions and for buddhism and so i now would like to translate it as

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:35,800
doing nothing malevolent not doing nothing malevolent

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,120
and then engaging in what is skillful the word skillful is kusala

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,200
which can also be translated as wholesome and wholesome has more of a feeling or

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,599
something for me of something that's nourishing something that is healthy health producing

28
00:02:53,599 --> 00:03:00,000
where as skillful has the connotations of uh that just you know you that is

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,040
has someone has is capable of doing something in a useful in a

30
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:11,599
beautiful way or skillful way and it's a very important word and the fact

31
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:17,920
that this word can mean both wholesome and skillful speaks to something very profound about

32
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:25,440
the training in buddhism how we're training ourselves to become skillful in what is wholesome

33
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,680
some translators will simply translate this line as let's say do no evil

34
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,799
do what's good just it's kind of very simple easy to remember then

35
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:43,280
but doing nothing malevolent engaging cultivating

36
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:51,840
intending you know working at doing what is nourishing or healthy or skillful or

37
00:03:51,840 --> 00:04:00,120
wholesome and and then purifying one's mind

38
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:05,920
so when i was thinking about this today i was reminded of

39
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:11,920
medical ethics it's on my mind regularly enough because i'm on a ethics

40
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:17,359
committee at a local hospital so the the the

41
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:24,560
basic ethical principles are quite important for the ethics committee and for

42
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,479
hospital staff to consider and it's a little bit similar in that uh

43
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:37,840
it depending on what order different places have different orders of the basic principles

44
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,840
but is avoiding um

45
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:51,280
maleficent's i think i'm pronouncing it right maleficents so doing harm

46
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,680
doing ill and um doing what is

47
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,840
practicing beneficence so doing what's beneficial

48
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:11,199
and then in hospitals the other important one is respecting the autonomy

49
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,240
of the patient of the person under care that everyone has the ability to make their own choices if or if they do have

50
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,520
the ability sometimes people don't have the ability and that becomes a that's one of the reasons why an ethics

51
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,400
committee in hospital is engaged because if the person can't choose for themselves should it be the doctor

52
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:36,400
should be a wider committee what's the ethics of it and then it's

53
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:41,919
the respect for the patient respect for the the human rights respect for their

54
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,280
dignity kind of respect for patients and and sometimes what's added

55
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:54,400
in hospitals is solidarity that the medical staff should be in solidarity with the patient so i kind of

56
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:02,720
be their champion be their their companion be their you know in their camp kind of

57
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:08,560
so i kind of think that's pretty good for buddhism too

58
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,919
that um so this you know this first two are related for sure

59
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:18,960
and um and so it has this very strong statement the

60
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:26,560
beginning do no evil do nothing malevolent and that's like a line

61
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:32,960
how do you know what's malevolent how do you know what is you know some of it has to do with our intention

62
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:38,000
is there ill will is there hatred um is there hostility

63
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,919
and that's what's for me is behind malevolence making things worse you can make things

64
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,680
worse with good intentions so i also like the idea don't make it

65
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:56,160
worse because there's a little bit higher sensitivity than just simply it was my intention good

66
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,880
and that's sometimes not good enough and so um

67
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,400
but here's it's kind of very clear do know nothing malevolent

68
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,440
the second one it doesn't say do good like you know this is what you have to do

69
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:20,000
it says engage or cultivate develop your capacity to do what is skillful and what is

70
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:25,039
wholesome and those are the things by definition in buddhism

71
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:31,039
that come from non-greed non-hatred non-delusion

72
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:37,199
and then the positive terms of it would be comes from the things that are opposite to greed

73
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:42,560
opposite of hate and opposite of delusion and some people like to make it really

74
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:49,680
simple by saying do what is generous do what is kind or loving

75
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,800
and do what is

76
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:02,160
wise last night i'm still a little bit

77
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:10,720
what's the right word to say here sitting here i'm still under the influence of the movie that i

78
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:17,120
saw last night it was kind of a movie that would kind of

79
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:23,120
discombobulating in some ways and as it discombobulated you

80
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,199
intentionally more and more and more it comes to the final conclusion

81
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,279
which is be kind so is this movie

82
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:41,200
everything everywhere all at once so if you've seen it

83
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,640
if you want to be discombobulated

84
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,720
you can just take the message be kind then you don't have to see the movie

85
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,079
so uh the um

86
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:07,279
and then um in medical ethics one of the challenges

87
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,360
is sometimes there that you don't want to cause harm but you want to benefit and sometimes

88
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:19,040
those two principles are not positioned to each other and so then there's a whole discussion about how to work that

89
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,760
out and i suppose that's also true in our ordinary human life as well that it's not so often so

90
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:32,720
clear you know or so always just one way or the other it's like maybe a little bit of both we we do

91
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:38,080
make it worse i mean some of us uh so you know maybe the transportation

92
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,360
how we got here today you know it's probably made the world worse place

93
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:49,360
but if you if we avoid any kind of making the world worse

94
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,399
would we then not even make it much better and my hope is that

95
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:00,959
is that i mean i've dedicated my life to the idea that buddhist practice and

96
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:06,720
these buddhist values will make the world a better place make better people people who are interested in benefiting

97
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:14,079
the world changing the world for the better and so maybe we have to compromise a little bit you know we drive here and

98
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:19,200
the bigger picture maybe we find it inspires us moves us makes us more capable

99
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:26,480
of living a life that uh that's maybe with the challenges that come so we we become agents for

100
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,399
good in this world for benefit so you know we're balancing all these things

101
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,000
but here the buddhist principle is not make it worse

102
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:44,000
which has beneficial to see that but also has challenges to understand exactly what that is and how do you

103
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,200
balance stuff but here the principle is do nothing malevolent

104
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,760
and that's a kind of i think a wonderful line maybe hard to do

105
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,680
but that's the line we were trying to live on on this side of malevolence

106
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:08,000
we're not going to go into the into doing something intentionally with hostility and harm

107
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,760
and we still might make things worse but at least we know ourselves well enough

108
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,360
that we are not doing anything malevolent you know intentionally and

109
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:24,399
you know most people don't think of themselves this way and it might not be an inspiring

110
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,839
teaching you know do nothing malevolent but

111
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,519
i think this world needs a dedication to this and and for those of us who are

112
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:42,880
basically not malevolent i think it's possible to up the game be even more sensitive more attuned and

113
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:48,160
i think this is one of the things the benefit of buddhist practice is to become more and more attuned to

114
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:53,279
the subtlety in which this works in our minds and our conversations and our

115
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:59,600
our connection to other people and i mean it could be something i don't

116
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,880
know if it's subtle exactly but some of something so small is um

117
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:10,480
the way that you complain you know there might be complaints that are appropriate

118
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,880
you go to the complaints department because you know something didn't work

119
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:22,639
and complaints maybe you know they say something so by the way i want to let you know something didn't work and

120
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:28,800
you know and maybe you should know about this and they say oh thank you we're grateful to know that

121
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:35,440
versus coming say you know you guys messed up

122
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:40,560
and you know then you're kind of like sticking it at them you know and then there's there's malevolence there's some

123
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:47,440
hostility some you know or you know like if you're living with someone and

124
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:53,040
i can't believe you left the dirty dishes in the sink again

125
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:58,079
you know and you know it could you know just you know the tone of voice the way it's said

126
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,680
you're kind of you know you're kind of like angry and so i was a little bit hostile

127
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,279
and it's a complaint right but does a complaint have to be hostile

128
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:14,639
i have a notification to make about dishes in the sink

129
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:20,880
would you like to hear it it would be helpful for me if i could say something about the dishes in the

130
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,839
sink is this the right time and as opposed to growling or something so

131
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:34,240
so i'm just trying to maybe say something something very basic but even this you know as we as we develop in this

132
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:41,279
practice there might be enough we might not think of ourselves in terms of doing something malevolent or evil it's a big it's a big

133
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:47,040
bar right maybe i hope it is but to start becoming looking at it in

134
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:53,440
more subtlety and more subtlety and i think that's natural as people develop

135
00:13:53,440 --> 00:14:00,639
in the mindfulness and the practice and the concentration and the stillness that there's a more and more sensitivity

136
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:05,920
to the impact our own states of mind have the impact of our

137
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:13,040
words the impact of our intentions that we have and one of the principles we'll discover

138
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:21,680
is that if you do something malevolent if you have it do anything with any hostility towards anybody else

139
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:28,639
you might be harming them but you will definitely be harming yourself

140
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,760
and you can't harm anybody else intentionally with malevolence

141
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:40,720
without harming yourself at the same time and i've known people who have only given up their malevolence

142
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,399
when they realized that ouch you know why i had no idea how much i was harming myself

143
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:51,600
i you know people who have harbored resentment

144
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,800
or anger for years and and resentment is a kind of i think it's

145
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:06,240
a kind of malevolence maybe other people use the word differently than i do but i think of it in that way

146
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,720
and um and then i've known people who only after years realizing oh

147
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:18,720
the person i'm resentful to probably doesn't even remember i exist

148
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,000
i'm not harming that person anyway i'm not getting back at that person anyway the only person who's hurting

149
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:29,120
by my continued resentment as myself and i know in some people that was that

150
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:35,920
was the key that oh okay they put it down so this increased sensitivity to this

151
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:44,160
mutuality of you know the harm goes both ways and then this wonderful word uh

152
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,320
skillful or wholesome kusala it also has the same direction that as

153
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:56,000
we've been as if we do something skillful do something good wholesome

154
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:02,079
for the world we're benefiting ourselves if we're cultivating what's good

155
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:08,920
wholesome ethical skillful in ourselves

156
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,600
inevitably it will be beneficial for the world the world needs more examples of people

157
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,639
who are living a skillful wholesome good life

158
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:27,120
now how do we do this and how do we do it so that it's not just um

159
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,519
you know living by principle like this is how i'm supposed to be doing and that's the third principle here

160
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:40,639
purifying one's mind and i don't know how it is for you to hear this term purifying one's mind as a

161
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:47,360
principle i know that for me when i was younger i was

162
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:54,079
repelled by this word purification purity it had connotations of maybe

163
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,639
of some kind of excessive puritanical notions some idea of dualistic ideas that you're either

164
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:07,839
completely pure or not and and um and it seemed like a standard that um

165
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,038
that lended itself to a lot of judgmentalism

166
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:19,839
of people that you know you know if you're not pure you're not good or something

167
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,678
sin and purity kind of idea but over the years

168
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:33,919
i've come to appreciate it more and more and and what i appreciate about it is that

169
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:41,280
i now associate this word purity with something that becomes clean

170
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,320
something that becomes clean for the mind to become clean

171
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:52,559
and uh and to view your own mind and see that it's clean

172
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:58,400
that it's kind of clear there's no there's no um

173
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:03,520
you know there's no i don't know you know you know any negative word we use

174
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:08,559
you know will arouse some resistance for some people

175
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:15,600
but there's no dirt in there there's nothing malevolent there's no hostility

176
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:21,919
there's no nothing greedy there's nothing that we would feel somehow

177
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,960
awkward about having in the mind

178
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:32,880
if um you know your mind got plugged into a monitor so that everyone can see what

179
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,000
goes on in there no look you look oh wow that's what that

180
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,919
person that's what he she they think or are doing

181
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:51,919
so if your mind was public to everyone it would be no problem because it's clean

182
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:56,960
and and you know i think that i came to

183
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,919
appreciate this through doing this buddhist practice where at some point

184
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:11,919
the most beautiful thing that i've ever seen in this world i've seen many beautiful places and

185
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:17,840
many beautiful things but i think that the most beautiful thing a person can encounter and see or

186
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,440
perceive is a clean mind and to have touched that which i feel

187
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:31,520
like i've touched in myself that it's just astounding to see that this is a possibility for us

188
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:37,679
so you know clean your mind we clean our teeth hopefully every day

189
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:45,600
we clean our bodies most days shower or whatever we do and we clean our dishes

190
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,880
why not our minds and you know if you brush your teeth

191
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:57,039
twice a day maybe you should clean your mind twice a day meditate twice a day why not

192
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:03,520
you know why isn't it why not why do it is that the mind is probably

193
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:07,400
one of the most influential

194
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:16,320
forces in this universe of ours one of the most influential at least in the human world

195
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:21,600
it's like really really influential and

196
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,919
the harm comes from it the desirable benefit comes from it love comes from it hate comes from it

197
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:34,400
and so to clean the mind and then or empty the mind another way of saying

198
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:40,640
it is to empty the mind of great hatred and delusion empty the mind of of attachment

199
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:47,600
and then the amazing thing happens is that uh it just feels natural then

200
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,799
to avoid malevolence it's not like a moral injunction you're just like of

201
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:58,240
course why would i why would i do something malevolent when

202
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:04,880
that's doesn't just make the mind dirty again it actually scars the mind

203
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:11,919
it's a powerful language isn't it it scars the mind that if the mind is overly scarred one

204
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,360
more scar you don't notice you don't even know you're doing it but when the mind becomes clean you see the effect it

205
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:23,600
has and then and then engage in what's skillful and

206
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:29,760
what's nourishing what's wholesome it's not an injunction it's like of course

207
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:36,240
that's what the clean mind wants to do that's what it is about is to do the things which are clean to

208
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,960
do the things which are healthy that's nourishing supportive

209
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:49,039
and and so the last one purifying the mind uh i was um

210
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:56,480
uh i had a little bit struggle with that for a while because i came my first uh buddhist practice was

211
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:01,520
in mahayana buddhism the buddhism of zen buddhism where they had

212
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:08,080
three kind of principles like this the first two are basically the same

213
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:15,120
avoid evil do everything that's good but the third one was

214
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:22,080
liberate all beings so there's an idea of compassion and i love that the idea that we'd live

215
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:29,520
for the liberation for the benefit of others and that that was a dedication to practice for that purpose

216
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:35,679
and then the criticism of mahayana of our tradition is that we're the selfish ones

217
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:42,960
we're the ones who are just involved in our you know our own practice for our own liberation so then the contrast of

218
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:49,440
this line purify your mind versus liberate all beings seems to accentuate

219
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:55,440
this divide and so i was a little bit troubled by this for a while but i came eventually

220
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,200
to realize that um that these two things are not so separate

221
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:08,240
that if we clean our mind purify our mind empty our mind it's uh then there's this greater

222
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:13,360
sensitivity to harm and to

223
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:19,280
other people and the state of other people empathy mirroring other people understanding other people

224
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:24,799
caring for other people that the natural outcome of a clean mind

225
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:31,039
is in some appropriate way for each person that we do care we do want to liberate we do want other people to

226
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:36,799
benefit and it's a little bit like you know on the airplane where you're supposed to take the

227
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:42,240
oxygen mask for yourself first before doing the children or someone who needs help

228
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:50,520
um it's a little bit like that that you know before you help someone else not be malevolent

229
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:56,080
maybe you should do it yourself first because how much how much good how well

230
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:02,159
can you help other people to be non-malevolent if you're still being malevolent

231
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:08,480
how how much can you help other people to do things which are skillful if you don't know what's skillful or what's what's

232
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:14,320
wholesome having to cultivate it for yourself and so these these all go together and i

233
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,919
don't think that the any of these are so separate self and other benefiting oneself

234
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:26,080
benefiting others they come to they can become more they come together more and more as we practice in buddhism

235
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:33,039
as as a singular whole and and with inseparable from each other and that just seems so beautiful to me

236
00:24:33,039 --> 00:24:39,360
that that's the case so um these

237
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,039
um three principles that kind of

238
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:51,840
kind of simplify all the rest of buddhism and some of buddhism is philosophically

239
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:59,559
profound which can mean sometimes that it's

240
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:09,919
difficult to understand complicated but if you remember it all arises from

241
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:15,279
these simple principles everything is an expression of that or manifestation of that or a

242
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:20,320
commentary on that or or support for that

243
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:27,120
you know then maybe it's all kind of simple so i'll read it again with my current

244
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:34,799
um translation choice doing nothing malevolent

245
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:42,960
engaging in what is skillful wholesome and purifying one's mind this is the

246
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,960
teaching of the buddhas

247
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:57,760
so that's the talk we have a few more minutes left in the time that we for the scheduled

248
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,279
dharma talk time and then after this we'll have a picnic outside for those of you like to stay

249
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:08,720
but if you'd like to ask any questions or have any commentary about what i said

250
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:13,200
you're welcome too and um

251
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:23,039
uh thank you dr bronson i thought your uh commentary about

252
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:28,400
the the medical connection was pretty apt i believe that the foot that goeth alma was actually referred to as the

253
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,520
physician so i just found that connection nice

254
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:39,679
yeah yeah i'm inspired by the connection as well or the overlap and and inspired by the medical ethics and

255
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:47,120
just in general it's i wish it the rest of society would adopt it yeah

256
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,279
thank you

257
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:59,559
yeah you can pass that back but edna speak first

258
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,320
you very much for the talk girl um i have a question about uh you know purifying the mind and cleaning one's

259
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:18,960
mind what about when the emotions are really strong and kind of rule then

260
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,600
how i guess what would be the the method of cleaning ones cleaning

261
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:32,000
one's teeth cleaning one's mind with strong emotions yeah i think that uh

262
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:38,000
meditation practice is a optimal way of doing it for many people because we're cultivating the

263
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,600
mindfulness to recognize what's happening in the mind and the recognition is

264
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,520
is very very helpful especially if the recognition of what's in the mind goes together with

265
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:54,640
relaxing the mind settling the mind stabilizing the mind because then you're

266
00:27:54,640 --> 00:28:00,799
beginning to let go of the agitation of the difficult aspects of mind the

267
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:05,840
unclean aspects of the mind and so to see it clearly and allow it to settle

268
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:13,840
and that more it settles the more you see kind of a calm mind a clear mind a clean mind

269
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:18,960
then the more you have a new perspective to catch the

270
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:26,399
the difficulties that arise when they do arise because we have this background now of like a clean cloth you

271
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:32,080
see a little you know spot of grease on it right away but a really a

272
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:37,440
cloth that's full of grease you don't see one more spot so we start seeing more and more so i

273
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,679
think meditation is a great way to do it thank you and everything else buddhism

274
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:46,080
teach us

275
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:54,720
um yeah there's i really appreciated the talk i think there's so much so simple

276
00:28:54,720 --> 00:29:01,200
but so complicated as well in terms of how to apply but i just wanted to make a

277
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:08,399
comment the idea about resentment for um a good friend of mine had said resentment is like taking the pills and

278
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,919
expecting the other person to die

279
00:29:24,799 --> 00:29:31,600
i've watched some videos on medical ethics in my teaching and i remember one of the

280
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:38,880
pillars the four pillars one of them is justice yeah and i was thinking about justice as

281
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:44,720
yeah that's sort of working things out in the bigger system in the whole

282
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,200
community maybe more of a sangha way of looking at things yeah yeah justice yeah and also sometimes that has to do with

283
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:56,880
equity and fairness and the fair fair big part of it is the fair

284
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:04,240
usage of limited medical resources who gets it and how do you decide who gets it when it's limited and how is it

285
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,840
how is it justice how is it fair and

286
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,640
there's one back there oh yeah go ahead

287
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:24,880
so grappled a little bit with the the speed

288
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:30,720
of response so the dirty dishes analogy for example the one you gave

289
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:36,399
the amount of time it took to settle yourself and ask the question you

290
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:42,320
know rather than the gruff like why are the dishes dirty again

291
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,600
you know the calm equipoise non malevolent way

292
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:54,880
feels like the environment is our dirty dishes and our response is not speedy enough

293
00:30:54,880 --> 00:31:00,559
so how do we approach that with non-malevolence

294
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:07,760
if if you understand the question well maybe not but let me try anyway is that um

295
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:14,159
i think that as we develop mindfulness more ability to monitor ourselves as we do it we

296
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:20,159
might not have the capacity to notice the subtlety of the intentions what we're doing in the mind

297
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:26,720
but ideally we get enough ability to monitor what we say and what we do with our

298
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:32,480
hands and and so to really bring a lot of attention to

299
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:38,399
the our tongue and our and our body and

300
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:43,440
and then learn how to restrain and then

301
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,480
at least restrain any anytime you're going to say something that you have doubts whether this is really kind

302
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:55,600
and and and uh and so

303
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:01,039
and that restraint which is not very popular thing to do might be the protection you need so you

304
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:06,960
have the time then to go to go look deeper and that's why the principle of do know

305
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,440
don't make it worse so just learn to restrain learn to hold back

306
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,480
and um and so if your hand goes into a fist

307
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:25,440
you know restrained well and the follow-up there is the even

308
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,799
the restraint feels like a um an injury to self like as i contemplate

309
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,240
climate change and and what i should be doing yeah if i'm not doing then i'm

310
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:44,240
somehow harming myself and not really um all that

311
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:51,519
a beneficent actor yeah so so uh we do the best we can but i

312
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:57,120
don't make it worse so so if uh if you're

313
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:04,080
the best you can do is not make it worse in the environment but you're still you know harming yourself in some way

314
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:11,440
but you also want to kind of look more deeply at how you're harming yourself you know yes if you're driving a car

315
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,200
you are indirectly harming yourself coming back comes back to you a little bit

316
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:22,320
uh but if uh but but uh if then you're um uh

317
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:29,679
drowning in guilt grounding and self-hostility drowning in in self-criticalism

318
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,360
then then you've added maleficence towards yourself

319
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:42,720
then there's a malevolent feelings attitudes towards oneself and any malevolence is not needed

320
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,919
so so then the training the practice is to discover how not to view oneself or to add

321
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,360
malevolence hatred hostility towards oneself and and

322
00:33:55,360 --> 00:34:00,880
and that's i think is brilliant how to live in this world without

323
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,120
malevolence towards oneself or others so we're not struggling with guilt and in buddhist in

324
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:13,919
the buddhist definition of guilt it isn't just simply that we did something that's wrong and know

325
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:19,599
it guilt is has a sense of self-hatred in it

326
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:27,358
and so the practice is to purify ourselves of that that's as important as not having malevolence out there harming out there

327
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,839
you know you don't want to pollute yourself this reminds me of that penultimate um

328
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:39,919
moment of the buddha's enlightenment where he turns to in inwards and notices the second arrow

329
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:46,560
yes and pulls that out and this is but i've been stuck with that second arrow recently

330
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:52,560
with some of these uh you know the the events of the

331
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,920
the globe yeah yeah it's challenging to be a human being especially in this modern world

332
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,480
and so part of part of part of the skill of practice is also to learn to somehow

333
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,599
be a little bit more relaxed or have the capacity of have the capacity

334
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:15,119
to feel the discomfort that we feel to feel the challenges of the mind and

335
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:21,520
and not not to add second third or fourth arrows but to kind of somehow build the ability

336
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:28,560
to open up kindly to how challenging this for us and what we're doing in our inside

337
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:35,040
so one last one behind you okay thank you very much um

338
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,359
i just wanted to sort of add one one slight thought on the

339
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:48,240
physician's oath which also begins with first do no harm yeah and it seems

340
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:55,119
really interesting that there's not only that parallel but the comment you made about the rules for

341
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,720
the monastics in some sense the physician has an extra

342
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:08,000
obligation as a decision maker or someone who's in charge of the the patient's life

343
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,040
and another way that they sometimes think about it is don't let the perfect be the enemy of

344
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,200
the good which goes back to your initial point of you know don't make it worse yeah so

345
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:26,720
that that's something that i've sort of ruminated on as as you're um a dharma talk sort of unfolded and it

346
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,079
thought great sure thank you yeah it's a wonderful principle don't

347
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:38,839
make it worse i think it's fantastic to carry that with you and like what

348
00:36:38,839 --> 00:36:45,520
what thank you so much there's now we're going to take one question from the youtube audience that someone put in the

349
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:52,320
chat so so uh so evelyn asks um gail how do you

350
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:58,720
navigate the idea of putting one's mind on a screen where everyone can see how clean it is

351
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:03,760
with avoiding shame and embarrassment about all of the current blotches

352
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:09,359
he has a good question how to avoid shame and embarrassment um

353
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:15,599
well some degree of embarrassment seems healthy you know it's not

354
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:22,000
that does not necessarily uh self-harm or not necessarily self-hatred or something it's just like

355
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,200
oh you know this is unfortunate and um but shame maybe is much more painful

356
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:35,040
and difficult and and so what degree shame has some kind of self-harming aspect to it that's unnecessary

357
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:40,320
it's a profound thing there's a lot of people who feel shame and it's a difficult state and one that

358
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,079
sometimes learn from society learn from

359
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:53,599
other people and and we internalize it for ourselves

360
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:59,119
so it might be that before uh making your mind public to everyone

361
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:04,400
maybe resolving the issue of shame understanding a little bit the the

362
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,480
you know i don't want to make it harder for anybody this idea of of shame what i'm about to say

363
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:16,560
uh it's meant to be kind of freeing and compassionate but shame uh is uh

364
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:22,720
involves a degree of conceit and not the conceit of being arrogant the conceit of being a little bit

365
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,880
excessively preoccupied with ourselves with self-identity and how we're represented how we're seeing and how

366
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:35,280
we're understood and of course we are that way where our society trains us to be that way

367
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:42,079
but buddhism buddhist practice shows us how much we can let go of self-preoccupation self-definition

368
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:48,000
um kind of the attachment to self-ideas that we have self views about oneself

369
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:55,599
and then it's a lot easier to um to have our behavior transparent so

370
00:38:55,599 --> 00:39:03,280
other people can see it because we don't um we don't feel um

371
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:09,040
it doesn't get stuck in our self-concept for ourselves we don't we don't linger in it we try to do

372
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:14,720
better but we don't define ourselves by it so to really study this idea of shame

373
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,880
and free ourselves from before we become more transparent i think it's really worthwhile

374
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:28,320
uh when i was i was ordained as a zen priest and monk 40 years ago

375
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,320
and and one of the remarkable things that happened with that

376
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:40,800
ordination that i wasn't thinking about or planning it just kind of happened and i saw in the weeks after the ordination

377
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,560
was that um now i was a public figure you know i had a shaved head i wore robes

378
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:51,760
and um and so much i called it my shortcomings were

379
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,760
much more obvious and i was much more conscious of them that i had before

380
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,800
and and at the same time

381
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,839
it was more okay to have them but it wasn't like i barreled ahead and

382
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:13,040
just did terrible things in the world because i had these shortcomings i i was going to practice with them and try to

383
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:19,040
work with them and i had anger so i had to kind of work with my anger and try to keep it in check so it didn't didn't

384
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,520
cause harm but i became much more sensitive to these shortcomings but it was more okay to have them

385
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:31,839
because in the language i had back then i was now a child of the buddha

386
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:38,560
i had been ordained and somehow being a child of the buddha was now in the fold of the buddha's lap

387
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,200
you know it's not being held by some this compassionate caring force in the universe somehow

388
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:50,480
and i was accepted for who i was as a practitioner with my shortcomings

389
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:57,119
so it was wonderful i thought it was really significant to both become more sensitive to my

390
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:03,680
shortcomings so i could practice with them and work with them and clean at the same time it was in certain kind

391
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:08,800
of way more okay to have them and and that made it a lot easier to work

392
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:15,359
with them if because i didn't have the conceit the concern i didn't feel the

393
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:22,640
shame for having them it's more like of course i have them now i get to practice with them

394
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:27,760
so evelyn i hope my answer is a very important question you asked and i hope that my

395
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,800
my answers gives you something to chew on that's useful
