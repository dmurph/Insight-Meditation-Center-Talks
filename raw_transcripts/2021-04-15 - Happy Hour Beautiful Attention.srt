1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,120
okay great so hello hello and welcome to all of you

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,480
wherever you are zooming in from all over the place and i missed

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:19,680
susan from santa cruz and uh awawas

4
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:28,880
thank you yes hello to all of you wherever you are zooming in from or

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:36,960
or youtubing from or or listening to this on audio dharma later so lovely to be with you so

6
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,120
so for today's practice um

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,760
this this practice is inspired by um a talk i was listening to by my friend

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:59,120
catherine mcgee who teaches uh in england and the title of the talk was

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:06,799
something like your attention can be beautiful um so and that's been swinging

10
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:12,479
and swinging in my mind so of course i'll offer my own version of that

11
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:20,560
related to happy or in practice of the heart so so

12
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:29,600
so to consider that you're always paying attention you are always paying attention

13
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,640
somehow to something and we're often focusing on the object

14
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:44,640
well actually most of the time we're not even aware that we're paying attention because it feels um as if we are

15
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,840
in autopilot and we just do things and our attention

16
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:59,439
wanders from one object to another to another so there isn't even a sense of awareness

17
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:08,000
that we're paying attention but often we might be aware that we are

18
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:14,000
paying attention and we might only be aware of the object we're paying attention to

19
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,200
say if you are on the computer sending an email you're sending you're

20
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,879
paying attention to the email you're sending or right now maybe you're paying attention to the

21
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:33,599
sound of my voice or maybe to the sensations in your body or to the colors on the screen etc

22
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:40,239
now just as important as to what we're paying attention to

23
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,720
is how we are paying attention what is the quality

24
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,080
is our attention tight are we tightening the body trying to

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,760
bear down say on the breath in order to get concentrated

26
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:07,680
yes perfectly good intention beautiful intention to to settle the mind etc and yet how

27
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:15,519
are we engaging what is the quality of the attention

28
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:22,000
is it tight is it way too lax is it

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,159
just wandering from one object to the next etc

30
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,640
is the quality that attention is imbued in

31
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:44,239
is it judgmental is it grabbing is it grasping is it

32
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,920
perhaps pushing away the object it's aware of

33
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:59,519
so becoming aware paying attention to how we are paying

34
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,640
attention [Music] and as relevant for our cultivation here

35
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,720
in happy hour is noticing

36
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,739
or perhaps seeding or cultivating whether the quality of our attention

37
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:22,160
[Music] is imbued

38
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,479
with friendliness

39
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:36,960
ah with openness with a gentle kind curiosity

40
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,160
this is this meta that can infuse this friendliness

41
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:50,720
this non-judgmental stance that awareness can be imbued and how are

42
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:59,199
we paying attention how are we meeting the breath

43
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:06,560
how is the attention needing the body how is the attention meeting thoughts

44
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,840
that are arising

45
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:20,000
perhaps one distinction that i was thinking earlier about a cartoon that could be

46
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:28,320
made in on one that with two images of a meditator who's a beginner and just

47
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,440
started to meditate and one who's an experienced meditator

48
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:38,479
practitioner and in one in on one side

49
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:46,240
the experience the inexperience the new practitioner meditator is the the thought bubble

50
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:54,080
is oh darn it i was thinking oh i was thinking again this is terrible

51
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:00,639
i i can't do this thing i can't do this meditation thing i'm a failure i'm a loser my mind keeps

52
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,759
wandering i must be defective everybody else they you know can just be clear and spacious

53
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:15,520
and i keep thinking okay that's on the right hand side and on the left hand side the thought bubble of the experienced

54
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,960
practitioner says ah thinking is arising

55
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,520
thinking is arising our thinking has arisen it's just like that so

56
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:35,039
how are we paying attention how are we aware of the thoughts that are coming up

57
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:42,960
is it with a sense of unfriendliness oh i'm a failure uh thoughts go away i'm just like oh

58
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:49,759
interesting thinking is has arisen has arisen and or is arising just

59
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,680
the sense of openness spaciousness this friendliness of meta where things

60
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,360
can arise and pass without becoming sticky

61
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:08,000
so so in the practice today i've said plenty to frame or practice

62
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:15,120
inviting us with meta with kindness with ease

63
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:21,759
to become aware of how we are paying attention and in that way

64
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:28,840
may our attention become beautiful may our attention become filled with

65
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:37,759
this ease of spaciousness this quality this quality this freeing quality of the

66
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:43,440
heart and mind itself so let's begin

67
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:49,120
let's begin let's settle into our

68
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:59,840
ah into our bodies into our breath

69
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,840
and then writing fighting

70
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,919
our attention to release to let go ever so gently

71
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:28,400
of thoughts of preoccupations

72
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:44,240
and to turn to turn inward turn inward towards the body

73
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:55,839
this whole body sitting and breathing

74
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:23,200
and from the outset noticing if the attention is tight if the body is tight

75
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:32,639
there is a sense of bearing down [Music] or can there be a sense of spaciousness

76
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,399
attention awareness

77
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:51,839
like a comfortable bed that we rest on

78
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,279
like the air that can infuse like the breath that goes through the

79
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:18,640
body is breathed in on its own

80
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:33,839
in on its own gently

81
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:52,959
and not getting too self-conscious at this point about wait how am i paying attention just let go

82
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,600
let go

83
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:08,160
we can turn off our awareness or attention just so let it be let it be just as it is

84
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,480
receiving whatever is arising and this

85
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:29,839
fear of awareness in this moment

86
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,120
letting each breath be received

87
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,480
and the lower body and the abdomen [Music]

88
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,880
the tension awareness connecting

89
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:07,760
intimately not tightly but intimately as if

90
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:18,800
as if attention is the water the breath is swimming in as if the breath was a swimmer

91
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:30,079
swimming coming in contact to contact with

92
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:37,839
awareness the entire body of the swimmer immersed in water

93
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:45,839
the entire body of the breath beginning middle and end

94
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:53,839
immersed touched gently soothed

95
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:13,839
caressed by awareness

96
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,000
and if and when thoughts arise

97
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,558
notice our thoughts are rising thoughts have arisen

98
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:11,600
and notice the quality with which

99
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,839
thinking is being noted

100
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:29,280
is the knowing the quality of knowing spacious friendly

101
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,480
or is it aversive

102
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,880
is it like a generous host ah this is what's

103
00:17:44,880 --> 00:18:00,000
present right now where visitors come and go

104
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:04,799
or is the quality imbued with the resistance

105
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:15,840
calling them distractions

106
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:35,120
and notice how the attitude of the kind generous guest could be one of

107
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:43,840
oh hello visitor thank you

108
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,960
and this is not the best time to visit see how can that be how that can be very

109
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:58,480
spacious and easy lovingly firm

110
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,080
please come back another time thank you

111
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:13,120
no trace of ill will

112
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:25,840
the heart the mind the mind heart the chitta

113
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:39,840
kind generous as wide as the world

114
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:53,840
we're always paying attention

115
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:21,840
how how are we paying attention

116
00:20:54,240 --> 00:21:00,158
can awareness attention be imbued with friendliness

117
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,280
with meta these qualities beautiful qualities of

118
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:17,840
the heart and mind

119
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:26,320
and now what if the sense of

120
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:31,759
the self self as the center of the world

121
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:41,840
it's the constant frame of reference

122
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:56,720
what if that was loosened with this quality of meta

123
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:06,559
be more easily accessible when there isn't so much me and mine

124
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:23,840
in my self-interest what i like or dislike

125
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:37,840
what does this say about me what if that was dropped

126
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:59,039
what are we attending to and how are we attending

127
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:07,840
can we notice tension and its quality with metta

128
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:39,600
and now can we expand instead of just being internal with our

129
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:45,840
awareness can we turn awareness to be external

130
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:53,440
as if aware of other beings around us with us

131
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:03,840
in space and time

132
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,880
awareness turned external

133
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:18,960
to humans non-humans

134
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:22,240
plants etc

135
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:31,840
the air the earth

136
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:39,520
and can there be a sense of benevolence kindness

137
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
meta-infused

138
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:59,840
with attention turned outward

139
00:29:00,399 --> 00:29:04,720
any object it comes in contact with

140
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,840
sense of friendliness

141
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:12,559
can attention turning external and now internal both external and internal

142
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:16,880
whatever objects of the mind

143
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,840
thought internal external comes in contact with

144
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:37,760
be infused with goodwill friendliness

145
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:51,840
and matter

146
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,799
even if what we meet internally externally is challenging

147
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:33,840
can the stance of awareness be a friendly one curious open

148
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:47,840
patient

149
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:55,440
and for the last moments of this practice as we come to an end

150
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,660
and we gather ourselves up and perhaps an evaluation

151
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:09,839
[Music] attention to evaluation comes up

152
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,720
can we see can we attend

153
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:25,680
this evaluation if it's coming up with kindness

154
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:35,200
it's not judgment or friendliness no matter how

155
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:40,320
challenged or challenging sleepy [Music]

156
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:45,599
distracted this period of practice was

157
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:54,000
bringing appreciation that we showed up we showed up as best as we're able to

158
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:59,760
and appreciating with friendliness

159
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:08,560
and love thank you me thanks for showing up as best as you're able to planting seeds

160
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:16,079

161
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:33,838
showing up for yourself and all beings whose lives you touch

162

169
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:38,079
for you i'll share that noticing how we're paying attention turning awareness on awareness to

170
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:43,200
quality when we see that it can free something it can

171
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:50,240
something can let go something can release and more kindness more ease more

172
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:56,400
spaciousness more meta can come in through that process

173
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,799
did many of you have an experience of that even for a split second

174
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:11,839

176
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:28,480
and my breath was anxious and then when you said can you let go of the self

177
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:38,400
at i i took my breath away i was like gasping for breath and then

178
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,200

profound right profound that that is possible

182
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,680
that is possible and it can it can happen just like that by

183
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:21,359
inclining by turning the attention the self dropping away so much space

184
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:29,119
there can be beautiful all you're doing yay or all your all your non-doing well all

185
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:34,160
none you're doing

186
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,078
thanks for sharing that mary beautiful

187
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,839
what any other reflections observations

188
00:41:52,160 --> 00:42:03,838
questions complaints

189
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:42,480
i'll ask you a question that um [Music] with the invitation internal

190
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:50,720
external turning awareness internal external did you notice a shift there is there something

191
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:59,839
in the inside perhaps something that came up or different aspects

192
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:08,880
or as mary talked about ah the self dropping away or noticing thoughts arising kind of the

193
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:14,160
stance of friendliness arising and passing with the thoughts

194
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:27,838
gracious host

195
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:39,040
was there anything particularly challenging that didn't quite that was confusing instruction that

196
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:55,839
would be helpful to unpack

197
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:04,720
so how about we turn to practice in

198
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:10,720
small groups in sangha and there as you share and you listen to others i think

199
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:19,760
different reflections might come up there's so much to learn from each other

200
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:25,280
so the invitation is let's start with

201
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:32,960
30 seconds of silent meta for each other and then whatever

202
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:40,960
reflections you like to share with each other about the practice

203
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:48,079
so i'm going to open the rooms here we go enjoy meeting and practicing

204
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:54,319
together okay welcome back everyone the rooms are closed

205
00:44:54,319 --> 00:45:04,960
so what did you discover discussing in community sangha practice

206
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:11,599
love to hear something you've noticed please don't be shy especially if you don't tend to speak

207
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:14,880
in in group

208
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:23,599
trusting that your observations your insights your questions your confusion

209
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:33,838
is valuable to offer that if you wish

210
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:44,400
um hi it's michael um it was super sweet and there were four of us and we kind of

211
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:49,680
ran out of time meaning there was not enough time for the shares

212
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,720
and i hope the woman who wanted to share something but she

213
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:02,079
said she thought it would take four minutes we'll share whatever she's gonna share because i'm interested deep vows to you

214
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:08,160

217
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:31,920
so i'm the one oh great and i'll try to be fast but i was at

218
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:37,920
dinner tonight with a friend i'm three hours ahead of you so it's almost 10 o'clock

219
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:46,720
and um i wasn't feeling it but i practiced loving kindness anyway and i was in the previous um

220
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:52,880
retreat the one before i did it anyway i was really blah and negative and then

221
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:59,359
i was eating eating mindfully at dinner or attempting to and every now and then i would take

222
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:04,720
really serious breasts and just be with myself although i was listening

223
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:11,520
and both the internal and external came into play i was very much with him

224
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:19,359
and settled within myself and very much feeling her without boundaries and that

225
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:25,119
was our dinner it wasn't a perfect dinner but then as we were walking back

226
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:32,160
i something so struck me and i had it just came to me i

227
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:37,760
totally understood her profound profound fear she had this past year of the

228
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:43,200
coronavirus which i had been putting down and she was just always had been this

229
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:48,240
way and i'm not and we live in a city where it kind of gripped us

230
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:54,800
and i finally felt into something for the first time and then also during the course of

231
00:47:54,800 --> 00:48:01,599
dinner uh the family i got to get a really clear sadness about something so i

232
00:48:01,599 --> 00:48:09,119
processed that sadness is here i mean i sound like i'm this is this is dinner tonight my sadness is

233
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:14,960
here and i started to breathe again and i didn't analyze it i just said what is this i went through that

234
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,640
she's talking so by the time i got home tonight and set up everything i thought

235
00:48:20,640 --> 00:48:29,119
what just happened so all these various experiences of meta self-compassion

236
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,440
just started playing that's my story it was like this

237
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:41,280
record of things playing one to another nice thank you thanks diana thanks for sharing i'm so

238
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:48,720
appreciating oh what you shared i'll reflect a couple of things back um as you were in the retreat uh the

239
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:56,160
meta and wisdom retreat a couple weeks ago so you're saying you've been practicing and and this is what i always

240
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:01,440
tell practitioners on retreats that your retreat isn't finished it's going to keep doing you and that's

241
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:07,599
what that's what i'm hearing that you know your dinner with this friend there's this sense of oh internal

242
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:14,000
external and the heart opening up to their fear to their worry like feeling into it really

243
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:19,040
connecting with it and um just the

244
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:26,079
the you know the retreat is continuing is doing you in so many ways internally externally with a sense of openness and

245
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:31,760
kindness and compassion internal external being in your experience opening up to sadness

246
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:38,640
and conversations that are pushing it away it's just it's all here it's all it can all be included lovely thank you

247
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:45,119
for sharing that it's beautiful a beautiful detailed observation of how practice can unfold

248
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:50,160
no great miracle during the retreat or afterwards it's just

249
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:56,800
these things coming along and um like almost out of nowhere not planned

250
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:02,720
although i'm practicing that's you planted seeds in diana you planted seeds and now the

251
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:12,160
seeds are being uh bearing fruit thank you yeah so any last quake reflections about

252
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:18,319
you know this paying attention quality of paying attention knowing how we're paying attention we're

253
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:21,599
