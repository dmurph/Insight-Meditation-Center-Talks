1
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:11,099
ah welcome uh of

2
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:16,320
discussion practice on the theme of the 10 Perfections the

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,279
parties so nice

4
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,859
um again sorry to be just a couple of minutes late I will um I'll try opening the room

5
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,680
a little earlier tomorrow um yeah that way if there's any technical

6
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,899
bubbles we don't lose any time together

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,360
so yesterday we talked about the the Perfections of energy

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,660
and patience and I'm wondering if um as before we get into the

9
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,360
the meditation itself for the day if there's anyone who you know reflected on these

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:09,080
two during the day looked for how they showed up if you want to put any comments in the chat I offer that invitation

11
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:16,140
so yesterday we had a look at some of the ways particularly that

12
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:23,159
energy and patients work together and today we're turning our attention to

13
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,420
truthfulness and resolve or determination

14
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,479
so let's um let's move into the meditation

15
00:01:45,299 --> 00:01:54,240
this is a this is a guided meditation on the theme

16
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,298
of our our noting practice

17
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,520
and I want to call this honest noting

18
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:12,319
let's first settle ourselves here

19
00:02:52,319 --> 00:03:00,620
um just forgiving our way back into intimacy with the body

20
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,480
all of our efforts and activities

21
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:18,560
and this body this breathing body is right here

22
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:51,260
and we have a an ally in the silence

23
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,799
between the sounds between the thoughts

24
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:08,720
letting us in the direction of Stillness

25
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,259
the Simplicity of here

26
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:38,880
and I would suggest using a small

27
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:44,000
note light whisper in the mind

28
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:55,580
to it identify recognize

29
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,960
what's being noticed now

30
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:07,100
often we begin with the breathing

31
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:16,039
putting in another inhale out and the exhale

32
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:43,199
the note is not meant to lead the attention

33
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,660
but confirms what's been recognized

34
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:46,279
with the intention to clearly know

35
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,120
particulars of this experience

36
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,480
seeing it honestly

37
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:15,560
breathing in a little label little note in the mind

38
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:26,959
it's in her naming aligning with our experience

39
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:06,380
tuning our energy

40
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:17,820
so that the attention stays clear this is what's happening now

41
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:23,120
this now this

42
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,940
and that's last minute

43
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:21,919
to continue with the noting practice

44
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,539
sensing the way in which

45
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:33,919
this simple naming of experience

46
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:42,620
turns the mind in to honesty truthfulness

47
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:43,790
[Music]

48
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,360
foreign

49
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,539
so hello again

50
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:44,520
summarize a bit of our our last session we we talked about how the parames the

51
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:50,760
Perfections of energy and patience work together how they support each other and

52
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:56,940
we looked at this skill of tuning Our energy such that it's appropriate for

53
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:03,779
um both the situation and the activity that we're engaged in and they looked at how

54
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:10,860
um the wisdom that we're involved in this complex set of processes we call life

55
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:16,860
supports our patients and then Donald Paula picks up the

56
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,679
thread here and he says it's entirely through the spiritual power of energy

57
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:29,940
that the practice of all of the qualities of Enlightenment succeed it's long list long list long list and

58
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:36,779
then he includes in that list of what's achieved through energy the determination upon truth

59
00:26:36,779 --> 00:26:43,440
so this is where we'll continue our exploration of the Perfections with truthfulness and determination

60
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,779
resolve so let's get specific about what we mean

61
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:54,240
in this context so um the Perfection of truthfulness

62
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,960
we're talking about non-deceptiveness non-deceptiveness in speech accompanied

63
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,799
as all the Perfections are by compassion and skillful means we're honest with an eye Torah the

64
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:14,640
skillfulness of the moment and an eye toward um the effect on each other

65
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:21,960
with our with our open heart or their affect so this is the Perfection of truthfulness non-deceptiveness

66
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:30,000
and then the Perfection of determination or resolve um is unshakable determination

67
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:37,140
to undertake all of the good qualities for the good of others

68
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:44,480
accompanied by compassion and skillful means so to move in just a layer closer

69
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:50,720
we break these down into practices of truthfulness

70
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:56,220
practices of restraint things that uh maybe get in the way of truthfulness

71
00:27:56,220 --> 00:28:04,080
and then how compassionate and skillful things play a role um the the obvious thing to avoid when

72
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:09,659
practicing truthfulness is deceptiveness in our speech and then the volition is to speak what's

73
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:15,179
true it's skillful it's beneficial and for determination of course we

74
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:20,220
undertake all of this beneficial activity and we refrain

75
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:26,720
from straying off and putting our effort somewhere else actually

76
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,179
so let's look a bit more closely at truthfulness we'll look at some of the encouraged

77
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:37,580
practices before we talk about refinements so

78
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:44,100
truthfulness is said to make patients long lasting

79
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,740
and staying in alignment with truth makes our patients long lasting

80
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:58,520
and this manifests as something we call Devotion to truth then they ring Adele for some of us

81
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:06,720
so buoyed by this patient endurance that we've been cultivating when someone uh hurts us

82
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,020
when someone maybe does wrong are resolve to truthfulness is meant to not waver

83
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:19,020
and this is a practice this is a practice uh Suzuki roshi said I can't find quite

84
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:26,419
where the where the story happened but he's he's known to have said you don't know how hard it is to love some people

85
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:32,419
and this is a person who is devoted to caring for others

86
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:38,279
but despite it being hard I trust he remained honest

87
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:45,419
so the sutas the Buddha speaks of safeguarding the truth maybe you've seen this in majima 95 and we do this by by

88
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:53,220
being explicit and clear about what the bases are for our views I have such and

89
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:58,380
such opinion based on this according to this without the accompanying demand

90
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:05,039
that is only this is true anything else is wrong I've got the one right View and

91
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,919
everything else is uh false invalid or whatever reason

92
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:16,559
there's no um there's no receptivity there is no uh there's no openness there's no

93
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:22,500
connection so in turn we Safeguard the truth and in

94
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,539
turn the truth safeguards us uh as the Buddha tata's own son when one

95
00:30:27,539 --> 00:30:33,960
is willing to tell a deliberate lie there's no he said there's no wrong one

96
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:41,279
would not do and the word wrong here is related to soil that is now infertile

97
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:46,980
to look down from the other direction to grow the wholesome qualities truthfulness is

98
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,120
like a fertile soil

99
00:30:53,159 --> 00:31:00,179
the sorts of practices we refrain from when cultivating truthfulness speaking deceptively internally and

100
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:06,419
externally we practiced this a little bit in the guided meditation uh

101
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:14,059
speaking simple honest truth about our experience

102
00:31:14,059 --> 00:31:20,240
some of us some of us have heard ill use this expression of them uh

103
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:27,000
honesty truthfulness is like mindfulness out loud it's also mindfulness Insight we're

104
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,380
sub-vocalizing another thing to to abstain from to take

105
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:39,600
care take care watch for in our practice is this clinging to views it's

106
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:46,620
um as we mentioned before only this is true everything else is wrong this is discussed kind of poetically and

107
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:53,279
nicely in uh the atikavaga is a subsection of the Sutton ipata and

108
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,380
something called the passura suta the the Buddha is having this discussion

109
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:05,520
with with someone who's really uh let's say involved in the debate culture of ancient India

110
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:10,919
um anyone could come challenge uh an aesthetic to a debate and then the loss

111
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:18,299
the loss of that debate meant I think you um you lose your following which means you lose your livelihood and

112
00:32:18,299 --> 00:32:24,480
um your disgraced more or less so debate was kind of high stakes um

113
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:29,760
and there was this there was this uh um powerful way of speaking that

114
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:35,700
included uh only what I say is true anything else is false and the Buddha has a specific

115
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:41,760
instruction a specific encouragement he says if grasping to a view

116
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:47,340
and disputing someone says this alone is true you can

117
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:54,320
just tell them in this dispute you have no opponent here

118
00:32:54,659 --> 00:33:00,779
I love this you're not uh you're not getting entangled you're not um

119
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:09,419
staking out your claim your happiness and unhappiness is not dependent on having the right opinion or uh reasoning

120
00:33:09,419 --> 00:33:14,820
or reasoning your way to have them admit oh you're right and they are wrong

121
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:20,460
um there's another way to be together and another way to express the truth

122
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:27,539
in this dispute you have no opponent here I relate this to the skill of of uh when

123
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:34,919
you know when you need to be you need to have some honest communication with something but you know the other person at this moment in

124
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:42,600
this current state is not receptive it's not the time it's not the time we're not going into dispute we're

125
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:48,000
trying to have honest communication so I'm reminded of the one of the

126
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,880
standards of Rights speech that's timeliness

127
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:01,440
so then of course this um this relates to truthfulness as it's

128
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:08,040
accompanied by compassion and skillful means we're not using the truth to harm someone

129
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:15,658
um you might think of this um might think of you know pretty maybe a well-meaning commitment to to

130
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:21,599
um to share something but maybe without a maybe without analysis of whether that

131
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:27,000
that harms another person oh well it's true well I have to tell I have to tell them it's an imperative

132
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:33,300
but there's a sensitivity here to what's skillful what's the right time what's beneficial

133
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:38,878
in my own practice [Music] um to this some years ago as I was start as

134
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:45,480
I was starting out I had a real tendency um to not not say truths that were a

135
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:52,320
little edgy in my life or um if I if I thought it was gonna cause a wave in the

136
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,440
relationship at all I wouldn't I wouldn't say anything and so I kind of went I kind of went

137
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:05,099
really far in the other direction not sharing everything I ever thought with everyone but in a safe space with

138
00:35:05,099 --> 00:35:10,560
my mentors and teachers and people I could be really safe with I developed

139
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:17,460
a willingness to speak truths that felt scary to me

140
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:24,000
and then once that once that matured a bit then I could bring these two into alignment where there was discretion

141
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:31,099
about speech there was both a willingness to speak and wise reflection

142
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:41,040
so this truthfulness living in truthfulness I think can give us confidence in the past

143
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:47,880
and can be a sort of lodestar a direction for us and then we turn to determination

144
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,760
determination as like an unshakable Commitment if wise truthfulness orients our ship

145
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:01,560
then we can say determination sets out upon the course truthfulness orients determination sets

146
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:07,079
out Ruth identifies the path where whereas determination resolved resolves to

147
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:13,079
follow it and short we might say that determination is to set our sights on

148
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:20,160
something and when they start to see a theme if you're you're listening through the

149
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:27,000
series Dharma Paula teaches without this part of me none of the others are possible and with this part of me all of

150
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,540
them are possible and all of them mature all of them are perfected and purified we're starting to hear this

151
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:40,380
a lot and I think that points that points to the fact that uh

152
00:36:40,380 --> 00:36:46,079
the parties work as a group I was reflecting on it yesterday and sharing that

153
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:52,140
I'm starting to see these 10 qualities of the Perfections as kind of an ecosystem of beautiful qualities

154
00:36:52,140 --> 00:37:00,000
we support each other so we might reflect that in the absence

155
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:08,460
of determination we might hear about something like the paramese or hear about um practices that sound good to us

156
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:16,940
um are interesting to us but we without determination we don't undertake them so they remain words

157
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:24,359
I was reflecting on aditan determination resolve I'm reminded of some of the some of the

158
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:30,359
practitioners I practice with myself included in my early vipassana training we would do these sittings of strong

159
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:39,060
determination and uh one of us I won't say who um said I don't I don't care if I'm going

160
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:45,780
to die during the sitting I will not move which kind of it reflects the the Buddha's determination before before his

161
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:51,780
Awakening um and there was a way that that generated a lot of energy and commitment

162
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:56,940
to stay with the practice and then there's this complementary

163
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:03,000
quality which is uh we'll see that determination is followed upon by loving

164
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,579
kindness that a determination a determination

165
00:38:08,579 --> 00:38:15,720
to follow the path sometimes even a great effort uh is is greatly supported by the

166
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:23,540
tenderness of loving kindness be honest with um what's possible for us

167
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:29,700
I think it's important to talk about um when we consider the practice in the

168
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:36,060
long term what about when we set our sights we set our determination

169
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:43,140
and then um what happens if we fall short

170
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:49,680
or vacillate or we're human so we're shakeable we determined to not move and

171
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:56,520
we move um and this is a case I think where we Orient we can Orient toward our ideals

172
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:03,060
but we live in our actual life this is both compassion and skillful means

173
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:08,760
and I think when we're walking a long path we need a wise and compassionate way to relate to our

174
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:15,060
Humanity our fallibility and our foibles I think a little bit of humor maybe uh

175
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:21,900
may be necessary I'm reminded of Suzuki roshi again

176
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:28,380
who I consider someone who took his practice very seriously without taking himself too seriously

177
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:36,000
he's very committed to the well-being of of all beings so in the first few years of tasahara

178
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:41,160
um there's a story told by Blanche Hartman there was a there's a wedding after a

179
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:47,160
wedding at tasahara there's this big celebration there's a band one of the priests is playing a keyboard another

180
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:53,880
student is playing the guitar and singing and someone else is on the drums and are very serious determined zen

181
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:59,839
teacher Suzuki roshi is sitting on the corner of the stage playing it because it

182
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:08,359
thinks his practice seriously doesn't take himself too seriously it's a long path

183
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:16,079
so we take care our foil our foibles our fallibility our shakeableness

184
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:23,040
it's neither an indication that there's an error in the system and it's also also not a reason that we

185
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:29,460
shouldn't Orient toward our ideals but how do we do this wisely

186
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:35,940
and to make it personal for ourselves how do we how do we encourage our faith how do we encourage ourselves

187
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:41,460
how do we Foster confidence especially when we're shaken

188
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:47,460
and do we do we have a trust that we cultivate in awareness regardless of the content of experience

189
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:52,640
even when it's out in patience

190
00:40:54,359 --> 00:41:02,300
when we step off the path how do we step back on it's a great help to have Dharma friends

191
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:10,560
um so truthfulness and determination

192
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,599
to set the course and then determine to proceed

193
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,660
with compassion and skillful needs as I'm fond of quoting di kubody said you only need two things in Buddhist

194
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:27,380
practice one is to start second to continue

195
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:34,619
so for today as we've been doing I'd encourage you to look for truthfulness in your uh in your daily

196
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:42,000
life and then your impulses to the opposite and then look then look for your determination resolve and then impulses

197
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:47,160
to the opposite and tomorrow we'll pick up with the last two of the ten Perfections tomorrow

198
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:54,240
tomorrow I'll try to have a shorter talk and we can have some time for questions so uh please bring them and we can type

199
00:41:54,240 --> 00:42:01,140
them into the type them into the chat and I'll try to address as best I can uh for a few minutes tomorrow

200
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:07,760
thank you so much best wishes for your practice may all beings benefit
