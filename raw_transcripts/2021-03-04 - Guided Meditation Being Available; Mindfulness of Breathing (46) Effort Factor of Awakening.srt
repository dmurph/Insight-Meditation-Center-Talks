1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:09,280
and um so one of the orientations or

2
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:15,759
perspectives on practice in the teachings of the buddha

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,880
is an orientation oh i wasn't recording

4
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,760
so one of the perspectives on

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:34,399
practice in the teachings of the buddha is that he was oriented to

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:41,760
towards the consequences of our actions so there was a sense that

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,920
noticing little bit or caring a little bit for what the consequences of what we do is

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,320
important and so some orientation into the future

9
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:01,199
about the potential the likely results of what we do is part of a wise way of living

10
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:08,000
and of course we have to be very careful with that and it's balanced with the tremendous emphasis on the present moment in this

11
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,360
practice as well but it's not ignoring the future and

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:19,600
consequences and so to sit down to meditate in the morning it might be that we do

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:28,560
have a sense of the day will go better we'll be more centered calmer maybe wiser and so there is some

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,400
appreciation that and motivation even to meditate because of the benefits it brings our lives

15
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:43,280
and then there's also the consequence in the short term it's possible to

16
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,720
have a sense that if you sit down to meditate and what you want to do is to

17
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:55,920
be in a super hurry to get into a deep state of concentration and

18
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,439
and because there's important things to do and in life and and so you're going to just

19
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,640
really huff and puff and strive and get all sweaty and contracted and tense so

20
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,160
you can get quickly concentrated that doesn't work and so have some sense

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,599
that yes i want to get settled here in my meditation but it doesn't work to strive or to push or

22
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,640
have a lot of expectations demands to be measuring how i'm doing as i go along

23
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,200
every few seconds what has a good consequence is just be very relaxed around

24
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,360
the consequences at this point and being relaxed about not trying too much to make something happen

25
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:41,360
is the better way to make something happen that's useful in meditation and so there's still some consequential

26
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:47,920
thinking but it's recognizing you know how i am in the moment is important

27
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:54,319
and that it makes a difference how i am that if i strive in meditation i'll have a headache and

28
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,480
that will persist through the day if i can be at ease that creates more ease and it sets up a nice thing for the

29
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,680
day if we get closer in and

30
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:11,360
and into the present moment the sense of the consequences of our practice

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:20,239
has more and more to do with the present moment we can feel the difference between being critical about

32
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,920
how we're paying attention to the breathing versus being relaxed around it

33
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:32,879
and you can feel the the immediate consequence sometimes called instant karma the immediate quality the

34
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,360
that one of them has is more dukkha suffering and one is more open and and

35
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:45,680
feels better and feels satisfying and this ability to differentiate between what is satisfying and not

36
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,599
satisfying in how we enter the moment it gets closer and closer to something very

37
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:57,280
intimate and close here and now and less concerned about the future

38
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:03,680
but to be able to discern that difference and see is it are we are we involved in

39
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,879
um you know are we too lazy in meditation and so the

40
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:16,079
mind is drifting off too much and a little bit more energy is necessary a little bit engagement

41
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,280
are we a little bit too much

42
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:28,400
constantly making commentary about our meditation and always kind of questioning and doubting

43
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,240
it and is that really that's not really so useful and you could feel that that doesn't feel good

44
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:42,160
and perhaps having a provisional confidence in our meditation um a uh just uh

45
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,960
you know provisional until more evidence comes it's actually more useful for settling and so again there's a

46
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:57,040
sense of the immediate consequences there and for this meditation i'd like to point to something more subtle

47
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:03,120
and that is that as we practice like mindfulness of the

48
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:09,039
breathing there's a very there can be a very subtle

49
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:13,919
after effect of

50
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,800
be a moment of being connected to the breathing like if we follow the breath all the way

51
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:26,639
that knowing of the breath being connected to it it's kind of like an after image there's

52
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:31,840
a kind of or kind of like a if you go out into the war and stand in the sun and get

53
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,960
warm that warmth will persist if you go back into the shade for a little while there's the the after

54
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:44,240
effect of warmth that remains so there's an after effect of doing the

55
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,680
practice act after effect of kind of after image

56
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:57,280
after sense after feeling that persist a little bit beyond just the moment of being mindful it's

57
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,360
very subtle and uh and even if you don't feel it

58
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,479
the sense of being open to it or receptive or

59
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,680
to to feel that as well kind of in the peripheral of attention

60
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:22,080
to be a veil or to be available to be open and receptive to allow an after effect or the glow of

61
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,360
the practice or the the the uh after warmth

62
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:34,880
remain or the softness or the calmness or whatever it might be to let the goodness of the practice kind

63
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:43,520
of be available for you to persist into as if you were making space in your body

64
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,440
for that after effect that the results of the practice so you're

65
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:56,160
not making it happen you're not demanding it happens the subtlety is that of kind of staying

66
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:03,520
open available for the practice to somehow

67
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:11,360
work on you or radiate into you or persist a nice feeling of something

68
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,880
and whether you feel anything or not is less important than that sense of presence and

69
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:24,720
availability receptivity to something be kind of of allowing yourself to be

70
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,000
practiced by the practice to allow yourself to be affected by

71
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,199
the practice in a way that's not exactly your doing

72
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:42,880
it's the consequence of what you're doing the after effect and if what i'm saying

73
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:48,160
is too subtle or too bizarre for you just forget what i'm saying

74
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:54,319
but um so with that taking a

75
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:02,319
upright metaphorically or literally upright posture

76
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:15,120
and taking a few moments and closing your eyes to feel your body

77
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:21,919
kind of roam let your attention roam through your body

78
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,520
familiarize yourself with what the experience of your body is right now

79
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:45,200
and then to see if you can adjust your

80
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:53,040
kind of your attitude your orientation that with your body and heart and mind

81
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,160
you're available

82
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,120
you are available to be receptive

83
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,160
to to the practice that you're available

84
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,519
to be changed

85
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,200
you're available for some deeper qualities of practice to be registered or to

86
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,720
waft through you

87
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:38,320
and then very gently with this receptivity availability

88
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:43,360
take some gentle but deeper breaths

89
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:51,440
maybe slowly as if you're receiving the inhale into

90
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:54,480
that availability

91
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:05,839
and filling that receptivity on the exhale long quiet exhale

92
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:19,839
and perhaps you recognize that quieting the thinking mind

93
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:29,360
increases the receptivity the availability to really take in the experience of

94
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:35,360
practice of meditation and the more you're thinking

95
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:47,360
the less room there is to be available to sense to feel

96
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,760
and then letting your breathing return to normal

97
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:03,519
and in terms of feeling the after effect being available to linger and feel it

98
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:10,320
it might be extremely subtle but notice the after effect as you relax different

99
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:17,680
parts of your body as you exhale softening the muscles of

100
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,240
the face

101
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:31,920
and what's the feeling that comes with relaxing those muscles

102
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:45,360
as you exhale softening and relaxing the

103
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,839
shoulders

104
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:07,839
and in these little moments of softening relaxing the shoulders what good

105
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:24,160
feelings remain for a few moments what after effect is there

106
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,079
relaxing the belly

107
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:43,279
softening it might be possible to soften the hands

108
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:53,839
the fingers

109
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:07,519
might be possible to just gently just a little bit flap your elbows to loosen up

110
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:21,839
any tightness or holding in the arms

111
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:35,440
it might be possible to relax and soften

112
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:41,199
the muscles of your back so maybe those

113
00:13:46,839 --> 00:14:03,839
muscles kind of release down your back

114
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:10,720
and now opening more fully to your

115
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:21,120
breathing at the end of the exhale

116
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:27,519
for a moment let there be a very brief pause

117
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:33,839
not a pause that is a strain but just long enough so the beginning of

118
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:41,519
the inhale really wants to happen and you

119
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,399
allow it and rece and better so you can better

120
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:59,839
receive the inhale

121
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:13,519
for the influence the inhale has on your body and mind

122
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:19,360
receptive not just only to the sensations of

123
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:24,959
breathing but maybe to the afterglow or the

124
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:41,519
radiance or the something that spreads from your breathing as you inhale

125
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:48,240
and as you exhale allow the exhale the release to

126
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,839
occur ride that release ride the exhale

127
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:01,040
gently allowing it all the way to the end

128
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:13,199
and especially as you get to the end of the out breath being available to feel

129
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:20,160
the influence that exhaling has on you

130
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,839
more widely

131
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,480
being receptive to the inhale

132
00:16:53,600 --> 00:17:05,839
being allowing for the exhale

133
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,760
available to allow the influence of mindfulness of breathing to spread

134
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:19,839
through your body

135
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:38,159
as if your body is a receptacle that receives the practice

136
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:46,720
and whether you receive anything or not is less important than

137
00:17:46,720 --> 00:18:01,840
is openness and availability as you breathe

138
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,720
and if you become aware of other things besides your breathing

139
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:34,320
perhaps you can become aware of them body sensations feelings thoughts

140
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:39,280
in this open receptive way that's

141
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:47,039
available to feel not the influence of our

142
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,240
feelings and body sensations but the influence of

143
00:18:52,240 --> 00:19:00,640
being mindful aware aware of body emotions

144
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:03,120
thoughts

145
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:17,280
where being available and receptive is almost a quality of the mindfulness

146
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,760
itself

147
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,480
and perhaps feeling the goodness

148
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,120
of this receptive open mindfulness

149
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
practice

150
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:49,840
in some subtle way small way can you adjust how you have a continuous

151
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:57,840
mindfulness continuous awareness of your breathing of your experience

152
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:05,840
so that that mindfulness has a good influence on you

153
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:16,158
that it's nourishing supportive that the after effect the influence

154
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:22,559
is beneficial or if you notice that the after effect

155
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:30,000
the influence is not beneficial can you adjust it

156
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:40,000
so that how you're aware seems to have a nice influence

157
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,840
here and now in the present moment in this body and mind

158
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:15,840
letting the thinking be quiet so you can better feel the subtlety of all this

159
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:59,840
sometimes the beneficial influence of the practice

160
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:08,480
can increase slightly if you very slightly make a small

161
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,240
half smile turning up the corners of your lips

162
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:22,640
and allowing for the receptivity being receptive to the influence the

163
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:28,880
good influence of pleasure joy

164
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:41,840
that supports being present

165
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:57,280
as you receive the inhale receive the global

166
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:06,319
nourishment or influence good influence that might be here from meditating

167
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:13,119
as you allow the exhale allow the nourishment or allow the

168
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:20,880
global goodness that might be here throughout the body

169
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,319
in the mind in the heart

170
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:33,280
letting your awareness take it all in on the inhale

171
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:43,838
the awareness allow for it on the exhale

172
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:51,760
and then as we come to the end of this sitting take a moment to feel

173
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:56,960
grounded in your place of meditation

174
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,838
if you're sitting upright to feel the sitting bones your bottom

175
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:10,480
firmly on what supports your weight if your feet are planted on the floor to

176
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:17,838
feel the solidity of your feet on the floor

177
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,760
whatever way you can really use your body weight to really feel grounded settled

178
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:34,000
established here and then together with that

179
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:45,040
to be open and receptive to be available to feel and sense and

180
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:51,279
take in the experience of the world around you

181
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,839
without being unduly influenced been duly affected by that

182
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,520
but grounded in the present moment and open and receptive

183
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,839
and then bringing to mind some people of your life

184
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:25,280
friends family neighbors people in the community and places you

185
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:31,760
frequent and imagine that you're with one or some

186
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:37,839
of them in this way both grounded and

187
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:43,838
established in the present and open and receptive

188
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:52,800
secure in your groundedness available to be open and receptive

189
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:57,440
to take in the experience of another person

190
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:13,280
and maybe feeling or sensing the other person knowing the other

191
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,880
person from some place inside that

192
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:26,800
is tender or gentle or kind loving

193
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,560
without losing your groundedness without leaning forward or

194
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:43,839
approaching the person or needing to say anything just this place of being grounded and

195
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:50,560
receptive have thoughts of good will for them

196
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:58,000
feelings of goodwill in which you wish them well

197
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,839
may you be happy

198
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:11,200
may you be safe

199
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:24,240
may you be peaceful and may you be free

200
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:33,839
and imagine that this is the stance that you can have towards everyone

201
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:39,760
that you are firmly confidently grounded in yourself

202
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:47,839
and open and receptive to take in the humanity of other people

203
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:58,800
and then to extend your heart to all beings may

204
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,839
all beings be happy

205
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,160
may all beings be safe

206
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:17,920
may all beings be peaceful

207
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:26,240
and may all beings everywhere be free

208
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:32,559
and may the benefits of our practice this morning

209
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:43,838
contribute to that being the case

210
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:52,600
[Music]

211
00:46:56,600 --> 00:47:04,319
[Music] so the topic now

212
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:10,160
is the third factor of awakening

213
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:18,240
the effort factor of awakening or the effort lim the word anga

214
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:25,440
can mean lim or part and and so it's a

215
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:33,359
it's a part of the whole and uh so the seven limbs of awakening

216
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:40,960
the seven factors of electing parts of awakening can be seen as a part of four

217
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:46,400
seven different qualities or practices or states

218
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:51,520
of one whole one whole way of being

219
00:47:51,680 --> 00:48:00,160
and one of those ways of being is to engage to to make efforts to do things

220
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:05,680
so it's not just a passivity of just how we are but there's also an

221
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:10,960
engagement in our practice in our world

222
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:18,480
and the word viria that's a v-i-r-a-y-a

223
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:26,480
v-i-r a-y-a is comes from the word hero

224
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:31,119
and so a kind of heroic effort

225
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:38,160
but all these words like effort and heroic effort can lend itself to being exhausted as

226
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:44,400
soon as you hear them like oh no i have to do all this work now and

227
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,920
tiring work some translators to uh translate this

228
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:57,280
word for effort and effort factor of awakening as endeavor

229
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:05,040
and i don't know if some of us if the word endeavoring has a little bit more nicer feeling than the word effort

230
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:12,400
we endeavor to do something it's what we are engaged in trying to do

231
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:21,200
to make it really maybe feeling closer in and more less the energetics of effort

232
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:27,280
i relate this right effort with the word choice that

233
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:33,920
it's the choices we make as we practice and as we live our life and choice you

234
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:41,359
know a choice doesn't necessarily imply that there's a lot of effort or strain or work a lot of work it's just a choice the

235
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:48,079
choice and what we're going to endeavor in and this uh the usual definition or

236
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:55,760
description of these of the effort factor of awakening is the same description as the effort

237
00:49:55,760 --> 00:50:03,760
factor of the eightfold path and so if you take it as endeavoring

238
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:09,599
the buddha is here is teaching us what what in this wonderful precious life

239
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:14,880
that we have what endeavors are worthwhile to do

240
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:22,720
you know what's what should we do with our life what endeavors and rather than giving an

241
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:29,119
answer for a particular project you know particular work to do a career to do or

242
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:35,119
something the answer is it has to do with

243
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:41,760
the consequences of what we do of how we do it and so those things

244
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:48,880
that lead to what is skillful or wholesome those things

245
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:54,079
choose choose those things those things that

246
00:50:54,640 --> 00:50:59,839
lead to what's unskillful to what's unwholesome

247
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:05,359
don't do those things don't choose those things to do

248
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:11,920
and what's most skillful in the in the teachings of the buddha are those

249
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:18,160
things that avoid we're avoiding things that cause suffering

250
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:26,880
and suffering comes along with a feeling of being caught or trapped or constricted or

251
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:33,119
clinging to something craving the world's gotten smaller narrower

252
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:41,760
and we choose to do those things that are skillful which is those things that lead away from suffering

253
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:49,040
lead to a kind of wonderful happiness and peace that goes along with feelings

254
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:54,640
of freedom of openness of tranquility

255
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:59,920
of of goodness of happiness

256
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:06,319
and so it isn't just any old happiness that we're looking for

257
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:13,520
because some happiness is like the happiness of winning the lottery is not really a

258
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:22,000
deep nourishing kind of wellspring of goodness of warmth of peace of

259
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:29,040
kind of real intimacy with the warmth and juiciness of life it's more

260
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:34,160
of a surface joy and more exuberance and and

261
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:40,000
i don't know what promise of all kinds of exciting things and they say that most people who win

262
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,920
big lotteries a year later are less happy than they were before they won it

263
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:52,559
so what is it that's lasting happiness what is it that lives lasting well-being and so begin having a

264
00:52:52,559 --> 00:53:00,400
sense of what that is not in the big picture like way in the future but to to recognize

265
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:06,160
this in ourselves to recognize moment by moment

266
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:12,319
that um if i'm driving my car and there's a light up ahead that's

267
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:17,680
green but i don't know if i'll make it and then get contracted and focused and

268
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:23,280
tight and like you know i better get it you know i i'll be late for my appointment

269
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:29,440
my life will you know be so much more difficult if i don't make that green light and and then we're kind of you know

270
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:35,040
getting contracted and tight and the feeling in the body and the mind

271
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:40,400
and the heart maybe it's subtle but is not a very good one it's not a nourishing one it's not

272
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:50,319
one that inculcates goodness or warmth or peace or love or care for others

273
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:55,680
but another choice in driving would be you know i see the light up there it's green

274
00:53:55,680 --> 00:54:01,440
right now but probably i can't reach it i'm not sure rather than racing to see if i can get

275
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:07,359
it what if i actually there's no one behind me right at the moment what if i actually go a little bit

276
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:13,760
slower and just kind of take it easy and give the light a chance to turn red

277
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:20,480
and then i can kind of be connected myself to myself in a different kind of way and i can kind of relax a little bit be more

278
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:25,680
open it can be more receptive to the traffic around me and to the environment and not so

279
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:31,920
narrowly focused and you get it turns red and you stop and you sit there and turns out then you're

280
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:38,319
kind of quite contented you did a nice thing for yourself and and so this much some of you might

281
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:44,240
think this example is ridiculous but we have ten thousands of these small

282
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:51,760
little choices that we make throughout the day and to begin endeavoring the right

283
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:57,200
effort is to make wise choices around these ten thousand little things we do throughout

284
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:03,040
the day including the big choices we make the big things we do

285
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:09,280
and this this is how we bring mindfulness into daily life is we bring mindfulness to all the what

286
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:16,079
we're doing and we have not just aware of what we're doing we're aware of the choices we make as we

287
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:21,359
do them and we we're aware of the options we have

288
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:27,599
of which direction we go in the skillful or the unskillful

289
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:32,880
and so the investigation factor of awakening the fact awakening that makes the sees

290
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:39,599
clearly and sees distinctions includes seeing this distinct distinction between his healthy and

291
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,640
unhealthy skillful and unskillful beneficial and not beneficial

292
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:50,720
leading to entrapment or leading to freedom

293
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:58,000
and so right effort is to you know in the effort factor of awakening is that

294
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:05,279
factor of awakening that's constantly turning towards the healthy choice

295
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:10,880
but not because it's a lot of work in fact as we get the hang of it it

296
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:16,559
feels the opposite that's where the least work is

297
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:22,559
in some ways choosing the unskillful thing that can't if you're lazy or if you're

298
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:27,920
kind of it's easier just to go along with impulses it can feel like it's the easy

299
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:34,960
way but generally the consequences are require much more work later much more

300
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:41,680
repair and stress and all that choose the healthy approach the skillful

301
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:48,559
and it tends to be just the consequences tend to be good in the future and no repair is needed no you don't have to

302
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:54,000
de-stress afterwards recover from it and so getting

303
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:59,920
getting the habit and the ongoingness of being present and making these wise choices to

304
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:07,040
what's skillful and beneficial tends to start creating a life which has less and less stress in it

305
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:14,000
less and less needing to recover from the stress the tensions of the life and so there's

306
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:19,839
more energy there's more vitality for this life of ours than if we choose

307
00:57:19,839 --> 00:57:28,240
the unskillful repeatedly repeatedly and so this effort factor of awakening

308
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:33,680
uh is um is certainly the individual practices and choices we make

309
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:40,960
along this line but it's more of a state or a generalized attitude or orientation

310
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:46,079
for how we live where we're just naturally oriented towards the skillful

311
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:55,040
naturally oriented towards these choices which lead to our betterment to ease to peace to ongoing well-being

312
00:57:55,040 --> 00:58:00,559
and there's a kind of a momentum in that direction there's a kind of a strength to that

313
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,160
that follows in the wake of the second factor of awakening becoming strong

314
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:12,880
this really seeing clearly so first there's mindfulness that places us in the present moment then

315
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:18,079
there's investigation in a sense or exploration or discovery

316
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:23,839
that helps us to see all the choices we have in the moment when we when you see the

317
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:30,400
red light green light or the red light ahead as you drive you see oh there's a choice here and

318
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:35,680
then there's the effort factor of awakening which no something inside of you

319
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:42,960
with time almost doesn't have to be a lot of reflection and planning and calculating and bringing up the

320
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:48,079
calculus of stress and freedom but it's uh just

321
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:54,319
it just feels like oh that's the natural thing to do that's the easeful way that's where the doors are

322
00:58:54,319 --> 00:59:01,280
open that's where the freedom is found and of course we choose that and so the

323
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:07,680
choice becomes more and more effortless more and more delight and joyful and

324
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:16,640
my hope for all of you is that if you do this a day will come

325
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:24,400
that the word effort just brings you a big smile and you're like oh i am so

326
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:29,599
lucky to be able to make effort wow this effort thing is fantastic

327
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:36,480
wouldn't that be great and along the way what's happening is you're beginning

328
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:42,240
to manifest your freedom your ability to be free

329
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:47,359
to simply choose to be mindful is an expression of freedom

330
00:59:47,359 --> 00:59:54,960
to choose to discover to look more carefully to investigate is an engagement of your freedom

331
00:59:54,960 --> 01:00:01,839
to make your choice is an engagement enactment of freedom

332
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:09,200
and and so uh and that's very different than being

333
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:14,240
the victim of our experience or being under carry the burden of the weight of

334
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:19,839
the world on our shoulders and everything so hard and uphill we're

335
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:26,160
being impacted we're being piled up piles and piles of responsibility where

336
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:33,280
there's no freedom but to choose freedom over and over again is not a second nature for many of people

337
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:40,160
but this is what we're working with and what how we're setting ourselves free in the big sense as well by all these

338
01:00:40,160 --> 01:00:47,760
small movements of manifesting our freedom in mindfulness investigation and choices

339
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:53,520
we make so thank you and

340
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:57,839
i look forward to continuing this series
