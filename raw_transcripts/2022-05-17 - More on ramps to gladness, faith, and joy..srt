1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:08,800
hi welcome nice to see you here tonight

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,840
and uh hello out there on youtube

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,599
thank you for being here as well

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,560
so this last week i've been um

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:31,840
thinking more about and noticing continuing to notice this

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:39,040
this idea of receiving moments of gladness or joy

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,360
faith as they come up and um

8
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:52,399
you know it's interesting i was also noticing kind of where i don't

9
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:59,320
connect where i don't allow myself to take in the goodness

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:08,400
and even you know this we really do have to stay present

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,920
to receive to receive the gladness and the joy that come up in

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,159
our lives even the simple ways

13
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,400
yeah i am so helpful to you know

14
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,000
really truly try and notice these moments and take them in it's very easy to skip over

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,479
the little the little gifts of the day

16
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,960
this week one of the things that i um

17
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,960
noticed was you know there can be things that happen in life

18
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,399
can you turn the volume down just a little bit um

19
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,399
that are kind of in that space of like this could be

20
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:04,079
seen as good by the mind or it could be seen as difficult or not good by the

21
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,679
mind depending on how the mind engages with

22
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,720
it so for example my

23
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,520
i had said something to my daughter that

24
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,440
was i was trying i was being joking in the moment but it really hurt her feelings and so she told me

25
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,480
didn't come out exactly directly that way but she told me that you know what i had said had hurt her feelings

26
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:42,000
and there was a lot of gladness that she could tell me right that we could talk

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,599
about what what happened and i could apologize and

28
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:52,959
and there was this appreciation so my daughter is 25 so the

29
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:59,680
mature maturation of our relationship our ability to um

30
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:06,560
to talk things through right and and not just have a lot of reactivity which we used to have a lot

31
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,239
more reactivity with each other

32
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,159
and uh you know we got to a really good place it was good it was a really good thing

33
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,840
and i noticed that the you know i went to bed happy and the

34
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:28,879
next day i got up and i felt happy but then i noticed

35
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:34,159
uh starting to like well i wonder i wonder if you know she's still okay she

36
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,680
feels okay this morning when she wakes up if she feels good about the talk

37
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,519
so i sent her a text just to check in and i didn't hear back

38
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:51,519
and so you know i'm sort of a little later halfway through the day i'm like oh i didn't hear back and i'm like

39
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:58,400
what does that mean right so i sent another little text and i still didn't hear back and

40
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,080
so during the day i could feel myself um kind of having a hard time staying

41
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:12,799
with the fact that we had this really good conversation that the there was this energy of worry

42
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,320
or just you know yeah worry that maybe there was more

43
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,080
more conflict to be managed i could be

44
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:29,520
really clear in my mind that i was really glad that we had the

45
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:36,080
conversation it was really healthy i knew these things and i could feel the energy pulling kind of

46
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:41,520
i'll call it right here the sense of anxiety or tension in the core of my

47
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,639
body and

48
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:52,400
i was thinking about sort of um are you guys familiar with the hindrances

49
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,479
the five hindrances jim you know you know them they're good friends of yours

50
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:04,320
there's these five hindrances that um are discussed by the buddha as being pretty

51
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,080
significant interferences in our meditation and i'll say in our daily lives and our

52
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,720
lives in general and so i was like really like naming okay the hindrance of

53
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,000
restlessness and worry right this is one of the five restlessness and worry just

54
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,400
kind of keeps keeps coming in and while i have this clarity

55
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:36,479
like a mental clarity of this is a good thing there's this other energy that's kind of

56
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:43,280
keeps stirring things up and so you know as the day went on i was like

57
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,759
okay it's like just pull over

58
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:55,680
the metaphor of a driving or a car you know the mind when it gets going it feels like you're

59
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,800
driving and when you're restless and worried it almost feels like um

60
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:07,199
you keep trying to find your way somewhere and getting lost right you're just like

61
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:15,440
this relentless searching feeling and so it's like the opposite of that was just pull over and

62
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,880
stop and breathe in to the gratitude for the

63
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:28,800
the contact the event the sharing that happened between my daughter and myself

64
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:34,960
and uh keeping myself there right so last week i was talking about

65
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,800
savoring right that the brain needs our help to savor or take in the

66
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:48,240
good stuff especially when we've got a hindrance going on in our minds we need to help it

67
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,720
settle and to help it take in and recognize and attend

68
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:02,880
it's like a fork right we can keep a fork in a road we can get caught and pulled off right into the

69
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,520
mental kind of hindrances or worries or we can

70
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,199
nope just stay stay here just take in what's going on

71
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,639
here so this week i found gratitude was a

72
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,919
really helpful way to help myself work to

73
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:32,800
take an entrance to gladness right to a sense of gladness and that

74
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:39,680
gladness supported a light lightning of the heart right a lightning of the being

75
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,080
so um we we pretty much all know right that

76
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,759
our minds are different things are happening it's not always just peaceful and common here

77
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:57,360
and uh sayadaw uttajania do you guys know who he is

78
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:05,280
he's a a monk burmese monk and he um he has a lot of very pithy

79
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,960
little direct sayings that have to do with mindfulness and daily life and

80
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,400
one of the things his quotes is it's inevitable to make some wrong turns in daily life

81
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:24,240
but you have to learn to profit from these experiences learn to profit from them these wrong turns don't allow

82
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:31,120
um just the difficulties to keep running the show but but learn from them

83
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:39,200
so these uh hindrances and i'll list them in a moment

84
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,599
it's good to get to know them it's good to recognize when when they're present

85
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,640
one of the yeah one of the simplest things to do is

86
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:05,839
kind of to do what the in the suit is some of the pursuit does it when the buddha is um

87
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:11,519
facing some challenge some difficulty um

88
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:18,640
he will reference mara mar as the representation embodiment like of

89
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:25,760
the temptress all the the ill ill will and the desire and the aversion and

90
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,880
and that you know he'll say mara i see you

91
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,880
when those qualities are coming up in the moment sort of this turning toward you know i

92
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:44,399
see you i see you that you're you know restlessness and worry i see you i see you i see you here it's a

93
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:51,680
really important way to help us start to to benefit to learn from these visitors

94
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:56,160
so what are these five let me just list them for you

95
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:05,040
typically they're listed in the following order one is sensual desire so a lot of desire for

96
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:12,320
pleasantness for objects for you know feeling good

97
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,519
the second one is ill will so anger hatred

98
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:24,399
wanting to strike out the third one is

99
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,720
restlessness no sloth and torpor actually there's a yeah sloth and torpor so a sense of

100
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,079
tiredness fatigue that can be both mind or body or

101
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,560
mind and body or or one or the other and then there's restlessness and worry

102
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:49,839
which i was sort of alluding to and the last one is um doubt

103
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:58,959
and this is like a um a doubt in the practice or down ourselves right that's kind of a

104
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:04,640
not not a very helpful doubt

105
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,480
so

106
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,880
shiloh catherine says that just as an oyster transforms the

107
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:27,040
irritating presence of a grain of sand into a pearl meditators convert irritants into wisdom

108
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,240
so this goes back to that statement by dao tejania you know like let's take

109
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:38,079
advantage of it when these things come up in our lives learn from them you know let them become

110
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,839
the pearl the wisdom that guides us

111
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,000
they're um these hindrances are you know energetic

112
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:55,440
they affect our body like uh just think about the experience of of

113
00:11:55,440 --> 00:12:02,959
having a strong desire for something what does that feel like in your body

114
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,920
there's like generally just even just thinking about maybe even imagining something you know you really

115
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:16,399
really want and as i'm even just imagining it you see my

116
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:22,399
body is leaning forward right do you notice that that tends to be what happens

117
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:30,079
energetically with our bodies is we we lean toward it and there's a feeling of a pull

118
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:37,279
now contrast that to ill will when you really don't like someone when

119
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:42,800
you have aversion just kind of bring that to mind something

120
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,120
some event some person some food just as you imagine that what how what

121
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:53,839
do you notice in your body how's that energy feel different

122
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:02,959
you want to lean toward it probably not right there's more of a sitting back or

123
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:08,720
a pull back in general so i'm pointing to this because um this

124
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:14,560
is partly how we start to recognize that the forces are present of the hindrances

125
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:22,079
is we can start to see it in our the the body will start to give us clues

126
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:30,800
in terms of sloth and torpor well

127
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,040
when we feel really tired there's a sinking right there's a sinking energy which can be felt literally in our

128
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:45,279
bodies like just a sleepiness heaviness but sometimes the torpor and the mind

129
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:51,040
can actually get really drifty and dreamy and quite pleasant

130
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:57,360
so it's also important to recognize because we can kind of be losing touch with the present

131
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,560
moment in meditation and not really recognizing it because it feels it can

132
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:09,519
feel somewhat pleasant so in that energetic state when we're

133
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:17,600
you know feeling slothful there's usually a heaviness a sinking feeling right

134
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,560
um with restlessness and worry

135
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,920
for me that uh there's this kind of habitual pattern that feels a little

136
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:38,560
like like this i'm doing you know like a settling okay okay and then a stirring

137
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:43,760
up and a settling and a stirring up there's a difficulty

138
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:50,959
settling period right with restlessness and worry and it can manifest you know very much in the

139
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:57,680
body and you can see it just in the mind just sort of the

140
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:05,519
circular thinking that we tend to get involved in when we're caught and then with doubt

141
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:15,120
what does that feel like when you have a lot of doubt what do you notice in your body when you're really

142
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:23,000
really questioning doubting if this is the right thing to be doing

143
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:36,079
for me what comes up is there's this a way in which it feels it's almost like there's a frozen

144
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,839
feeling in a way of the energy like a little set resonate for you

145
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:48,399
um any other words feel free to speak up you guys to describe what it feels like for you

146
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:56,480
when you you're feeling a lot of doubt uncertainty stuckness

147
00:15:56,480 --> 00:16:03,120
comes to mind you have anything else you want to say what's that

148
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:08,639
back and forth okay okay yeah

149
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:14,720
like not the that speaks to that energy of do i want to do i not want to kind of like is

150
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:20,839
this right is this good is this bad kind of yeah and some freezing

151
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:27,839
yeah yeah yeah so it's it's said that these

152
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,000
hindrances weaken our wisdom they're like a sieve because they drain the mind

153
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:41,279
there's a lot of pretty strong language used to describe them um obstructing hindering blocking

154
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:48,160
enveloping i think it's um they're all it's really really

155
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,800
helpful to think about them in strong ways but it's also like they're this is

156
00:16:54,800 --> 00:17:01,839
part of being human these are all experiences every human being has

157
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:08,319
and uh you know it's

158
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:15,520
better to i think to uh to get to know them to understand them

159
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:22,160
just sort of normalize them than to vilify them

160
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:27,600
in my view gil franzdal talks about

161
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:33,600
having a hindrance is like wandering through a maze staring at the ground

162
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:40,640
where you're never looking up right like that and he says in contrast being mindful is

163
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,039
like standing above the maze to get an overview right without eliminating a hindrance

164
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,960
mindfulness gives us a better perspective of what's happening so when we notice when we recognize oh look at

165
00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:00,799
me i'm i'm experiencing restlessness and worry it is like having that above view of oh

166
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:06,799
look what i'm doing i can see it now right before you maybe are just feeling it and getting drawn

167
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,960
and driven by it but when we can start to have that

168
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:22,840
awareness recognition of its influence we have a opportunity to kind of get more free

169
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,440
so you know last week i was sort of emphasizing um

170
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,440
that you know when suffering happens in our lives

171
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:49,840
it is an opportunity to recognize it there's an opportunity to notice the pain

172
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:58,080
the difficulty of it and in doing so we can do that thing like we see the

173
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:04,160
maze and when when we see the maze we have freedom we have this opportunity

174
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:10,640
and that can be like it can help us see that that suffering that was happening

175
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:17,280
that was going on was actually an invitation you know to to freedom if we listen to

176
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:24,240
it if we listen to its call and we we recognize it

177
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,360
so um maybe i'll talk a little bit more about

178
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,799
the the five hindrances just uh there's some really cool similes

179
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:42,160
in the sutas um so with central pleasure

180
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:48,960
it's it's compared to the experience of being in debt

181
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:55,360
so having a huge financial burden versus um being free from it like the

182
00:19:55,360 --> 00:20:02,400
difference between like i don't owe anybody anything like that feeling of freedom

183
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:09,919
and then there's other similes that are related to water and this one is

184
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:15,200
with with central pleasure it's related to a colored pool of water

185
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:21,760
so here's the suta from um that i'll read if there is water in a

186
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:29,360
pot mixed with red yellow blue or orange color a person with normal facility of sight

187
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,640
looking into it could not proper properly recognize and see the image of

188
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:41,360
their own face right the water is discolored might be pretty but

189
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,559
in the same way when one's mind is possessed by central desire

190
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:53,679
overpowered by it right it's really driving us one cannot properly see

191
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:58,799
you know see the escape see the clarity

192
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,919
it's not available and then when we we don't

193
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,280
kind of see and see the way out we don't understand right we don't

194
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:16,840
really understand what's happening it's like being in that maze and looking down at the ground

195
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:28,799
so i think i'll just kind of go through with the similes and then we can see where we want to go from there but um

196
00:21:28,799 --> 00:21:34,640
with uh ill will it's compared to

197
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:41,280
illness or disease a sense of you know feeling really sick

198
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:47,280
right when we feel really angry and hostile there's a great sense of discomfort disease in

199
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,720
the body there's a often it's talked about as like wanting

200
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,200
to strike out or push push something away

201
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:06,559
and so with the simile of the water and if there's a pot of water heated on

202
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:12,320
the fire [Music] the water is seething and boiling

203
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,919
and a person with a normal faculty of sight looking into it cannot properly recognize or see the

204
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:27,440
image of their own face their own mind they can't really see what's going on in there

205
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,519
so when we're possessed by ill will

206
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:41,840
and we don't recognize it's there we don't know our way through the maze right we don't know our way out

207
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,000
with sloth and torpor

208
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:55,120
it's equated with imprisonment or being

209
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:04,559
locked in a cage that feeling of not being able to move

210
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:11,840
and the simile for it is uh if there's a pot of water covered with

211
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:18,240
moss and water plants this is you know it's it's full of that

212
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:24,559
sludge so we really don't even see hardly the any reflection at all not even a

213
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:27,840
distorted reflection

214
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:37,840
with restlessness and worry

215
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:44,320
i like to think about it as being very very caught like in a tide pool

216
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:50,480
and with the simile it describes if there's a water and a

217
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:56,480
pot stirred by the wind agitated swaying or producing waves

218
00:23:56,480 --> 00:24:01,919
that that's the way it distorts the surface of the water and makes it

219
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:08,240
impossible again to see clearly to sleep into our own minds

220
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:18,159
and for skeptical doubt it's equated with the dangers of a

221
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:24,960
desert journey no water no no relief from the heat of the sun no

222
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,240
no safe space to rest we just can't maybe that goes back to what you were

223
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:38,000
saying like we just there's no settling right and then with the water simile

224
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,840
it's described as water that's turbid stirred up and muddy

225
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:51,039
um in a dark place [Music] right

226
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,840
do you connect with those those images do they resonate for you

227
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,480
yeah yeah

228
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:11,679
can you imagine which of these hindrances are the most

229
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,840
often visitors in your lives

230
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:25,440
what would you say if you feel comfortable saying which ones are the most common for you

231
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,320
sensual desire yeah yeah

232
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,840
doubt yeah yeah

233
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:47,120
what's that i still didn't it will and it will and you say that so

234
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:54,510
yeah like almost like embarrassed right yeah they're so it's just this is uh

235
00:25:54,510 --> 00:26:01,679
[Music] so much just a part of our psychological makeup and our evolution really if i if

236
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:08,000
i step back from all of these forces i think well of course we need to have sensual desire right that's sort of what

237
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:13,760
propagates humanity and you know and at this point we're living

238
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:19,200
in such a capitalistic society right so much about sort of

239
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:26,240
you know so much greed in our society right so that's just wow really fed and then the

240
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:31,440
hostility and ill will right well we do need to uh or we used to need

241
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:38,799
to maybe we we shouldn't need to now to to have that sort of hostility with

242
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:44,400
other beings um but if you know at some point uh if you just

243
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:50,640
watch animals right it's just it's an instinct you know it's an instinct

244
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:57,279
um and uh sloth and torpor right you know it's

245
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:03,760
sort of a natural response in some ways to if we're feeling um overwhelmed or bored or

246
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:10,720
disengaged it's a natural thing we're not connecting with our lives

247
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:16,640
we're not connecting with our experience often a lot of times when people talk about being bored i feel like

248
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:24,320
they're leaving themselves in a way they're leaving their experience they're not interested in it

249
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:34,960
and with um

250
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:41,360
doubt again you know it's important actually it's important to have doubt

251
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:50,240
right if we didn't have doubt we might just believe a commercial and do whatever

252
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:56,799
you know we're told to do right the beautiful thing about

253
00:27:56,799 --> 00:28:02,000
working with doubt in the practice and the buddhist teachings was

254
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:08,080
so you know just this encouragement to to listen to what works

255
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:13,600
to trust your experience not so much your ideas about what's

256
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:20,320
supposed to be happening but just to trust your experience to really and then we need to commit ourselves to

257
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:27,520
it too right if we've got too much doubt it's hard to commit to a practice it's hard to commit to sitting

258
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:33,760
right but but if we can really help ourselves commit to the practice

259
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:42,240
then we can stop afterwards and reflect on our actual experience and trust it

260
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,480
it's also without really helpful to talk to a teacher or read

261
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:53,600
read the teachings or you know seek wisdom to

262
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:58,679
help you that can be very helpful

263
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:13,200
so do you have any kind of any direction

264
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:21,919
you'd like me to go with this talk do you want me to go back to this idea of you know joy and

265
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:27,440
gladness or would you like to hear more about any one of the hindrances or tips

266
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:33,200
for working on them in daily life what would be helpful and people in youtube feel free to write

267
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,600
in the chat if there's anything for you as well

268
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:44,720
great let me just uh think about that yeah take your time

269
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:51,600
when do you when do you see these five hindrances as something as maybe like these are

270
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:58,480
indications that i need to work on in my life and maybe use them to your own benefits

271
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:03,760
or at the same time compared to just like i need to fix

272
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:10,960
or maybe versus i need to fix my mindset so i'm not having these hendersons come up like how

273
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,960
do you compare and contrast contra compare and contrast maybe like maybe the doubt you're having is

274
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:22,960
beneficial for you yeah but versus like maybe i shouldn't be having this doubt i need to be confident in myself same

275
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:29,919
thing with desires and ill will because sometimes they are beneficial for you to have them versus i need to fix myself i

276
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:37,360
need to be more aware so that i don't have them how do you compare and contrast that's a great question i don't know how

277
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:42,799
succinctly i can answer it but it's a beautiful beautiful right on point

278
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:48,080
question and i would say number one is trust your

279
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:56,080
experience study your experience notice the impact of the hindrances when

280
00:30:56,080 --> 00:31:05,039
they show up and notice one thing that can be really helpful is notice when they're absent

281
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:11,440
right so when we're not in the grip of them it's hard to have full understanding of their impact or when

282
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:18,398
they're useful or potentially you know more useful

283
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:24,559
when you're under their spell because you can't see clearly

284
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,240
and then what's really amazing is to have experiences of their absence

285
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:35,679
because it is pretty blissful it's pretty surprising how

286
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:42,080
um these things that we're so familiar with how much they actually do block our joy

287
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:47,760
and block our capacity to be really present but this is not something to know

288
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:54,720
intellectually this is something to know directly through your experience

289
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:05,200
when i'm trying to recognize for myself

290
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,559
like i'm trying to think about you know

291
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:17,200
desire right kind of one of the other thing you can look at is what is it you're desiring

292
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:24,000
and you can use some discernment right around like am i desiring

293
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,440
peace and freedom and so i'm motivated to get to the insight meditation center and sit on my cushion and there's very

294
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:37,120
there can be very wholesome things that that desire supports us

295
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:42,559
in but if the desire isn't wholesome right

296
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:47,760
it's not leading toward a beneficial outcome

297
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:54,559
that's a very clear indicator for us that we're the hindrance itself is

298
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:02,000
keeping us connected to something that's not helpful for us in our practice does that make sense

299
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:11,840
jim or richard do you want to take a stab at responding in any way add to what i've said or

300
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,559
yeah okay so i'm going to look here at the chant or not the chant the chat

301
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:28,720
um says i definitely find that i can be drawn into the hindrances much easier

302
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:36,240
when i have not fully appreciated their absence yeah i i really agree with that graham

303
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,200
thank you that when when we're it goes back to in that simile really pointing out to

304
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:50,480
we can't see clearly when the mind is under the influence of the hindrance

305
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,960
we were in the maze looking at the floor we we aren't seeing the conditions

306
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,919
so the evaluation of what is useful and not useful

307
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,280
is much more clearly seen when we're free from it

308
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,200
and it is helpful to notice those moments of freedom what what is that like to have

309
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:20,878
a moment free from wanting things wanting things

310
00:34:20,879 --> 00:34:26,480
right or in the case of ill maybe not wanting things

311
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,878
right or what is it like when you don't feel doubt

312
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:40,158
when you feel confident right what's it like to have a moment of

313
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:48,638
contentment free of that like wanting like oh it's just everything's okay

314
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:56,079
what does that feel like it's it's so much more peaceful really

315
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:03,040
yeah yeah to mentioning how maybe let's focus on

316
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:09,839
what the absence of these hendersons are like so are there some exercises that we can do is it maybe just so more like

317
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:14,880
reflection every day writing something and how can mindfulness help us because

318
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:22,240
a lot of times yeah when we're meditating these hendersons are coming up yeah so what can we do to actively

319
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:27,839
work on and maybe in terms of exercises or mindfulness that yeah will help us like avoid these

320
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:35,680
interests and secondly be more aware of the absence of them at the same time great great question

321
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:42,000
yeah you kind of had something yeah please it's sort of related but um

322
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:48,560
so i think what tonya is pointing to with the you know practicing with hindrances is really understanding first

323
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:54,400
of all being cognizant or recognize the hindrance so that's a really great

324
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:00,880
reflection like you're going through the day if you're completely absorbed in a

325
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:07,200
story in your mind about a conversation that you had earlier in the day and it didn't go the way you would like to it

326
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:13,280
had gone or all the stuff that goes on the mental activity you recognize at

327
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:20,560
that moment oh this is restlessness and worry this is some clinging to wanting a different

328
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,560
this is greed this is wanting this is aversion if you're really angry about it

329
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:34,000
so yeah so seeing that is working with the hindrance and so over

330
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:41,839
time if you continually bring your mindfulness to that process eventually you'll notice

331
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:47,200
oh i don't i'm not experiencing that hindrance in a sense you may even be

332
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:55,480
kind of looking around for it you know i don't know if that makes sense

333
00:36:57,359 --> 00:37:02,240
yeah work that muscle is a great way to put it

334
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:12,560
so i'll just go through a list of things i wrote and i'll keep and before i actually uh read them i'll

335
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,680
say there i there have been many times i've taught

336
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,760
and other people have taught a five-week series on the five hindrances here

337
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:30,320
and so those recordings are all on audio dharma and if you go to the website the imc

338
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:38,000
website you can actually find the handouts and the handouts have um

339
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,839
exit suggestions tips for practicing for the week really fabulous ones

340
00:37:43,839 --> 00:37:50,760
so under documents on the

341
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,480
yeah and you can even if you you know have trouble you can search um there's a little search feature five

342
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:05,040
hindrances and a lot of stuff will come up um so that's that's written stuff and

343
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:10,720
then there's also the recorded stuff so so i want to share that resource and

344
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:17,359
then gil wrote a book um that's on amazon

345
00:38:17,359 --> 00:38:23,520
and unhindered it's called unhindered

346
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:28,720
and he has a tremendous number of reflection practices in there just really

347
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:34,640
a lot of lovely material yeah and in fact

348
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:41,359
most of the handouts and stuff are you know evolved into this book

349
00:38:41,359 --> 00:38:48,000
so the book is just a great it's a few bucks on amazon yeah

350
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:54,800
so um one of the things i think about is uh just going back to this idea of we

351
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,359
you know wanting to have moments of gladness you know and joy in our lives

352
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:06,960
it's helpful to actually believe that we deserve to have these experiences

353
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:12,800
just starting with this like it's natural and it's a good thing and it's good for me and i

354
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,920
i believe i you know i'm deserving and i want to have moments of ease

355
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,760
i think if we orient our mind toward this idea that this is natural and

356
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:30,560
beautiful and a good thing it helps us to recognize that when it happens

357
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,000
and this again is kind of um helping

358
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:42,160
reorient the mind away from just the negative right the mind has a negativity bias a

359
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:50,480
threat by us and so by creating this other thing that we value we help the mind orient toward

360
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:58,079
it it's helpful to know and recognize

361
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:05,040
the absence of the hindrances because then we also get to consciously mindfully experience the joy that arises

362
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:12,400
when we're free from them and the more we're aware with that and allowing that the more it strengthens

363
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:20,880
our kind of the value that we can place on them on that freedom

364
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,400
um it is

365
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:34,720
the more quickly we recognize them the better not in some sort of evil way

366
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:41,760
but you know if the water's not totally boiling yet it's easier to deal with the pot right

367
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,480
than it is if it's been roiling for a long time the energy builds with all of these hindrances

368
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:53,520
so you know being like yeah i want to notice i want to notice what's happening

369
00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:00,160
in my body i want to notice what's on you know my mind it's not that it's bad news it's like no it's really good to start

370
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:05,359
to get to know these things it's good to notice

371
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:11,839
which ones are your frequent visitors get to know them maybe name them

372
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:18,000
give them a color you know shape size help those those kinds of things all

373
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:25,359
help help us sort of oh that's familiar that's oh yeah that's what that is right

374
00:41:25,359 --> 00:41:31,680
um it's also helpful to notice

375
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,839
um not just the the pleasantness of their absence but the

376
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:43,119
way that they negatively impact you they end up so

377
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:52,000
maybe it's not the beginning of the little desire that's a problem but that it it leads to then overspending or over

378
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:57,040
you know gaming or whatever it is for us that

379
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:03,680
then leaves us exhausted or depleted and we're not doing the other things that we wanted to do with our time or spending

380
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:10,960
time with the people we wanted to spend time with so helping us consciously connect

381
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:17,520
like if i go ahead with a greed or go ahead with this hating energy

382
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:23,440
initially there might be some thoughts of pleasure around this or satisfaction

383
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:29,200
but then it feels like this and then this happens and then this happens and i'm more likely to do this and then i'm

384
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,240
more likely to do that so uh kind of playing the tape out

385
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:39,599
letting helping your mind think all the way through if we just get caught in these

386
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:44,640
energies where they're gonna lead potentially

387
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:52,160
um and what that does is grows your wisdom right it helps you not just get enamored

388
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,160
in the moment it's good to make changes in your daily

389
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:04,160
life to help protect yourself from the things that you know trigger the hindrances

390
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,680
right for you what are the things that tend to trigger your endurances

391
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:16,720
media right can be a big trigger

392
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:24,480
um shopping or overeating and these various things that we can do that we

393
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,760
indulge in can can kind of be food for the hindrances

394
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:35,280
can support their rising the other thing that really helps is

395
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,599
to actively cultivate alternative mind states like contentment

396
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:48,160
like really practicing with the idea that it's good enough i don't have to make it go away i don't

397
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,440
have to make it better it's good enough literally just really inviting yourself

398
00:43:53,440 --> 00:44:01,359
to just sort of notice the niggling and go you know what it's good enough it's okay

399
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:08,560
um [Music] it's also you know yeah i think the brahma vaharas in general so that's

400
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:15,119
loving kindness practice are you familiar with that yeah so it's another practice and it's

401
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,480
another talk and it's 8 59 but there are other qualities that are

402
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:26,800
considered very noble and sort of uh

403
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:34,079
what is the word i'm not thinking of the word but heavenly almost right and they're feeling and generating a loving

404
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,119
kindness their compassion their sympathetic joy and its equanimity those

405
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:45,359
are the four brahmapaharas so there's practices that support arousing those kinds of mind states and

406
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:50,960
those are all protected mind states where we are pretty much free from the hindrances

407
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:56,720
when we're fully engaged so there it is

408
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,000
thank you so much for your comments and questions it helped help me
