1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,639
so the reference point for these early morning

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:14,080
teachings are the 16 steps of

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,920
mindfulness of breathing

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:29,119
and these 16 steps appear linear

5
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:36,320
without any indication that there are difficulties or

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,718
challenges or bumps on the road as we do this practice

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,680
it also gives the impression that the beginning of them the first few steps

8
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:57,840
might be beginnings they might be for beginners and the idea is as a good practitioner you

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:05,840
would matter factually linearly move step by step through the 16 steps and

10
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:12,560
and then wonder step 16 what's next

11
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:19,360
but in some ways the first few steps certainly are beginning steps but they also are

12
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:27,439
advanced steps for people who live a human life with all its

13
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,479
vagaries all its ups and downs and all its challenges

14
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:42,240
and this practice of mindfulness is not meant to be a avoidance of being a full human being

15
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:49,439
with all the emotions and concerns that human being encounters

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,600
but rather to be able to face anything

17
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:04,640
with wisdom and so these first steps of anapanasati

18
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,200
are also a way of not avoiding things but also not

19
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:22,319
be caught in their grip not by not be lost in them

20
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:30,480
so to breathe mindfully in the middle of what's actually happening for us

21
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,400
maybe in the beginning being somewhat simple and

22
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,760
with the breathing not to avoid but to

23
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:48,159
prepare the ground to be present without

24
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:57,519
preoccupation in the steps three and four steps three is feeling the whole body

25
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
and this i think is so important when we start feeling the whole body we

26
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,440
feel the physical expressions of all our troubles

27
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:19,840
how they're actually registered or expressed or processed in the body

28
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,920
if we're feeling sad or angry we can feel it in the body if we're

29
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:34,480
excited or lethargic we can feel it in the body

30
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,440
if we're spinning around in all kinds of thoughts and concerns and fantasies and

31
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,879
memories and plans there's an art to feeling that in the

32
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:52,959
body what's the physical feeling with the physic physical sensations

33
00:03:52,959 --> 00:04:00,239
that come with that and so to feel the body as we breathe it

34
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:07,439
will be an encounter being present for all the challenges we

35
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:14,879
have and all the joys we have in how they're felt in the body

36
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:23,040
i think of it sometimes as whatever the challenges might be how is it for the body

37
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,960
and let the body compost them let the body process them

38
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,560
we don't have to figure it out we don't have to solve things when we meditate

39
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:42,400
but to trust and rely on being present for whatever is

40
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,560
happening in its bodily physical expression

41
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:56,160
which is always in the present moment

42
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:03,039
and then to breathe with that to breathe through it to continue breathing in and breathing

43
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:11,840
out and this is a little bit of a protection and why it's an advanced practice

44
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:17,680
a protection from getting swept off in thoughts reactions

45
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:25,120
needing to do something about things just letting it be in the body feel it

46
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:31,600
breathe with it and when the time is right

47
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:38,639
to also relax around what's happening relax with what's going on

48
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:44,960
not to get rid of it but to settle in with it more deeply

49
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:56,560
so to take your meditation posture and to close your eyes

50
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:08,240
and to take a moment before doing anything else in checking in with yourself

51
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:21,840
how are you

52
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,199
and uh and whatever way you are whatever way you answer the question how are you

53
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:48,479
how is that in the body

54
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,880
how's that expressed how's that felt

55
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,800
what's the physical what's physically is

56
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,160
activated and to take a few moments to feel that

57
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:17,280
the body body side

58
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:25,440
and then to take a few long slow deep breaths right into the middle of it

59
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:33,599
as if you're breathing right in the middle of how you are maybe feeling it more fully

60
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:45,440
as you breathe in and relaxing as you exhale

61
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,000
and if how you are is something positive feel that as you

62
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:59,840
breathe in spread it as you exhale

63
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:06,560
if something what you're you're feeling something challenging

64
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,840
feel that as in your body as you breathe in

65
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:28,160
and then as you exhale bring some ease ease up

66
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:40,399
soften around the challenge

67
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:45,039
and as we sit here this morning is today

68
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:57,760
regularly refer back to your body for whatever is happening for you if you're involved in thoughts

69
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:04,160
caught up in feelings emotions just keep coming back and feel it

70
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,600
through your body from the vantage point of your body what

71
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:17,519
is this is what is this experience like and breathe with that

72
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,839
breathe through it breathe with it

73
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:42,480
sooner or later noticing also the physical feelings of thinking or

74
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:50,800
physical feelings of mental activity and then be content to just feel it

75
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:58,880
and breathe with it everything in your body

76
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,839
feel it there

77
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:14,000
and as you sit here meditating if it's possible put aside

78
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:21,120
any hint any feeling idea atmosphere

79
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:29,120
that you're not doing it quite right and substitute it with the atmosphere

80
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,080
the mood the idea that you're doing just fine

81
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:41,600
and then settle into your body breathing

82
00:17:42,240 --> 00:18:01,840
refer everything to your body and breathe with that

83
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:31,840
breathing with whatever is happening for you whatever way you are

84
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,840
breathing through it breathing with it

85
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:44,080
gently feeling it at all in your body

86
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,840
letting the body receive your life

87
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:04,799
there's a way in which the physical experience is

88
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:11,120
quiet in that in and of itself it doesn't involve thing does not involve

89
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:18,080
thinking and to feel the quiet

90
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:33,840
of whatever manifests in the body

91
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:51,839
foreign

92
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:07,599
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

93
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:22,640
to whatever degree it's easy for you continue to rest your attention

94
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:26,400
in the quiet of the body

95
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:35,440
the physicality the physical feelings this the sensations of your body

96
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:44,000
breathing with them sitting with them

97
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:50,400
that aspect of them which are physical experiences not thinking

98
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:57,200
and thoughts and ideas not even reactions to them

99
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:03,838
but in the simplicity of how your body experiences itself

100
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:13,520
how the body expresses

101
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:19,760
whatever years going on for you thoughts and feelings reactions

102
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:27,838
make room in your body to feel it

103
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:34,559
and then in the same way that you make a room for yourself

104
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,839
stay with your body but open your body and your mind your

105
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:48,160
awareness to the world around you

106
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:59,520
to the room you're sitting in the building you're in the neighborhood

107
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:09,839
the district the town or province county

108
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:26,240
and one of the great gifts we can give to others is our ability to be present for them

109
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:34,240
with all of who we are just as we being present for ourselves

110
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:42,240
to allow ourselves to feel physically empathy

111
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:51,839
to feel physically how people impact us

112
00:44:52,079 --> 00:45:00,240
what happens for us in our body without contracting necessarily or

113
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:05,838
wanting it to be different

114
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:18,400
and then from this settled place to gaze upon all things kindly

115
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:27,119
to know how to be in your body and to be still insensitive

116
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:33,839
and gaze upon all things with good will

117
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:45,440
to allow our gaze of our eyes to allow the sensitivity of our hearts

118
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,560
warmth of our hearts

119
00:45:52,960 --> 00:46:01,359
to be concerned with the welfare and happiness of others

120
00:46:01,359 --> 00:46:05,599
to be well wishing for others

121
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:20,000
be still and gaze upon all things kindly

122
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:26,960
may all beings be happy

123
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:34,240
may all beings be safe

124
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:40,078
may all beings be peaceful

125
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:57,838
and may all beings everywhere be free

126
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:11,839
so

127
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,000
so i think it's fairly well known for many people that one of the core

128
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:30,880
in the buddhist view one of the core sources of suffering has to do with clinging or

129
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:37,280
craving and that clinging is described many ways sometimes it's simply called a

130
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:45,280
stickiness that we there's a stickiness a glue that keeps us attached to things sometimes it's called

131
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:52,800
a knot uh you knot it up in things it's sometimes called the fetter in the

132
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:58,960
translation for the pali word but it literally means a not to be knotted up and we say that colloquially

133
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:06,800
in english it was all knotted up in something and the uh

134
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:14,559
the uh expression rather from a japanese teacher that i really liked was um uh the fist in the heart

135
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:21,359
or the fist in the mind and that we're trying to open the fist of the heart so it's not all fisted up

136
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:28,720
or closed up tightened up and so there's many many languages for this many many ways of

137
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:35,119
talking about this way we cling or crave and part of the function of practice is

138
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:43,040
to reveal the ways that we cling the ways that we are knotted up and sometimes it's pretty

139
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:48,079
evident right away sometimes as we go further and further along in the practice

140
00:48:48,079 --> 00:48:56,400
we start seeing aspects of being knotted up being caught by things in ways that um

141
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:02,720
we didn't know at all maybe more subtle or deeper somehow inside and

142
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:10,640
in some ways the the the movement through the path of practice is a continual movement of encountering

143
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:16,800
and then releasing encountering and untying all the different ways that

144
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,800
things are sticky with things we hold on to things or cling to things or resist things

145
00:49:22,800 --> 00:49:30,079
and and so when we run into these things in ourselves it's you know some people have this

146
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:37,040
instinct to feel bad about themselves or criticize themselves it's also possible to see it as oh good

147
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:42,839
this is what it this is the path forward knowing these things is part of the path it's how we go

148
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:50,720
forward and that's one interpretation i have for why this practice of anapanasati

149
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:58,800
is so simple in its explanation is that it's not meant to avoid

150
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:05,920
or not recognize that we're attached or clinging or there's all these challenges we kind of come along the way

151
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:14,240
but it's not supposed to avoid it but it's offering us a very simple way of moving through it

152
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:22,240
without making a big deal of it because they're not mentioned and rather than getting caught up in the

153
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:28,319
stories or the idea of me myself and mine in relationship to it

154
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:33,680
that is to be really really simple of course those things are there

155
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:39,359
and uh and uh and then how simple can we be in a way that's

156
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:45,359
genuine beneficial honest

157
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:52,640
and healing or freeing as we go through and so i i see the simplicity of the way

158
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:57,680
this beginning of anapanasati works as a way of really addressing all these

159
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:03,359
clinging all the challenges all the strong feelings emotions we have all the ways in which the mind

160
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:10,319
gets knotted up fisted up caught up in things and concerned with things

161
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:16,400
and but without uh without kind of getting involved

162
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:23,839
getting entangled with it even further so to just simply stay breathing

163
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:29,680
through it all whatever's going on breathe and i think i said this yesterday that there's something about hanging in

164
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:35,599
there with the rhythm of breathing that keeps them i call it sometimes the great lubricator

165
00:51:35,599 --> 00:51:43,599
it keeps things lubricated so they don't get rusted up or or squeaky or or something frozen up

166
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:50,079
or it's a massage that we're massaging stuff for it's um it's a way of kind of by staying

167
00:51:50,079 --> 00:51:56,319
with that gentle rhythm of breathing it's a little bit easier for the mind not to get caught by something

168
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:02,480
because if you're cut caught you've lost touch with the breathing but if you were touched with the breathing then there's something we're

169
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:08,720
taking being with that's kind of this lubricant or this massage the concerns the feelings we have

170
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:15,599
haven't gone away necessarily but it's the knotted up the stickiness the preoccupation with them

171
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:23,839
that's loosened up and then something else begins to happen if we free our concerns our emotions our

172
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:30,400
challenges even our suffering if we free it from our preoccupation

173
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:37,280
from our resistance the stories the opinions the predictions about it what it means

174
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:44,319
that it's there are pushing it away or validating it or

175
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:52,559
justifying it or apologizing for it all these complicated things we do all those perpetuated somehow

176
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:57,920
and if we just could learn to leave it alone but without denying it just leave it

177
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:04,000
alone let it be there and leave it alone from all this extra stuff we had

178
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,800
the heart knows how to heal the mind knows how to unfold in the same way that if

179
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:16,720
you cut your finger with a kitchen knife for example chopping vegetables

180
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:22,559
it's a complicated physiological process to heal that cut but we don't have to worry

181
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:28,160
about that the body heals itself if all we have to do is keep the cut clean

182
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:38,960
so so much of the angst the suffering the challenge the grief that we have to respect it deeply

183
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:45,280
not to and in really respected leave it alone without

184
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:51,440
stickiness without clinging without being knotted to it and this mindfulness of breathing uh

185
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:58,720
the implicit idea in this practice is that actually that mindfulness of breathing allows that freedom leaves allows us to

186
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:03,760
leave things alone and then as the practice goes along to

187
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:10,400
feel the mental formations of the the fit the bodily formations to feel the physical

188
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:15,680
activity expressions manifestations of the mind manifestations over responses or

189
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:21,440
thoughts or feelings it's such a powerful thing it's a way again of

190
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:27,760
being present for the all the difficulties and joys of life but to be present for it physically

191
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:33,280
without the stickiness without being four against in the clinging and it's a way of kind of begin to

192
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:39,359
loosen up the stickiness just to feel it in your body the body is not a story and so much of

193
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:46,559
the stickiness has to do with the story making mind the opinions the ideas predictions

194
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:54,160
and then on top of that the panasonic says relax or tranquilize make tranquil this

195
00:54:54,160 --> 00:55:00,880
body and for me this idea of relaxing calming the body

196
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:07,200
is not really meant to avoid anything but it's beginning to relax the ways in which we

197
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:13,119
hold things the way we hold on or knotted up it's the knots that we're

198
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:20,079
letting go of and as the knots get let go the entanglements let go then

199
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:27,359
what we're feeling inside the challenges we have can begin to move and resolve themselves

200
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:32,400
and relax and it can be very different perspective

201
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:39,599
and sometimes we don't solve our problems but we dissolve them in this way some of the external

202
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:46,160
problems we have in life the real things that we have to take care of don't go away this way but we can put

203
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:51,200
ourselves in a much better position more creative more intelligent more wise

204
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:57,920
more loving to address them when we go through this deep process of letting go of the stickiness the craving

205
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:02,960
that we have so i think it's kind of a radical thing

206
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:09,440
with this practice that it actually doesn't talk about these challenges directly

207
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:16,799
because we don't have to address them directly if we do this steps of anapanasati

208
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:22,319
they just kind of get taken care of on the side or get taken care of because we're making

209
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:28,240
space to in releasing the stickiness the knots that we have

210
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:35,440
and that process continues into the second set of four instructions where we become

211
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:42,400
aware of the mental formations the mental activities the thoughts that we have and then we

212
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:48,319
calm those down and calming means let go of the stickiness like oh the tightness the

213
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:53,680
constrictions that are there the pressure that's there it can't be done all at once and all of

214
00:56:53,680 --> 00:57:00,000
it but the beginning is process of letting go of the stickiness of settling the mind

215
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,000
and this also is not to avoid the mental problems but to but to let go of the stickiness

216
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:11,119
the fetters that are there so

217
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:18,240
to repeat myself i think it's a radical thing that this anapanasati does not talk address directly the challenges we

218
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:23,359
have in practice but it's not because they're being ignored

219
00:57:23,359 --> 00:57:28,400
it's i would like to propose is because it's offering a very realistic very

220
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:34,319
effective process by which they can be resolved or dissolved or

221
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:41,520
we can find our way with them without having to address them directly when you know as in the usual ways the

222
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:49,520
mind wants to do that our heart wants to do that so um so as you practice

223
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:55,838
and when you find yourself with these challenges that could happen

224
00:57:57,359 --> 00:58:03,760
no the practice is a response to it this ways of addressing it and perhaps being

225
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:10,160
content and willing to do so indirectly and for some of us it's a radical thing

226
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:15,440
to not feel like we have to fix and address everything directly but we can

227
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:20,799
just relax settle back and trust the process as we go move along

228
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:28,880
on this path so thank you and i look forward to

229
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:37,599
being again with you tomorrow
