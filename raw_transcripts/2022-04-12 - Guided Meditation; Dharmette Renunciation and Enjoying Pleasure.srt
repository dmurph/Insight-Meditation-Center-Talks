1
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,200
so uh so welcome welcome all it's nice to see the the

2
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:39,360
names and of those uh streaming over there with the uh the comments

3
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:47,840
um yeah so let's um let's practice together

4
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,440
so taking some full deep breaths

5
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,759
there's almost like a sense of especially on the exhale

6
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:52,880
kind of wave ripple of relaxation

7
00:04:53,840 --> 00:05:00,680
that smooths out the energy of the body

8
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:03,960
so this kind of breathing we're making sure that breath gets into our belly

9
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:13,240
letting her belly be soft

10
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:28,039
letting our face be soft

11
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,759
area around the eyes the jaw

12
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:15,400
shoulders hanging loosely

13
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,759
the hands untensed

14
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:07,199
suffering usually arises as a kind of increase

15
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:12,759
density somewhere in body mind

16
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,720
and so we breathe in such a way

17
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:35,200
that smoothes out

18
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,518
the energy of body mind

19
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:39,120
we're we're not asking our breath to resolve the complications of our life

20
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:44,480
predicament of any human life

21
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,680
we're just using the soothing ripple

22
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:10,199
of the exhalation so as to suffer a little less right now

23
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:18,480
to bring tranquility

24
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,160
and a brightness right now

25
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:43,600
it's okay to put down the rest of our lives

26
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,480
just for this time

27
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:15,280
affect kind of emotional circuits

28
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:23,440
in our body or the the engine of so much

29
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:26,440
thinking

30
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:37,039
the kind of pool of energy increased density

31
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:45,760
in our body and this seems to necessitate

32
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:48,160
thought

33
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:57,080
we need to it's like our mind needs to understand

34
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:02,480
this little whirlpool of density in our body and our feeling

35
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,240
life yeah and

36
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,000
and our practice often

37
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,520
is just to smooth out the energy of our body

38
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,480
to breathe into it patiently

39
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:45,399
to commit to being softened by intensity rather than hardened by it

40
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:58,799
as we meet our bodies its densities

41
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,840
with this awareness and care

42
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:12,399
the whole realm of thinking

43
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:17,799
feels less urgent

44
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:45,919
just lavishing a kind of love awareness on your body

45
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:50,240
using the breath if that's helpful

46
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,960
in unifying the field of the body smoothing out

47
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:02,200
the densities

48
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:33,749
[Music]

49
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,320
okay

50
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:56,480
so quote so far as we are mere bundles of habit

51
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,960
we are imitators and copiers of our past selves

52
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:08,079
it follows first of all that the teachers prime concern

53
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,079
should be to ingrain into the pupil that assortment of habits that shall be

54
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:22,158
most useful to them throughout life education is for behavior

55
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:28,960
and habits are the stuff of which behavior consists

56
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:34,800
the great thing in all education is to make our nervous system

57
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:39,838
our ally instead of our enemy

58
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:44,078
it's william james

59
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,000
so yesterday we

60
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:57,280
explored helplessness and power

61
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:05,520
opening opening the heart to helplessness illuminates our power

62
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:11,680
and today another pair renunciation

63
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,720
and passion so

64
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:26,480
the fantasy of something for nothing

65
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:31,520
runs deep in my mind you know

66
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:38,000
like sometimes i'll notice i'll just randomly look down at the sidewalk

67
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:43,440
to see if someone dropped money there you know like the thrill

68
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:48,960
of something for nothing runs deep

69
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:55,200
but mindfulness is not something for nothing

70
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:00,640
it is a path of relinquishment

71
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:07,040
and we don't exactly

72
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,838
get to have the dharma and have our life

73
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:22,720
we don't exactly get to have the dharma and our life but i want my life i want my dreams and

74
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:29,200
my stories and my pleasures and my routines my habits

75
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:36,240
and i want the dharma but um

76
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:41,359
i don't know i don't think we can have it all that might be

77
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:46,160
a kind of american fantasy of buddhism

78
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:54,240
on renunciation the fact that the buddha was a monk gets

79
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:59,839
lost of course people are free to practice as they want nonetheless many western

80
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:06,560
dharma centers seem to marginalize but to the rest of the buddhist world is central and historically vital to the

81
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:13,040
whole process of dharma practice and enlightenment it's like opening up the chest attaching

82
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:19,839
all the veins and arteries carefully removing the heart and maintaining the body on a life support system

83
00:37:19,839 --> 00:37:26,320
one can't help wonder is this thing really alive is this going to carry on

84
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:32,240
obviously my perspective is slanted

85
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:38,640
a card carrying monk but in wedging dharma teachings into a

86
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:46,079
comfortable life one may be missing something that's crucial to the dharma

87
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:54,400
i would suggest that people look closely at that is the dharma something that i tack onto

88
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:01,200
my life or is it something that i offer myself up to

89
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:08,240
i've always loved that phrase um it's the dharma something we

90
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:12,880
tack on or offer ourselves up to

91
00:38:16,839 --> 00:38:24,400
we fear impoverishment in letting go

92
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,000
but as we let go as we let go the

93
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,800
the whole in the center of our being gets smaller

94
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:43,040
yeah the hole in the center of our being gets smaller we need less to fill it up in other

95
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:50,960
words as we relinquish as we let go this actually frees us up

96
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:58,000
and we know that we can let go we know we can let go and so we're not afraid

97
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:03,359
or less afraid of not having what we like

98
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:14,119
i think we uh

99
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:20,640
practitioners um are perhaps a little too vigilant about

100
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:27,200
pleasure you know it's like um at the slightest sign of pleasure we say

101
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:34,720
to ourselves kind of like oh my goodness like don't get attached don't get attached yeah

102
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:40,000
and so there's a certain kind of almost defensiveness against pleasure

103
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,839
in our practice in our lives

104
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,760
as we train we know we can let go and we're less afraid

105
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,359
about holding on we know we can just let go

106
00:39:57,359 --> 00:40:02,800
again an attachment in the end is not uh it's

107
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:07,599
not a sin it's just tuka yeah

108
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:16,240
i remember um a friend uh a kind of wild brilliant dharma friend

109
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:21,920
um emphasis on wild you know saying uh

110
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:29,119
that the meditative path is um parasympathetically biased

111
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:35,680
biased towards the the tranquilizing side

112
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:41,839
but this path is enlivens and brightens us

113
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:46,160
rather than flattens us

114
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,680
and all this letting go this renunciation

115
00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:00,559
frees us up to enjoy pleasure and goodness more completely

116
00:41:02,079 --> 00:41:08,240
it's um it frees us up to enjoy pleasure more completely

117
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:13,359
and so sometimes we we make the distinction between

118
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,560
um craving and desire tanha

119
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,720
chanda um and tanja that craving is that kind of

120
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:31,599
bottomless thirst the fever dream of longing that's never actually

121
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,640
satisfied yeah and so sometimes i

122
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:42,720
say like craving is our frenemy yeah as the kids say

123
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,240
craving is our frenemy but what distinguishes desire from

124
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:54,079
craving is that desire can actually be satisfied

125
00:41:54,079 --> 00:42:02,640
in desire and longing we're actually not asking too much of pleasure

126
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,720
we're asking just right

127
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:13,920
now this path is a path of dismantling craving

128
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:20,720
but as we do that as we work to dismantle

129
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:27,039
tanha sometimes chanda gets squashed too

130
00:42:28,319 --> 00:42:34,640
and as we uh as we let go some of the driveness the

131
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,160
desperation around pleasure is gone

132
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:46,560
and so we can actually enjoy we can actually enjoy

133
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:52,000
now i talk about um um

134
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:58,720
equanimity with unpleasantness a lot yeah it is a this is a path of

135
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,720
purification and it reveres the wholesome unpleasant

136
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:12,240
the wholesome unpleasant has a kind of reverential place on this path

137
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:17,760
but what does equanimity with pleasure look like

138
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:25,520
we're being asked to have equanimity with that too and i would say equanimity with pleasure

139
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:31,520
looks like a very uncomplicated intense

140
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:36,880
delight and satisfaction it looks like

141
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:41,838
enjoyment without compulsivity

142
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:50,720
and um do we still prefer pleasure over pain of

143
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,920
course but um our heart is more

144
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,880
flexible less dependent less reliant on budgeting

145
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,720
pleasure in the usual ways we do

146
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,240
and even even egoic pleasure yeah

147
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:20,480
uh we're not defended against that either we feel that that feels better than

148
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:27,839
insults yeah or yeah we we're not defended against it

149
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:32,880
nor are we entangled in it you know

150
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:40,799
a big part of dharma is um

151
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:47,040
about um d shaming suffering

152
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:54,480
pain we were so moralistic anytime we feel

153
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,319
feel pain or kind of run into the first noble truth we're moralistic about it we

154
00:45:00,319 --> 00:45:06,000
make it mean something about our being and so a lot of dharma practice is about

155
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:11,040
d shaming pain but it's also about d shaming

156
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:13,599
pleasure

157
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:21,800
and it's a tender zone for exploration because we are

158
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:27,839
exposed in our desire we are exposed in our pleasure

159
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:33,920
in our dependence and our need and our longing we're less self-contained and

160
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,960
more there's a vulnerability in that too

161
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:43,359
if we're we're doing this consciously

162
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:52,559
and um we start to

163
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:01,760
to free ourselves up to loosen up we become alive in our pleasure we ask our

164
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:07,119
pleasure only to do what it can do and not more

165
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:15,040
and so this gesture of relinquishment of renunciation of simplicity

166
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,079
actually frees us up in some

167
00:46:20,079 --> 00:46:26,880
deep ways to to enjoy to enjoy deeply

168
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:32,560
