1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,520
okay again good day um everyone in the

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:12,799
IM amc7 a.m. YouTube

3
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:20,199
channel I'm happy to spend this week with you I'd like to offer uh just a few uh

4
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:26,560
orienting words for this week and then we'll begin our

5
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:34,000
meditation and uh the daret and so this week uh I wanted to share

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,360
some Reflections on the teachings of five

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:46,960
Aggregates and many of you and may have heard this before or if if this is new

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:52,120
um you know uh receive this as a new teaching for

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:01:00,680
you and in particular uh this week uh I'd like to share a sutta that has

10
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,280
very Vivid uh similes that describes this five uh

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:15,720
Aggregates and the PO term is condas and I think Gil uh translates this as five

12
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:23,759
BOS this days it's a very Central teaching um in the Buddha

13
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:31,240
Dharma and uh the reason I picked out uh the simile is because

14
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:39,680
uh the Buddha uh seems to be quite a master at using similes to point at the

15
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:45,159
felt sense of um this five bundles of

16
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:51,119
human processes and so simile are very Visual

17
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:56,719
and uh we can feel potentially we can sense how it is in

18
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:05,880
us and the Buddha repeatedly um point out that this five Aggregates or five

19
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:12,560
bundles of human processes are to be seen to be felt

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,760
clearly to be known clearly for what they

21
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,879
are and they're often um said to be uh

22
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:31,319
called as a five cleaning Aggregates or five cleaning bundles

23
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:40,920
and partly because this is the where the cleaning Force tends to uh gets get uh

24
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:48,920
involved and so it's important to see this processes uh just as they are and

25
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:57,239
noticing how the cleaning began to come in and learning to soften and relax the

26
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,080
cleaning and so in this 5 days days uh each morning in the

27
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:11,599
meditation we will be uh I will try my best to evoke some felt sense of what

28
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,319
the simile are pointing to and then in the daret uh I'll

29
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:24,959
elaborate some more using words and so you can think of this week

30
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:30,840
almost as if as if it's kind of a a longer

31
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:37,720
meditation 45 minutes of meditation if you like uh

32
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:44,519
where uh the meditation and the dads are very connected and so my

33
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:51,280
invitation is that uh I will still be raining Bell at

34
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:58,360
uh the half an hour mark and then transition to offer more words and

35
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,599
elaborations about out at the simile each of the

36
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:08,920
simes but maybe you can sit in your meditative

37
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:15,760
bubble and receiving the words almost as a continuation of a

38
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,639
guided meditation maybe the teaching will uh kind of settle into your system

39
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,680
in a different way and so that's an invitation and you don't have to and if

40
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:35,360
it feels like a you want to switch the mode feel free to do that

41
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:43,600
um but that's an option I wanted to uh uh point out maybe at the beginning of

42
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,759
this week so with that uh we'll go into the

43
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:57,280
meditation and today we'll be working with the first uh aggregate or the first

44
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:05,199
bundle uh which in which the Buddha used a lump of

45
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:12,840
foam that forms um and the rivers kind of you know he was sitting by the river

46
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,120
ganji and uh he saw like big lumps of

47
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:24,120
Foams floating on top of the river Ki or some

48
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:33,000
rivers and he's pointing out that well this is how our material body is

49
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:41,520
like and look at this carefully um attentively and see how this is for

50
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:45,879
you and so we'll

51
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,629
[Music]

52
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:59,520
begin so settling in with the sound of the Bell

53
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:12,560
maybe taking a few moment imagine as if you're entering

54
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,360
into this sacret Temple within this

55
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:22,960
body mind and heart

56
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,280
if it's helpful take a few long deep breaths as you

57
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,280
enter

58
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:07,840
within as you breathe out out settle into the Inner

59
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,879
Space maybe there is a felt sense of coming into the

60
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:26,680
body coming into the body sitting or lying

61
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,599
down or whatever posture you may may be taking right

62
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:56,000
now gently softly

63
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:01,360
inviting mind and heart to

64
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:07,720
enter with the body and maybe through the

65
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,919
body becoming

66
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:26,919
present present for this moment

67
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,760
maybe the sense of a Here and

68
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,959
Now becomes more

69
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,680
obvious foregrounded

70
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,600
being available to the present moment

71
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:36,959
the present moment is available to

72
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:47,200
us one moment at a time

73
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,279
maybe the sound

74
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:31,160
silence temperature different parts of the skin

75
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:41,160
and the breath

76
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,560
a movement of the breath is available to

77
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:25,680
us are you

78
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,240
available to this life

79
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:38,720
breath Happening Here and

80
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,200
Now e

81
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:44,440
a breath may have a sense of flow to

82
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:47,720
it a

83
00:12:52,399 --> 00:13:00,360
rhythm a felt sense in different parts of the body

84
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:06,199
expanding

85
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:15,439
Contracting belly rising and falling

86
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:51,639
allow this movements of the breath to be received in the

87
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:58,040
open kind soft field of

88
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
knowing e

89
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:38,759
the movements of the breath May permeate throughout the whole

90
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,079
body en livening

91
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:25,240
that energetic flow of the breath animates the body

92
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:42,319
you may notice the dancing

93
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,480
Sensations

94
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:55,319
vibrations POS

95
00:16:22,279 --> 00:16:25,759
there a Riv of

96
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:36,959
life we can feel the energetic formations of this

97
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:39,959
body

98
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,679
what's the felt sense for

99
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,678
you maybe Airy

100
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:27,360
light a little bubbly

101
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:56,039
like a lump of foam on the floating lever

102
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:32,919
dancing Sensations maybe like soap

103
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:37,720
bubbles a layer of so

104
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:52,320
bubbles rising and bursting

105
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
away

106
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,679
e e

107
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:33,559
resting in the immediacy of your

108
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:45,280
experience releasing

109
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:53,480
ideas conceptual overlays

110
00:21:05,559 --> 00:21:09,520
trusting your own F

111
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
sense

112
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

113
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520

114
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

115
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

116
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

117
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
e e

118
00:25:15,159 --> 00:25:20,880
maybe this

119
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,679
energetic breathing

120
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:30,320
body has a kind of

121
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:36,240
Foy feeling to it

122
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:05,120
the sensations ever shifting and

123
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
changing

124
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

125
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

126
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

127
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

128
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

129
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
e e

130
00:30:00,919 --> 00:30:10,000
relaxing softening into the sea of the

131
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,760
sensations of this

132
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:30,840
body the breathing Chi

133
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,480
body maybe a sense

134
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,720
Emeral light

135
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:33,398
Hollow so the sensations are ever arising and bursting away

136
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:28,360
now ring bell in a moment but if you like to stay in your

137
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,399
your felt sense meditative

138
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:38,720
bubble please feel free to do so

139
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:52,940
[Music]

140
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:10,440
and so I'd like to offer some

141
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:16,240
Reflections uh about this five Aggregates in the first one that we

142
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:22,960
started with the simile of a lump of a foam that's used

143
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:29,399
to point to this felt sense of of our

144
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:37,000
material body material form and I like to read uh this part of

145
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,679
the suta for you and since you're kind of in a

146
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:50,360
meditative space right now maybe this

147
00:33:50,360 --> 00:34:00,039
simil as um offered in the sutta um has a certain flavor for

148
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:07,360
you this is in Sam nikaya number

149
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:19,638
22.95 and it says that the Buddha was staying on the bank of the ganes

150
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:27,079
river as see imagine yourself kind of sitting in the Bank of a River floating

151
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:32,679
River now maybe he's sitting there kind of

152
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:39,919
surveying the S right there and he said this to

153
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:46,839
them practitioners suppose this ganes River

154
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:55,358
was carrying along a big lump of foam and a person with clear eyes would

155
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:02,240
see it and count cont template it examine it

156
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:08,680
carefully and it would appear to them as completely

157
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:14,520
void Hollow and [Music]

158
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:22,960
insubstantial for what substance would it be would there be in a lump of

159
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:29,400
foam in the same way a practitioner

160
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:38,320
sees and contemplates any kind of a for form at all this is a material form of

161
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:45,200
his body past future or present internal or

162
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:50,720
external Co or fine interior or inferior

163
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:58,319
or Superior near or far examine it carefully and and it

164
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:03,480
appear appears to them as completely

165
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,480
void Hollow and

166
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:17,640
insubstantial for what substance would there be in the material

167
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,960
form and so in the immediacy of our experience

168
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,400
um we can feel and sense what is this material

169
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:42,520
body can I imagine this lump of for Foams floating on uh a floating

170
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:49,839
River and the Foams are light Hollow you know

171
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:56,160
they are gathered from different little pieces of a foam and they're formed and

172
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,119
they get dispersed first as they Traverse down

173
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:09,839
stream and maybe small lumps of foam grow bigger and they kind of gather with

174
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:17,040
each other and their shapes would shift and change as they float

175
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,680
along and eventually they get dispersed

176
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:29,160
um and so the image is quite evocative and

177
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:35,839
Vivid just like this the Buddha is pointing out and this is how our

178
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:42,280
material form is like kind of the the material form that

179
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:48,520
we uh embody or inhabit it's like this lump of foam

180
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:54,560
floating on the River of Life past and future

181
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:02,400
present course or fine and this keeps on changing um as some of

182
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:11,400
you may have experienced in the meditation and um you know sometimes I

183
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:16,760
would imagine like um the little kids and when they were born kind of little

184
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:24,480
small lump of foam and they grow as um as they they become bigger and

185
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:32,040
physically and then eventually they kind of St stabilize um but the physical form keeps

186
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:39,599
on still keeps on changing and eventually um they fall apart right this

187
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:45,880
is a kind of a material form is like this and that's one way to relate to

188
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:53,000
this assimile maybe on the larger time span of our lives and there's also a

189
00:38:53,000 --> 00:39:01,960
scientific way of relating to this assimile and we all know that um our bodies in

190
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:08,319
the cellular level are ever shifting and changing I read recently and said

191
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:16,240
something like the mass of cells that we lose every year uh through normal cell deaths is

192
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:21,920
close to the entire body weight for me that was kind of amazing

193
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,599
isn't it they basically kind of a different person physically each

194
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:34,960
year um and we don't feel like that way you know we feel like it's the same person

195
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,680
somehow um but the Buddha is pointing at look at this

196
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:49,520
carefully and the way uh they were imagining this P this uh

197
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:58,200
body are based on a conceptual overlay and we can grasp on it it and

198
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:04,079
create a sense of a self on it and this is uh what the Buddha was often pointing

199
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:11,040
to in this um five aggregate teaching or five bundles teaching and this is where

200
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:21,119
we tends to exert a sense of a self I Me Mine my body my thoughts my

201
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:27,720
perceptions but in the immediacy of our experience

202
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:35,000
we ourselves can feel and sense in this embodied

203
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:42,640
experience uh in our meditation we can drop into this

204
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:49,880
microscopic level of Sensations and energetic feeling and that's also

205
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:56,400
present that we can know for ourselves it's like kind of the the

206
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:02,880
bubbles in the foam that arise and bursts

207
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:12,880
away I know for me uh I've heard people reporting how in the meditative practice

208
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:20,520
when we're kind of uh immersing ourselves in in this energetic Chi the

209
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:26,880
Chinese word chi uh chi body it literally feels like the whole body

210
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:33,440
melted into a a thick layer of soap

211
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:41,079
bubbles and this the Buddha is pointing at a very felt sense way of

212
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:46,319
knowing this kind of um material

213
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:53,960
body and when we are able to experience uh this for ourselves

214
00:41:53,960 --> 00:42:00,359
directly in our experience we can begin to question the usual ways

215
00:42:00,359 --> 00:42:07,680
of how we relate to this body which usually can be a rather

216
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:17,680
persistent and a permanent thing and we can misappropriate it

217
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,599
as my body I me mind you know I am

218
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:33,800
this and there is a real cost to this kind of Mis appropriation or misp

219
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:42,599
perception because uh there can be Dua arising out of

220
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:51,040
this this conceptual overlay that we put on top of the Ever Changing shifting

221
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:57,280
experience obscures the reality the changing nature

222
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:03,400
and we can end up grasping and clinging to things that are actually not

223
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:11,838
graspable graspable right how can how can we grasp the empty

224
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:18,200
foam and yet we do and we do when we're

225
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:24,280
constructing this conceptual layer that we feel that's more persistent or more

226
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:30,280
permanent so through the direct experience of our

227
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:37,319
material form without the stirring of the grasping

228
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:43,359
Force we have an opportunity to offer our deep

229
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:52,280
respect and gratitude and care for this material form to be just what it

230
00:43:52,640 --> 00:44:01,359
is so like the forms of uh the lumps of the foam on the flo floating

231
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:09,319
River it's a wanderous AFF formation wand is a formation of the

232
00:44:09,319 --> 00:44:16,400
nature coming and going offering whatever they may offer

233
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:21,640
to this world and so we can have a different

234
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:27,359
relationship to this material form just as it is

235
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:32,119
it's a wondrous formation that's ever

236
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:38,480
changing has its own Beauty has its own shifting and changing

237
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:46,839
sense which is bow to this maybe that actually offers a kind

238
00:44:46,839 --> 00:44:53,800
of a nourishing feeling to our heart and mind offers a kind of a a freeing kind

239
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:59,280
of a feeling to our heart and mind and rather rather than this kind of graspy

240
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:08,000
feeling to us and so my invitation uh for the rest

241
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:14,240
of the today is as you go about the day maybe

242
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:20,760
um you know feel and sense the foess of this material

243
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:27,760
body and see what you discover allow kind of a shift to shift

244
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:33,040
of perceptions to come forth and shift of

245
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:38,079
relationship uh to this aform to the

246
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:46,200
form and may that all offer nourishment nourishment care and the freedom to our

247
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:53,680
heart and mind so thank you everyone and we'll continue

248
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:00,200
tomorrow uh to expand uh into a second um

249
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:07,720
aggregate so be well everyone and we'll see you soon
