30
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:33,300
I've been on this um uh role of of guiding

31
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:40,259
um subtle what I what I there's so many ways to call it but perhaps

32
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:46,680
characterized as sort of a subtle meta it's a silence quiet nourishing

33
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:54,120
glistening turning into into a sense of Stillness as a nourishment of of loving

34
00:04:54,120 --> 00:05:01,740
kindness care Stillness which is a way of kind of stealing it's not very busy with which which is wonderful the

35
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:08,100
busyness is wonderful too with the phrases and may I be happy may you be happy all the phrase that's wonderful

36
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:13,740
and fantastic as well and this is a different way this is a

37
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:19,560
slightly different maybe a little subtle nourishing calming quieting just a sense

38
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,440
of fear and love imbuing just imbuing our

39
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:32,000
experience it's it's as if yeah the words loving awareness whatever

40
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:38,100
awareness turns to and is aware of the there's a sense of warmth and care that

41
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:46,139
in that intertwines that that that [Music] um really imbues that that knowing and it

42
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:53,880
just becomes a very kind knowing and that if the knowing is turning towards suffering and pain becomes just a very

43
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:59,759
gentle knowing of that it's still quiet and still it's not very active uh which

44
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,900
again is wonderfully different work just more still so so having said that I'd like to invite

45
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:12,900

166
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:05,040
that there is silence in between the words here and so with kindness acceptance

167
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:11,579
spaciousness for everything that there is so so um

168
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:17,400
I'll share with you the feeling that came up for me through this meditation it felt like

169
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:22,859
in some ways towards the end especially as my heart and mind we're getting more

170
00:45:22,859 --> 00:45:29,760
and more subtle and stable and settling into samadhi concentration States

171
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:37,140
um it felt like I was sitting in my own meditation and you were all joining me

172
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:42,420
it didn't feel like I was leading you or guiding you or was effort it was just

173
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:48,900
like oh yeah we're all sitting together you're joining me in my practice of the resistance of spaciousness for me the

174
00:45:48,900 --> 00:45:54,599
sense of gratitude for all of you to be joining me as I practice like oh this is

175
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:03,839
so sweet like hey this is so great so it's um it's a it's really such a gift for me

176
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:09,180
um and and guiding leading doesn't feel effortful

177
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:18,319
does really feel like there's a give and take of generosity in this space so I'm I'm really grateful for this so

178
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:23,060
grateful for you thank you

179
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:32,220
so I'd like to invite you if there are any Reflections so any questions comments

180
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:40,920
bill please hi Nikki hi hi I wanted to thank you for

181
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:48,180
the the imagery of the the puppy of the Mind um what I noticed was I guess it seems

182
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:53,700
obvious now but it's so much easier to have space and to include things when

183
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:59,099
your attitude is one of kindness and it seems like the default attitude

184
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:04,319
for Me Maybe for most people is is to push away

185
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:10,740
things that are unwanted this seemed to include everything I mean what you were doing was seeing from seemed to just

186
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:16,200
incorporate everything and um I really enjoyed it and thank you very

187
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:23,220
much beautiful Bill thank you so much for your reflections

188
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:28,859
yes exactly that your Insight is so profound

189
00:47:28,859 --> 00:47:35,520
that we do tend to get rid of things push them away and it's

190
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:42,660
um and we usually don't see it we usually don't see it it's kind of the default

191
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:49,400
mode that we operate in it's just started to fall it's like fish in the water we don't see it

192
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:56,220
and um and what you were saying was oh yeah what this different mode of including

193
00:47:56,220 --> 00:48:01,980
everything with kindness wow that's actually it's easier it's more spacious

194
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:07,740
it's wow this this works this works better wow there's something I'm often

195
00:48:07,740 --> 00:48:13,079
hears yeah I'm noticing something here so yes bill that's exactly it and keep

196
00:48:13,079 --> 00:48:20,339
keep nourishing keep watering uh this Insight is so profound include

197
00:48:20,339 --> 00:48:28,520
everything push away nothing with kindness yeah beautiful thank you

198
00:48:31,619 --> 00:48:38,640
yeah I see a question asks what can we do with negative

199
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:47,400
thoughts and energy arising all the time yeah yeah well I think

200
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:54,780
bill just answered the question so that is exactly it so if we do try to keep to

201
00:48:54,780 --> 00:49:01,859
push it away to try to get rid of it try if we have an adversarial relationship

202
00:49:01,859 --> 00:49:09,240
with it these negative thoughts again ah instead okay okay

203
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:15,359
all right I see you thank you you have some good you have good intentions and

204
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:21,240
yet you're kind of misguided it's okay it's okay it's all right

205
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:27,420
um so again with that kindness turning towards negative thoughts energy

206
00:49:27,420 --> 00:49:34,800
Etc with kindness because by if you turn towards them with with negativity if you

207
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:40,020
try to push them away you're just giving them more power you're giving them more energy

208
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:45,359
and I trust there is enough creativity you have enough creative to figure out

209
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:51,660
how can I bring some more kindness and acceptance and acceptance doesn't mean that you act out of the negative

210
00:49:51,660 --> 00:49:56,760
thoughts and energy doesn't mean that doesn't mean condoning it doesn't mean

211
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:03,119
acting it out at all it just means you are accepting the truth of this moment

212
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:08,460
that in this moment here this negative thought is arising because of past

213
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:15,780
conditioning whatever it is mind external societal education genes family

214
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:21,740
whatever it is it's coming up all right dear negative thought I see you

215
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:28,800
ah it's okay I see you I don't believe you when I see you but this is this

216
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:36,119
turning this this acknowledgment with kindness and just that it takes the power away it

217
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:45,680
changes our habit pattern with with negativity I hope that helps get a cut

218
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:52,740
the other question oh actually you know the time has come to turn to small groups I see

219
00:50:52,740 --> 00:51:01,260
so let's do that let's turn so here's the invitation so the small groups this

220
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:08,880
evening here's an inquiry I'm going to suggest a a question that you can inquire with sit

221
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,760
with if you want with silence in the community

222
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:19,680
that is um maybe one creative way that you have

223
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:26,339
maybe one imagery you have where you is is as uh following up on what Bill

224
00:51:26,339 --> 00:51:31,440
shared and kindergarten asked with when challenging when negative thoughts come

225
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:39,180
up Etc or negative challenges maybe comma Now how do you what what way in

226
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:46,500
you have worked with them with kindness turn for them with kindness and if you haven't yet successfully how can you um

227
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:52,020
an idea of oh yeah maybe I'll try this maybe I I can see myself trying this

228
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:57,240
maybe imagine it like a sock puppet uh which intense well but it's just a

229
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:03,660
little misguided you don't know anything you're you're you're no good you're a failure like okay well thank you thanks

230
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:11,160
for your opinion like maybe I can imagine that or or maybe you just hold silence maybe you just hold silence okay

231
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:17,940
I'm just holding silence so so an invitation is we'll go in alphabetical order I actually let's do reverse

232
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:24,180
alphabetical origins or the fun of it and maybe share one one bot one

233
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:29,400
reflection or say pass you can share your silence the next person will say

234
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:35,819
something and then the next person and then your turn comes you go around and round a few rounds and you can always

235
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:42,240
say past share from your own experience no questions no no directing others just

236
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:47,339
share from your own heart okay so I'm going to create the breakout rooms

237
00:52:47,339 --> 00:52:54,240
always remember meta taking care of yourself taking care of others and I am

238
