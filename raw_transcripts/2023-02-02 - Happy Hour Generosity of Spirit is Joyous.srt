guidance come through and maybe I say a few words at the end so let's do that I'm liking that that different that that

7
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:48,059

on a bench cross-legged on the floor or lying down standing

11
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,040
inhale the postures all okay

12
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,220
and bringing awareness into this body seated as always we land

13
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:27,680
with the body arrive with the breath with the sensations

14
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:34,619

now let us consider

43
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:48,200
it's a reflection that the Buddha

44
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,639
taught to

45
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,980
everyone especially folks

46
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,980
first he taught generosity generosity of spirit

47
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:17,240
then ethics and then cultivation of mind and heart through meditation

48
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:26,640
so at this reflection as we bring this in we're going to work with it in our meditation

49
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:33,360
sense of generosity of spirit ah

[Music]

127
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:42,600
thanks everyone thank you for your practice ah

128
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:49,440
this practice was uh as I mentioned um the Buddha tight especially to lay

129
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:57,240
folks um generosity ethics and then mental cultivation meditation so really

130
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:03,000
generosity and as a preparation for everything and then

131
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:08,940
ethical the sense of uprightness the sense of Integrity again as a basis for

132
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:14,039
for stilling the mind for for mental cultivation for meditation which is what

133
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:20,520
we do so it's important to bring attention to these two and in this meditation

134
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:26,340
really an invitation for us to feel the sense of generosity of spirit it's not

135
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:32,360
just about giving things and material but this attitude of generosity to have

136
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:39,299
towards ourselves and towards others towards our thoughts towards everything internal especially if

137
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:45,659
something challenging internal as well as external and and generosity is Happy

138
00:32:45,659 --> 00:32:52,500
making generosity brings joy as a precondition for Joy so so uh I hope you

139
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,980
did experience that that bad feeling of just joyfulness and I certainly felt it

140
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:05,279
for me it was a sense of happiness in imagining myself being generous to to to

141
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,559
folks and just the spirit of generosity ah happy making happy making happy

142
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:15,960
making bill says love this meditation seems like generosity of spirit is closely

143
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:23,700
connected to patients and having fewer expectations of how things should be yes indeed yeah thanks for that reflection

144
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:30,539
Bill beautiful yeah so so I'd like to invite us now

145
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:36,600
with that having patience and a few expectations of how things should be for

146
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:43,559
us to take that sense of generosity into are small groups of interacting with two

147
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:49,278
other human beings with a sense of spaciousness opening

148
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,919
um and doesn't have to go any particular way we don't have to show up in a particular way or sound smart or

149
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:01,500
accomplished or anything and then the um the reflections the question that I like

150
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:08,040
to invite you um two questions one is what blocks generosity of spirit so you'll go around

151
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:16,200
just one each person will say we'll share one thing or we can also say paths what blocks generosity of spirit for you

152
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:22,320
is it lack of time being in a hurry you know whatever it might be what what blocks it

153
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:30,480
you go around once and then the other the the second question the round two is what supports

154
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:38,099
generosity of spirit what supports it maybe mindfulness maybe awareness maybe remembering maybe some you know for each

155
00:34:38,099 --> 00:34:45,599
person might be something different that you bring in so you go around and round a few times so so I will make the groups

156
00:34:45,599 --> 00:34:53,638
and as always be kind to yourself be kind to to others

157
00:34:53,639 --> 00:35:00,960
um really breakout groups or breakthrough groups is where a lot of breakthroughs happen in terms of

158
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:07,800
um yeah our our practice is where the rubber meets the road so again you just

159
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:13,380
offer one thing not asking questions directly in the conversation dominating and make sure you leave space for

160
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:19,920
everyone as a part of your act of generosity show up generously show up with generosity can I show up with

161
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:27,920
generosity and interact with two other human beings here and let's Go reverse alphabetical

162
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,000
alphabetical order okay all right here we go

163
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:39,420
okay the rooms are closed everybody's back welcome back and

164
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:45,780
you have time for maybe one or two quick Reflections what did you notice either

165
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:52,380
with the meditation or the small group so what came up any aha moments you like to share especially if you haven't been

166
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:56,540
speaking lately Jesse

167
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:04,079
yeah thank you Nikki for this practice uh near the beginning when you talked about infusing the body with generosity

168
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:10,260
I had the sense of uh forgiveness and uh forgiveness is not something I

169
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:15,359
hear very much in Buddhist Meditation area like sanghas

170
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:21,599
but I hear about Donna and generosity all the time so I'm wondering if you could talk about the relationship between generosity and

171
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,119
forgiveness yeah they're they're so as as you mentioned as you've noticed

172
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:33,720
actually they're so tightly connected um and and it is a generosity of spirit

173
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:39,660
right of course it's your generosity of spirit is the precursor it's all related to to forgiveness and there's specific

174
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:46,920
practices for forgiveness and then there's forgiveness there's more specific teachings in different in

175
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:54,599
Traditions that Buddhism has borrowed from so we do teach on forgiveness but there isn't so much of it traditionally

176
00:36:54,599 --> 00:37:01,380
um about forgiveness so so yeah I think it's kind of distributed in in the other

177
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:07,920
um another uh teachings yeah including generosity because Donna really Donna

178
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:15,240
isn't just giving money it's just it's it really infusing the heart and spirit it's just it's such it's a huge teaching

179
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:21,260
so thank you for bringing that in that that intuition thank you Nikki thank you

180
00:37:21,260 --> 00:37:27,980
and Amy make it quick here we go whoops wait here I got there

181
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:34,380
yeah very quick so um one thing that came up for me that makes it challenging is

182
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:41,099
um capacity and so what came up on the other end was um boundaries so when I have it sounds

183
00:37:41,099 --> 00:37:47,579
counterintuitive but when I have really great boundaries I actually have way more capacity to be generous so that was

184
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:54,420
really neat that feeling of insight there nice thank you for sharing that Insight beautiful yeah that sense of

185
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:59,700
having its generosity to yourself so that you know what your limits and what

186
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:05,480
your capacity is not to overextend and then knowing that generosity to yourself

187
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:11,640
kindness just then you can be generous instead of oh beautiful yay thank you

188
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:18,119
for sharing that insight for for everyone's benefit love it love it thank you all thank you for your practice
