1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:12,080
good morning friends welcome again to the morning

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,680
meditation and darmat and i'm happy to be having another day

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,960
with you and if you've been following along you probably

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:29,279
have surmised that we i'm going to talk about the fire element today

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:33,679
and we'll do a guided meditation with that

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:41,520
i wanted to start by naming especially sitting here at this moment in time and

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,879
the end of this summer the complexity

8
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:53,039
of our relationship with the elements it's not all

9
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,120
roses so to speak it we're very aware with the fire element

10
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:05,920
with the fires that have been burning with the amount of smoke even if you're not nearby that you've had

11
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:13,040
the people probably many of us know i do people whose houses have burned and the

12
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,680
vast swathes of forest and to acknowledge this these elements

13
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,880
are powerful the earth shakes

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,119
the waters flood the fires burn

15
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,360
they when we stand in face of these elements and see

16
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:43,920
the power of them there's can be it's a huge sense of awe that comes

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:50,560
through us and it's interesting having this the enormity of the elements the power

18
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:56,880
of them and to recognize that these same elements flow through us

19
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:04,719
we are not separate from that and a certain portion of that power is

20
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,239
flowing through us as well we're we're in conversation with that

21
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,920
and this is even more evident when we sort of feel into climate change and the

22
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,440
way every all the elements are being amplified and we

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:26,480
as human beings are very much much in relationship with that

24
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:32,400
we are an expression of the elements and we are affecting the elements

25
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,440
and whether we sense it on a very grand scale you know standing at the edge of

26
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:44,879
the grand canyon and looking in and seeing the power of water and earth

27
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,959
and the physical result of that or whether you taste a

28
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:58,159
summer tomato and feel the sun and the earth in it the elements are

29
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:07,760
expressing themselves all around us in these subtle and powerful ways

30
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,120
and as we touch in and practice with the elements we're being invited into this

31
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,200
full complexity of from the very

32
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:27,440
subtle sensations in our body to the grand expressions

33
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,879
that are around us i

34
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:39,440
will say for myself that i live where i do in the desert in

35
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,040
utah partially because i really enjoy

36
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:50,239
the dramatic expression of the elements the

37
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:56,239
fiery sun and the earth rising up dramatically and the intensity of the

38
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,360
wind and the storms when they come there is a

39
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,840
potency and aliveness when we meet that rawness of the elements

40
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:13,439
and it can be terrifying as well that word awe

41
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,600
includes both of those so i want to name that as we move into

42
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,800
practicing with the fire element the complexity and the

43
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,880
breadth of the experience that we have with them

44
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:38,400
so please go ahead and find your meditation your comfortable meditation

45
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,400
posture

46
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,639
and i'd like to begin by reading a quite a very wonderful quote from

47
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:07,120
john seed and joanna macy speaking about fire

48
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:15,360
fire from our sun that fuels all life drawing up plants and raising the waters

49
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,560
to the sky to fall again replenishing the inner furnace of our metabolism

50
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,120
burns with the fire of the big bang that first sent matter energy spinning

51
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,479
through space and time and the same fire as the lightning that

52
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:41,440
flashed in the primordial soup catalyzing the birth of organic life

53
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,800
you were there i was there for each cell of our bodies is descended

54
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,320
in an unbroken chain from that event

55
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,360
allowing your body sensing it

56
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,758
feel it in contact with the earth

57
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,120
scan through and find any places of tension

58
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:32,600
and let this pull this connection with the earth let it be here let yourself rest into it

59
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:55,120
you can touch in to the other elements as we begin feel

60
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:01,759
the weight and heaviness of your body feel the contact with the ground

61
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:06,120
and the ground beneath you

62
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,720
feel the wateriness of your body as you soften

63
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,759
as you bring attention to different parts of the body and the little micro movements

64
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,919
of the softening allowing the water element to come from frozen

65
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:03,120
into its softer more liquid form the rigidity of the body being released

66
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:10,160
letting the spine stand tall

67
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:16,800
with the earth element the solidity holding you up

68
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:25,000
and the softness of the water

69
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:51,920
and then beginning to allow yourself to come into contact with the fire element

70
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:59,920
first sensing very simply and directly the places of heat

71
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:05,040
of warmth and of cool on your body

72
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,800
perhaps there's places where the clothes the

73
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:18,080
warmth of certain parts that are in contact with more protection and then the exposure perhaps

74
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,519
feet or hands or face

75
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,160
letting yourself also feel internally

76
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:58,360
the warmth the warmth in your belly

77
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,880
the warmth in your chest

78
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,800
this fire element that comes

79
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,880
that comes from our sun the sun

80
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,720
heating the ground the plants photosynthesizing

81
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:20,079
the energy accumulating and as the energy accumulates

82
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:28,720
and then we eat it we take in that energy we're running on sun fuel

83
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:37,160
the warmth of the sun warming us energizing us

84
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:47,440
the warmth comes from the outside from the sun

85
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:54,079
heating the earth we can feel it on our skin and we can feel it from the inside the

86
00:11:54,079 --> 00:12:00,000
sun transformed into energy taken in

87
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,639
used with movement and digestion

88
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:13,279
keeping it all alive and then dissipating

89
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:20,720
this element of fire is constantly changing

90
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:28,560
warm to cool cool to warm as it passes through

91
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:41,279
constantly in a state of disintegration as well this food comes in the energy is

92
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,480
used and dissipated released

93
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,800
and gone

94
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,120
feeling the sun in your belly

95
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:17,440
and this energy also in our heart we feel the sense of

96
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:25,440
fire of passion in our heart there's a heat a warmth

97
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,639
of our heart it's like there's a line

98
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:38,720
going from sun to heart to molten earth down below us

99
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:48,600
from molten to molten our hearts here in the middle

100
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:57,279
feel how you too are part as john seed has said

101
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:02,800
part of that big bang the energy of the universe

102
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:08,000
the heat of it is in your body

103
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:14,720
temporarily being expressed and just like the sun

104
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:22,839
burning itself burning itself out but burning brightly

105
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:47,920
you might also sense in yourself the urges the urge to move the urge to

106
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:55,519
do things the passion for life for things that you care about

107
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:03,120
this heatedness of us this is an expression too

108
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,839
of the fire element as it expresses itself in us

109
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:44,079
the sun the energy the warmth and cool flowing through us

110
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:51,040
we are part of this vast exchange of the fire element

111
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,160
no inside no outside simply fire element

112
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:04,600
passing through combining with other elements and being released

113
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:37,120
feel the change we're cool then heat

114
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,279
change directly on your skin in your belly

115
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:48,680
how it changes energetically in your heart

116
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:57,720
in the restlessness and calm with your body

117
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:11,839
if there is something in your life that is present and agitating you

118
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:21,760
or eliciting passion or compassion let yourself feel the fire aspect of it

119
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,679
don't need to go into the content but let yourself feel

120
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,919
now this too is the fire element

121
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:09,440
let yourself tune to the fire element however it's showing up most clearly to

122
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:16,640
you letting it flow and change

123
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,080
coming and going fire element

124
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:26,200
simply moving through

125
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,720
so

126
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,400
so

127
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:24,279
so

128
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,400
so

129
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:48,200
so

130
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,760
so

131
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:41,520
where do you sense warmth and cools now in your skin and your belly and your

132
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,520
heart

133
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:53,480
coming going changing

134
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,200
is there fire in some way or are you more tuned to the absence of

135
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:29,240
fire the cooling the quiet

136
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,520
so

137
00:31:14,670 --> 00:31:17,759
[Music]

138
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:24,039
so

139
00:31:52,240 --> 00:32:00,518
the quote from john seed and joanna macy's so wonderful that i'd like to read it to you again

140
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:08,480
fire from our sun that fuels all life drawing up plants and raising the waters

141
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:15,279
to the sky to fall again replenishing the inner furnace of our metabolism

142
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:22,240
burns with the fire of the big bang that first scent matter

143
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:28,640
energy spinning through space and time and the same fire as the lightning that

144
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:35,200
flashed in the primordial soup catalyzing the birth of organic life

145
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:41,440
you were there i was there for each cell of our bodies is descended

146
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,320
in an unbroken chain from that event

147
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,840
lovely image the lightning spark of

148
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:02,399
life bringing us all here keeping us all going

149
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:08,320
and as i shared in the meditation we're most aware of the fire element in the

150
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:14,640
essence of sun and heat and energy and if you think about the amount of

151
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:22,880
that energy is such a key component in our lives we can energy both personally

152
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:29,919
inside us with our you know every step we take is an expression

153
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:35,039
of sun of fire of energy coming through us

154
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:43,440
i move my hand and it's like that's the result of the sun expressing itself here

155
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,279
and this way that the fire element not unlike the other one not unlike the

156
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:57,120
other ones but we're very aware with the fire element of this transition back and forth between heat

157
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,480
and cool the release and movement

158
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,398
of energy the whole play of matter and energy is so

159
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:16,398
clear here and the central element of digestion

160
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:22,000
i'll read to you the from that suit and i think i said

161
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:29,919
yesterday to somebody when they asked it was pseudo40 and i'm sorry it's also in suta 140 but the suta i'm actually

162
00:34:29,919 --> 00:34:35,679
quoting is number 62. and this is what he says about the fire

163
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,280
element what is the internal fire element

164
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:48,800
whatever internally belonging to oneself is fire fiery and clung to

165
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:56,079
that is that by which one is warmed ages and is consumed

166
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,119
and that by which what is eaten drunk consumed and tasted gets completely

167
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:08,880
digested or whatever else internally belonging to oneself is fire fiery and clung to

168
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,720
this is called the internal fire element now both the internal fire element and

169
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:21,200
the external fire element are simply fire element and that should be seen as it actually

170
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:27,440
is with proper wisdom thus this is not mine this i am not

171
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:32,880
this is not myself i want to point out something in this

172
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:37,920
that's a little different than the other elements he talks to

173
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:45,839
it talks about he says that by which one is warned ages and is consumed

174
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:50,880
there's a way and then he acknowledges the digestion and

175
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:58,480
but there's a way he's speaking here to this way the fire element has a also

176
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:05,520
a consuming a kind of moving from and he said ages the fact that in some

177
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:13,680
ways the fire element in us that we're burning with the fire element that it's what

178
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:20,640
um not only powers ourselves powers us but also burns us up

179
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:25,319
there's something very um

180
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,000
this is core to the fire element the way that it

181
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:39,960
consumes what in in its very expression it is consuming

182
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:49,920
and we can feel this also in the energy the passion of us

183
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:57,760
the warmth of the heart the fierce compassion has a desire to move to do to

184
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,560
express itself not just to sit or be and we feel this sometimes with the

185
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:11,280
passion of anger this consuming almost chaotic when you

186
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:16,480
watch a fire there's a chaoticness to it right there's like this

187
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:23,119
this energy that's quite uh

188
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:28,640
it's quite compelling for one thing but it's also got this

189
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:33,680
rather ferocious if you think of goddesses and in

190
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:38,720
hindu traditions and when you see fierce monsters there's that in the tibetan

191
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,920
tonkas they're expressing this consumptive

192
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:49,680
uh quality and one of the things here that becomes clear

193
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,880
is that when fire is paired with clinging

194
00:37:54,880 --> 00:38:02,400
as he points out to there when it is clung to then it is associated even more directly

195
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:08,720
with this agitation with consumption with greed with wanting

196
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:14,960
with destruction with anger

197
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:20,000
there's a lack of balance when it's paired with

198
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,160
the with clinging and this really points to the nature

199
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:32,800
of dominant experience or nature of our culture that we are the fire element i

200
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:39,440
mean look how we're burning we're burning the fossil fuels we're

201
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:47,520
burning with speed with energy and we're burning ourselves up in doing this

202
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,720
there's a lack of balance and yet we have this cultural attraction towards

203
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,720
the fire we we want to move faster do

204
00:38:58,839 --> 00:39:04,240
more and very interestingly in the buddhist

205
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:13,720
teachings when fire is paired with non-clinging

206
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:22,000
it is freedom it is nibana the bana is talked about as the cooling

207
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:29,838
the releasing of fire from that which is which it is which it clings to

208
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:36,800
read you a quote from fra john jutico a thai forest

209
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,800
monk he said the mind released is like fire that has gone out

210
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,280
the fire is not annihilated but is still there diffused in the air

211
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:56,040
it simply no longer latches on to any fuel

212
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:03,760
so this brings a query for us in our practice what is it to have this fire

213
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:08,839
this compassion of the of the heart the

214
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:14,640
warmth but not flavored with the clinging

215
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:22,640
by the greed and the wanting i had a very direct

216
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,880
felt experience of this releasing element of fire of

217
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:34,240
a sort of different cultural experience you might say

218
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,760
um i once went to burning man and the second

219
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:45,119
there's the there's a day where they burn this huge thing this man that

220
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,480
stands huge tall and it's fiery and energy and everybody's yelling and

221
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:56,480
screaming and there's this chaotic kind of energy

222
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:03,200
and then the next night there is a temple

223
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:09,119
that has been built some of you may have been there some of you this isn't your thing but just

224
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:16,160
imagine this huge beautiful temple all built out of wood

225
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,920
and it's and people over the week of burning man

226
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:28,960
have been going into this temple and you there's stairs and it's big

227
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:34,400
inside and it's raw wood and people

228
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:41,119
write on the temp inside the temple with you know like massive

229
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:46,880
invitation for graffiti they write the names

230
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:54,800
and messages to people that have passed in the previous year

231
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:03,520
so it's a temple to the impermanent passing and then on this

232
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:11,680
day it on this day after the burning of the man the temple is burned

233
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:20,880
huge fire all those names all those people

234
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,240
being sent and released and what was for me

235
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:32,319
incredibly dramatic about it is there were i think there's like 20 000 people

236
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,520
all surrounding the temple out at a distance

237
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:43,599
and it was so

238
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:52,079
quiet you could have heard a pin drop complete and utter quiet

239
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:58,640
recognizing the incredible power of fire

240
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,519
and release

241
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:12,480
and this is our practice release of clinging

242
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,839
in the silence in the stillness is the power and the

243
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:25,520
release of the power and our query as we practice

244
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:30,880
is to invite ourselves to burn with fierce compassion

245
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:36,480
for all forms and yet recognizing their ultimate empty

246
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,160
nature not to cling

247
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,680
everything is disintegrating that's it that's its nature

248
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:55,200
and in the midst of that the purity of the compassionate heart and the opportunity to meet at all

249
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:02,000
everything so fully and to know the blessing and the awe

250
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:08,880
of the world fire is an invitation

251
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,079
to all of this so

252
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:19,200
thank you all for joining this morning and i want to

253
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:25,040
um before you go offer you a practice for this day around fire

254
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:31,839
to see if you can feel the fire you can feel it just as heat and warmth but i

255
00:44:31,839 --> 00:44:38,319
invite you to feel fire and what it's like when you cling

256
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:45,920
when there's the fire element there's passion there's the urge to move and when is it connected

257
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:52,160
and held in place with clinging and what is the essence of fire as it

258
00:44:52,160 --> 00:45:01,279
moves through you in the moments when there's not clinging can you feel that difference

259
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:11,839
that's my invitation for you for today so thank you all again very much and
