00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:08,700
warm greetings from here the Insight Meditation Center in Redwood City

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,880
California and uh in the United States on this planet

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,560
Earth which we all share and uh

4
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,039
of all the places we could be in this earth we're all sharing the surface of it

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,420
and connected through the surface connected now through

6
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:40,879
electrical grid of wires and

7
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:48,500
signals nice to be together

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,899
so um

9
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:09,420
one of the common presentations of mindfulness

10
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,180
is that it is a some form of

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:21,540
non-judgmental non-reactive non-interfering attention

12
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,640
that somehow we allow things to appear in awareness

13
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,720
so that they are clearly known but we don't try to fix it or push it

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:40,860
away or hold on to it we don't need to get involved conceptually with uh

15
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,380
judging its worth or our worth because we have this thought this feeling this

16
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:51,479
thing is happening to us and um

17
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:58,259
and so one of uh one of the ways this is taught sometimes and uh in the Insight

18
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,720
meditations tradition is um

19
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,660
to make the distinction between listening and hearing

20
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:16,860
we're listening is something we intentionally do actively

21
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,700
do like you know someone says listen to the sound from outside and then you

22
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:29,160
direct your attention a particular way to listen to those sounds and you know and uh

23
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,319
maybe in some cartoonish way we're kind of like if we're going to listen to

24
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:39,900
something on our left kind of like the left ear kind of it gets bigger or stretches or something

25
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:47,220
um in order to hear in order to listen and distinct from that is hearing

26
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,620
and we can hear even if we're not actively listening

27
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:58,340
and so sometimes teachers will give instructions on um hearing

28
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:04,560
sound meditation where the focusing is on relaxing and

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:11,459
letting things be and just letting things be heard um and so there's a selectivity process

30
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:17,700
to the to the ear but it's hard to interfere

31
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:24,540
with what we hear unless we go over and do something about it but just allow it to arrive and

32
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,060
appear and be surprised or what comes to the ear whatever sound

33
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:37,860
comes and some of it we clearly are not Manufacturing and some people find that by doing just

34
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:43,440
listening to the Ambient sound that it keeps them in the present moment

35
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:51,900
in a very nice way and it allows them to relax deeply because they're letting go of the any

36
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:57,959
effort to try to make something happen within them in the same way

37
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:05,459
that we have the distinction between seeing and looking and looking is the active

38
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:11,400
and seeing is the I see that's what they do and it doesn't have to be an

39
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:17,579
intention or a direct directive to to see you cannot say ask someone notice

40
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:26,280
what you're seeing and um as opposed to look at you know the sunset

41
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:32,820
and so in the teachings of the Buddha the both kind of these are used these

42
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:39,180
ideas but the primary one is seeing that we're practicing we're developing

43
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:46,979
ourselves capacity to see with the Mind's Eye and sometimes that's called the Dharma

44
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:54,660
eye but we are learning to see with the inner eye or inner perception you know

45
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,840
doesn't have to be choosing the organ of seeing as the inner ear or

46
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:09,000
the inner perception inner knowing that is non-interfering non-judgmental

47
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:17,660
um you know non-entained unentangled with what's going on

48
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:22,740
and and this ability to rest back

49
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:30,840
in just a seeing let there be just a seeing it requires a stability of mind

50
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:38,039
because if the mind is jumping around a lot to distraction destructive thoughts there isn't a continuity of seeing

51
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:44,220
and the Buddha teaches the continuity of seating over time just settling back and

52
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:51,440
and observing and seeing what's there and and this is a very important

53
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,580
capacity for attention taught by the Buddha so

54
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:05,520
assuming a stance for meditation

55
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,340
a position where you are going to be rooted and established

56
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,479
Here and Now

57
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:32,360
and gently close your eyes

58
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:39,800
and if there are some sounds around you

59
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:47,759
allow them to come peacefully quietly to your ears

60
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,100
or receive them peacefully and quietly

61
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,979
maybe as if you were listening to a symphony or

62
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:06,198
some peaceful music letting it wash over you

63
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,740
not straining to hear

64
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,479
just hearing

65
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:34,500
relaxing any tension between the ears or in the mind or anywhere

66
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:42,060
in the attempt to hear and let it almost be a surprise

67
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:45,020
what comes

68
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,380
the sound of my voice

69
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:20,120
as you're hearing

70
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:27,840
maybe a little piece of your attention goes to the breathing

71
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:34,219
just enough that you're aware of the exhale

72
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:41,300
and you relax the body as you exhale

73
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:32,779
and then letting go of hearing and instead

74
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:41,480
Let There Be sensing of the body breathing

75
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:49,700
a sensing that's has equality is more like

76
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:57,800
hearing rather than looking more receptive awareness

77
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,660
than an effortful awareness

78
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:30,180
allowing whatever Sensations there are associated with breathing

79
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,980
to Simply appear on their own

80
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,920
into awareness

81
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:58,019
maybe on different breaths

82
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:06,360
somewhat different Sensations show themselves

83
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,920
different locations

84
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,579
different intensities

85
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:57,500
almost as if your body is a canvas

86
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:05,760
and the sensations that appear are like The Strokes of pain that wash

87
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,860
across the canvas

88
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:17,540
and they were quite sure what will come but the canvas receives it

89
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:55,320
as you're feeling the sensations are breathing a little bit on gently on the edges of

90
00:14:55,320 --> 00:15:01,620
awareness let there be a relaxing in the body on

91
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,279
the exhale

92
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:19,860
mostly sensing them paint brushes of Sensations across the

93
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:27,380
canvas sensations of breathing

94
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:39,240
but peripherally gently as you exhale relax the mind

95
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,560
the thinking mind

96
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:55,339
and as you quiet the Mind relax the mind

97
00:16:55,860 --> 00:17:03,600
maybe it can be like the canvas expands in all directions

98
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,740
becomes larger

99
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:50,640
and then imagine that you're sitting quietly comfortably

100
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,919
in an ease each year gazing

101
00:18:55,919 --> 00:19:03,140
watching the painting of the canvas

102
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:18,600
how it all occurs Sensations and sensing knowing

103
00:19:19,980 --> 00:19:25,880
it will occur is this something that you can sit back and just watch

104
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:34,580
seeing without actively looking

105
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:39,320
at ease content

106
00:19:44,539 --> 00:19:49,220
relaxed gaze of the inner eye

107
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:57,140
that doesn't need to fix or change or judge what's happening

108
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:08,720
but gaze is kindly upon it from the easy chair of awareness

109
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,700
foreign

110
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:33,299
foreign

111
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:58,860
and settling back further not even

112
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:04,980
not that only looking at the breathing watching it

113
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:10,440
settle back without any particular direction of attention

114
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:17,580
hope into everything but with the mind's eyes you're seeing

115
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:24,679
what appears not as paint on a canvas

116
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:33,559
but as Birds butterflies clouds appearing in the sky

117
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:41,360
settle back and observe watch

118
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:50,240
the comings and goings of anything and everything

119
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:12,380
and as we come to the end of the sitting

120
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:18,360
to gaze upon everything kindly

121
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:28,440
to gaze upon this world of ours kindly caringly

122
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:38,760
foreign to gaze upon ourselves

123
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,778
kindly caringly

124
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:05,580
maybe as if seeing gazing kindly is at the center of

125
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,740
all things and the seeing radiates out and sees

126
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:19,140
through yourself sees all of yourself every good bad the ugly it's all just

127
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:26,159
seen kindly as it travels through you and then out into the world gazing

128
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:33,900
kindly caringly and the good the bad the ugly

129
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:37,520
just kindly

130
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:42,360
caringly

131
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:59,600
and when we gaze this way with kindness and care

132
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:09,799
we don't have to be loving we don't have to be liking what we Gaze on the people we see

133
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:17,299
but it is a wondrous human ability

134
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:23,360
that we can gaze kindly with care

135
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:30,200
and may it be that our kindness our care

136
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:37,159
becomes the most natural thing to carry with us through the world

137
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:43,320
so that we gaze upon the world with good will

138
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:49,740
with caring instincts

139
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:57,179
may we care for everyone may all beings

140
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:04,580
be happy may all beings be safe

141
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:10,620
may all beings be peaceful

142
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:15,140
may all beings be free

143
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:24,620
and may we walk through the world with kind eyes caring eyes

144
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,700
so we can contribute to the welfare and happiness of all

145
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:51,190
[Music]

146
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:58,278
thank you

147
00:31:06,179 --> 00:31:13,620
so we come to the fourth talk on the series labeled consciousness

148
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:20,640
and the premise here is that what we call consciousness

149
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:25,799
um or what I'm calling Consciousness we

150
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:32,600
don't actually know what it is for sure but what I call Consciousness is the

151
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,860
synchronized working together of all the different

152
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:46,260
active capacities faculties we have for attention for perception

153
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:52,100
and they can come together also with our attitudes and our motivations and

154
00:31:52,100 --> 00:32:00,059
many of the cognitive functions of the mind as well and it all comes together to create and

155
00:32:00,059 --> 00:32:06,539
the mind creates an image or a sense of the whole um that is greater than the parts a

156
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:14,340
whole which is partly a a painting that the Mind paints of what this thing

157
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:20,820
is that the whole the unified hole the thing that Consciousness can seem

158
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:26,240
and there's a wonderful coincidence that in Pali that

159
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:32,520
the word for mind and work which might easily be

160
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:40,440
translated as Consciousness at times um is uh is um a homonym same

161
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:48,179
pronunciation as the word for a painting and uh so you know the mind maybe

162
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:55,140
Consciousness is uh this kind of construct this that the painting The Mind makes of itself

163
00:32:55,140 --> 00:33:00,659
that um that is somehow brings together all the different parts

164
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:08,399
into an image or a sense of something and um and so these different uh

165
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:14,820
capacities we have for perception for attention are key to this component

166
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:21,840
parts to this painting that's created the sense that's created and um and one of them today is um

167
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:29,399
they're talking about is the ability to see um to see clearly what's happening

168
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:37,320
and the Buddha uses this language of seeing uh as a metaphor so that for the

169
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:42,960
inner way of perceiving the inner way of kind of sensing knowing

170
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,980
that is somehow uh in the mind rather than in

171
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:57,419
the sensations so that's the kind of knowing quality of the mind that knows I'm sensing

172
00:33:57,419 --> 00:34:02,600
um warmth cold coolness the sound a taste the smell

173
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:09,720
the tactile sensation body and um but it's not so much that cognitive in the

174
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:18,118
sense of recognizing what it is it's not the recognition factor of the Mind but it's more like just the the uh the

175
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:25,020
level of the mind that can just kind of do the equivalent of of of hearing or

176
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:30,440
seeing in that hearing and seeing are different than

177
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:36,118
listening and looking in that hearing and seeing are receptive

178
00:34:36,119 --> 00:34:41,700
are not directive necessarily they're not active engaging of those scent

179
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:46,740
stores but those sense doors are on

180
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:54,240
and Sensations sounds or site objects arrive and come and they are seen they

181
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:59,900
are heard but they're not looked at they're not

182
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:07,619
listened to in an active way and um and in both of these uh

183
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:14,460
metaphors of the hearing and and seeing uh I think Builds on the idea

184
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:21,900
that uh what is seen and what is heard is actually usually uh at some distance

185
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:27,180
from the ears and the eyes I mean it could be distance could be you know just

186
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:33,900
a few centimeters away but still there's a there's a there's a gap there's a distance the medium through which the

187
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:39,740
information is going through the ear and this air the space

188
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:45,180
creates a little bit the difference from that's different than feeling Sensations

189
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:51,660
in the body physical Sensations uh you know like we feel pain or pleasure

190
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:57,300
that there's an intimacy there to uh to ourselves in a certain kind of way

191
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:04,680
and um but uh and so that intimacy sometimes because of you know being pain or pleasure it becomes something that we

192
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:11,160
are you know prone to get actively involved in or concerned with or identify even with

193
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:18,720
but the things we see in the distance see a tree we don't usually identify it as being you know me who I am the tree

194
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:25,619
it's all about me the tree and if we hear traffic Outdoors uh it

195
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:32,820
you know we're not again defining ourselves by the traffic we might find it uncomfortable and have a reaction to

196
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:41,700
it but the um but the uh but the hearing itself does not react the that's deeper in the

197
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:47,220
minds that it begins reacting and and um

198
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:52,500
and uh making meaning and values and preferences in there

199
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:59,220
but before these other layers of the Mind get involved that have to do with judgments and evaluation and reactivity

200
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:05,280
and preferences and emotions there is initially this very simple and

201
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,680
I would suggest relatively innocent Act of just hearing the sounds seeing the

202
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,900
sights and um and so that this is translated now for

203
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:21,780
the Buddha or adapted to the Buddha to talk about the inner eye and an inner

204
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:29,880
way of seeing and here also the idea is to do it in this receptive non-active way

205
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,880
um and so the Buddha never tells us in his instructions to do seeing with the

206
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:43,140
Mind's Eye the inner seeing um do the perceiving but rather to abide

207
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:49,619
in it and this he uses this word abiding a lot when he's talking about deeper

208
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:54,660
meditation that it when when we get settled in practice and meditation are able to kind

209
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,820
of course in the present moment then it's more like settling back and abiding

210
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:05,460
dwelling in something in a state and a way of being and a way of perceiving

211
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:13,740
then it is actively trying to do something and make something happen and it's a remarkable shift when that

212
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:20,280
can happen some people find that they can tap into that early in their practice some people it takes a long

213
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,320
time some people can do it early and then they can't do it for a while because they're going through layers of

214
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:32,280
leading to do some real inner work to sort through and settle down so they can

215
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:39,420
settle back for the Buddha it's it's the latter we do all the work of practice

216
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:46,579
and a purification practice a cultivation practice a settling practices

217
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:52,740
understanding practices and then with with enough practice and some point we

218
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:57,780
can just settle back and observe what's happening

219
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:05,339
and and this is a and then an abide in the observing abide in this inner seeing

220
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:11,940
um and um uh where things are everything's allowed to be itself it's very respectful of everything it can

221
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:18,720
almost be reverential that everything's allowed to be kind of its own pristine thing every sensation

222
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:24,119
every sound every sight every everything that's known uh

223
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:29,940
um in this seeing can be seen with the reverence or with care or with

224
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:37,338
um with um Simplicity radical Simplicity just allowing it to be itself

225
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:44,220
that becomes the foundation for for the kind of insights that Buddha emphasizes

226
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:51,000
the most the insights that are part of the inside meditation uh path uh are

227
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:56,040
insights that don't come from actively looking for them but rather when we

228
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:02,579
settle back and can observe and see in this kind of way that I'm talking about today

229
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:10,640
now as we see this way uh the seeing is somehow

230
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:16,859
free of what is seen in the sense that in the seeing

231
00:40:16,859 --> 00:40:22,500
we're not entangled we're not caught up we're not reacting and so what's being

232
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:28,560
seen is clearly left alone just like seeing with the uh with the physical eye

233
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:32,880
or hearing with a physical ear

234
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:39,900
we're not actively involved with you know looking you know the tree and

235
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:46,680
interfering with the tree as we're gazing upon it we're not interfering with the sound of the car outside it

236
00:40:46,680 --> 00:40:53,460
just does its thing independent of us and um and so

237
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:59,460
um all things are allowed to be this way and be seen in such a way that then

238
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:06,000
insights begin arising and um and that's maybe for another time but

239
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,660
um but the sense of what I want to emphasize today is this way in which the seeing

240
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:18,240
there's a freedom in the seeing and independence from the freed and the freeing there's kind of a spaciousness

241
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,339
and allowance of things as they are in this kind of interceeing that goes on

242
00:41:23,339 --> 00:41:29,400
and um and so in that seeing as one of our intentional

243
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:36,359
faculties when seeing has this quality of freedom in it it can give

244
00:41:36,359 --> 00:41:41,780
um uh when when we construct this idea of Consciousness Consciousness then

245
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:49,020
begins feeling like something that's a place of Freedom a place of um of

246
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:55,260
um allowance space of openness a space of

247
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,540
receptivity and but in particular there could be a

248
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:06,060
feeling that in Consciousness itself is something we can place we can rest in

249
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:11,760
the kind of Freedom the Consciousness almost can feel a very broad the spatial

250
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:19,020
of the uh the way that the body the my inner mind or the constructs a spatial

251
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:26,520
sense of uh awareness where it constructs spatial space spatial ideas of location and when that spatial

252
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:32,700
location gets relaxed and soft that also starts having a broad almost boundless

253
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:38,700
quality to it and so the construction of Consciousness can now starts feeling not

254
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:45,780
only is it free and and um and peaceful and Broad but it also feel and Untouched

255
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:52,920
by the things of the world but also it can feel like it's boundless and open and expensive

256
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:59,280
is consciousness actually boundless is it actually you know

257
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:05,940
anything at all um more than you know it's hard to say and there's strong

258
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:12,420
opinions about this but the view that I'm presenting here that it's yes it's

259
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:18,900
boundless in the sense that the construction the image of it the sense of it that the mind creates has no

260
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:24,720
boundaries but it's a it's kind of a a

261
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:29,760
a wonderful composite image Gestalt

262
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:36,000
image or idea of all these wondrous faculties that we have that come back

263
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:43,920
come together and work in some kind of Harmony together to to give us a sense and then we try to

264
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:50,220
make sense of it we try to understand it we try to have an image of what it's operating and then the mind creates that

265
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:57,180
image of it all so and then we can abide in it we can

266
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:04,260
rest in it we can allow it and now it can be very freeing and very supportive to to have a sense of Consciousness like

267
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:11,280
this so um I hope that uh

268
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:17,040
this is useful for you and gives you something to reflect on and explore on

269
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:22,079
your own and I would encourage you for these next 24 hours

270
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:30,000
to um use hearing and seeing the physical ones and also the Mind's Eye his ability

271
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:38,040
to see and hear and perceive to experiment uh with gazing upon things

272
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:46,079
or he uh hearing things in a very receptive open allowing way

273
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:54,300
to feel the refreshment that can come how the eyes and the ears get refreshed

274
00:44:54,300 --> 00:45:02,460
and cooled and calmed and peaceful when they're able to just see rather

275
00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:08,579
than look rather than searching rather than straining or staring

276
00:45:08,579 --> 00:45:15,720
and the same thing can happen to hearing uh when we hear rather than strain to

277
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:25,740
listen or or something so uh thank you all very much and

278
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:31,460
and I am looking forward to coming back uh tomorrow morning
