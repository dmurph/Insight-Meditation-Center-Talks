1
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:10,000
so good morning and good day as we continue with the mindfulness of

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,599
the body exercises and um

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,800
the exercise we're doing now is usually called the four elements

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,960
and i prefer the four properties but what's nice about calling it the

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:34,160
elements is the way that it connects us to

6
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:42,320
the natural world and so the elements or properties associated with

7
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:49,360
the earth with water with fire and with air

8
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:56,399
and um and uh these are all properties that are

9
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,800
essential for life and we take them in and and

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:09,760
they animate us we animate them and the uh but by one of the nice things

11
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:15,600
about seeing it this connection with the earth with the natural world around us

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,400
is for some people it begins to be an antidote to excessive self-preoccupation

13
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,320
excessive living in our head with ideas of me myself and mine

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:36,079
antidote to conceit and antidote to kind of the constructive aspect of the mind that constructs

15
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,520
somewhat an edifice or um

16
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:48,399
palaces of ideas and concepts and selves and histories and all these things that are

17
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:55,759
second nature for many people and there's certainly a place for that in life an important part of life

18
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,079
to see the whole but here in order to free ourselves from some of the deleterious effects of this

19
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,160
constructive activity of the mind we begin to deconstruct it

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,680
and deconstruct the concepts and take us back to the elemental level

21
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,760
to the building blocks of our experience to the core

22
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:27,440
sensations core sense data that we take in through our body with which we construct

23
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,440
much of the world that we live in and so uh learning to

24
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:40,480
tune in and get concentrated on the these properties these sensations in the body

25
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:46,080
can do a phenomenal job in teaching us how not to get caught in the constructs

26
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:52,400
and the ideas it's a way of freeing ourselves from them temporarily to have a radically different experience

27
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,760
of ourselves that gives a different reference point for living a free life

28
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,959
so these are sensations that we have the elements these

29
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,519
properties are known experienced through feeling the different sensations in our body

30
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:17,200
and and and to experience it just as sensations

31
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,480
independent on the ideas that are then built on those sensations

32
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,840
so we'll start with a simple exercise that i i kind of like to do i hope that you're

33
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,120
content to do it with me again and we'll build on that

34
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:39,360
so just gently closing your eyes

35
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,599
and maybe a few moments of settling in whatever way you

36
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,920
have

37
00:03:54,239 --> 00:04:00,879
maybe a few moments of breathing deeply and

38
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,519
relaxing

39
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:15,200
and when you settle in and relax into your body you're relaxing into something which is

40
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:19,600
quite natural part of the natural world

41
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:26,240
as natural and perhaps as wondrous as a tree

42
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,400
as a bird flying through the sky

43
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,720
there's a gopher in the ground or squirrel scampering up a tree

44
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:52,000
a butterfly flying in the air a hummingbird

45
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,840
a river an ocean

46
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,600
all the wondrous parts of nature we're equally part of it is all those

47
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,800
things our body is

48
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,120
so then to begin now with sitting quietly

49
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,720
and begin sensing and feeling

50
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,720
the sensations of one of your hands

51
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:48,160
and perhaps you can feel pulsing and tingling

52
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:57,199
maybe something that feels comparable to the flow of blood through your fingers

53
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,639
feeling the contact of the hand against some surface

54
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,478
your legs the other hand

55
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:27,039
perhaps there's sensations of some weight heaviness or lightness

56
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,479
warmth coolness maybe both on different sides of the

57
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,800
hand

58
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:47,479
certain sensations in the palm of the hand

59
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,039
sensations on the back of the hand

60
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:59,160
sensations of the fingers

61
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,800
and if you become attuned to the sensations themselves

62
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,800
as natural phenomena you might even be able to feel them the

63
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:21,758
sensations of them independent of any idea of and

64
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:31,800
the way the sensations feel themselves

65
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:40,000
sensing whatever is sensitive enough to sense sensations

66
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:49,879
are not really two separate things sensing and sensation occur together

67
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:04,560
and we're in the location where sensing and sensations occur together

68
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:11,280
they occur before the mind has ideas

69
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,800
before the mind identifies it certainly with something as complicated

70
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:23,039
as hand or my hand

71
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:32,479
or judgments this is a good hand or a bad hand or anything

72
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:39,399
the sensations and sensing occur together

73
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:51,279
almost as if for themselves there is no hand there's just themselves the sensing

74
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:56,800
the sensations come and go

75
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,000
arise and pass

76
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,839
the energetics of them

77
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,959
originally derived from the energy of the sun

78
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:25,920
the solidity weight hardness softness

79
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,040
are considered properties of the earth

80
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:45,320
warmth and coolness are properties of fire

81
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:07,839
seeing if you can notice how different it is to experience sensations of your hand

82
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,200
without ideas of me myself and mine

83
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:24,079
how if you go into my hand or it should be this way or something it pulls you away

84
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:31,200
into the control tower but if you

85
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,560
relax into the hand into the sensations and let them just be

86
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,040
there by themselves

87
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,680
and now turning your attention to the area in your body

88
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,440
where you normally experience your breathing

89
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,200
and not so much specifically focusing on the ex experience of breathing

90
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,560
but in that area of your body

91
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:22,760
have the same sensitivity to sensations as you had in the hand

92
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:57,680
if there's movement that's associated with the air element

93
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,800
the wind element

94
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,760
if there's temperature it's associated with

95
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:18,440
the fire element fire property

96
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,120
if as your chest or belly expand if you feel that the expansion

97
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,920
the pressure the contraction

98
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,759
is considered part of the water element

99
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:54,320
a water holds things together

100
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,120
creates pressure

101
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,600
sensations of hardness and softness

102
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,480
weight are the earth element the earth property

103
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,560
and the exercise is one of becoming

104
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:40,240
attuned to the fundamental

105
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:47,680
sensation level of experience which is the building block more

106
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:55,399
complicated worlds we live in but it begins with sensations

107
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:10,320
the sensing and the sensations occur together

108
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,839
and in the location where they occur

109
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:25,760
in and of itself those sensations have no concepts no ideas

110
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:29,000
no preferences

111
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:40,399
let go of ideas and thoughts and preferences

112
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:46,959
so you can rest awareness in the sensations themselves in that

113
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:55,519
area of the body content to be with a dancing

114
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:01,040
flow of sensations coming and going

115
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:07,279
getting closer to them the closer we get the more they become a

116
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:14,079
dance of sensations

117
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:19,160
all in the area of your body where you're breathing

118
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,739
[Music]

119
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:25,360
notice the way thinking pulls you out and away from

120
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:32,480
this natural phenomena of the body the processes of sensations coming and

121
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:39,520
going perhaps you can dip back in like dipping

122
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,760
into a pool of water settle back in

123
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:51,440
to these properties and elements of sensations

124
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:57,840
for a few minutes willingly surrendering

125
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:03,200
to just sensations of breathing in the body

126
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,039
gently noticing

127
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:18,280
the different sensations that come and go

128
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:42,919
choosing to stay with the sensations not the thinking

129
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:31,840
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

130
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:42,000
to appreciate how much of our

131
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:47,679
body is part of the natural world

132
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:54,200
majority of our body is water

133
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:07,440
essential for our body is the air that we breathe in

134
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:13,840
and out

135
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:24,480
we are in a sense continuing the energies of the sun and

136
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,760
our digestion and our temperatures of our body and

137
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:47,120
and we have within us atoms and molecules

138
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:52,240
that have circulated around the world in many ways some of them have

139
00:29:52,240 --> 00:30:00,799
been in other forms of life before you some of them come out of the ground

140
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,960
absorbed by plants that we eat

141
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:16,158
just about every part of our physical body

142
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:26,000
is a continuation of the earth and the natural life of the earth

143
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:35,520
our body and all its elements belong

144
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,440
as part of this earth you belong

145
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:48,039
here on this planet in this world

146
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:56,960
and to believe you don't is to have lost touch with this

147
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:04,039
elemental level of our life and its connection to the planet

148
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:11,518
and as we come to the end of the sitting

149
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:18,159
perhaps you can appreciate that others belong here too

150
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:26,000
they also are the fruit of the earth

151
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:34,480
of this universe and to offer them

152
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:43,158
the right to be here to offer them to see them through the eyes

153
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,398
appreciates them too as an important part of this natural world

154
00:31:54,720 --> 00:32:00,440
to support others to feel like they belong on this planet

155
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:10,080
maybe get gaze upon others with respect and care and love

156
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:18,679
maybe even irreverence that's freed from our self-centered

157
00:32:18,679 --> 00:32:22,240
self-preoccupied ideas

158
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:29,760
may all beings be happy

159
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:38,399
may all beings be safe may all beings be peaceful

160
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:43,640
and may all beings be free

161
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:47,549
[Music]

162
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:54,440
[Music]

163
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,919
so hello everyone and i want to say that yesterday we had uh

164
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:17,360
some kind of technology

165
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:24,398
breakdown here and we don't know what it is yet but uh we have

166
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:29,919
hopefully bypassed the area of the problem as we try to figure out what happened

167
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:36,360
and so um

168
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:47,840
so maybe that today can function then also as a another introduction to this topic of

169
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,840
the what's classically called the four elements the four datu's in poly

170
00:33:53,840 --> 00:34:00,640
d-a-d-h-a-t-u and um

171
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:07,279
it's uh the way that we can or the aspects of our felt experience

172
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:14,079
the way we experience things that can be seen as to be associated with uh elements

173
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,118
of the physical world that's around us and that of course i think it can have

174
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:26,240
very profound meanings associations and that sense of connection to that

175
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:33,599
the i prefer to translate this word dotu as properties

176
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:39,118
because elements implies to me like some kind of molecule some kind of

177
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,118
something you know very essential elemental whereas it doesn't have to mean that in

178
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,520
english of course the word element but so i kind of prefer property and because

179
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,520
property points to a property of something

180
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:03,040
so now this is the property of our body of our sensations that we're experiencing

181
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,079
and so there are four

182
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:14,079
and they're kind of they're always listed in particular order

183
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,520
earth water fire and air and the reason for that order is that um

184
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,440
there's a way in which the ancient indian cosmology or geography

185
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,599
believed that the earth um uh

186
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:38,640
is um you know that's the bottom and then there's the water floating on the earth and then uh above that there's the heat

187
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,720
and the and uh the fires that grow up come up into the air and then there's the air so

188
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:50,720
it's kind of like a progression and um

189
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,960
the um and to do this meditation on the four elements of four properties

190
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:04,400
is to take a very different lens a different perspective for a direct experience than

191
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:11,359
what many of us will normally live in which we live in ideas and concepts and ideas of things

192
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:16,800
so for example i have this big bell here and um and i could just kind of be

193
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,920
thinking about it as a bell and this is what a great bell remember who gave it to us it was a gift

194
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,320
and how wonderful that was to receive this gift and how we've used it for so many years and and different places we've used it and

195
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:35,760
ways we've used it and and i can be kind of in that world in the mind of memory thoughts ideas bell

196
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:41,119
and or i could change the lens of my experience

197
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:47,680
to not be in the ideas the history the memory and and what this proves about imc that it's

198
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:54,400
a really worthy meditation center because that is a good bell i can just kind of feel the weight of it

199
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:02,000
i can feel the smoothness of it the temperature of it feels cool to touch right now with my warm hands

200
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:07,760
i can feel some smoothness in it and also there's little indentations on the sides that i can feel it's kind of fun

201
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:12,880
to have my hands kind of rub across indentations and they come and go and

202
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,160
and and so i can get into the sensations

203
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,760
independent of it being a bowl a bell

204
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,200
and um and the bellness of it doesn't need to be relevant i can close my eyes and just

205
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:36,720
be with the sensations and it doesn't have to be a bell it could be something very different

206
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:42,240
so the you know so different lenses different perspective so we can have

207
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:47,760
and uh think of it maybe as a different magnifications that we do

208
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:54,560
and a particular um idea that uh exercise i like is that of

209
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,079
what has to do with i remember my sons had had a little kids book that a couple of

210
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:05,839
them i think that had involved you turn the pages and it's a kind of

211
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:11,520
picture of the same location kind of but at different

212
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:18,480
magnitudes of uh of focus i think they they went by magnitude of 10 i think and sometimes

213
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:24,240
you started the universe and went closer and closer in and in and you saw the earth and then a little town and then

214
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:31,119
the lawn and then the grass and then the cells and then you saw the

215
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:36,160
the atoms and and you kind of just depending on what magnification you use

216
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,680
you see different things and you can imagine for example for you if uh

217
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:48,640
if there was a satellite video that you would watch and it zoomed in on the neighborhood you

218
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:55,040
grew up in and that would be kind of fascinating to see oh they've changed that the house is no longer there they've redone it there

219
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:00,640
or that house hasn't changed at all there's a tree i used to climb in there's the house of my neighbor who was

220
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:06,480
so unjust because i know i broke his window and my threw my baseball through it but

221
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:13,680
he never returned it and and you know how could my favorite baseball and

222
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:19,680
and then though there's a neighbor that used to give us cookies and we always felt so safe playing in the tree in

223
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:26,000
front of that person's yard and i've come so far in my life since then or i haven't come anywhere in my

224
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:31,520
life since then all my problems derived from that time and so all this ideas come into play so

225
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,720
for the certain magnification but if we kind of drop in into just a tree we used to play in

226
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:45,040
and the whole different set of thoughts come up but then if we go closer into just a leaf

227
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:52,960
and beyond the leaf to the cells and beyond the cells to the atoms beyond the atoms into the subatomic particles

228
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:59,920
and suddenly there's all this space and vastness between all the particles and it's like amazing it's kind of like

229
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:06,079
looking into the great night sky and the amazing size of the universe

230
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:12,319
depending on the magnification we have a different relationship than what's going on

231
00:40:12,319 --> 00:40:18,400
if we're always at that at the magnification level where it's all about me myself and mine

232
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:23,440
and my ideas my history what's done to me what wasn't done to me what i should do

233
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:30,880
it can be tiring exhausting it tends to be the place where there's a lot of attachment a lot of stress

234
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:39,359
and it can be a labyrinth and it could also be a buddhist terms a cycle of stress where

235
00:40:39,359 --> 00:40:44,640
the very attempts to resolve it and get out of it those that level of practice

236
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:50,160
the level of life magnification just kind of spins the wheel more and more and we just kind of do more and more

237
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:55,520
it's like rearranging the deck tears in the titanic it's just like you know

238
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,160
we're always trying to make things better and to solve things but as long as it's based on

239
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,200
ideas of me myself and mine there probably is no real solution to a

240
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,480
final happiness but one way to find that the real change

241
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:18,560
is to change the magnification level to change the lens in which we see our experience

242
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,240
and that's not an easy thing to do because the attachments keep us in that

243
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:30,480
certain magnification level the level of these thoughts and histories and ideas

244
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:37,920
and so we're training ourselves to begin letting go of that place not to dismiss it or abandon it

245
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,880
so that we're not so attached to it and so we can see it in a fresh way we can learn to be free

246
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,960
and also to connect to ourselves at a different magnification level that reveals a different level of

247
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,960
experience different kind of processes that if we connect to them

248
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,800
are much more freeing much more liberating much more helpful for

249
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:07,920
experiencing something vast and free and liberating like really getting down into

250
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:13,599
the particle level of the atoms and and just wow this is all amazing

251
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:20,800
and so these this four element meditation is this shift of magnification the shift of uh to a

252
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,160
different lens of experience and it's very important to understand it's not a dismissal of other

253
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:31,280
magnification levels but for many of us it's an expansion of the lenses we can

254
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,280
use so we're not always in one lens one magnification level but where we can

255
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:43,760
have the ability to go between different ones and when it's helpful to go into this

256
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:51,520
element level there's a lot of wisdom to be discovered here and also a fair amount of healing

257
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:58,319
because some of the stresses that we apply to our system limit the healing qualities of the body

258
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:04,000
and mind but once we drop into this elemental level of these properties that of the

259
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:10,319
sensations there's a freeing of this stress and this this whole physical and also

260
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:17,599
mental system can operate much more harmoniously and it's remarkable what can start happening then

261
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:24,400
so to shift our attention um to um

262
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,480
to the the sensation level it's really a sensation meditation

263
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:36,480
um sensory awareness that we do and the pasta practices has thought uh was

264
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:43,599
taught to many of us the kind of mahasi practice from this teacher mahasi sayado

265
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:48,960
the instructions were to experience the movements of the belly as we were breathing

266
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,920
and and so it kind of people thought it was a breath folk breath meditation but in fact the emphasis was not on the

267
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:02,960
breathing the emphasis was on the sensations that came into play as the body breathed

268
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:08,000
and and to feel the you know all these sensations that come

269
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,359
into play and get closer and closer more intimate like really get into the magnification that just

270
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:19,520
we we are just there with the sensations and we're not there with the ideas and

271
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:25,119
concepts and stories around them and it can be quite relaxing and easeful to

272
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:32,319
drop all the stories and just be with the sensations as they come and go and that is kind of the core

273
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:37,680
uh really core aspect of the pasta practice so this four elements meditation

274
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,880
is really indire is really central to this tradition

275
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:48,160
even though we don't know not always so explicit about it

276
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:54,720
so that's what we'll do for a few days explore these four elements and these sensations and how to work with them

277
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,119
and um and hopefully you can appreciate this uh this particular lens or magnification

278
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:07,839
level of our experience and we'll find some fascination delight and maybe even some

279
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:15,760
freedom in in it so thank you very much and um

280
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:21,119
so i'll see you monday

281
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:26,640
i'll be here monday and i won't see you but i'll be with you and

282
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:33,119
a reminder that tomorrow morning imc and zoom

283
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:40,480
is hosting a mindfulness circle for black identified practitioners so if you're black and

284
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:47,119
and or know someone who's a black practitioner who would like to meet with other black practitioners

285
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:53,440
it's a wonderful the third time we're doing it and it's a wonderful gathering of practitioners so if it's relevant for

286
00:45:53,440 --> 00:46:04,280
you and you're very welcome to attend and the information is on the what's new on imc's website so thank you
