1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,380
so good morning I had to turn off the speakers at the

2
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:16,139
the speaker system had been left completely on so then I hear the booming speakers that

3
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,300
are above me in the wall and it's nicer just to be here with all of you

4
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:28,939
without that extra voice coming in so um

5
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:37,040
to begin

6
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,620
when we sit down to meditate we can ask ourselves

7
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,860
are we ready to be in the present moment

8
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:10,280
are we ready to be receptive and present and engaged nicely in the present moment

9
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:16,380
in a way it might be interesting or evocative to say that

10
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,200
the present moment is always ready for you are you ready for it

11
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:28,200
is the Mind ready and this mind that we have can be busy and

12
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:35,899
caught up in thoughts and ideas and feelings and agendas preferences many things

13
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:43,320
that might interfere with the capacity to be ready

14
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:51,240
to be available and ready available

15
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:56,520
for this moment to receive receptive

16
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:05,479
and sometimes it takes part of the meditation

17
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:12,780
a lot of the meditation period for the mind to finally be present enough where we can say it's available

18
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:21,180
to the present it's ready for the present it's ready to allow something to grow and develop

19
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:26,400
and one of those things is a greater Readiness a greater receptivity a

20
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:35,099
greater availability to really feel sense be here

21
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:40,680
in what can be called our experience

22
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:47,459
and that's a Choice expression because it means what we're experiencing not what we're

23
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:55,040
thinking so much what we're experiencing is always here in the present

24
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:01,560
we might have agendas about it and preferences but those interfere with our ability to

25
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,220
be ready available receptive here

26
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:15,120
so to begin this process of readying the mind

27
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:19,459
to assume a meditation posture

28
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:27,959
a posture itself that

29
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:35,099
if someone saw you could see that this posture is

30
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,200
available for the present is here attentive

31
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:48,659
is awake alert if you are sitting back a lot in a chair

32
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:55,440
take a few maybe just a two minutes or so to sit up and as straight as you would

33
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:02,519
if you suddenly heard a you know maybe a car come up to your

34
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:09,900
house that sounded like that car of an old very good friend like oh what's that I hear and you sit up to kind of like

35
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:15,120
pay attention what's this it's just maybe for a couple of minutes

36
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,060
to get a sense of in a certain kind of alertness

37
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:25,580
which is ready available for here

38
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,800
gently closing your eyes

39
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:44,400
being receptive to the experience of your body taking a few long slow deep

40
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,759
breaths

41
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:03,860
relaxing the body as you exhale long exhale

42
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:09,960
maybe slightly longer long enough to get your attention it's

43
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,039
time to breathe in

44
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:27,620
so the inhale is a little bit more conscious than automatic

45
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:46,639
letting your breathing return to normal

46
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:59,000
and what would it be like now sitting here quietly to establish a Readiness of Mind

47
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,199
Readiness of attention for whatever might happen during this

48
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,100
meditation that you're available

49
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:17,699
to be attentive kind of Readiness where nothing is a

50
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:24,720
surprise is just one more thing to with this too

51
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:28,639
is the experience of the moment

52
00:06:39,139 --> 00:06:47,240
Readiness which is not assertive but rather receptive available

53
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:58,639
may be ready available even for what would be unexpected

54
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:16,039
relaxing the body

55
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,180
where the more relaxed you are

56
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:38,000
the more receptive ready available

57
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:17,180
and then settling into the experience of breathing settled and ready

58
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:25,319
as if each breath is a new event each breath as if it's Unique and almost

59
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:31,199
like the first breath ready for it

60
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:37,700
available as the breath is

61
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:14,419
if this time now was the beginning of the meditation

62
00:18:15,419 --> 00:18:19,519
will your Readiness be different

63
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:27,360
your receptivity availability to the present moment

64
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,280
has it changed over these minutes

65
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:50,580
foreign

66
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:20,000
and as we come to the end of the sitting

67
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,179
is there something about how you are right now

68
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:34,919
that feels more ready available

69
00:26:34,919 --> 00:26:42,679
in a relaxed way in a receptive way

70
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,658
maybe it's in your body

71
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:58,519
maybe it's in your mind or your heart

72
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:04,340
symptom part of you is more settled

73
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:13,039
at ease so that it's open and available

74
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:18,080
for whatever Here and Now

75
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:29,760
and then coming to the end of the sitting to invite into your

76
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:34,279
mind your attention your thoughts

77
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:40,640
other people who you might encounter today

78
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:48,200
people you know strangers on the street stores

79
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:56,960
people that you might somehow encounter on your screen and media

80
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:08,539
and is there a way of being ready receptive

81
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:16,340
to others that helps you tap into

82
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:21,960
appreciate appreciation of others Good Will of others

83
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:29,760
for others a generosity of spirit

84
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,820
of attention for others

85
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:57,380
may all beings be happy may all beings be safe

86
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:03,539
may all beings be peaceful

87
00:29:03,539 --> 00:29:07,940
may all beings be free

88
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,050
[Music]

89
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,460
thank you

90
00:30:39,779 --> 00:30:47,360
so welcome to this beginning of the week is uh

91
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:54,620
weekdays week that is between these two holidays that we have

92
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:02,460
kind of a some ways a liminal or limbo or alternative kind of

93
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:09,559
week for many people and um

94
00:31:12,179 --> 00:31:18,539
we have a new theme so last week the topic was the four

95
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:23,700
right efforts where the emphasis is to let go or

96
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:29,100
the unwholesome and develop the wholesome and today this for this week I wanted to

97
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:35,100
talk about five wholesome States that can be cultivated and developed

98
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:40,320
that are appreciate could be appreciated in our lives

99
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:48,360
and it's not the common wholesome states that this early Buddhist tradition is maybe most associated with

100
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:54,179
um often the Buddha would begin had Dharma talked to lay people especially

101
00:31:54,179 --> 00:31:59,940
on topic of generosity and generosity is often a preeminent wholesome state in

102
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:06,480
our tradition he might also talk about uh states of

103
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:11,640
ethical integrity kind of a wholesome integrity

104
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:16,940
there might be meditative joy and happiness tranquility

105
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:24,179
the variety of things that are fairly well known in our tradition and but for this week I want to do

106
00:32:24,179 --> 00:32:32,120
something which is not so emphasized or hardly at all that um the Buddha put a particular

107
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,760
emphasis on an importance of as Holston states to be developed or cultivated or

108
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:45,419
to be evoked in preparation for real insight to really be able to

109
00:32:45,419 --> 00:32:52,320
see deeply into the nature of our hearts our minds Our Lives

110
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:59,539
and um and so uh these five wholesome States

111
00:32:59,539 --> 00:33:06,000
are to be are a Readiness of mind

112
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:11,760
a malleability of Mind a mind free of hindrances

113
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,399
a a

114
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:23,760
think they uh a I forget the fourth moment the fifth

115
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:33,080
is a bright mind or a confident mind so ready receptive free of hindrances

116
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:39,480
right at the moment maybe some of you remember the fourth but we'll get to it it somehow it slipped my mind

117
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:46,320
and um so these are five states that the Buddha would evoke in people in

118
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:51,779
preparation for giving the deepest Dharma he has the deepest teachings he had

119
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:58,260
and so he would give a Dharma talk to to prepare people for deep teachings and

120
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:07,280
prepare and these are the five ways in which he prepared their minds so the first is the word is kala

121
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:15,118
k-a-l-l-a and it's um it's usually translated as a ready mind

122
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:21,240
a Readiness of mind it's a mind that's receptive that is available

123
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:27,658
that's prepared in order to receive something really significant to be

124
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:34,200
and um and so one of the functions of meditation is in fact to cultivate

125
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:40,020
this Readiness of mind the Zen masters of Suzuki roshi the

126
00:34:40,020 --> 00:34:47,300
founder of San Francisco Zen Center and his books and my beginner's mind his definition of mindfulness

127
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:55,679
was is in fact Readiness of mind and to be ready and available to attend

128
00:34:55,679 --> 00:35:00,780
to whatever might be coming up next the next thing that arrives in the present moment

129
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:07,500
if we're distracted if we're already retro respective thinking like thinking

130
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:12,839
back at what just happened then we're not there for the next moment the next moment

131
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:19,079
and um and this art of being able to let go of what just happened enough not to

132
00:35:19,079 --> 00:35:27,119
think about it dwell in it to really be fresh and available ready for the next moment is a phenomenal gift when many

133
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,700
people feel like they're obligated to review and think about and criticize and

134
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:38,700
comment and be way down by what happened in the past even if it's just a few

135
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:45,359
moments before and this Readiness it's always available always open for the next thing the next

136
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:52,020
thing um is uh is um a mind which is prepared

137
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:57,300
a mind which is receptive is available to be changed

138
00:35:57,300 --> 00:36:03,420
and this is one of the aspects of Readiness of mind is to be ready and

139
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:09,000
available to be changed there's some idea that a real dialogue with other

140
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:17,640
people if you have a conversation that it's a dialogue a dialogue is only possible if each person is willing to be

141
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:22,740
changed if we're stubborn or resistant and kind of in a dialogue or in you know

142
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:29,880
some kind of serious conversation with someone and we're not willing to change there's not possible possibility of

143
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:35,280
dialogue of dialogue in this kind of definition is one where maybe each

144
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:41,460
person is changed by the conversation they learn something new they see something new they understand something

145
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,520
in a new way or so the same thing with meditation

146
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:52,920
are you available to be changed and now I don't think that's such an

147
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,320
easy thing to be because of the intensity in which many of us will be

148
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,359
involved in our concerns our beliefs our attitudes that we have

149
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:12,119
and and so we're holding on to it or resisting something or we're we're hunkered down or tight or Frozen in time

150
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:20,099
even sometimes and so part of meditation practice and

151
00:37:20,099 --> 00:37:27,060
in time of the Buddha part of a Dharma talk was to engage people in such a way

152
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:32,099
engage yourself in such a way that something softens and opens and relax

153
00:37:32,099 --> 00:37:39,240
and you kind of finally arrive here turning point in meditation practice is

154
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:45,119
arrival when you really feel I'm here I've arrived I'm in the present moment

155
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:50,960
of course you are you always are but the mind the attention the thoughts are not

156
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,260
and so in a sense uh the life energy is going someplace else and when your

157
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:02,300
Consciousness conscious alive attention

158
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:09,000
settles here on this moment then we've arrived

159
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:14,700
and that's the beginning of being available of being ready

160
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:20,880
uh kind of receptivity and um

161
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:28,820
the so part of understanding this

162
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:36,660
is to understand that it's important it's valuable appreciate the role in place of this

163
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:42,720
kind of Readiness here and understanding what gets in the way

164
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:50,040
of it and so each of us probably has the top Tunes the top

165
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:55,200
um maybe three concerns ways of being in the mind that

166
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,540
prevent us from being ready it might be that we have chronic anxiety

167
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:05,700
about what's happening and needing to plan and so the planning is to get ready

168
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:11,460
but it's not being ready for whatever's here that kind of willingness to almost

169
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:18,420
not know not assert not to project onto life because we're anxious or we

170
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:23,839
want and other top one which might be

171
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:31,020
wanting pleasure wanting good things wanting to light and wanting

172
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:38,940
is not a bad thing in and of itself but it can uh if it's two Intense or two and caught

173
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:45,060
up in it then we're not available we're not present for what's actually here

174
00:39:45,060 --> 00:39:50,099
the art of having desire is having Desire with such a light touch

175
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:55,500
that it doesn't blind us to hear and now

176
00:39:55,500 --> 00:40:01,800
and then there's also the top kind of what interferes with maybe Readiness is

177
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:07,680
some preoccupation about the past emotional preoccupation maybe resentment

178
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:14,780
maybe Delight or some kind of

179
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:21,480
reviewing and some kind of trying to figure out or

180
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:27,480
um so in many ways so those are possibilities but what are the what are the top three ways in which your mind

181
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:33,540
operates that interferes with your mind being ready

182
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:40,740
your mind being uh present in a way that doesn't overlay your

183
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:46,200
preoccupations your projections your your knowing your belief that you know

184
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:54,599
what's happening your belief that in your opinions about what's happening her Readiness is a willingness to put

185
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:02,940
those opinions aside as if so we can see and hear and know in it as if everything

186
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:08,940
is new and in a certain way they are

187
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:15,000
and if we don't see in this way that everything is new then

188
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,780
there's a way in which we limit the possibilities for our own transformation

189
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:27,119
the our own way of being changed which is part of the purpose of

190
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:34,859
cultivating this Readiness of mind because the ultimate purpose the Buddha gave for this was to give deep teachings

191
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:42,260
in order to awaken people in order to what he called opening the Dharma eye

192
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:47,599
so um the

193
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:56,099
so a wholesome state to be cultivated We Begin by appreciating it the value of

194
00:41:56,099 --> 00:42:02,099
it the value of having a readiness and

195
00:42:02,099 --> 00:42:10,020
availability and then to evoke it or recognize it in ourselves

196
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:16,680
and let it expand Let It Grow let it push against the edges of what

197
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:23,539
gets in the way of that so you really see the what interferes with it

198
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:28,980
and um and then

199
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:36,180
experiment with what it's like to live in this world ready available receptive

200
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:42,720
with a kind of not knowing mind meaning that you know the mind doesn't assert or insist that it knows

201
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:51,060
everything it's available so uh this is a wonderful wholesome

202
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:56,760
state of mind that supports wholesome life supports a wise life

203
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:01,920
supports a compassionate life supports the ongoing

204
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:08,819
development of this practice that we do and and it's one of five states that the

205
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:14,280
Buddha emphasized and we'll go through the next four and maybe all in in

206
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:19,680
preparation for the coming year maybe we're getting ready

207
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:25,920
for uh for 2023.

208
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:33,079
so thank you very much and I appreciate this chance to be with you all
