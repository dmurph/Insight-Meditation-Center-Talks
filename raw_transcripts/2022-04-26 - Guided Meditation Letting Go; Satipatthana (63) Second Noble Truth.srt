00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,279
hello everyone and

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,120
welcome welcome to our meditation

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:22,960
session together and the idea that we're doing it together so many of us from around the world

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:30,000
for me is quite meaningful it's always been meaningful for me to practice in community meditate and

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,920
community i've done a lot of it and i probably wouldn't have practiced as much as i

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:44,320
have if i hadn't had a community around me sharing the meditation i probably wouldn't have learned as much

7
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:51,600
and i've learned a tremendous amount sitting and together with other people in meditation

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,160
so we have this way here now with him through the medium of our

9
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:03,680
electric electric electric communications to have a chance

10
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,560
to meditate together thank you

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,680
and um

12
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:24,960
sometimes when there is a particular practice buddhist practice that's given

13
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,040
and it's offered not as a universal practice do this all the time or if it is offered that way then we do

14
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:36,159
it for a while and we forget and then it's just always there and we might do it and

15
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,840
it might not but the alternative way is to have a practice that we do for a very specific

16
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,880
time and maybe even a short time this is what we're doing now

17
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:53,360
and what i'd like to suggest that for this next you know 29 minutes now

18
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,360
or so of meditating together that the primary practice

19
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,719
be letting go and

20
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,399
maybe you know let go and let go into your breathing keep the

21
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:16,000
thread of coming back to your breathing over and over again and it's a way of highlighting what can

22
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:23,920
be you can let go of anything that takes you away from the breathing gently lovingly kindly

23
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,800
maybe even slowly let go release it

24
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:36,040
thoughts let them float away like thought bubbles

25
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,599
and it and we're not letting go of things per se what it is is letting go

26
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,879
of our preoccupation with them our concern with them

27
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,080
so is not a judgment or a statement about the value or the lack of value

28
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,360
of anything it's just the value of not holding on

29
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,840
the value of having a heart a mind that's

30
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:11,040
not concerned preoccupied involved with anything at all except gently

31
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,599
concerned with the breathing letting go into the breathing

32
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,799
being with a breath and any kind of extra effort straining pushing judging and commentating about

33
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,560
how it's going let go let go of your concern with it

34
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:37,360
let go of your interest in that kind of thinking let go of giving it authority or value

35
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,200
just let go and be with the breathing be with the breathing

36
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,840
so to assume a meditation posture that

37
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,040
maybe provides you with a certain kind of little bit of strength a little bit of dignity

38
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,840
a little bit of of uh

39
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,760
presence here and now

40
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,479
if you're sitting in a chair or sitting in a cushion perhaps you can

41
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:25,440
straighten out the back of your neck a little bit so the last vertebrae of the spine

42
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:32,240
there's a gap between the last vertebrae the spine and the skull and as you kind of lift up and open that

43
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,680
part at the same time maybe open your chest a little bit

44
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:44,960
not puffing it out but just letting the shoulders maybe roll back a little bit

45
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,520
and feel where the weight of your body settles on your chair your cushion

46
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,520
wherever you are what do you feel the groundedness

47
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:09,120
there and taking a few long slow deep breaths

48
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:16,240
on the exhale releasing yourself into that support

49
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,039
while staying upright

50
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,160
and then letting your breathing return to normal

51
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,120
and it's a lot easier to let go if the body is relaxed

52
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,440
so in whatever way that's possible but not more than that

53
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:02,400
relax the body on the exhale relax the muscles of the

54
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,400
face

55
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:14,960
maybe when you feel the muscles of the face you can get a sense of how much they work

56
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,600
speaking smiling communicating

57
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:30,639
responding to the world meditation let your face relax

58
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,240
taking a break from all that

59
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,319
relaxing or softening around the shoulders

60
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:56,319
you carry the burdens of the world the things we're preoccupied with

61
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:03,400
the preoccupation is maybe held or expressed in the shoulders

62
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:08,400
for these minutes now putting everything down

63
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,759
letting the shoulders relax

64
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,039
and the belly

65
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:31,840
maybe anxiety fear is chronically held in the belly

66
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:38,800
and if there's fear or anxiety it's hard to let go of our

67
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:44,840
mental preoccupations even for a short while

68
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,360
softening relaxing the belly

69
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,840
feeling the weight of the belly as you do so

70
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,680
and finally you can also relax the thinking mind

71
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:20,160
the energy the pressure the

72
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,240
tightness associated with thinking

73
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,759
maybe in the head maybe somewhere else

74
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:41,760
as you exhale maybe a little longer exhale than usual

75
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:49,560
relax the thinking muscle the thinking mind

76
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,600
and then breathing normally

77
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,959
noticing how the body experiences breathing

78
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,200
so you're not so much in the control tower as you are

79
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,240
in the experience the body has of breathing the sensing the feeling in the

80
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:45,240
body

81
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:59,600
either maybe feeling more fully or a little bit like

82
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:06,000
placing a a flag in the sand

83
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:13,279
say here this is the place where the attention will now

84
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,600
reside come back to

85
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:26,640
and any other concern preoccupation of the mind as soon as you notice it

86
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:33,839
let go especially let go on the exhale

87
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:43,120
release your preoccupation let go of your concern your involvement

88
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:51,200
whether the thoughts you're caught and go away or not that's secondary to releasing

89
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:56,560
your interest in them your involvement with them

90
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,240
so that you're deliberate or conscious

91
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:11,519
interest returns to breathing over and over again

92
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:19,720
let go of everything else but resting gently with the breathing

93
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:36,400
let go let go of the layers that get revealed

94
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:43,160
as you let go release

95
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,120
release your concern your involvement

96
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:56,880
it's not that you're so much letting go of what you're thinking about

97
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,280
just letting go of holding on being involved

98
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:09,320
and let go into your breathing

99
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:20,039
let go into knowing breathing

100
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:21,840
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

101
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,240
sometimes the practice of letting go in meditation

102
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:35,679
where there's no need to be thinking about certain things or being

103
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:41,760
concerned with things in the moment no inherent need

104
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,600
we start seeing how much our desires our thoughts keep

105
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,360
us from the task at hand

106
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,799
and sometimes when we're with other people caring for others

107
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,840
caring for ourselves

108
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:14,720
we get hijacked pulled away by our thoughts our judgments our commentary

109
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,360
and learning to let go can be a learning to really be present

110
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:28,640
for others present for ourselves in a deep friendly way caring way

111
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,840
kind way

112
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,559
may it be that what we learn about letting go

113
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:45,840
supports us in caring for self and others

114
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,200
for a focus on supporting the welfare and happiness of

115
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,880
all beings may letting go

116
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:03,520
wise letting go be a be

117
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:09,840
give us the ability to wish

118
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,360
and support happiness safety

119
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:22,480
peace and freedom for everyone may all beings

120
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:29,200
be happy may all beings be safe

121
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:34,960
may all beings be peaceful

122
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:39,720
may all beings be free

123
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:53,519
[Music]

124
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:00,760
thank you

125
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:33,360
so the practice of letting go is a powerful teacher

126
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:39,679
learn to let go and you can be available more fully for

127
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,360
our life for compassion for

128
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:51,760
wisdom to arise practicing letting go

129
00:31:51,760 --> 00:32:00,760
starts revealing all the ways in which we hold on all the ways in which we

130
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:10,640
cling grasped hold on and it's hard to see that in daily life

131
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:17,760
often but in meditation we can see the subtlety of it the consistency of it

132
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:23,760
how easy it is for the mind to wander off into some kind of concern and it might seem innocent enough some

133
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:31,600
of our preoccupations but it still involves some part of us is interested in our thoughts our fantasies

134
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:39,200
our imaginations the past the future and that interest is involves some kind of desire

135
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:45,279
some kind of wish that can be mild innocent enough it could also be

136
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:52,080
strong and intense if there's a anger about something

137
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:57,279
sitting in meditation and the mind just can't drop thinking about what happened and what

138
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:02,399
someone said and and the intensity of holding on being

139
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:09,760
concerned about is so strong but one of the things we learned is the consistency that how subtle how

140
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:16,000
thoroughly we're always always holding on or something and in daily life we don't see it so

141
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:22,559
clearly the minutia that ongoingness of it um in some ways we are

142
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:28,080
being um led around we're being hijacked we're

143
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:34,320
being um uh directed by our desires

144
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,720
and there's a lack of freedom we're not we're not directing the show our desires are

145
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:47,279
and um so in meditation we can learn how this works and learn to let go of it

146
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:53,200
we can we can start to cultivate um we can softening the

147
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,399
the muscle of holding on and clinging the intensity the energy behind it

148
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:03,519
some of the mental um uh orientations that leads us to to

149
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:09,200
cling and to hold on to things the inclination to give authority to our

150
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:15,679
thoughts to the the inclination to see everything to the filter of me myself and mine

151
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:22,079
the the orientation to have opinions that

152
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,040
we need to have we have to have all kinds of things we can see

153
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:32,960
and and so in meditation we can it's a one

154
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:40,240
laboratory to discover what it's like to let go of it all let go let go let go

155
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:46,638
and uh mindfulness practice uh you know if we as we go through this

156
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:53,440
uh there's been no real discussion about letting go at this so far

157
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:58,560
and um and so the only thing is at the very beginning it talks about relaxing the

158
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:05,920
body but otherwise that's the closest it gets to actually instructing us to let go

159
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:12,560
the the phenomenal power of the satipatana is that we don't we are not the agent

160
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:19,119
for change we are not the ones who are doing the change we're the ones who are knowing showing up for experience

161
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:24,400
knowing it well and then the letting go happens in a deeper way

162
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,400
and that's how the suta is but it can be very wise to let go if you

163
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:35,760
know how and um it could also be unwise there's unwise letting go letting go of the

164
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:42,480
wrong things but what we're focusing on in buddhism is not letting not the things we let go

165
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:48,880
of we might let go of some things but rather we're we're focusing on

166
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:54,160
the letting go of the clinging to things the holding on to things

167
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:00,720
and for this regard it's helpful to make the distinction between holding on and holding

168
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:07,839
so i can hold on to this striker and i can also hold it like this with my

169
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:12,880
hand flat so we can hold things in the softness of our hands

170
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:20,400
and now we're holding it lightly and if it's something that needs to go or is naturally going away then it goes

171
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:27,520
we're not holding on to it if it's something that temporarily needs us to use it for a

172
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:34,640
tool or something then we can grasp it and do something and then we return to holding it lightly

173
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,640
and so we don't necessarily have to lose things and letting go

174
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,000
we lose the grasping the holding itself the holding on

175
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:51,359
though we still might hold and so why this is important in looking

176
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:56,960
at the second the uh four noble truths is that

177
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:03,359
the um probably the most popular and common modern interpretation

178
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:10,160
of the four noble truths is that that the second noble truth teaches that

179
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:15,280
craving is the cause of suffering

180
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,560
that's a craving somehow grasping is somehow

181
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:26,720
responsible for how we suffer and in this interpretation if the grasping

182
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:31,760
goes away then that suffering goes away

183
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:37,280
it's possible to argue this and say for example not all suffering comes

184
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:44,079
from grasping and clinging some suffering some pain sadness grief

185
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:51,119
is just a natural part of life a dear loved one dies the fact that we feel grief and sadness

186
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:56,480
doesn't have to entail any grasping clinging they're just a natural state of

187
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:02,400
losing something that's important to us but there can in the grief also be

188
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:09,760
clinging and attachment and the issue for in practice is how to hold something like grief

189
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:15,280
without holding on to it and when you hold it then grief

190
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:23,359
kind of knows what to do if we hold on to it we limit it's working it's unfolding

191
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,760
so it could argue it's possible to question this whole thing about that the suffering comes from craving

192
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:37,520
that's why i like to turn this interpretation around and that's and say that if you crave

193
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,280
you will suffer so it's not that saying that all suffering comes from craving but

194
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,240
rather craving is a cause for suffering and part of the reason that i'm i feel

195
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:56,000
confident in saying this is that craving itself is a form of suffering it's a form of

196
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:02,400
stress on our system and so even regardless

197
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:08,560
of what we're crave the thing we're craving the act of craving is suffering

198
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:14,000
but the act of craving also uh creates habits in the mind creates karmic

199
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,280
momentum in the mind that will come back and sometimes

200
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:24,960
make things more difficult in the future so

201
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:30,720
so then learning to recognize what's called craving clinging

202
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:38,320
is important and i like to think of it as having as being desire

203
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,880
as being compelling desire desire which we seem to not have any much choice

204
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:50,079
about because it's so compelling it's so forceful it's so insistent um

205
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:58,400
put it down it immediately comes back sometimes try let it go go over and you can't let go of it sometimes it has us

206
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:05,440
complete control over us the intensity of the addiction desire that we might have

207
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:11,599
and and so um so

208
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:18,640
some people find it phenomenally useful this simple idea that craving

209
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:25,440
gives rise to suffering and if you let go of the craving that particular suffering goes away

210
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:30,800
suffering that's there that's not because of craving that's a whole other topic

211
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:36,319
but and this is one of the great i think

212
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:41,839
teachings of modern buddhism is this focus on craving and clinging

213
00:40:41,839 --> 00:40:48,160
and letting go that allows us to really release a lot of the tension the stress

214
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:53,359
the suffering that we carry with us in our lives

215
00:40:53,359 --> 00:41:00,079
and so to see that the second noble truth to understand it as

216
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:07,920
um so the first one is the truth of suffering the second one is the truth that

217
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:14,800
craving is the cause of suffering and um and some people in the modern world also

218
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:20,800
like to say that in this regard suffering is optional and

219
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:27,119
pain is not emotional pain not comes with life but the suffering suffering is the

220
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:32,400
the in this in the buddhist language is suffering is the pain

221
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:38,720
that arises because of the clinging so there's pain that has no clinging

222
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:45,280
it's then it's uh it's uh it wouldn't be called dukkha it wouldn't be called this uh this we

223
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:49,838
wouldn't use the buddhistic word suffering for it

224
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:56,480
so learning to let go and and there's two ways there's

225
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:02,400
dropping something and there's letting go of the holding onto it

226
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:07,520
and one way some people love to do this letting go practice

227
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,359
is not to let go per se but rather to let be and this is closer to what we're doing

228
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:20,640
in sattipatana is a practice of letting everything be

229
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:27,119
and then just seeing it for what it is knowing it and if we think of the knowing of

230
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,400
mindfulness as a letting b practice i think it adds a richness

231
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:39,359
to an adapt to the mindfulness that i think is very very significant

232
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:44,800
so letting things be so letting go of the holding on to

233
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:51,599
wanting expecting measuring ourselves how are we doing wanting it to be different

234
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:59,599
wanting it to go something to go away there's all these compuls compulsive thoughts ideas that

235
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:06,079
can weigh us down when we do mindfulness practice and the idea is to come to a very

236
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:11,440
free or easy or satisfying place of mindfulness where we

237
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:17,680
let everything just be and in the beingness we know it

238
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,680
we let it be and we know what we're allowing it to be so whether it's

239
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:30,240
experiences of the body feeling tones mind states the hindrances the seven factors of

240
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:37,200
awakening a lot of it is just letting it be and knowing it well

241
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:44,319
and what we discover over time is that the act of this clear full

242
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:50,319
knowing while we let things be it doesn't this has an impact

243
00:43:50,319 --> 00:43:55,599
it it sets in motion something begins to unfold and to move

244
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:02,160
and change i don't know if this is a good analogy but if you take

245
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:07,680
carbonated water a bottle of it and maybe shake it first and then remove the lid

246
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:13,680
then just removing it letting go of how the lid is holds on and clings to the top of

247
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:19,040
the bottle then it releases the pressure of the carbonate carbonation

248
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:24,960
the gas and um so sometimes just letting go releases

249
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,720
something free something sometimes it allows something healthy to

250
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:36,400
flow and move our psychophysical beings are processes they're not things

251
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:42,240
and so the holding on interferes with the processes the the dynamic nature of this life that we

252
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:48,319
are and so letting be is not that doesn't really let things

253
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:54,560
stay the same letting things be allows a process dynamic process to

254
00:44:54,560 --> 00:45:01,200
unfold which is not under your direction and so there is a kind of letting go of

255
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:06,880
direction with giving direction is another thing to hold on to

256
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:14,480
so um so you might want to look at um

257
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:22,240
what behavior you have today that's compulsive what thoughts what words you speak

258
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:28,560
what activities you do that you find yourself doing without deliberation without

259
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:35,920
care and attention like something inside of you is kind of taking the ball and run with it

260
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:42,560
where you're not free and what do you need to let go of or what you need to

261
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:48,560
not hold on to so you come back to a place of freedom of choice

262
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:55,680
of agency knowing what you're doing without compulsion

263
00:45:55,680 --> 00:46:00,800
getting in the way so stop through the day take a good look at

264
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:05,839
this and you'll learn a lot

265
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:11,119
so thank you all and tomorrow i'll offer a different interpretation for the

266
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:18,680
second noble truth that relates to the third noble truth thank you
