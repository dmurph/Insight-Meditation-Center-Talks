1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:08,280
okay great so so dear ones welcome welcome

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:14,400
so for tonight's practice um I'd like to invite us to engage with

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,740
um with self-compassion both Beth this soft

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:26,340
gentle nurturing type of style of self-compassion as well as as what

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:35,640
actually feels like Fierce self-compassion there's a sense of um strength a brightness and and it's

6
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:41,340
very loving and it's also powerful at the same time so for us to engage in

7
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:47,700
both of those ways so so

8
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:56,340
um especially I think especially as as we are in the holidays in in the US

9
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,980
um it it can be both a joyous time for for

10
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:09,000
for many and it can be a stressful time for many um in fact

11
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,760
a very stressful time for many for a variety of reasons and

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,040
um of course not not assume that everybody else's experiences like us or

13
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:27,119
who are getting together with family and and um it's great to to for us perhaps to to

14
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,460
acknowledge and and and perhaps um consider that for some people maybe

15
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:38,340
if they've experienced loss this might be a difficult time especially this stressful time so

16
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:45,240
let's end and of course the two can coexist together joy and sorrow can

17
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,880
exist together so one does not negate the other we can hold joy and delight

18
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,880
and happiness and gratitude um and we can also our heart can also hold

19
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:04,320
challenge difficulty perhaps sadness Melancholy at the same time it's our

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,160
heart is so expansive that that um they can both be present and it's

21
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,160
okay in fact the state of equanimity state of equanimity equipoise allow us

22
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,340
to be with everything that arises um as a part of this Human Condition

23
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,000
so so um

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:36,360
self-compassion can be a healing a healing wand both for us and as we have

25
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:42,540
it for ourselves it can support others so and the very first

26
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:49,440
um step towards self-compassion is acknowledging actually realizing

27
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:55,700
that we're hurting that seems kind of simple and straightforward but actually

28
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:03,900
that first step of realizing and knowing that we're hurting we often miss we often kick ourselves in

29
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:10,260
The Shins okay get going get why are you being XYZ calling ourselves name and not

30
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:15,420
names and not realizing that actually oh maybe oh this being who is me is having

31
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:21,140
a hard time right now oh I'm having a hard time this is difficult

32
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:27,840
this is difficult if anyone else was in my shoes right now with this

33
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,080
background with these jeans with this upbringing with these set of experiences

34
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,239
um life experiences Etc they would be having the same the same challenge same

35
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:47,280
difficulty so so it could just be as simple as if this is hard right now this is hard right now and that recognition

36
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:53,159
that simple recognition can help transform us

37
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,860
from kicking ourselves and adding more insult to injury

38
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,560
um versus cutting ourselves a little bit of slack bringing more kindness bringing

39
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,840
more compassion ah finding our balance through

40
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:15,000
gentleness and kindness and then maybe some fierceness some some

41
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,239
ability some some uh compassionate power and accountability

42
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:28,080
for ourselves that we did we couldn't have before because it hurts too much can then show up but then together with

43
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,479
kindness together with kindness compassionate accountability can come in

44
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:40,440
as a sense of fierce compassion so I'll try to invite us to to play with

45
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:45,860
these Concepts if it just seems like too heady right now what is she talking about don't worry about it I'm just

46
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:50,940
introducing some ideas and I'll guide us I'll guide us in the guided meditation

47
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,460
for us to explore and um for each person the exploration might

48
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:03,720
be might lead you in different places and that's perfectly okay trust trust your

49
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:12,120
own wisdom trust what is appropriate for you right now so so with that let's transition into

50
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:19,500
our sitting practice so inviting you to

51
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,300

or a pet

109

a fully compassionate being say the Buddha or foreign

111
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:53,360
example Paragon of compassion just

00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:50,220
just because you are a human and being human is hard enough hard enough

118
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:54,559
hard enough you're held

119
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:02,480
by the Buddha by kuanian or any other

120
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,840
compassionate being

121
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:16,400

122
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:23,780

129
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,700

and it's okay I can hold it I can hold it with care

146
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:51,840
not self-criticism but yeah this is hard ah let your body soften at your heart

147
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:54,320
soften

148
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:54,539
let this acknowledgment of the challenge be held with kindness

149
00:29:54,539 --> 00:30:00,899
anyone in my situation would have felt the same would have felt

150
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:09,480
challenged may I have ease I wish myself ease

151
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:15,620
and freedom from this challenge may I hold myself with kindness

152
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:24,720
and acceptance may I offer myself safety

153
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,520
and generosity of spirit

154
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,919
with respect to this challenge especially

155
00:30:52,260 --> 00:31:01,760
just as this compassionate being hold to you with care compassion holding yourself with care compassion

156
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:36,260
and maybe as you hold yourself

157
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:44,720
with the recognition of the difficulty and with compassion

158
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:52,520
a brightness a brightness awakens the brightness the power of compassion

159
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:07,020
as compassion together with its soothing nature also empowers you from within

160
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,480
your heart foreign

161
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:27,080
feeling soothed feels more ready to take on

162
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:35,700

164
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,100
maybe it feels you can feel that it's both soothing calming

165
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:51,799
nurturing and empowering at the same time

166
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:12,860
and if the empowering aspect of it isn't clear lean into the soothing

167
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:18,419
calming nourishing healing

168
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:22,460
and when enough healing has happened

169
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:33,919
the heart will feel more whole and more empowered in its own healing

170
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:43,278
see and explore for yourself

171
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:03,599
and as we begin this begin to bring this seated

172
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:08,780
practice to an end together

173
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,599
offering kindness to yourself for whatever Rosen did not arise and

174
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,599
letting your sense of goodness and

175
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:28,859
kindness however much you were in touch with it let it shine Let It Shine internally

176
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:34,740
and externally for the benefit of yourself and others

177
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:42,260
equally it's a gift to ourselves or practice it's a gift to others

178
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,319
same same

179
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:55,079
and may our practice be a support for our Awakening and

180
00:36:55,079 --> 00:37:00,839
Awakening of all beings everywhere may all brings be free may all beings be

181
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:03,020
happy

182
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:24,619

183
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:36,599
ah and I certainly feel happier and happier and calmer and

184
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:42,720

for the benefit of with yourself to Sharon be witnessed and for the benefit

188
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,880
of others what came up what did you discover

189
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:12,119
Stephanie so it's funny uh I had a meeting with a

190
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:19,320
meditation teacher I worked with today and she was talking to me about self-compassion so when I showed up on

191
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:25,560
this call was funny that that's what we're talking about so I really got a lot out of the practice as I always do

192
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:33,060
your practices Nikki and um really appreciate it it will definitely have to listen to this one again

193
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:39,660
hmm thanks Stephanie thanks for sharing the the Serendipity synchrony that has

194
00:38:39,660 --> 00:38:46,680
happened for you and and I'm delighted that these offerings are supportive to you yay thank you

195
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:54,020
thank you for being part of the Sangha Stephanie Dan

196
00:38:58,579 --> 00:39:06,720
hi thanks Nikki um I I I don't quite know my difficulty maybe

197
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:12,300
you might have some comments or insights I have no trouble whatsoever

198
00:39:12,300 --> 00:39:18,359
being compassionate to the first seven you know fifth seventh eighth level of

199
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:23,700
compassion for you but I can never make it past two for myself

200
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:30,560
it seems self-centered it seems selfish uh give me some perspective here please

201
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:35,700
ah thank you Dad this is such an important question

202
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:42,960
um and it's it's important to bring this up as you as you well articulated it and

203
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,200
first to say it is very common it is so common for for many many people to have

204
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:54,480
this sense that it's easier to give compassion for others and for ourselves

205
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,720
it's a little more challenging it feels uh and and you named a couple of things that come up

206
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:07,920
a couple of blocks that you mentioned it feels uh self-centered you said selfish

207
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,500
um trying to remember what else you said there's there are many of them there are many blocks to compassion uh one is oh

208
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:20,940
if you become compassionate then or especially self-compassionate then um you will not get anything done

209
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:27,359
because you're just you'll lie on the couch and eat bon bons all day so it's it I mean there are lots of fears of

210
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:34,079
compassion lots of fears of compassion and the one that you named is one of them that it just feels like oh it's not

211
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:40,440
appropriate um somehow that um yeah I'm being selfish and there's so much need in the

212
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:45,780
world here I am trying to uh be kind to myself

213
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:51,420
um and so so and there might be more there and and I'm going to ask you to unmute if there's more there if you want

214
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:59,640
to share so that we get to the Croc server or is that is that it basically that's that's short of it I come or I've

215
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:07,500
spent most I've done both Buddhist Meditation and sort of non-denominational meditation on and off

216
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:15,000
for a number of years I come from a classic Christian background with lot lots of optional Theology and stuff yeah

217
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:20,520
I think uh I'm old enough to to you know go back to the Latin mass and stuff like

218
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:25,560
that so I've got a lot of time on the meter so

219
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:31,140
to speak um and it despite your kind words I'm going

220
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:36,540
to have to reflect on this and oh we're not finished yet we're not finished I wanted to ask you that we're not

221
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:43,260
friendship I just wanted to give you a chance to reflect some more so before I I I was just hype I was just formulating

222
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,960
the problem before getting into it so so good so excellent so let me take it if I

223
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:56,280
may um so so and thank you thank you for more um more background so

224
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:03,060
so here's a couple of things to consider then one is that this this challenge could be a sense of perspective so

225
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:08,400
consider the perspective what are the thoughts that are creating the block and

226
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:14,880
and actually catalog them I I invite that you Journal you write down okay maybe there's a sense I'm not deserving

227
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:22,320
maybe a sense that it's a waste of my time other people are needed more or I need to to earn it and or whatever the

228
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:27,780
perspective is it's just you know there could be a dime a dozen whatever person and then try to catalog them it's like

229
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:32,940
okay well is that really true really is that really really true and and and and

230
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:38,400
with kindness like okay I don't deserve the you know the thought might come I don't deserve like I don't know if

231
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,339
that's the case or not but I'm just giving an example say well actually is that really true and then reflect on

232
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:53,040
that and and given that you have a rich background and with different theologies well every human being and and uh maybe

233
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:59,280
I'll use the Christian language for a moment ever God loves everyone I'm as deserving as

234
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,500
everybody else why wouldn't I be deserving of love and my own compassion

235
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:11,160
so so examine all these unseen unseen assumptions

236
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:16,859
um that there might be that when you're in meditation they just come up and the mind believes them and it just blocks

237
00:43:16,859 --> 00:43:22,440
and that's it just so take time with kindness to examine all these hidden

238
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:30,060
perspectives and and also one holds someone to add is that um

239
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:36,839
um there's that that if you know if we really fill our own cup with our own

240
00:43:36,839 --> 00:43:42,780
compassion with our own kindness first if we do that first

241
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:48,000
then then we don't go around basically through the whole world saying love me

242
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:55,500
love me love me love me take care of me it it because we might be doing that subconsciously but if we their sense of

243
00:43:55,500 --> 00:44:00,599
acceptance and love for this being who is me as as if it's the third person

244
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:06,359
then there's a sense of contentment as a base for uh compassion for others

245
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:12,420
actually and as you mentioned you know you can have level seven or eight for me and two for yourself right now and

246
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:19,740
that'll become oh 10 for yourself and ten for me it will just open up that other extra you know that the blocks

247
00:44:19,740 --> 00:44:27,300
that there are so so offering that for your reflection Dad yeah thanks thanks for being here beautiful Serena I see

248
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:33,000
your hand up and we'll let this be the last reflection before we transition to

249
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:38,819
um the groups thank you so much for this opportunity

250
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:44,280
and much appreciated um yes so

251
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:51,119
um I have a really difficult time

252
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:56,400
well one of the things that happens to me during meditation was that

253
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:02,220
um I was at a meeting before I came on and I stood up very strongly to somebody

254
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:10,079
to someone of a certain point of view and I could really see I could really

255
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:16,319
feel at one hand I was feeling a lot of strength um

256
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:22,200
uh Within Myself which I haven't been feeling at all as a matter of fact I've been quite

257
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:27,300
depressed um for a few months and

258
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:32,940
um and um

259
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:40,760
I'm just kind of wondering how to be with with that kind of strength

260
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:48,740
and you know standing up kind of energy uh and having compassion for it yeah

261
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:56,400
yeah I get I did get the gist of the question thanks Serena um and for the for um given that the

262
00:45:56,400 --> 00:46:01,859
time is short I I like to respond in this way so so how to balance that so so

263
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:08,339
actually fears compassion is loving so you can have you can as you said stand

264
00:46:08,339 --> 00:46:14,220
up to someone but not from hatred and not from um well I'm gonna show you but if

265
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:19,319
actually loving them and loving yourself and out of love for the community are

266
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:25,680
out of love for the cause out of love for what it is you're doing instead of instead of resentment or anger so that's

267
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:31,560
how you bring these two together um and it's it might sound like a tall

268
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:38,280
order but it isn't it it's it's um it's something that I do trust every

269
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:44,880
single one of us can do if we practice if we and that's why we come but that's why we practice so that this practice

270
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:50,700
becomes becomes the natural tendency so that's what I like to offer for for your

271
00:46:50,700 --> 00:46:59,940
reflection Serena thank you thank you so much okay let's transition now it's uh 10

272
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:07,460
minutes till the hour let's transition to small groups and the um small the The

273
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:14,640
Prompt or so the groups will be size of roughly three and each person is invited

274
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:22,260
to just share something from their experience or say pass and hold a compassionate space for others and the

275
00:47:22,260 --> 00:47:28,920
prompt is simply um how does um how does self-compassion

276
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:35,760
um when you experience self-compassion um do you notice that it'll there's

277
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:42,720
there is some gentleness some kindness some ease with suffering do you notice how self-compassion actually can hold

278
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:48,900
the suffering and can you see how it actually brings more resilience how self-compassion can bring more

279
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:54,180
resilience so that exploration your answer might be no I haven't really thought about this connection at all

280
00:47:54,180 --> 00:48:00,839
it's like oh yeah no actually I say that when I was kind to myself oh there was some resources or strength that I had

281
00:48:00,839 --> 00:48:08,520
realized so so that's the exploration exploration each person will say maybe one minute and then the next person will

282
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:15,300
say them uh another minute and the next person another minute then you go round and round and make sure everybody gets

283
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:21,660
the chance to speak so so hold back from the full story just just give it a little bit and and he'll come back to

284
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:27,060
you be kind take care of yourselves take care of each other

285
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:34,260
um yeah so I'm going to create the rooms now and here we go

286
00:48:34,260 --> 00:48:40,200
okay all the rooms are closed everybody is back and

287
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:47,040

288
00:48:47,040 --> 00:48:55,440
um yeah close and um dedicate the Merit of our practice together I hope and trust that the small
