1
00:00:01,079 --> 00:00:09,800
welcome good morning good afternoon good evening wherever you are whenever you are nice to see you again my name is May

2
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,279
Elliot and we are on day three of the Buddha's five Daily

3
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:21,199
Reflections five daily Recollections so today we will be

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:28,679
focusing on the third phrase I am of the nature to die I have not gone beyond

5
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:35,079
death so uh death is something that most of us don't spend a lot of time thinking about

6
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:42,000
uh so by centering this reflection we can transform fear we can align our life

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:51,719
with our priorities and really become more intimate with the truth of the way things are so this is a powerful one and

8
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:58,440
uh as mentioned in previous days as these phrases progress um one through

9
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:03,559
four they become increasing L more challenging and so this one can have a

10
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,799
stronger impact than the last two um so please consider for yourselfself whether

11
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:17,640
this topic is supportive for you today or you know maybe if you're a little underresourced or feel like you um don't

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:23,960
have the bandwidth for this totally fine too might be a little too much for today

13
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,119
so these these Recollections they should be um you should be carefully titrated

14
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:36,119
and administered when we actually have sufficient well-being and resiliency to take them in to take them in so uh

15
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:42,640
please just take care of your own heart um and uh as with the previous days

16
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,880
we'll practice with the phrase in two ways um we'll sit in silence together

17
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,320
and then uh and then we'll shift to dropping the phrase into our practice just letting it Ripple through the mind

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,399
and heart seeing what arises and um and then secondly we'll do

19
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:06,960
an engage contemplation where I'll offer questions and you'll be invited to think about and feel into what comes up for

20
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:14,480
you in a more engaged fashion so oh and during the meditation I'll offer um

21
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,080
Nikki map's version of this phrase which is um so sweet and so gentle um and

22
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,599
that's breathing in with compassion I gently remember that this body will die

23
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:33,959
so uh so I'll offer both the traditional and her her version of that of the

24
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,519
phrase so let's get started with our meditation go Ahad and find a posture

25
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:46,000
which is supportive for you maybe that's sitting standing or lying

26
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:54,280
down something that allows you to be um have some energy in the mind so you're

27
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:01,040
not sleepy but also something that invites calm invites some tranquility

28
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:15,670
and maybe starting just by softening the the muscles of the body releasing any

29
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:18,990
[Music]

30
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,760
tension connecting with your anchor the breath the global sense of the body

31
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,840
sitting the soundscape whatever it is for you that helps you really land here

32
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,120
in the

33
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:59,959
present and any thoughts that arise during this time we're not resisting

34
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:05,720
them or fighting them nor are we getting lost in them taking them and

35
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:13,439
respectfully putting them on the Shelf we'll be putting them on the metaphorical Altar for the period of our

36
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,440
meditation anything discursive setting aside

37
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,680
go ahead and take some time now in silence to settle and collect the

38
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
mind

39
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639

e e

55
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:46,000
before entering into the recollection

56
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:54,120
together and start by warming up the heart we can do that with a little meta

57
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,759
little loving kindness the the approximate cause for

58
00:13:59,759 --> 00:14:05,320
meta to arise is reflecting on someone's

59
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:10,639
goodness so to warm up our own

60
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:17,000
heart as these Recollections are about ourselves and to begin we begin with

61
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:24,839
oursel um and then consider others um we can reflect on our own

62
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:31,759
goodness just taking a moment to uh to consider your own goodness maybe there's

63
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:37,399
something that you did small or large that was generous

64
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:45,839
recently maybe you offered a compliment gave a gift listened

65
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,959
well something you appreciate about

66
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:02,040
yourself just taking a moment or two to

67
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,839
letting go of this

68
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:50,839
reflection sending ourselves some

69
00:15:52,959 --> 00:16:00,920
kindness as all beings wish to be happy may I too be happy

70
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:06,680
may I be

71
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:16,600
healthy may I be safe and at

72
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,920
ease just bringing in a little care a little gentleness for ourselves

73
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,959
and we'll begin with our our

74
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:42,319
recollection so I'll say the phrase and then just let it drop into

75
00:16:42,319 --> 00:16:47,440
your meditation like a pebble in a pond and let it Ripple through the mind and

76
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:54,720
heart just see what naturally arises um and with this there's no we're

77
00:16:54,720 --> 00:17:00,639
not calling forth thinking intentionally there may be thoughts or uh thoughts

78
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:08,640
words or pictures in the mind that arise and that's fine not we're not deliberately contemplating this

79
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:15,400
time so let's begin breathing in with

80
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:22,880
compassion I gently remember that this body will die

81
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:54,960
just noticing what [Music] arises if there's any duka there if

82
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,120
there's any suffering in the heart or mind holding it with

83
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:16,840
compassion I am subject to death have not gone beyond dying

84
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:49,158
breathing in with compassion I gently remember that this body will die

85
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:15,519
comforting as needed there there love it's

86
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:25,360
okay in your own time now dropping in the

87
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:30,720
phrase and seeing what happens

88
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,679
e e

89
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:48,720
when you're ready letting go of

90
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:56,320
phrases returning to your anchor and settling

91
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,559
back e

92
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:36,039
shift now to our engaged

93
00:21:36,039 --> 00:21:45,000
contemplation and I'll offer you some questions which you can actively think about um but keep a

94
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:52,720
short leash on the thinking in the sense that one thought can easily lead to another and another and suddenly we're

95
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,080
on a very far off topic so um so keeping your thoughts close to the question

96
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,880
as um as in they are gravitating around the

97
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:14,200
being so the first question when you consider that you'll

98
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:21,000
die how do you relate to it is there fear

99
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:29,240
sadness [Music] acceptance how do you relate to death

100
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:06,799
if you to imagine your death consider how would you like to

101
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:13,440
die what is that moment

102
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:23,799
like where are you who are you with

103
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:36,480
what can you see here smell taste

104
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:26,720
realizing that death will occur what do you want to prioritize

105
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:39,120
and in considering this is there anything that you want to let go

106
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:45,720
of or anything that you want to

107
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:58,880
begin namely how do you want to spend your time

108
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,960
how do you want to

109
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:28,600
prioritize and as we deep this of course while we are inviting thinking in while

110
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:34,399
we're inviting Concepts in also paying attention to the body so we have a wide

111
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:41,600
angle mindfulness to feel and sense emotions Body Sensations as the thoughts

112
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,600
occur

113
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:07,440
knowing that you are subject to death how do you want to be with

114
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:13,640
others does it Inspire patience [Music]

115
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:23,520
forgiveness expressions of love how do you want to be with others

116
00:26:56,559 --> 00:27:02,279
in daily life are you aware of the blessing of life and

117
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:07,120
vitality of one more day on this

118
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:15,559
plan are you aware of the blessing of life and vitality

119
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:01,919
letting go of any flection now coming back into [Music]

120
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:10,320
silence sensing the body noticing what Sensations are

121
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:18,080
present noticing if there's an emotion present or a

122
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:29,240
mood recognizing whatever you find and allowing it to be there

123
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:41,120
whatever you find is a natural

124
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:49,120
response to coming to terms with this this recollection on

125
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,440
death it's okay to feel big feelings right no

126
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,519
feelings and meeting whatever you find with some

127
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:20,170
kindness we'll close with just a few metap [Music]

128
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:28,760
phrases just as all beings want to be happy healthy

129
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:35,760
safe and at ease may I too be happy healthy safe and

130
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,960
at ease

131
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:09,120
May the benefit of our time together support all beings in being

132
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:16,279
happy heal healthy safe and at ease

133
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:55,120
welcome back for those just arriving my name is

134
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:01,679
May Elliot and I'll begin with the first paragraph of a

135
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:08,960
book uh which has a title that I love it's called advice to Future

136
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:14,720
corpses and I think it was actually mentioned in the YouTube chat feed

137
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:19,200
yesterday and the book begins like

138
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:28,279
this right now imagine dying make it what you want

139
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:37,000
you could be in your bedroom on a lonesome Hill or in a beautiful hotel whatever you

140
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:42,519
want what is the season what time of day is

141
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:48,559
it perhaps you want to lie in sweet summer grass and watch the sunrise over

142
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:56,000
the ocean imagine that perhaps you want to be cuddled in a soft bed listening to

143
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:03,440
Mozart or Beyonce do you want to be alone is there a particular hand you

144
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:11,760
want to hold do you want do you smell the faint scent of baking bread or Chanel number

145
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:18,480
19 close your eyes feel the grass the silk

146
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:23,919
sheets the skin of the loving hand hear the long held

147
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,200
note dance a little smell the bread

148
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,760
imagine

149
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:45,399
that so I I once sat a retreat with biku

150
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:51,960
analio one of the great scholar monks of our time uh and we spent the whole week

151
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,519
doing an elaborate series of practices involving emptiness and compassion and

152
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:03,519
all of these extraordinary Buddhist teachings and he spent quite a lot of time during this week telling us how

153
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:08,840
incredibly profound these teachings were and how much they can transform us and lead to

154
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:14,200
Liberation and towards the end of The Retreat someone said somebody asked him

155
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:23,039
uh if you could only do one practice what would you recommend and he said oh well I actually

156
00:33:23,039 --> 00:33:29,760
wouldn't recommend any of the practices we're doing I would recommend death contemp

157
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,039
ation so perhaps that's sufficient to describe the importance of today's

158
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:42,919
recollection or maybe this from the Buddha the elephant's footprint is the

159
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:51,480
greatest of footprints of of all the mindfulness meditation that on death is

160
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:58,159
supreme so clearly this is an important recollection and here we are in the

161
00:33:58,159 --> 00:34:04,240
third um the third of five Recollections I am of the nature to die I have not

162
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,360
gone beyond death this can be truly

163
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:15,960
transformational and know uh there are many ways to engage in death

164
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:23,520
contemplation um this daily recollection is just one death contemplation or mindfulness

165
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:31,158
of death is called marati and there are within in this field of practices there are chal ground

166
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:37,839
meditations um there's reflecting on the stages of decay of the body um there's a

167
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:43,480
simple bre breath practice that can be done when inhale this could be my last

168
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:52,358
Last Breath exhale let go inhale this could be my last breath exhale let go so

169
00:34:52,359 --> 00:34:58,000
there are many ways to do this the Recollections are just one

170
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:04,040
and uh one of the core intentions uh of this practice is to move this conceptual

171
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,079
understanding of death into the heart into the belly where it can be

172
00:35:09,079 --> 00:35:15,599
digested um because for most of us uh we really can't fathom our own death Beyond

173
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:22,440
an intellectual understanding in the in the mahabarata which is a revered Hindu

174
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:28,599
text the Lord of death asks what is the most wonderful thing in the world what's

175
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:35,560
the most wondrous thing in the world and his answer that we could see everyone dying

176
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:40,680
around us and think it won't happen to

177
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:47,880
us it's uh it's simply amazing that it could be happening all around us and yet

178
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:55,319
still we don't think it'll happen to us like we know of course it'll happen to us but there's uh uh something in us

179
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:04,440
that can't necessarily come to terms with that our struggles to so uh so it can be really helpful to

180
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:11,280
spend time with death if we can really get to know it deeply so we can be changed by it but we need to remember

181
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,760
again and again so that we can actually um so that

182
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,800
we can actually bring that into our and really learn to live differently by

183
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:31,599
it so a few days ago I mentioned uh an aging app that could be downloaded on

184
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:37,920
your phone uh so today I have another one to share with you which I kind of love that we can turn our phones into

185
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:44,960
these uh tools for Liberation um rather than nuisances um so in any case like the app

186
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:53,200
is called we croak we c o a k uh and the intention is

187
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:58,560
to remind you that you're going to die and here's what they say on their

188
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:04,560
website uh each day we'll send you five invitations at randomized times to stop

189
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,920
and think about death we croak invitations come at random times and at

190
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:14,480
any moment just like death

191
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,319
itself so this in a way is like a modern version of this ancient Buddhist

192
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:25,119
practice of uh remembering

193
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:34,119
daily uh I I spent the last eight years or so living at Zen temples and um

194
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:41,560
whenever it's time for a meditation at aen Temple an instrument is played to call

195
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:47,960
the s to the meditation Hall to call the community of practitioners to the meditation homeall bendo and the

196
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:53,160
instrument is called a Han it's it's a large wooden block about a foot and a

197
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:59,599
half wide and a foot tall and it hangs from the ceiling and this block is hit with a mallet so the instrument

198
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:05,640
functions a little like a a grandfather clock and that it Chimes the hour um

199
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:11,079
before meditation so the monks can track what time it is by by listening to the Mallet

200
00:38:11,079 --> 00:38:16,240
Stripes now the reason I mentioned this instrument is because of what's painted

201
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:23,319
on it so in thick black lettering on the face of the instrument uh is this

202
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:28,400
phrase uh birth and death are given once

203
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:34,079
this moment now is gone awake each one

204
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:42,920
awake don't waste this life so with each strike of the Han this

205
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:48,720
teaching Echoes through the monastery reverberates through the

206
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:56,200
monastery grounds birth and death are given once awake each one awake don't

207
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,440
waste this life so it it imparts the sense of SGA of

208
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,760
spiritual urgency and this is part of the function of today's recollection you know wake up

209
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:13,000
spend your time wisely and I hear this this same

210
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:21,000
sentiment in the last refrain of a Mary Oliver poem and what will you do with this one

211
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:29,359
wild and precious life what will you do with this one wild and precious life

212
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:39,680
I was doing this uh this death contemplation practice and having it

213
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:47,640
done it for some time at some point uh a very deep sweetness arose of just loving

214
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:53,200
this being that I've spent my whole life with this being called May Elliot who

215
00:39:53,200 --> 00:40:01,200
I've cared for since she was small so sometimes when resting in loving awareness when

216
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:07,920
the sense of self arises I relate to her as a child so realizing that this child

217
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:14,720
is only on this planet for a very short time I think about uh how I would want

218
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,280
to treat her how much more tender I would be with her and rather than living

219
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:27,520
a life based on gried how could I be generous with her kind patient forgiving

220
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:34,319
so just accompanying this child this ego to the end no need to fix her or ask her

221
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:41,720
to be different so knowing knowing that you too will die and the part of you that is

222
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:47,680
still a tender child will have to die how would you take care of that

223
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:53,640
one you know really tender here dear one let me wipe your brow when you're sick

224
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:59,119
let me stroke your hand lay your head on my shoulder

225
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:05,640
so gentle and can we be with ourselves in

226
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:07,920
this

227
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:18,040
way there there are many benefits to this practice some of which I've already

228
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:25,160
named um one is uh we can learn to meet death without fear and perhaps instead

229
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:31,000
meeting it with awe or here our final Act of generosity is giving our bodies

230
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:39,280
back to the Earth that's how we related to it another benefit I mentioned briefly

231
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:45,680
is the benefit of somea spiritual urgency you know to give ourselves more

232
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:52,359
wholeheartedly to practice uh another huge one is that

233
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:58,880
we're more likely to act in ways that are aligned with what we value it helps us priv prioritize in a way that allows

234
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:05,640
us to live more fully and uh one that Nikki mentions

235
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:12,400
which I really appreciate is that this practice provides a great gift for our loved ones and that they don't have to

236
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,800
take care of uh of your fear and your Terror death if you've already learned

237
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:26,520
to work through that yourself so uh so the invitation today

238
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:33,040
is to stay close to this recollection stay close to the truth of death when

239
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:38,880
you interact with others um when you take care of yourself dressing showering

240
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:44,640
eating will lovingly care for this one wild and precious

241
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:52,720
life and so I will close with a poem and this is called uh for the anniversary of

242
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:57,680
my death by WS Merwin

243
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:07,000
every year without knowing it I have passed the day when the last fires will

244
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:12,040
wave to me and the silence will set out tireless

245
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:16,839
traveler like the beam of a lightless

246
00:43:17,319 --> 00:43:23,480
star then I will no longer find myself in life as in a strange garment

247
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:29,400
surprised at the earth and the love of one woman and the shamelessness of men

248
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:37,920
as today riding after 3 days of rain hearing the rening and the falling seeds

249
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:42,920
and bowing not knowing to

250
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:54,119
what and thank you so much for your attention everyone I hope you enjoy your day that

251
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:59,760
you're gentle with your heart and that you can and lovingly care for this one

252
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:05,200
wild and precious life take care
