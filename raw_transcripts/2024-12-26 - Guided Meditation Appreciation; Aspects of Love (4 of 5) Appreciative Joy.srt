1
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:09,359
hello my friends and Welcome to our meditation

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:18,000
and I'm feeling pretty appreciative and delighted to be here and uh to be here

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:25,599
in a relatively healthy way after being having a short cold short maybe

4
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:31,960
flu and um and it feels kind of special to be sitting

5
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:37,960
here so the theme for today is well this

6
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,399
for the dmer talk will be um appreciative

7
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:50,920
joy and so to talk about appreciation and joy briefly we have this amazing capacity

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:58,640
for attention and awareness or attention is often comes along with our

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:08,720
preoccupations with our ruminations with our uh uh primary concerns with our

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:16,720
fear and when it does so awareness acts like a magnifying lass so if we bring

11
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:24,040
our attention to something which we're challenged by some we find is difficult or unfortunate all these extra stuff

12
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:30,720
that comes with awareness um U makes it bigger for us and it can Loom really big

13
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:40,119
big and but this uh and we then we miss out on the bigger picture of what's

14
00:01:40,119 --> 00:01:47,280
happening and meditation is meant to settle the preoccupations the pre the

15
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,600
the the fears the biases the selectivity

16
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,240
by which the attention is used to help us see the bigger picture of the of the

17
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:05,240
moment and in doing that it's helpful to almost

18
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:11,080
counter the tendency the negativity bias that many people have to from time to

19
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,319
time take time to appreciate all the good that you have appreciate what is

20
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:24,160
right maybe just in this present moment even if much in your life is

21
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,200
difficult to be to be preoccupied with that for the

22
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:37,160
mind the heart to be caught in that all the time is not healthy for us it's good

23
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:43,879
to take a break it's good to step away to get a bigger picture to realize there's more to life than the challenges

24
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:50,879
we have and from time to time it's good to uh appreciate uh what is good in life

25
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,599
what's good the sunlight the warmth the the

26
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:03,440
um that we have food to eat that we have a roof over our head many people don't have these basic

27
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:11,400
simple things so now we're sitting here the goodness the appreciation for

28
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,799
the opportunity to meditate the opportunity to meditate in

29
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:22,640
community the opportunity to enter into your meditation

30
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:29,200
posture and um there's something very very invaluable something very powerful

31
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,799
for me to step into my meditation posture posture that I've assumed now

32
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:40,280
for 50 years and the associations the familiarity is quite wonderful and that

33
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:46,120
I have been able to have this posture uh that is so meaningful for me

34
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:53,040
brings me a lot of Joy it brings me a lot of joy that I have a practice of

35
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:59,079
mindfulness that frees me from suffering frees me from the preoccupation with it

36
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:04,920
frees me with the added fear added added um

37
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,560
rumination it frees me for that magnifying glass that tends to highlight

38
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:17,759
the difficulties so I live in them thinking they're most of what's Happening mostly what's happening in the

39
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,960
present moment for most of most of us uh it's good mostly what's happening for most of

40
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:30,880
us are things that are working uh May many of our biological

41
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,919
functions that Keep Us Alive if you're alive they're working even if some of

42
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,639
them are challenging challenged most of our mental functions

43
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,680
allows us to be aware and recognize what's happening as it's happening a lot

44
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:54,360
is working in the brain in the mind even if some things are a little bit

45
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:01,280
wonky and to know that there are these teachings

46
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:08,400
for finding our peace is phenomenal lucky to have

47
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:15,360
them so to sit with appreciation and not so much spending a

48
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,919
lot of time thinking about it but just enough thinking about

49
00:05:20,919 --> 00:05:28,600
appreciation that something in you begins to smile maybe it's your mouth maybe it's

50
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:34,479
your heart maybe it's somewhere in your whole

51
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:40,720
torso maybe it's in your eyes to

52
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,520
appreciate the goodness that's here the Good Fortune that's brought us to this

53
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:53,039
moment these moments even if wider moments of the day are not so

54
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:01,560
fortunate and doing this appreciation can allow something to settle that's the hope some kind of attention we carry can

55
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:08,720
be put to rest for a few minutes so assuming a meditation

56
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:19,680
posture and maybe find a posture today that has a minimum amount of pain

57
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,120
or discomfort find one that is comfortable

58
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,280
for you so it's easier to appreciate being in a

59
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:38,360
body the body that becomes the home or the temple for

60
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,080
meditation gently closing your

61
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,039
eyes

62
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:01,039
and and as you breathe in you are particip ating in a

63
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:08,599
phenomenal Global process of the oxygen

64
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:15,479
Cycles we're doing our part to create carbon

65
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:25,840
dioxide that the trees and plants can use so they make oxygen so we may

66
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,919
live we can't just take and take take and

67
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:37,840
take we participate in this cycle of giving and

68
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:44,560
taking in so many ways our life is a process of giving and taking receiving

69
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:50,919
and giving and now as we breathe we're

70
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:56,159
participating in a wider process than just our own

71
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:02,159
life but which keep which keeps our life

72
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,560
going taking a few long deep

73
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:13,198
breaths relaxing on the

74
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:31,800
exhale and letting your breathing return inter

75
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:49,480
normal and see if you can

76
00:08:50,519 --> 00:09:01,160
now listen quietly feel in a deep sensitive way

77
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:09,839
to a place inside where all things are

78
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:16,240
good is there a place deep inside below the level of

79
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:24,519
your thoughts and preoccupations past and future just here

80
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:29,320
now maybe in your breathing

81
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:39,680
maybe in your heart maybe in a back corner of the

82
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:49,079
heart maybe somewhere else in your torso maybe low down the base of your

83
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,360
spine the length of your

84
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:06,240
spine and if there is a place of goodness of peace or quiet or

85
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:14,200
calm breathe with it breathe with

86
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,200
appreciation breathe with gratitude

87
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:38,120
and maybe with a small smile on your lips breathe with

88
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
joy

for e

103
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,080
if you can give yourself over

fully to the rhythm of breathing breathing in and breathing

105

what animates the

107
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:25,720
breathing a joy that comes when

108
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:30,720
we give ourselves fully to one

109
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:37,440
thing in a relaxed soft

110
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640

e for

123
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:41,039
and then as we come to the end of this

124
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:50,760
sitting to reflect a little bit how easy it is to be self

125
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,360
centered how easy it is to see the

126
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:03,080
world as if field of opposition me versus

127
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:11,200
you you or me but coming out of meditation there's

128
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:18,320
no indic no orientation for this it's all in a certain

129
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:26,880
way a Cooperative field where we're all kin all working

130
00:27:26,919 --> 00:27:32,399
together and think one of the advantages of coming out of a less centered

131
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:40,240
Place through meditation is to be able to appreciate

132
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:45,840
others not just care for them not just wish them

133
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:54,398
well but appreciate what's going well to celebrate with them when they're

134
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:02,240
celebrating to reflect back what's good when what they do is

135
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:10,159
good the ability to share in a delight in the success and well-being

136
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:15,360
and goodness of others is one of the great joys of

137
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:23,200
life and people appreciate being appreciated people appreciate being

138
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:30,360
recognized in a certain way we put promote the

139
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:37,000
Good by appreciating the good and may it be as we come out of

140
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:43,279
meditation today that we consider going into the

141
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:50,480
world of our family and friends neighbors strangers people in stores

142
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:58,159
places of work ready to appreciate them

143
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:04,480
maybe having spent some time reflecting about the people who do good

144
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:08,360
things are helpful

145
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:17,960
supportive who do a good job makes it easier for everyone else whatever it might

146
00:29:19,519 --> 00:29:24,679
be may we

147
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:31,159
appreciate the happiness of others may we appreciate the way others care

148
00:29:31,159 --> 00:29:38,720
for people may we appreciate the integrity and honesty with which people live that

149
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:47,120
helps others to feel comfortable with them may we appreciate how others help

150
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:53,720
people who are suffering and may that appreciation of

151
00:29:53,720 --> 00:30:00,240
others bring us Delight May It Be inspiration for

152
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:06,640
us may it continue to awaken what is good in our own

153
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:11,720
Hearts may all beings be

154
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:25,220
[Music]

155
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,960
happy thank you for

156
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:18,000
so hello my friends and welcome to this fourth talk on the aspects of love I

157
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,519
feel pretty fortunate to be able to talk on this topic brings me

158
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:31,639
joy and uh the first day was ANUK which I translated as care and it's a care that is deeply

159
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:37,559
connected to respect for others I like to think of it as a respect where we see

160
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:42,720
everyone as kin that maybe we're not directly family

161
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:50,399
but we're kin we're related we're part of a global family and

162
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:56,679
um and that kinship then leads us to want to be friendly inclines us to be

163
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:04,279
friendly to however we meet why would anybody be an enemy why would anybody be someone who we would not be happy to see

164
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:10,480
just happy to see people maybe that's what friendliness is and um and offer some of our

165
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,720
happiness to them in our way we say hello or maybe that's all it is

166
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:22,200
I and then um and then when people

167
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:28,360
suffer uh to want to help to have be motivated to see their suffering end

168
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,559
they're kins of course we want it to end so if we can we may do something if we

169
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:41,320
can't we then we uh we are a witness we are we recognize we help people not feel

170
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:48,159
so alone we accompany and then today it's when

171
00:32:48,159 --> 00:32:53,639
people are having success when people are doing good things when people are

172
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:58,679
happy themselves when things are going well for them we we don't want to end up

173
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:05,519
being envious or jealous but rather when we're kin this openness this respect that we're happy

174
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:11,399
to see people uh uh when people are having

175
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:17,840
success we feel Joy we feel happiness to feel that happiness to take time for

176
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:25,000
that to not Overlook it to not race Beyond it but but to

177
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:30,799
appreciate and in Buddhism there's a whole medit ation practice on appreciative

178
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:38,080
Joy where we just kind of focus on the well-being that other people have may

179
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:43,679
that well-being continue May that well-being fill

180
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:52,120
me with inspiration with joy may this well-being of others spread

181
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:57,360
out through the world so different ways of kind of highlighting but the idea is

182
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:05,760
to take the one way to do this is the words another way is to take the feeling of appreciation of joy and let it

183
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:11,760
radiate and that takes time you have to pause a little bit not just kind of Rush

184
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:18,118
on with the conversation to something else um someone tells you that they're really happy and you say oh that's I'm

185
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:24,638
so happy for that but you know I'm having I'm really challenged with my car my car is not behaving properly and and

186
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,280
you've kind of changed the subject to something it wasn't necessary to talk about or in a right away it was not

187
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:36,320
necessary but to stay and linger to appreciate make room for that

188
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,358
and sometimes people uh it's invaluable for people to really feel they were

189
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:49,280
heard really feel like you're there for them that you make space for them to make more come out tell me more this is

190
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,599
so good that you graduated from high school this must be really great that you accomplish this tell me

191
00:34:55,599 --> 00:35:04,320
more and um but so this idea of appreciative joy joy in the joy of

192
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,160
others can be cultivated and developed in the process of all these forms of

193
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:17,320
Love they can coexist with their kind of opposites where the things interfere with them and part of the value of

194
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:25,079
practicing them or bringing them up and reflecting on them and letting them be a guide through our day is that it

195
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:30,280
sometimes can highlight the opposite highlight the things that interfere with

196
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:36,839
these things so what inter what for you interferes with appreciative joy and the

197
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:44,040
joy of others so I mentioned U Envy or jealousy which uh can be quite strong

198
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:50,079
and quite a current strong current in some people's lives and so then we would

199
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:56,400
uh in mindfulness practice we wouldn't berate ourselves for that or criticize ourselves for that but we do something

200
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:02,839
more important and that is we would study it we would take a good look at that what's that about uh what are the

201
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:08,480
emotions that come along with jealousy and envy what's the sense of self what's

202
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,599
the belief system that's operating can we sit and just feel that for a while uh

203
00:36:14,599 --> 00:36:21,599
accompany ourselves in those feelings because accompaniment is so powerful ACC

204
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:27,400
competent let's let allows something to settle or what is what else gets in the

205
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:34,720
way of appreciative Joy it might be um your own desires your own

206
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:39,760
preoccupations that uh you want to get what you want and uh you don't have time

207
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:45,760
to take it other people into account it could be fear it could be fear that if

208
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,160
you take in and appreciate others take in their joy that you make it makes you

209
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:57,880
susceptible to be taken advantage of or people want more from you or or uh you

210
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:03,280
know something might happen or maybe it uh highlights your own

211
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:09,800
unhappiness because if you really recognize happiness in others then you feel worse about your own and how your

212
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:16,640
life is difficult I'd like to propose the opposite that appreciating the joy in

213
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:23,119
others can be an inspiration for us food for us to be able to then practice with

214
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:30,560
our own difficulties so appreciative Joy is not meant to be a distraction from our own

215
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:37,960
suffering from our own difficulties but rather uh uh create the amb ambience in

216
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:43,599
which we easier to focus on our own to be present for our own to give a wider

217
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,760
context for it in some ways that appreciative joy to

218
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:55,440
others is probably not going to make you um panish because in Buddhist practice

219
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:03,040
um what comes up clearly uh is an emphasis on suffering but not to drown ourselves in

220
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:10,440
suffering but to find Freedom from suff suffering so in this emphasis on

221
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:18,040
suffering I don't think you have to worry about being poly Anish um if the others are suffering then you don't want

222
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:24,240
to paint it over with joy and make them kind of kind of show things on the

223
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,760
bright sh side for other people or even for yourself as a way of ignoring the

224
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,720
difficulties are going on but when things are going good when things are go

225
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:42,240
delightful for people that uh they're happy be share that happiness accompany

226
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:48,760
that happiness take time to take it in just take time to say wow that's

227
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:54,640
great uh in a way that brings a smile to your face in a way that brings you kind

228
00:38:54,640 --> 00:39:01,640
of to light and uh it's phenomenal uh how great this

229
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:07,880
appreciative Joy can be in us and sometimes it can feel that you're the one who's benefiting from it more than

230
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:13,560
the other person uh maybe it sets free something inside a flow of joy of

231
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:19,839
delight of happiness because you've become an open channel for

232
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:26,880
um for for these wonderful feelings and uh it's sometimes uh people

233
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:33,440
who doing meditation on appreciative Joy will feel kind of shivering or shivering

234
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:40,200
right word but a wonderful uh vibrating feeling of joy

235
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:47,839
and Delight that courses through them uh when the appreciating Joy is so

236
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:53,520
strong and um so appreciative

237
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:59,400
joy and uh so people this during this holiday

238
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:04,480
time there's a lot of joy in seeing each other and being together with each

239
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:12,400
other share in that Joy Delight in that Joy celebrate that Joy toast that

240
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,040
joy and on the holidays also there's many people who suffer more that uh

241
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:23,280
people feel left out or lonely or something so that also should get our

242
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,359
care and our love appreciating them and not to uh rub it in for them by

243
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:35,640
emphasizing The Joy when they're not having it maybe then we emphasize calm

244
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:40,680
attention calm Lo loving compassionate

245
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:46,440
attention and so the care we have for others is something that's morphing and shifting and

246
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:54,280
changing sometimes it's compassion sometimes it's friendliness loving kindness sometimes it's uh appreciative

247
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:00,760
joy and one of the great joys one of the great aspects of this practice is the

248
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:06,040
fluidity by which we can shift and change move between them and there's a

249
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:11,079
way that to allow each of these to have their own time and maybe even become

250
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:16,400
strong uh allows us to uh Let It Fade Away as we move into a different

251
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:23,520
circumstance and the another one is needed we can be friendly with

252
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:28,599
someone you know for a while we go to another place and we're we have

253
00:41:28,599 --> 00:41:34,640
compassion we shift we go someplace else to be with someone else and they're joyful and we

254
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:40,599
then kind of shift with it we morph we meet the circumstance not because

255
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:46,560
we're rejecting or being dis unloyal to the people who were suffering when we

256
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:54,680
feel Joy but rather we're just in a sense loyal or present for how it is

257
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:01,440
now and each time being appropriate for this circumstance not carrying past

258
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:07,839
circumstances with us and so this fluidity between these different states

259
00:42:07,839 --> 00:42:13,359
care kindness compassion and appreciative

260
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:19,640
Joy uh the more we're fluid the more we're not stuck in any one of them the more these can live in our lives in a

261
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:27,838
wonderful way feeding us in a way that they're always available

262
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:34,440
and um much more available Than People Avail themselves for these are

263
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,960
Treasures the Buddha called the Brahma viharas a practitioner's wealth so if

264
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:46,599
you want to be wealthy these are these are the real wealth is to have these

265
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:55,839
wonderful qualities so then tomorrow we'll finish with uh equanimous love and um so may

266
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:01,720
you in the meantime look for opportunities today to either

267
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:07,319
privately in yourself so no one knows or out loud to

268
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:13,599
appreciate uh the goodness the joy the success of other people make that a

269
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:19,520
theme um see what happens if you accompany PE ACC company or open

270
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:25,680
recognize people for their joy and their happiness and may it bring you Joy may

271
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:31,200
you be Delight lighted by all the success and goodness

272
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:37,160
that there is in this world for all the all the terrible news we

273
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:44,440
get I suspect there's more goodness every day than uh than what is difficult

274
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:53,200
and and painful thank you very much
