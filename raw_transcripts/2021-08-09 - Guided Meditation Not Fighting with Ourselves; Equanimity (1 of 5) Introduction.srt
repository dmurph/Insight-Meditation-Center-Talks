8
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:03,520
the custom around these parts and we'll we will um

9
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:10,080
sit together for about half hour and then i'll offer some some reflections on

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:14,560
a theme this week and

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,759
yeah yeah so i know gill left off with um

12
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:31,680
three weeks on on greed hate delusion and um and uh freedom from non-delusion

13
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:41,680
from from delusion uh was the the friday talk and theme and um

14
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:50,159
yeah and this week uh i'll be be exploring uh the the theme of equanimity equanimity

15
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:56,240
uh woven into uh really the fabric of our of our practice and so much of the

16
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,799
goodness that unfolds and so as we as we sit we'll

17
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:08,959
practice the way one of my teachers put it

18
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,120
shenzhen young is will practice uh sort of the

19
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,280
non non interference with the arising of sensory experience

20
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,520
yeah the the nervous system not fighting with itself

21
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:36,000
and yeah we can actually get a feel for that what it is like to

22
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:44,560
not be in contention with ourselves not be in contention with experience to give a kind of

23
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,879
radical permission for phenomena to to arise

24
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,440
and pass to give it our blessing

25
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:05,840
so uh yeah finding a posture that is uh sustainable for you

26
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,920
just feeling

27
00:03:56,640 --> 00:04:15,840
that upright axis of the spine

28
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,800
the rest of the body hanging loosely

29
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:43,840
from that uh gently upward reaching spine

30
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:40,080
and remember this crucial aspiration of our practice we

31
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:53,840
practice for ourselves and for others

32
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,599
we cultivate our own heart such that

33
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:21,840
we become a cause of more joy more safety less suffering in the world

34
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:44,240
the attitude we take the attitude in line with this theme of equanimity

35
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:53,120
this is a kind of um deep non-violence towards

36
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,840
the whole of our experience

37
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:24,319
wherever it feels like two solid objects colliding

38
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:38,720
the solidity of some ache and the solidity of a contracted mind wherever it feels

39
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,800
like a collision we soften

40
00:09:49,200 --> 00:10:05,839
awareness like space

41
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:45,680
this means we can't get what greed wants we can't get

42
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:48,959
what hatred wants

43
00:11:50,959 --> 00:11:58,399
we renounce the objects of clinging

44
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:10,480
when we make peace with the

45
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:25,839
imperfection the human condition

46
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:39,840
the forces of of grasping

47
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:53,840
have been a source of agitation forever

48
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:07,840
source of kind of inner friction friction in our own nervous system

49
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:19,520
so we give up the fight at least

50
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:35,200
for this moment

51
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:49,840
relax the body relax the mind

52
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:11,519
even though equanimity is known for its its coolness

53
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:20,399
it actually deepens the poignancy of life

54
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:31,679
makes our heart more rather than less responsive to suffering

55
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:38,559
more rather than less responsive to joy

56
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:45,840
more attuned not less

57
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:14,179
[Music]

58
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
so

59
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:05,760
so um good morning to you all uh

60
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:13,600
welcome to those uh just just joining uh my name again is matthew and um

61
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,960
uh it's good too it's good to sit with you

62
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:26,159
um yeah i was listening to um to gill's

63
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,120
friday uh session just to see exactly where he uh he left off

64
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:41,840
and you know it struck me that gill he makes teaching look so easy

65
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:49,679
and i make it look really hard but that's the situation

66
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:56,159
i'm uh no no problem with that either i'm happy to

67
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,840
to be with you all and i trust we'll we'll uh feel each other's hearts and

68
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:05,840
that'll be uh that'll be plenty

69
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:13,440
so um sometimes people say uh you know

70
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:21,919
about their practice you know matthew i'm paying attention on being mindful and everything is still terrible

71
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:25,679
you know and

72
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:34,559
it's important to to acknowledge that that simply using our attention

73
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:41,039
doesn't generate wisdom attention in other words is not a

74
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:47,279
um is not not necessarily wholesome in itself or unwholesome yeah

75
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:55,039
it's we're using our attention all of the time it is the kind of most basic currency

76
00:32:55,039 --> 00:33:01,360
of um of of uh human beings you know the most

77
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:07,519
basic resource and we want to use it wisely we want to use our

78
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:13,760
attention wisely appropriately and wise attention

79
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:20,960
means that it's it's connected to to wholesomeness yeah it's conjoined

80
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:28,080
with wholesomeness it's conjoined with among other things equanimity

81
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,440
what i was alluding to and

82
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:41,679
more and more it feels like equanimity is a kind of like

83
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:50,080
the foundation for this path you know um that this path as gil said as he left

84
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:56,240
off with this path is about non-clinging and non-clinging is very

85
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:04,960
closely related to equanimity non-clinging is very closely related to equanimity

86
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,919
with um not getting the promises that craving makes

87
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:20,800
yeah not getting the promises that greed makes that that hatred makes yeah

88
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,480
and so um sometimes it's defined as a kind of inner balance

89
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,240
and and the way i i tend to think about it

90
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:37,839
is it's um it's a non-compulsion

91
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:44,158
around our preferences yeah there there's no compulsion to act out

92
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:51,679
our preferences we may still have preferences but there's not a kind of compulsion to

93
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,240
enact them in the world to live out this greed to live out this

94
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:03,359
hate and that can refer even to just how

95
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:11,280
the way we act out greed and aversion hatred in our sitting

96
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:18,480
yeah the kind of way we're subtly lured into

97
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:27,040
um imagining that this moment can somehow be fixed yeah that sense of like the moment

98
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:33,119
can be fixed we relinquish that

99
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:40,800
and so we may still have preferences but um but we're not feeling so

100
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,838
compelled to enact them

101
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:56,000
sarah lazar and her colleagues describe equanimity as a kind of a widening of of the perspective

102
00:35:56,000 --> 00:36:01,280
more readily engaging incoming sensory information

103
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:07,359
and disengaging kind of cognitive and emotional

104
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:12,560
reactivity yeah so widening the perspective that

105
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:20,240
in our clinging clinging is always claustrophobic yeah it's always claustrophobic

106
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:26,480
everything feels hemmed in pinched

107
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:35,200
we widen our perspective rather than uh solidity meeting solidity

108
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:42,400
we it's it's maybe like solidity meeting space yeah

109
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:48,240
this ache meeting the space of awareness

110
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:56,240
and we're relinquishing maybe renouncing the kind of

111
00:36:56,240 --> 00:37:04,720
defensive coping strategies that we have to deal with the imperfection of the moment

112
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:12,000
so um the one of my teachers shenzhen young

113
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,680
described it as the balance point equanimity is the balance point between suppression on the one hand

114
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:23,280
and identification on the other

115
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:31,040
michelle mcdonald i believe said um equanimity is is uh is the courage of

116
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,720
low expectations which is very funny um the courage of low

117
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:43,520
expectations and i think she would add the courage of low expectations but

118
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:47,839
very high aspirations yeah

119
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:56,079
in a way i don't want to give one definition we'll sort of unfold a range of definitions over the

120
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:02,160
course of the week because something like equanimity has

121
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:09,599
many many flavors many facets and so hopefully rather than starting with some

122
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:19,599
simple reductionistic idea of exactly what it is we live into it we practice into it

123
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:25,440
and it takes a lot of equanimity just to open to

124
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:33,838
the human condition you know to the intensity of the human condition

125
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:43,760
to dukkha to suffering in a way even after all of these years

126
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:50,480
every time dukkha arises it feels a little bit like this freak

127
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:57,520
accident you know it's like i still haven't fully acclimatized to the first

128
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:04,079
noble truth you know it just has this feel of like the universe is off its rails

129
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:11,200
and it's like no matthew you just stubbed your toe you know it's woven into the fabric of

130
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:19,760
of uh existence and to actually open to that is no

131
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:26,640
joke it's no joke yeah to really begin to appreciate

132
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:33,040
what is this this inner life and or our outer world this

133
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:42,480
this entails a measure of equanimity otherwise it's too much it's too much so we open

134
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:50,320
now maybe i say all of this and um you think like

135
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:57,200
ugh you know like equanimity it sounds tiring yeah sounds

136
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,280
tiring and

137
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:10,400
i want to kind of celebrate equanimity as it's it's very generative very

138
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:17,839
generative it is so closely tied to peace to love to

139
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:24,079
release and so this is the focus of

140
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:33,119
of the week so the the last weeks as i said go had

141
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:38,800
done on greed hate and delusion the the kind of wellsprings of

142
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:46,240
self-generated suffering and um and even enlightenment itself is is

143
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:54,960
sometimes described as the absence of greed and delusion and what i want to begin

144
00:40:54,960 --> 00:41:01,920
this week with is to say that uh to work skillfully with these forces with the

145
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:09,440
defilements with grenade and delusion this requires equanimity yeah

146
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:14,880
and uh in a way the the greed the hatred

147
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:22,240
are readily uh observable right the greed the kind of

148
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:29,520
um that hole in the heart like we um try to

149
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,580
to get what we think we want and we act out that um

150
00:41:35,580 --> 00:41:43,680
[Music] that craving so often but um but craving

151
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:50,319
always over promises yeah what we get never actually

152
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:56,480
satiates the craving but compounds it

153
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:03,200
we might get some fleeting something but it actually deepens the habit of

154
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:08,640
acting out craving and so we want to begin to see

155
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:15,440
how the objects of greed the fantasy of what i get when i get what i want

156
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,480
it's always over promises

157
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:30,880
so we develop equanimity with longing that's very tender

158
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:39,200
it's very tender if hatred um

159
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:48,480
if you haven't noticed there's uh there's always something wrong something can always be better

160
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,839
and so we develop equanimity with imperfection

161
00:42:55,280 --> 00:43:02,000
and so if greed is the kind of hole in the center of your being and hatred

162
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,680
feels like your heart is on fire what is delusion

163
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:14,960
well delusion feels exactly like the truth

164
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:23,040
until it doesn't so the question how do we see

165
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:30,079
what we can't see and what i would say is that delusion

166
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:38,720
yeah for sure is more subtle than greed or hatred but delusion launders our greed

167
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:46,000
and launders our hatred it serves to justify and dignify

168
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:54,640
the forces of greed and hatred when we launder money

169
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:01,680
i through some criminal enterprise i get money and then i make it clean

170
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:09,440
running it through some legitimate business right when you launder greed you make it look

171
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:16,240
like hope and fun and excitement when you launder hatred you

172
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:23,839
clean it to make it look like righteousness like clarity like discernment

173
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:31,040
this like uh the delusion serves to um obscure

174
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:38,640
the greed and the hatred and so the invitation is to

175
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:45,520
if we can have equanimity with greed with hatred we do not have to build

176
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:53,599
and fabricate and proliferate the stories and perceptions that launder

177
00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:02,480
that dignify our defilements yeah we develop equanimity with

178
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,760
greed with aversion and this makes the kind of delusion that serves to make

179
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:17,760
that disappear to make it look like wisdom to make it look like fun yeah

180
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:25,119
we no longer need to um enact that delusion but it starts

181
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:32,960
with the equanimity with these these pushes and pulls on the heart

182
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:40,640
