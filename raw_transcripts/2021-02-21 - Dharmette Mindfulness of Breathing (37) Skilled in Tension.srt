1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:03,120
so

2
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,320
in doing uh this buddhist path

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,519
doing meditation practice

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,720
it's certainly helpful to relax

5
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,080
to calm the places that are over

6
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,640
activated to relax the places that are

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:27,519
overly tense

8
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
to bring tranquility to the ways in

9
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,600
which we're

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,199
anxious or agitated

11
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,960
and sometimes then the emphasis emphasis

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,640
is on the relaxation

13
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,719
on the rel on the calming

14
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,440
but one of the things that's very

15
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:51,039
important to

16
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,559
develop on this path of practice

17
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,280
is a skill is a heightened sensitivity

18
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,039
to the tension to the agitation

19
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,760
to the the ways in which we

20
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,000
uh

21
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,719
get tense

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,240
and the reason for that is that we want

23
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,240
to become skilled at we want to be able

24
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,759
to recognize it well

25
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,119
and clearly so that it becomes something

26
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:25,520
we

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,960
pick up early as it begins

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:30,880
or so that we become more aware of the

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,960
more subtle ways in which

30
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,479
we get caught and cling if we're only

31
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,759
focusing on the relaxation and the calm

32
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,640
we might not become experts at

33
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,079
perceiving attention

34
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,680
and now all the tensions we feel

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,159
tension in the body not maybe i

36
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,840
shouldn't say all but most of it

37
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,719
probably represents some way that the

38
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,479
mind is clinging to something

39
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,799
it's fixated on something it's pushing

40
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,840
on something

41
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,160
in the mind and the much of the physical

42
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,800
tension that we have represents

43
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,440
something deeper in the mind

44
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,480
and the surface tensions of the mind

45
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,239
that we might feel when we're really you

46
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:20,560
know anxious or upset

47
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,440
or tense around something also

48
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:25,200
represents probably something deeper in

49
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,400
the mind some deeper

50
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,120
place of holding of clinging of

51
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,519
attachment

52
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,280
and so even though it may be talking

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,560
about physical relaxation

54
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,160
what we're relaxing is something that

55
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,000
has its source

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,680
in the mind deep in the mind the

57
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,840
clinging in the mind

58
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,080
and so the idea is to start becoming

59
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,920
more sensitive

60
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:51,120
to clinging to tension and that has many

61
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,319
benefits

62
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,800
one is that it can help us go further

63
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,239
and further and deeper and deeper into

64
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:57,920
practice because we've gotten used to

65
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,560
we've gotten

66
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,280
familiar with all little ways that that

67
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,360
clinging appears in our body and mind

68
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:05,200
and heart

69
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,560
but also we can

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,040
it's also a protection for ourselves

71
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,840
that it protects our practice because

72
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:19,440
it's very easy

73
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,159
to practice with tension practice with

74
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,440
attachment

75
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,080
and we don't see it so i mean

76
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,440
paradoxically a person

77
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,480
could get the instructions just relax

78
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,080
your tension

79
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,760
and they get so serious about the

80
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,440
relaxing and that

81
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,159
they tense up around let's do let's have

82
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,840
to really do it well here

83
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,319
the teacher says to relax and by golly

84
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,760
i'm going to relax i'm going to be the

85
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,120
best relaxer

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,640
anywhere and then we relax certainly we

87
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,720
relax part of the body but the mind has

88
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,080
gotten tense in the effort to push

89
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,879
anything any instruction people get in

90
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,080
practice

91
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,280
we can get attached to the instruction

92
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
any idea of what might happen in

93
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,360
practice we get attached to

94
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,840
wanting that to happen or attached to

95
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
somehow clinging

96
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,920
kind of a negative clinging to oh that's

97
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,680
not happening to me it's not possible

98
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,080
for me

99
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:16,720
that doesn't relate to me or that's not

100
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,919
right

101
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,759
so there can be this tension is holding

102
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,040
on to that

103
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,400
in a way that limits our freedom

104
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,600
and so if we start becoming skilled

105
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,800
at recognizing tension then we recognize

106
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,360
the very

107
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,000
tension that's involved in how we

108
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,600
practice what we're looking for

109
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,479
wanting to have happen in practice and

110
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,400
so it becomes a protection

111
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,000
that we're not ahead of ourselves in

112
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,520
practice that we're not trying to make

113
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,880
something happen or

114
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,120
expect something to happen that's not

115
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,479
actually what is happening

116
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,880
the default is always to come back to

117
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,759
what is happening

118
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,199
and in doing that again we recognize

119
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:03,840
maybe how we're tense

120
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,880
recognize the pushing the striving the

121
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,600
contraction that might be there and then

122
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,000
as we

123
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,880
let go of that then there's an influence

124
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,880
that has on us

125
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,120
and part of this recognizing tension

126
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,520
deeper and deeper is that we can

127
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,840
recognize what is not

128
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:26,479
tension we can recognize the impact that

129
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,000
has on us to let go

130
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,600
to soften to relax and we can recognize

131
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,080
that there's

132
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,960
more happening here than the tension

133
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,520
i've certainly had the experience of

134
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,600
being overly concerned with my tension

135
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,440
in my body and mind

136
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,479
that or overly concerned with something

137
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,360
i'm supposed to do

138
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,560
like focus on the breathing that i

139
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,199
didn't notice that in the wider picture

140
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,479
of what's going on

141
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,960
there was in fact some subtleness some

142
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,479
calmness some

143
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,360
uh peacefulness some actually some some

144
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,440
very subtle kind of delight and just

145
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,360
being here

146
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,759
and i was so fixated and concerned with

147
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,680
my preoccupation

148
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,000
and so this idea of relaxing and opening

149
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,160
the attention to feel the influence of

150
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,240
relaxation the influence of

151
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,199
tranquility allows us to feel some of

152
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,360
the other goodness that's here

153
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,280
some of the other things that are

154
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:26,479
actually going well for us

155
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,319
and and this is

156
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,000
the because as as

157
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,280
this anapanasati deepens we want to

158
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:40,160
uh broaden the attention to take in the

159
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,080
bigger picture as well

160
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,680
of what's happening so the joy

161
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,600
and the happiness of practice the

162
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,720
contentment

163
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,240
belongs to this kind of little bit

164
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,759
bigger picture

165
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,360
and it might be subtle nothing dramatic

166
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,120
and we might then get fixated get

167
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,800
attached to having joy

168
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,440
attached to having happiness and or

169
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,720
disappointed that we don't have it

170
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,080
and that's tension and if we

171
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,319
again if we are skilled at looking at

172
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,639
tension we'll catch it right away

173
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,840
so it doesn't trip us up oh there's

174
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:16,800
tension

175
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,639
maybe rather than looking for joy i

176
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,319
should look for i should really spend

177
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,720
time

178
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,440
feeling that tension so he can relax it

179
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:25,039
can soften

180
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,919
or let me not be limited by the tension

181
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,080
let me kind of uh

182
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,160
open up the attention wide or not in a

183
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,759
fixated way

184
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,880
but in an open relaxed way

185
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,319
and so the um

186
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,639
and then but then as we open if we do

187
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,879
feel some of the goodness of the

188
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,199
relaxation some of the goodness of

189
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,840
the practice that's occurring uh i think

190
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,240
of it as the atmosphere

191
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,039
uh the or the mood of a room or the

192
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,680
atmosphere of a situation we're in we

193
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,280
we can go into i've gone into some

194
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,199
places and the atmosphere is clearly

195
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:04,639
peaceful and i feel like i'm being

196
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,560
washed in peacefulness

197
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,800
i go into other atmospheres of your

198
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,319
social atmospheres and just feels

199
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:11,440
immediately feels very

200
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,240
tense the whole thing so the kind of the

201
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,319
atmosphere within us

202
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,879
and and take in the atmosphere of the

203
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,240
goodness

204
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,960
even if it's subtle and breathe with

205
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,479
that

206
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,520
not to deny other things not to lose our

207
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,840
ability to notice when we get tense or

208
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:30,800
tight or

209
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,159
contracted or resistant or

210
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,440
all the different expressions of

211
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,440
clinging but as a way

212
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,959
of creating a nice atmosphere

213
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,200
that supports the further letting go of

214
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,159
clinging

215
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,080
that gives us confidence that gives us

216
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,360
some sense of

217
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,920
the rightness of the moment as opposed

218
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,920
to it's so easy to focus on the

219
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,600
wrongness of the moment

220
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,720
some people are really experts at this

221
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,600
and and this is not to make a polyanis

222
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,279
view everything is good

223
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,000
but it's to create an atmosphere that

224
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
allows us to hold and be with the

225
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,200
difficulties

226
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
in a way that we don't get fixated or

227
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,200
cling to them

228
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,320
or resist them too tightly

229
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,640
so all this is a way of saying that part

230
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,040
of what we were doing in this practice

231
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,720
is becoming an expert on tension

232
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,480
and so even though if the emphasis might

233
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,519
be on relaxing

234
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,600
don't become tense because you're trying

235
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,320
to relax or because you can't relax

236
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,440
keep remembering that recognizing and

237
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,200
learning to feel

238
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,240
sense and becoming more of a connoisseur

239
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,240
all the different flavors and textures

240
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,440
of tension

241
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,399
of clinging of holding of attachment is

242
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,000
actually a very important part of the

243
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,440
practice

244
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,440
and the so you want to take some time to

245
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,880
feel it and get to know it

246
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,680
and and not to be in a hurry to relax or

247
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,320
not

248
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,760
not in a hurry to to get rid of anything

249
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,079
that's uncomfortable

250
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:04,560
because the lesson of what you what you

251
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,600
learn

252
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,600
by really feeling it fully

253
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,160
is you learn how to be prepared better

254
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,519
for next time

255
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,399
how to catch it earlier how to protect

256
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,320
yourself from being caught in it

257
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,680
next time so

258
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,560
part of this buddhist path is to become

259
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,079
skilled

260
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,120
intention not skilled in tensing

261
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,360
um because we don't want to be you know

262
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,160
learn better how to tense

263
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,640
but uh skilled and recognizing tension

264
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,399
and seeing it when it's there seeing it

265
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,279
sometimes almost when it's beginning

266
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,800
and the last thing i'll say about this

267
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,560
is that importance of not confusing

268
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,120
tension with intentness

269
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,240
sometimes there's an intentness that has

270
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,959
a certain energy and engagement

271
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:04,000
that um and wholeheartedness

272
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,399
that doesn't have the quality of

273
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:08,480
limitation or

274
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,560
or debilitation that tension or clinging

275
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,519
has

276
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,240
but it's really present there can be

277
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:19,040
intentness of the body and tentness

278
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,279
of the mind i'm here this is what i'm

279
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,160
doing i'm involved in this

280
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,839
but there's no tension there's maybe a

281
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:28,959
tautness but no

282
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,320
contraction or tentness

283
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:35,760
and um so because sometimes people when

284
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,120
they hear relax

285
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,360
relax their intentness they relax their

286
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,240
healthy tautness and they become moved

287
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,320
towards becoming just a

288
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,240
slouch just kind of move towards

289
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,360
becoming just a

290
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,480
you know too limp to really

291
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,279
let the vitality or practice operate

292
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,519
so certainly

293
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:04,639
relaxing calming becoming tranquil

294
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:08,480
peaceful is a support for this practice

295
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,200
but don't overlook the important work of

296
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,320
becoming skilled at recognizing tension

297
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,800
and um and maybe take some delight and

298
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,720
satisfaction

299
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,920
as you become more and more connoisseur

300
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,440
of all the different ways that you're

301
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,200
tense and rather

302
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,120
being disappointed when you see it you

303
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,240
say oh fantastic

304
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,160
i get to study this and get to know it

305
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,279
better

306
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,240
it's not so pleasant right now to the

307
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,160
tension in and of itself

308
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,959
but in the long term i'm much better off

309
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,639
to really

310
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:46,079
become the student of tension before i

311
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,360
focus too much on relaxing

312
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,760
so thank you and uh
