1
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,758
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:20,720
and uh

3
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:30,599
when my children were young we had this children's book

4
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:38,160
that had drawings that um were magnifications of 10

5
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,980
and these these books would start with um I think they went different

6
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:51,000
directions maybe they'd start but one common one was would start like far out in space and

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,340
maybe see the world in the middle of our

8
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,160
our solar system Maybe or a Galaxy

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:08,540
and then each page would take a power of 10 closer in until just the world

10
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:15,240
then just that particular maybe continent and then get closer and it'd be just a

11
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,720
city and closer or just be the park in the city and then the lawn and the city and then

12
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:28,520
the grass and the few you know pieces of grass in the city and then going closer it would be

13
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,979
somehow a close-up of the cells and they go into the cells and

14
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:43,799
see pieces of the cells and maybe DNA and then go closer still and there would be molecules and atoms and

15
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:50,640
closer still and just the electrons and protons and in vast space and it was quite a

16
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,740
remarkable thing to kind of change the perspectives and see things in so many

17
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:01,619
different ways and meditation is can be a little bit the same way

18
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:09,119
and which direction we go varies and sometimes it's going inward

19
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,120
and to our vast space of just a few electrons and sometimes it's outwards

20
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:20,459
into a vast empty space in a galactic systems or

21
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:25,980
something and um and sometimes it's nice to have the idea

22
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:33,780
of going back and forth between these two different perspectives vast and you know large and very small and close

23
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:39,840
in and and but I think

24
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,319
starting where we're at as human beings and then nothing oftentimes meditation

25
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:51,660
is more like starting where we're at and learning to be fully present for where

26
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,879
we're at regardless where we are in the powers of ten

27
00:02:56,879 --> 00:03:04,440
but then as we relax and settle and quiet it's kind of like moving inwards

28
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:13,019
and now it's becoming kind of closer and more intimate in here and until we're kind of powers of 10 and

29
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:20,220
just go in and end to come to a place we're the most intimate the most expansive the most freeing

30
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:27,480
is kind of like this vast space and and it feels like we're home in some

31
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:34,580
ways and then we return and come back to this human

32
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:42,019
perspective and and hopefully bring with us the freedom

33
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:49,700
so to take a alert upright posture

34
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:55,739
and lowering your gaze gently

35
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:00,500
letting your gaze be relaxed

36
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:12,720
and then to gently close your eyes and to begin here

37
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,120
at this human Realm

38
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,240
of your life here and in the place where you live maybe

39
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:30,419
surrounded by your neighborhood of maybe other Homes apartment buildings

40
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:36,660
Maybe you live early surrounded by fields or forests

41
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:42,660
mountains just kind of where you are

42
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:46,400
and the environment around you

43
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:57,000
maybe as far as you can walk for five minutes as if this too is part of your world

44
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,860
part of who you are in a sense

45
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:10,259
so here in the middle of this neighborhood this land under the sky

46
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:16,860
here you are in a sense sitting on the Earth

47
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,400
here

48
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,400
and then bring your attention in closer and if you're sitting in a room

49
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,800
be aware of sitting in a room this is the power of 10 maybe coming inward

50
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:41,460
or if you're sitting outside it just not what you can walk five minutes in any

51
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:50,479
direction to but here what you can see what you can feel around you

52
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,699
in Buddhism we have this idea that any of the location where someone

53
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:07,460
meditates is kind of like the Center of Your World

54
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,000
your experiential world the world of your perceptions

55
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,680
and if you come closer in to just hear in this body

56
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,800
feeling how this body connects to this place

57
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:33,960
the weight of the body full of gravity and where those meet in

58
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,740
the your cushion surfaces your body touches

59
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:47,580
here definitely hear this spot

60
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,500
the center of your universe

61
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:58,680
in this body that breathes and maybe as you breathe you feel the movements of

62
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:04,160
your chest and torso against your clothes

63
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:17,780
maybe you feel like whatever your hands are contacting your thighs your knees each other

64
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:36,419
hear this body that has been your companion one way or the

65
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:44,160
other for years now centering yourself in this body they

66
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:53,240
can give you long slow deep breaths relaxing into the body on the exhale

67
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:35,520
breathing normally and as you exhale with a normal breath

68
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:42,979
perhaps there can be a quieting a gentling of your thinking mind

69
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:53,120
maybe not dramatically but a little bit of a quieting

70
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,560
calming of the thinking mind

71
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:14,519
with a lot of thinking it's kind of easy to feel removed from

72
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:20,540
oneself one's body once lived experience

73
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:32,040
letting go of your thoughts they go into this living body

74
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,259
feeling it from the inside out

75
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:07,500
and maybe coming in closer power of 10 kind of movement

76
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:14,880
feeling the particular location in your body where you feel most you

77
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,040
most feel your sense of aliveness

78
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:34,800
the place in your body that most represents or is associated with

79
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,440
to living here in this moment

80
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:14,519
and perhaps if it's easy allow this location in your body

81
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:21,920
to be gently massaged rocked by the breathing

82
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:35,160
for the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out by the rhythm of the body moving as you

83
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,519
breathe

84
00:15:16,139 --> 00:15:24,320
as you exhale can you settle in let go into

85
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:30,500
deeper Within like a power of 10.

86
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,680
it's entering yourself

87
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:47,300
either at the center of where you're most alive

88
00:15:49,139 --> 00:15:55,800
or centering yourself where the breathing begins

89
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:03,720
where the breathing ends place in your body the ending and

90
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:06,680
beginning of breathing

91
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:34,620
like you're entering into a beautiful Grove of trees leaving the World Behind

92
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:39,380
enter into your depth of your body

93
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:43,639
leaving your thoughts behind

94
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:27,980
letting go of thoughts and letting go into

95
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,559
the quietest deepest place within

96
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,260
foreign

97
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:37,740
going inwards beneath your thoughts beneath your feelings

98
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:45,539
beneath it all is there some place of calm or peace

99
00:23:45,539 --> 00:23:52,760
that you can touch into at the center of it all

100
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:59,940
maybe it's a just a pinhead

101
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:08,340
in size someplace the powers are ten going in

102
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,320
of calm or peace

103
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:26,460
maybe of your breathing the rhythm of breathing move through that place

104
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:30,320
through the calm the peace

105
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:47,100
and as you inhale let that calm

106
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:54,419
become larger through your body as you inhale that your awareness spread

107
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:57,380
through your body

108
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:06,200
bringing with it to calm or the sense of spaciousness

109
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:17,658
expanding to the whole body

110
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:33,259
letting you be your awareness your

111
00:25:35,419 --> 00:25:42,480
conceiving spread out to include this room where the place you're sitting

112
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:51,620
maybe the inhale spreads the calm or the or the spaciousness out into the room

113
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:20,520
and then letting your awareness expand outward as if it can

114
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:28,279
reach out across the land around you the territory the neighborhood

115
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:37,399
bringing away that a sense of expanding calm

116
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,740
and visualizing or considering

117
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:04,020
The Wider land in which you are at out

118
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:11,120
as far as you can walk on a five minute walk maybe just out and expanding outwards

119
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:17,600
as if you're calm or your spaciousness

120
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:22,100
spans ever outwards

121
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:55,080
and powers of tan outwards across the the city the county the province

122
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:58,700
the state that you're in

123
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:07,580
and all the people that inhabit this area

124
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:17,419
in you as one of a multitude of people

125
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:23,120
but from your point of view you sit in the middle of the multitude

126
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:28,679
from your calm spaciousness

127
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:36,980
imagine your gaze upon all beings with kindness and friendliness

128
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:41,240
you wish them well

129
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:54,260
and taking powers of ten more broadly your powers of a hundred and

130
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,840
out into space looking back on this world

131
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:03,799
Planet floating in space

132
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:12,779
this Blue Marble with so many people on it

133
00:29:12,779 --> 00:29:19,440
so many beings who have this precious opportunity to be

134
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:24,980
alive and to be breathing and

135
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,940
okay is a component all kindly and friendly

136
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:47,480
wishing may all beings be happy

137
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:55,580
may all beings be safe

138
00:29:56,299 --> 00:30:03,799
may all beings be peaceful

139
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,840
and may all beings be free

140
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:30,019
[Music]

141
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,700
thank you

142
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:47,340
so welcome to the second talk

143
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:54,179
on a series of talks on the topic of meaning the meaning meaning making and

144
00:30:54,179 --> 00:31:01,919
relationship to meditation and one of the areas of that we

145
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:08,820
so first I want to say is Introduction that um there's a cliche that everyone is a

146
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:15,480
philosopher but they don't know it many people don't know it and what that

147
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:24,860
means I think is that everyone has um a set of interpretations meaning

148
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:30,240
understanding of what it means to be alive what's important what this life is

149
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,960
about that they operate from though sometimes it's not reflective

150
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:44,700
sometimes reflect they don't haven't thought about it haven't realized they're doing this and part of a path of mindfulness is

151
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:51,539
both to be reflective about this to be clear and conscious but also to discover what are some of the underlying

152
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:57,179
assumptions belief systems interpretations that we are basing our life on

153
00:31:57,179 --> 00:32:03,360
and as we said quietly in meditation it's possible to see these operate

154
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,520
and then also to question them some of them aren't really that helpful or

155
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:14,100
healthy for us and some of them are and be able to distinguish between which is useful and

156
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:20,039
not which seem accurate or not is part of the wonderful power of meditation of

157
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:27,299
mindfulness so one area that we can connect one area of meaning

158
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:33,539
making in connection to meditation is the our understanding

159
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:39,840
of what it means to be a self and what it means to have other people in relationship to a self

160
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:46,620
that there's a lot of philosophy a lot of ideas that come along with our

161
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:52,799
Notions of Who We Are and who who others are and what that connection is

162
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:58,980
I think a wonderful story around this was some years ago there was someone who

163
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:03,898
did a study of different

164
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:13,620
um meditation centers I think they're all in the United States but some of them were primarily

165
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:19,740
um the participants the meditators were

166
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:25,799
primarily um born and raised in the United States

167
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:33,120
I call acculturated in the United and then as local United States Yen's culture

168
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:40,080
and some were were acculturated in an Asian

169
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:47,279
culture that had a much stronger collectivist culture much strong sense

170
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:52,740
of communal sense of identity in who they are whereas the United States many

171
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:58,679
people who grew up in this culture have a much stronger sense of individuality in the individual

172
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:03,720
so researchers studied these two different meditation centers and asked

173
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:09,658
that the participants how was the retreat you did I think they both did you know set week-long Retreats or

174
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:16,618
something well how was the retreat and and uh and what did you gain or what was the benefits from the retreat

175
00:34:16,619 --> 00:34:24,658
and um and both groups loved the retreat that it was fantastic it was life-changing so that they had in common

176
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:30,480
but when they discussed uh what they benefited from them and what way it was so great

177
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,599
um in one way or the other the people who have been raised in this local

178
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:42,060
culture in the United States they

179
00:34:42,379 --> 00:34:47,398
emphasize that they discovered who they are they got a sense of real

180
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:52,980
Independence and freedom and all the reference points were very individualistic

181
00:34:52,980 --> 00:35:00,780
and um and those people who came from the Asian culture uh they said oh I realized how much

182
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:07,580
gratitude I have for my Society my family how deeply

183
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:12,780
connected we are and and um and I've you know I've appreciated so

184
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:18,780
much more all the benefits I've received from you know my Society my family my

185
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:23,820
everyone and and the sense of connection and gratitude and being part of

186
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:31,200
something was you know so powerful for me and I and so in many ways maybe they're having

187
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,619
similar you could say similar experience of settling getting concentrated

188
00:35:36,619 --> 00:35:42,599
becoming still letting go of hindrances but the meaning or the value that they

189
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:47,880
took out of the experience what they selected out of their experiences this is what is important

190
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:54,240
it was so very different one was very individualistic one was more about how they are in the collective

191
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:59,880
and so this speaks to how uh and often that's invisible that we make this

192
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,280
selection just seems like this is natural of course this is like isn't this what it's all about or

193
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:11,099
because the view we have about what's important is not just taken for granted

194
00:36:11,099 --> 00:36:17,220
it's built into the fabric of the universe that self is important than discovering the self

195
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:24,240
similar thing happened to me many years ago where I was on a panel and um with a Christian minister and I

196
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:31,500
was kind of like the Buddhist teacher minister and uh and they're also the person that

197
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:37,380
I was uh the panel that the person I was with was uh Asian Asian American and I

198
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:43,200
was you know you know represented people from the United States I guess

199
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:48,540
or Europe what kind of this individualist Norway where I'm from is very individualistic because maybe even

200
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:55,440
more so sometimes than the way we are in the United States and um

201
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,720
and we were asked you know what when you what brought you into Buddhism what were you or into your religion she was

202
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:07,380
Christian and um and uh I for me I was kind of Happily matter of factly as if there was

203
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:13,380
the most natural thing in the world back then um it was talked about how um you know

204
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:19,920
finding myself or finding this inner freedom and and she talked about how her Christian

205
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:25,680
faith how much it put her into a community of fellow fellow people in

206
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:32,760
relationship to a society and people and that was what was so meaningful for and found a sense of belonging and home

207
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:40,440
and there again we see this you know people enter into religion have very different orientation of what they're looking for and what they want

208
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:45,599
so and we also become with a lot of ideas not just simple like that but what

209
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:52,619
it means to be an individual what it means to be a self what's important and so when we sit down to meditate it's

210
00:37:52,619 --> 00:38:00,599
part of what our motivation can be is about that self um it could be that uh we're you know

211
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:05,760
we're looking for how to be a better you know get a career advancements and so

212
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:12,420
we've been told that if we're too anxious and so you need to meditate they get calmer and quieter because that's

213
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:19,200
how you're going to you know be more respected at work and so so it's all about me

214
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,240
attaining something getting something it could be that um

215
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,880
uh it could be this you know it's another person has been told that you know you really don't fit into the

216
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:35,160
community here uh very well and um you might try meditating because then

217
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:41,280
you'll relax and start feeling more connected to the people around you and so the meditation can have a

218
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,320
different function for different people depending on what seems important for them

219
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:54,960
and um and then um so then also the locus of uh of what

220
00:38:54,960 --> 00:39:00,240
what's valued the most around the self is the self as an autonomous independent

221
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:05,339
person what's most important and we have to realize that and and find it or as a

222
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:12,240
self as someone embedded in a system of relationships with other people and somehow finding ourselves kind of

223
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:17,760
connected to that embedment and embedded Nation nature of society or social

224
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:22,800
connections that meditation is going to help us to really feel connected to that

225
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:28,099
and and feel much more part of it in a deeper and deeper way

226
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:35,940
um the uh I've seen you know my early years when I was first coming to Buddhism and was kind of peer with a lot

227
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:42,060
of new people coming to Buddhism how many peace on people were really coming to find themselves

228
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:48,060
and um and what they found was instead of finding themselves that or maybe they

229
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:55,619
did because they found themselves then at some point they found themselves back into the deeper connection to the

230
00:39:55,619 --> 00:40:03,780
religion they grew up with and so they will go back into a church or synagogue or something and um and uh in a way that

231
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:09,420
they then participated more in the collective life of it other people I've seen it goes into

232
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:15,839
Buddhism and and um and it also finds a sense of community there and that's what's kind of more important than the

233
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,660
meditation because that's what they're culturally or personally their philosophy what they

234
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:26,599
think is important and some people

235
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:32,160
um I've you know just for some whatever reason find that their engagement of

236
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:39,660
Buddhism is always very personal and they're happy to go off and be Hermits and long periods of meditation without much

237
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:44,839
connection to to others is one better or worse than the other

238
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:51,420
I'd rather not think that way there are all ways of organizing meaning purpose

239
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:58,560
in this world of ours and maybe they all have a place they all have a role there's a time and season

240
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:04,020
for all things and there's a and there's a place in society for maybe all the

241
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:12,359
different ways that we can construct our sense of self our sense of meaning our sense of being connected to others

242
00:41:12,359 --> 00:41:18,660
and um and and this is an adventure it's kind of like a discovery it's kind of like

243
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:24,720
the and as I said in the meditation kind of like the powers of ten that meditation takes you into some deep

244
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:31,140
deep place quiet still Letting Go place and then how do we interpret that around

245
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:38,339
the sense of how we understand this self and what's important around the self and what the self is in relationship to

246
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:45,119
needs and motivations and purposes and our place in this world

247
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:51,720
um in that deep place or what's that connection from that deep place of Freedom as we come back to

248
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:57,900
powers of 10 back into the world back into society and not a few people have found

249
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:03,480
themselves transformed so that their relationship and their understanding of what it means to be in

250
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:09,060
relationship to other people is radically changed a simple way where understanding would

251
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:15,780
be that many people are codependent very deep sense of neediness and need and and

252
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:22,020
really measuring their success and their well-being in relationship to other people and comparing themselves to other

253
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:28,500
people and to really delve deep into this kind of varied powers of tend to go within

254
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:35,040
going within within and letting go the social world for a while can be transformative so that when we

255
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,220
come back into the social world that the sense of neediness is not there anymore

256
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:47,339
this sense of comparing ourselves and measuring ourselves with other people and then the

257
00:42:47,339 --> 00:42:53,820
social world can have a very different meaning than it had before how much meaning it has how important it

258
00:42:53,820 --> 00:43:00,480
is depends in part by the meaning making understandings that we have about our

259
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:07,380
place in the world and who we are and who we are in relationship to other people and we shouldn't assume that two

260
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:14,700
meditators share the same understanding of in that range or in that of what's most

261
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:20,640
important where are they most Center their life and I said more in community or more is in

262
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:27,060
the individual and and what other kind of secondary understandings come from that

263
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:32,880
so without saying any of us are right and wrong I think that's very important

264
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:39,480
what I'd like to say is that it's important to become reflective about it think deeply about to realize what we're

265
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:46,619
operating under what are the assumptions what are the beliefs we have around self around others and to dismiss this whole

266
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:54,078
investigation of self because Buddhism says there's no self kind over not to focus on self

267
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:01,079
um is it there's uh it's easy that we think I almost Miss or not notice that we actually haven't

268
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:07,020
almost subconsciously unconsciously deeply embedded Notions and operating

269
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:13,020
principles around what it means to be a self and what's important and what this

270
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:20,900
kind of selective process attention uh is used for to pick out and

271
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:27,720
recognize and know in this world what's important so I offer this uh with the hope that

272
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:34,440
you will uh maybe spend some time today maybe

273
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:41,640
talking with friends and others about you kind of your you know your your own

274
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:48,119
Central focus on understanding of what it means to be a self an individual and

275
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:53,160
the uh what that mean what what what beliefs and ideas come along with your

276
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:58,800
sense of personhood and what is it to be in a person in

277
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:04,980
society and what are the beliefs and ideas and their standings that come along with how you are embedded in

278
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:10,079
society are you embedded or are you really removed what's the connection there

279
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:17,160
and um and I hope that if you reflect deeply on these things and think about them that when you come to do your

280
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:23,460
meditation some of those things can be put can be put down it could be put to rest

281
00:45:23,460 --> 00:45:28,560
temporarily and they won't be operating and churning away in some maybe quiet

282
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,280
deep way and allow something some power of 10 to open up for you

283
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:39,720
whether it's power of 10 deeper and deeper in or power 10 further and

284
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:45,119
further out that's for you to discover

285
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:50,780
so thank you very much and um
