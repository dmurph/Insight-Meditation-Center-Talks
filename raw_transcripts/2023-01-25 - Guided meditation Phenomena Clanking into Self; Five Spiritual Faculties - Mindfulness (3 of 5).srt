1
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:10,760
okay welcome uh welcome folks

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:19,340
um yeah nice to say the names

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,840
okay I will uh uh

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,460
Let's uh that's it that's it

5
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:32,759
let's just imagine it was you not me

6
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:36,380
guiding this meditation

7
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:50,939
and let's imagine that you

8
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:57,920
were deeply at ease no social pressure

9
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:13,280
but you had to decide how to guide

10
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,840
and you know many techniques but you're

11
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,540
actually in deciding how to guide us all

12
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:47,400
having to really contact the field of your own experience

13
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:51,680
to find where the inspiration is

14
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,360
where the aliveness is in you

15
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,640
is guiding a meditation a little like narrating one's experience in a way that

16
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,800
is hopefully useful for another

17
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:39,560
and so as we begin just uh

18
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:46,640
gently scan your experience

19
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:54,019
to see where the inspiration is where the aliveness is

20
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:03,180
which phenomena are useful for you to pay attention to

21
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,719
right now

22
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,918
maybe it's the breath or the body

23
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:29,600
a feeling tone or objects of the Mind

24
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:35,419
but maybe it's something no one's ever heard of before

25
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:59,000
planning letting your own wisdom

26
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:05,180
shape your attention in this moment

27
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,759
receiving your own wisdom

28
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,899
when you have your sincerity

29
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,060
the rest is really detailed

30
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:25,699
when you want to know something when you want to know experience

31
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,579
the rest is details

32
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,779
when you're willing to be softened

33
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:06,920
rather than hardened by experience

34
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:12,680
the Restless details

35
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:08,459
letting the world blow through awareness

36
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:19,620
so I'd open receptive

37
00:13:26,459 --> 00:13:32,420
nothing for phenomena to Clank into

38
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:57,200
phenomena Clank into the solidification of self

39
00:14:03,899 --> 00:14:11,399
flank into solidification of

40
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:14,399
clinging

41
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:24,860
and we relax

42
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,800
open

43
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:15,980
we don't have to catch and cage

44
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,480
some thought

45
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,160
feeling sound

46
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:21,199
like a safe way to open to hold anything

47
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,899
including what you call your life

48
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:30,440
and then of course something clanks into self-cranks into clinging

49
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:47,419
we hear the sound of suffering

50
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,640
but there's no shame in that

51
00:18:54,419 --> 00:18:59,780
there's no shame in that we were designed to suffer

52
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:08,419
and we were designed to be free

53
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,799
just letting life run through you

54
00:29:03,299 --> 00:29:05,480
foreign

55
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,539
foreign

56
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,919
okay let's get this here with you

57
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:39,179
um I hope you did a good job imaginarily guiding that meditation

58
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:44,658
in my Stead um

59
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:53,340
so uh faith energetic vigor

60
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:59,179
mindfulness mindfulness oh my goodness that word

61
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,380
a word Nietzsche said um words are like Pockets into which

62
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:09,840
many things have been placed and mindfulness is most definitely a pocket

63
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,860
into which many things have been placed and um

64
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:23,159
sometimes it is it's used as a kind of placeholder for all of the Dharma

65
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:30,059
sort of like all these different concepts smuggled under the umbrella

66
00:31:30,059 --> 00:31:35,179
of that word and

67
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:42,179
other times you know um attempts to to kind of monetize

68
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:48,720
mindfulness make it uh change its meanings to it's been made

69
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:58,460
more compatible with greed hatred and delusion in in some depictions of it I would say

70
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,039
sometimes uh I've thought that um

71
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:09,779
understanding mindfulness is not the starting point of practice but

72
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:14,880
the fruit of practice that we don't you know of course we have

73
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,640
to begin with a definition of mindfulness but um

74
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:29,419
to know what that is is is not actually where we start but where we wind up

75
00:32:30,179 --> 00:32:37,200
so from classically from the Sati patana what's right mindfulness here on

76
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,840
monastic dwells contemplating the body and the body Ardent clearly

77
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:49,080
comprehending mindful having removed covetive covetousness and

78
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:53,059
displeasure with regard to the world

79
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:59,760
um there's a lot to say about that but one of the things I want to note is that

80
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:07,740
they're are multiple dimensions of the construct you know it's not it's not just it's not

81
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:15,980
just narrowly one one feature that's right it's it's um contemplating

82
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:22,860
body or you know feeling and feeling Ardent clearly comprehending remove

83
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:28,019
having removed covetousness and displeasure is a lot yeah a lot of

84
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:35,279
facets of mindfulness and so what I thought okay if 15 minutes

85
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:43,320
to talk about mindfulness the lot that one might say but I thought

86
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:52,279
to highlight this dimension that to my mind uh mindfulness

87
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:59,820
describes a state nearly diametrically opposed to

88
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:05,640
the Hallmarks of distress yeah

89
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:13,560
that that what mindfulness depicts is like really almost the opposite from the

90
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:18,780
kind of characteristics that are shared by many different states of distress may

91
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:24,358
we say suffering and so obviously suffering distress

92
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:32,158
comes in a million flavors but there are shared characteristics across a range of

93
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,940
states of distress and when I was reflecting on this it's

94
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:44,280
um was able you know just with can name a

95
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:51,240
few features so in states of distress generally not

96
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:57,139
always generally thoughts become

97
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:03,660
absorbing and imposing thoughts feel really

98
00:35:03,660 --> 00:35:08,359
real they feel

99
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,579
um they feel like the realest thing in the world

100
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:20,339
and we know rumination that kind of like chewing

101
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:28,440
that embeddedness in thought bubbles is is known as like a trans diagnostic

102
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:36,200
risk factor so for a range of different states of distress psychiatric

103
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:41,820
compromise rumination is a risk factor

104
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:48,839
in states of distress the the kind of space of experience Narrows

105
00:35:48,839 --> 00:35:57,180
a kind of claustrophobia in states of distress uh are our

106
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:04,380
attention becomes fragmented it's pinging from memory

107
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:10,740
to present moment emotion physical sensation to prognostications about the

108
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:18,180
future it's um it's a very unstable you know in

109
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:22,760
the kind of field of experience

110
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:30,240
in distress there tend to be alterations in physiological arousal

111
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:35,720
we tend to be really flat or hyper aroused or we're

112
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,700
a blend of kind of Frozen and then Super

113
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:48,900
impulsive in states of distress there there tends

114
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:55,440
to be a lot of experiential avoidance meaning a kind of unwillingness to make

115
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:02,480
full contact with one's inner life kind of bracing and guarding

116
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:09,260
patrolling the inner landscape to see what's safe and what isn't

117
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,440
there's there are often compromises in distress tolerance so the unpleasant

118
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:25,020
features of any human life become especially distressing especially sticky

119
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:31,800
uh the pain the pain is a pain

120
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,560
these difficulties tend to be deeply personalized so when we're really

121
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:44,579
distressed you know it's like that distress becomes a commentary on one's

122
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:49,160
life one's worthiness one's being

123
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:57,060
in states of distress there there tends to be rigidity in the

124
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:02,839
um predictive models the ways that we

125
00:38:02,839 --> 00:38:10,619
are using this moment to um to make make predictions about the

126
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:18,000
trajectory the vector of our life and there's a kind of failure to learn

127
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:25,380
and revise the models we are models of of self and World become impervious to

128
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:31,260
new information in states of distress we're not learning what's important to

129
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:37,460
learn we're suffering but we're not learning about suffering

130
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:48,000
so that's a very vague kind of sketch of like some of the shared features of of

131
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:52,578
distress a wide range of distressed States

132
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,980
okay what are the Hallmarks of mindfulness

133
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:07,140
a reduction in experiential Fusion like a reduction this metacognitive awareness

134
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:12,200
we are no longer living within the bubble

135
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:18,960
defined by that thought this is another way of saying there's a

136
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,020
kind of dereification thoughts feelings

137
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:31,020
feel less real in other words they feel less

138
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:37,680
um they are no longer these pure descriptions of the state of the world

139
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,720
true descriptions of the state of the world the state of the self

140
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:50,760
they become less real yeah or maybe they they become more

141
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:59,539
infused with space phenomena become less intimidating

142
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:10,380
that that phrase from the satitana putting down covetousness and displeasure this is really I would say

143
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:16,560
related to equanimity um a kind of

144
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:22,200
um a conjoined factor with with mindfulness Sati

145
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:26,480
uh this kind of um

146
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:33,260
non-interference with the arising and passing of phenomena

147
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:45,500
um in mindfulness is um is is a state of distress tolerance

148
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:51,240
it's a state where we're not so intimidated of those pockets of our

149
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,520
inner life that are charged with uh affect

150
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:01,680
we can approach what was once avoided

151
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,839
these are Hallmarks of mindfulness and the mindfulness there is a attentional

152
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:15,060
stability attentional stability and mindfulness that's different that's not exactly the

153
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:21,660
same as samadhi which talk about tomorrow but there's there's at least a modicum

154
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:27,119
of attentional stability we're not pinging around everywhere

155
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:34,800
and um there are many regulatory benefits of

156
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:41,460
um this stabilized malleable unified attention

157
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:48,440
is a Hallmark of mindfulness the opposite of distress

158
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:54,680
in mindfulness we are [Music] um

159
00:41:54,680 --> 00:42:01,339
draining the moralism from our inner life

160
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:08,000
who what we took to be a sign about Who We Are

161
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:14,820
about or worthiness or something

162
00:42:14,820 --> 00:42:23,160
no longer points to anything or anyone it's phenomena blowing through and so

163
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:30,780
there's less and less room for the moralism about what we think or feel

164
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:37,160
about uh what arises in the field of experience

165
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:47,160
there is uh in mindfulness a kind of hypo hypo egoic state

166
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:53,720
the energy and tension of self is relaxed

167
00:42:55,500 --> 00:43:03,000
and in this kind of this receptivity the self is not really home based it's just

168
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:10,460
there's just okay wide open

169
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:19,400
and in that openness we're not really making a home anywhere

170
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:23,599
or we're awake

171
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:33,000
and so uh so many ways to suffer some features

172
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:37,460
these shared features of distress

173
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:43,578
and the facets of mindfulness

174
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:51,060
are the facets of mindfulness represent a

175
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:57,319
kind of diametric opposite of those those Hallmarks of distress
