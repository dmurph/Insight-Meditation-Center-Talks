1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,920
welcome welcome a really warm welcome to everybody

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:17,320
wherever you are whatever time it is whomever you are really warm welcome

3
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,320
so as you know we'll start with a guided meditation

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,719
and just taking this opportunity to

5
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:39,000
maybe fully arrive at this moment

6
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,920
bringing a sense of presence a sense of aliveness

7
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,239
to the body

8
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,840
inhabiting the body and some kind of way

9
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,920
there might be portions of the body areas of the body

10
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:02,849
that feel neutral [Music]

11
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:11,920
and there might be some that feel a bit tight or tense or

12
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,800
otherwise calling for attention

13
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:23,120
and can we in a warm-hearted way just bring our attention

14
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,720
to those areas where there might be some tightness some contraction

15
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,440
this can be commonly in the face

16
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,959
around the eyes and the jaw

17
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:04,800
sometimes the shoulders get tight and raised up can we allow the

18
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,120
shoulder blades to slide down the back

19
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,359
and feeling grounded feeling connected

20
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,159
to whatever we're sitting on whatever the feet are touching

21
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:45,440
and whatever the hands are touching maybe they're

22
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,280
touching the top of the legs

23
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,680
maybe each other each hand is touching the other hand

24
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,200
and then can we rest our attention on the sensations of

25
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:20,639
breathing noticing this aspect of the

26
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,479
body feeling the expansion and contraction

27
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,400
associated with inhales and exhales

28
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,120
allowing ourselves to rest in the rhythm

29
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,039
of the breath can we soften

30
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:52,080
any ideas that things need to be different and instead

31
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:59,000
just rest here with the sensations of breathing

32
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:08,160
when the mind finds itself being busy with thought

33
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:16,120
just very simply gently begin again with the sensations of breathing

34
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,280
there might be a lot of momentum to our thinking

35
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,400
chances are you've been thinking all day

36
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,400
so can you have a warm-hearted attitude

37
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:32,479
towards the mind wanting to continue thinking

38
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:38,839
we don't have to make thinking a problem and we

39
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:45,320
just bring it back to the sensations of breathing

40
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,080
giving ourselves over to the sensations of breathing

41
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,760
right now there isn't anything else to do

42
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,519
while you're here meditating and where else to be

43
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,800
we're just here

44
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,600
meditating being aware of the sensations of

45
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,600
breathing

46
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:26,160
it can be helpful to make a quiet

47
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:34,160
mental note when we find ourselves thinking

48
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,959
there might be a way in which labeling it making a note

49
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:47,440
thinking like indicates a clear transition from

50
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:52,920
thinking back to the sensations of breathing

51
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,440
this is a tool you can use if it's helpful

52
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:22,000
if it is not helpful there's no need to do this practice

53
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:30,160
but it can be a support just a soft gentle note in the mind

54
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,160
thinking

55
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:57,519
we don't have to make thinking be a problem we can fold it into our meditation

56
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:06,480
practice not trying to make thoughts go away

57
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:16,120
we're just choosing to put our attention on the sensations of breathing

58
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:53,440
sometimes we might have this idea

59
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:59,919
that meditation is about having no thoughts

60
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:06,559
and having that kind of idea just creates the conditions for frustration

61
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:10,039
and disappointment

62
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:19,039
there's a lot of thinking that happens in our daily lives that of course continues into our

63
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:21,840
meditation

64
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,200
so is there a way that we can work with our thoughts

65
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:36,159
rather than insisting that they go away can we fold them into our practice

66
00:29:36,159 --> 00:29:41,360
and maybe even they can be an ally they can be a

67
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,158
support for our practice

68
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:56,000
so in this way our warm-heartedness

69
00:29:56,000 --> 00:30:01,840
our intention to quiet the mind settle the mind can be a

70
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:07,120
support not only for us but for those who are in

71
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:12,720
contact with us so that we are more aware of our

72
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:19,200
thoughts and aren't as pushed around by them

73
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:27,039
so that we may meet others with openness and ease

74
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:36,559
so that our practice is a benefit not only for ourselves but for others

75
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:43,919
i can spread out from there may our practice be for the benefit of

76
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:48,679
old beings everywhere

77
00:30:53,740 --> 00:31:01,869
[Music] so [Music]

78
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:58,679
welcome welcome really warm welcome

79
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:08,879
so today i'd like to talk a little bit about thinking and meditation

80
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:16,720
within the meditation instructions or certainly mindfulness instructions are just to

81
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:23,840
notice our thoughts and that's a fantastic practice and it can be very effective and it's a great

82
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:30,240
way to go but it's not the only way to work with

83
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:36,159
thoughts and maybe sometimes something a little bit

84
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:42,480
different is needed so can we work with that thinking mind in a

85
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:49,919
way that goes beyond just being mindful of thoughts when the occasion arises

86
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,960
but to use the mind as an ally and use it as a support for our practice

87
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:03,600
it is a powerful tool are the mind of course it is

88
00:33:05,679 --> 00:33:11,360
and there's this way that there are some analogies

89
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:17,919
or similes that are used in the suit does of um like a cloth being better able to

90
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:23,600
take up dye if it doesn't have stains

91
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,200
right so the dye just won't it'll either not be taken up where that stain is or

92
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:34,080
maybe it shows up darker or something like this

93
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:39,519
so when the cloth isn't filled with stains we might consider that the dye

94
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:45,200
represents some concentration or good will

95
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:50,480
some boundlessness some openness something like this

96
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:56,000
or the and the um in the same way that when there's a

97
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:03,279
cloth that isn't filled with stains is better able to like clean and polish

98
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:09,040
whatever needs to be cleaned and polished maybe even including itself

99
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,960
so is there some way in which we might consider that the mind is like a cloth

100
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:21,839
in these similes but for some of us this idea of like

101
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:28,240
actively using the mind during meditation um can be a big shift can be really

102
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,599
different than what we're accustomed to we we may have this habit of we just use

103
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,560
the mind in a certain way during meditation

104
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:45,118
or and so we have this idea that with our meditation practice it's just about

105
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,280
doing more of the same maybe longer or deeper whatever we've been doing with

106
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:58,320
the mind and to actively do something different might feel

107
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:04,079
different uncomfortable for example we may be attached to these ideas that there

108
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,800
should be a sense of not knowing like that's the most important thing and so for us

109
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,520
to meditation practice is associated with falling into a soft

110
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:23,440
cushiony cottony maybe foggy blurry space

111
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:29,039
that initially can have a certain amount of comfort because it's a

112
00:35:29,599 --> 00:35:36,880
insulated from the outside world perhaps but then often you can find that the

113
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,960
energy um drops out of a practice like that and there can't be any wisdom that arises in

114
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,400
this kind of this dullness but there might be this idea that there

115
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:54,160
should be not knowing and we kind of try to shut down all of our

116
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:01,040
mental activity and instead fall into what sometimes it's called sinking mind

117
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:06,320
or alternatively we might have an idea that with meditation

118
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:13,040
we is finally an opportunity for us to figure things out figure out ourselves like why we do what

119
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,040
we do or what's underneath that um

120
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:24,240
trouble niggling mind or thoughts that we might have or something and so we're

121
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:30,560
doing some archaeological dig in our thought processes

122
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:38,720
lots of different ideas that we might have about the role of thinking in the mind during meditation

123
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:45,760
and there's a number of ways in which we might use the mind but that requires that we put down any notions about what

124
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:53,320
should be happening with the mind with thinking during meditation

125
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,520
and including putting aside the idea that there shouldn't be any thinking whatsoever

126
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:08,560
but instead to start wherever you are and

127
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:15,920
we use the mind in particular ways to be a support

128
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,960
so the practice doesn't require that our minds not be engaged

129
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:28,800
in order to move towards greater and greater freedom instead the practice is to find freedom

130
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,839
while the mind is engaged so

131
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:38,960
one way is i've been using just this word thoughts kind of in a generic way

132
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:45,440
you know just plumping them all together but in fact you know there's lots of different types of thoughts

133
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,040
and certainly it changes during the course of meditation

134
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:57,839
it might be with a longer meditation period at the beginning is we sit down and there's this thinking

135
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:04,640
mind is definitely present and there's kind of a strong momentum there's this

136
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,240
maybe a compulsive feeling to thinking that there's this can't be stopped and

137
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:18,800
there's one train of thought after another after another maybe the thoughts seem loud or solid or

138
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:24,560
authoritative and happening in a rapid succession so

139
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:29,119
maybe when we first sit down that's what we discover

140
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:34,720
but as the mind starts to settle as the body starts to

141
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,640
settle as the meditation period progresses

142
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,119
then thinking can becomes a little bit softer a little bit less compelling

143
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:54,240
and maybe with not a sense of rapidity like there was before

144
00:38:55,359 --> 00:39:01,680
and with greater meditative clarity with greater stillness the thinking can then be a

145
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:07,119
little bit more light or thin or still

146
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:12,480
definitely less authoritative less solid

147
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,400
and there may be a way in which the thoughts like float into the mind and

148
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:23,680
the meditator doesn't really have that much interest in getting tangled up with

149
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:30,560
them isn't so identified with them they're not seen as a problem

150
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,560
necessarily and there might even be some gaps of

151
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,960
silence in between the thoughts

152
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:49,200
and then as meditation period progresses this might only be experienced on retreat

153
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:55,680
or with longer meditation sessions or maybe after some time of practice

154
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,960
it's really big beginners often don't have this experience but

155
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:06,480
there's this the thoughts seen arise and they're seen just as

156
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,839
phenomena oh there's just one more thought without any inclination to

157
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:20,000
be associate with them or to add any particular importance to them

158
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,280
there might even be kind of a feeling of the

159
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:30,480
creation of a thought and then the thought arises and then it passes away

160
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,040
like all things do so i'm using this word thought but we

161
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:44,160
can see that as meditation period progresses or meditation experience progresses whether that's in one sit one

162
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:50,319
retreat one's uh maybe years of meditation practice we

163
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:56,319
can see this progression we can see that

164
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:01,359
this one word thought actually refers to a whole range of things

165
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:06,560
and has different qualities it can be helpful to kind of notice the

166
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:12,880
quality maybe the how authoritative it seems or how solid

167
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:18,480
it seems another way another way to characterize

168
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:23,520
thoughts sometimes that i find useful is to think of them as

169
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:29,520
sometimes thoughts feel like they're just long novels you know just getting lost with

170
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:34,720
getting lost in thoughts getting lost in you know

171
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:41,760
just this papancha getting a proliferation of thoughts and then maybe as the mind settles maybe

172
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:48,560
instead of a whole novel maybe it's just a chapter and maybe just a paragraph and then we can get down to a sentence and then a

173
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:54,160
word so it can be helpful to notice that

174
00:41:54,160 --> 00:42:00,400
there's these different qualities and that it can be a way in which we

175
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:06,160
interact with the thoughts is to be to notice the different qualities of them is one way

176
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:12,480
to be a little bit removed from them and not to be completely lost in them

177
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:20,160
and in the suit does we know that the buddha to be that is before he was awakened that he worked with thoughts in

178
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:25,920
this way too also to categorize them and uh here's a quote from one of the

179
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:31,040
sudas before my awakening when i was still

180
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:37,920
unawakened but intent on awakening i thought why don't i meditate by continually

181
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:43,200
dividing my thoughts into two classes

182
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:49,200
so i assigned thoughts of sensual desire thoughts of ill will and thoughts of harming

183
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:56,160
to one class and i assigned thoughts of renunciation good will and harmlessness to the second

184
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:04,000
class then as i meditated diligent keen and resolute

185
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:11,280
when essential thought arose i understood this sensual thought has arisen in me

186
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,599
it leads to affliction for myself it leads to affliction for others

187
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:24,319
it leads to affliction for both myself and others it destroys wisdom it brings irritation

188
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:31,040
and does not lead to nabana when i reflected in this way

189
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:38,480
the thought went away so i gave up got rid of and eliminated

190
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:44,319
sensual thoughts that arose then this continues with thoughts of ill

191
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:51,599
will and thoughts of harming so the buddha he categorized his

192
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:58,880
thoughts on whether are these wholesome are they helpful or are they on hopes of unhelpful and

193
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:06,560
even causing affliction and harm do they lead to awakening or do they lead to harm

194
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,920
so this can be a way in which we can interact with our thoughts also like a

195
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:20,319
third way in which we might categorize them to sense into is this the way that's leading to greater and greater freedom

196
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:25,920
and one thing that i appreciate is in this quote is that first the buddha noticed that he was having thoughts he

197
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:31,440
wasn't lost in them that's the first step the second step that he did a little bit

198
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,960
of noting practice oh this is a thought on sensual thoughts

199
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:42,720
sensual desires ill will harming

200
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:50,319
and then he subsided these thoughts subsided when he contemplated this actually isn't helpful

201
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:56,240
it doesn't lead to awakening and causes harm to myself or others or both

202
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:04,079
so he's actively using his mind here to help him with his thoughts

203
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:09,119
but sometimes that doesn't work right often once we hear what the buddha does it

204
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:16,640
sounds like so easy and so straightforward and it's true that often there's kind of these idealized

205
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:22,319
scenarios that are portrayed in the sudas but there's some more ideas about how to

206
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:29,520
work with thoughts in the sutas and these are some instructions that the

207
00:45:29,520 --> 00:45:35,920
buddha is here's a quote he says when harmful and wholesome thoughts

208
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:42,560
connected with desire aversion and delusion arise due to paying attention

209
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:48,000
to a particular object of awareness then

210
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:54,400
shift one's attention from that object awareness to another

211
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,000
objective awareness that is connected with something wholesome

212
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,560
so this idea that if you notice that you're paying attention to something and there's um some sensual desire maybe

213
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:14,640
there's a individual that you're sexually attracted to and you're lost in sexual fantasies

214
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:21,440
or maybe there's an individual and which that you um have some it will some aversion and

215
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:27,839
you're lost and those thoughts whether they're lost thoughts of harming or if it's there's

216
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:34,640
thoughts of how you were harmed or kind of repeating things you know often how these types of thoughts kind of have a

217
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:40,400
real stickiness to them so the buddha's suggestion is to replace

218
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:47,680
them is to switch if you notice that you're thinking about this to think about something else

219
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:54,960
and it gives a simile it's as if there were a peg and some wood

220
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:02,640
then you want to replace it you have like maybe a coarse peg and you got one that's just a little bit smaller a

221
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:08,160
little bit more fine and you take a mallet and

222
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:14,079
kind of like pound it out and you just replace the

223
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:20,000
more coarse maybe one that's unwholesome unhelpful peg with one that's more

224
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:25,839
wholesome and helpful fortunately there's some gives a little

225
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:31,040
bit more details about this because maybe it's not that easy

226
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:38,559
to just reflect on to note the thoughts to reflect on these aren't helpful and then

227
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:45,520
to decide okay i'm going to try to replace them but maybe we find it's a little bit difficult to replace them

228
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:51,520
so there might be some ways which we can replace them with something that's

229
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,640
neutral and often this is the general instructions that are given that pay

230
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:04,079
attention to the body often i'm giving instructions to and i do this myself is to bring attention to

231
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:10,800
the sensations in the feet there's something about the feet that feel really grounded and connected to

232
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:16,319
the earth to whatever it is even if we're sitting our feet our chances are are touching

233
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:21,839
something so to replace thoughts

234
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:28,559
that are troubling and unwholesome and unhelpful with of the body it can be helpful to do with

235
00:48:28,559 --> 00:48:34,640
what the feeders touching or what the hands are touching maybe if we're sitting to feel the

236
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:41,440
pressure of the chair or cushion against our bodies or another neutral one often is the

237
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:46,559
breath just put a little bit more effort into

238
00:48:46,559 --> 00:48:52,480
bringing sensations to breathing for me sometimes i find it helpful to

239
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,720
set the intention to be with the beginning middle and end of an in-breath or the beginning middle

240
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:05,680
and end of an outer breath and setting that in tension brings just enough a little bit effort to stay with

241
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:11,200
the breath so that's one way to replace thoughts

242
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:16,800
but there's some other ways one is we can replace thoughts of

243
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:22,160
sensual desire sexual fantasies or something like this

244
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:27,200
by dismantling the attractiveness

245
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:33,119
and i appreciate the way that tennis robiku approaches this

246
00:49:33,119 --> 00:49:38,240
by visualizing what the body of this other

247
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:44,800
desirable other would be like if we dissected it into its various parts not

248
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:51,599
necessarily dissecting with a scalpel but broke it up or considered all the different parts

249
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:59,280
so the purpose of doing this is just to help us if we feel like we're lost and

250
00:49:59,280 --> 00:50:06,880
just these thoughts of sensual desire in it so to keep that in mind so in any time you

251
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:12,559
feel like doing this this practice leads into disgust or

252
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:17,760
something that feels unhelpful that's not the direction we're going right this

253
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:25,040
is just a replace the coarse peg with a finer peg just to

254
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:31,920
replace it with something that's has more wholesomeness to it so if you further feel like a sense of

255
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:37,040
disgust or depression or something like this then to just drop these practices i

256
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:42,160
haven't described them yet but kind of laying the found work

257
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:48,480
laying the groundwork here to drop them and just return your attention to the breath but maybe it's

258
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:54,040
easier to go to the breath after this little interlude

259
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:01,760
so this practice of thinking about body parts

260
00:51:01,760 --> 00:51:08,160
instead of the body as a whole as a way to dismantle the attractiveness

261
00:51:08,160 --> 00:51:12,880
in some ways we're kind of like dismantling the body

262
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:18,960
and part of the mind is sure to resist this practice

263
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:24,880
like there's a way in which we feel like we have a sense of vitality

264
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:31,200
or some i don't know there's some way in which we are loathed to give up

265
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:37,040
some of these what our minds get lost in

266
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:44,640
but until we kind of work with that resistance the mind will continually go this way

267
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:50,880
so this dismantling what we find attractive is a way in which we can help take some

268
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:58,720
of the power out of this the mind wanting to get lost in lust

269
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:05,599
full thoughts so one thing that tunis robigu tanjef

270
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:11,440
that he recommends which i appreciate very much is to bring an attitude of humor

271
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,280
to this contemplation so that it can shift the obsession that the mind is

272
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:23,760
currently lost and just right we don't want to get filled with disgust or depression or anything like this we're

273
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:30,640
just trying to help ourselves get out of our rut perhaps with our thinking

274
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:35,920
so uh ton jeff says to keep it lighthearted

275
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:41,280
this uh this uh exploration okay so how is this

276
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,559
first of all we need to use our imagination of course right there's no other way so here's a way in which our

277
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:53,359
mind can be our ally is to use our imagination and you can imagine that this person

278
00:52:53,359 --> 00:53:02,319
that you're very attracted to and you might imagine that they have a beautiful hair let's say

279
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:10,480
luscious hair and maybe you have these ideas of running your fingers through their hair or something like this

280
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:16,160
then imagine that you're gonna have a meal with this desirable person and

281
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:22,480
you're gonna have some intimate time together and then you discover that their hair

282
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:29,520
is over everything it's in your food it's on the plate it's on the table

283
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:37,599
you look around the hair the place is covered with their hair like that just olson kind of shifts your

284
00:53:37,599 --> 00:53:42,800
your perception or your relationship to it to their hair

285
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:48,640
or there's something that tonjes suggests as this idea of

286
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:54,319
you can think of maybe there's another part of their body that is attractive to you

287
00:53:54,319 --> 00:54:01,440
and imagine what you would do if you opened a room you walked into a room you opened it in and there was

288
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:08,000
just that particular body part right there on the floor that body part completely removed from

289
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:14,800
everything else ugh right very different very different uh

290
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:20,960
experience this brings to mind

291
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:28,319
somebody a friend a child of a friend it was i think probably a preteen at

292
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:35,040
this time thought it would be really funny you know during halloween time you can get these

293
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:40,400
body parts like arms that look really real and i

294
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:45,680
saying this about walking into a room and seeing the um

295
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:51,599
just a part on the floor somebody i had this experience right where this preteen

296
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:58,720
put this uh arm that they had gotten from the halloween store and i remember just yelping and but then

297
00:54:58,720 --> 00:55:06,960
we laughed and laughed and left we had such a good laugh about it so is there a way in which you can consider

298
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:13,920
there are different body parts of this individual in which you're having a sensual desire

299
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:19,680
or can you if you think about part of all human

300
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:25,119
bodies is liquids right we have the contents of our gut we have saliva we

301
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:31,440
have all these types of liquids contents of the bladder of course

302
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:36,960
what would you do if you saw a vat of that liquid

303
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:43,920
like wow right that's completely different so there's a way in which you might

304
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:50,240
use the imagination a little bit playful and

305
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:55,760
bringing up things that are a little bit outrageous as a way to

306
00:55:55,760 --> 00:56:01,119
replace these thoughts that are unwholesome that are unhelpful just to get lost in

307
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:06,160
sensual thoughts and then maybe after this thinking of

308
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,520
parts being in unusual places and in unusual ways

309
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:16,880
then maybe it's easier to come back to the breath maybe it's easier to come back to something that can really calm

310
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:22,240
and settle the mind it's true that we might also have

311
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:28,240
thoughts of you know a will or some aversion and to replace those kinds of thoughts

312
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:36,000
the common teaching is to do some love and kindness to do some mata some good will

313
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:42,720
and i'm often instructing to just do goodwill wherever it's easy

314
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:49,040
so it doesn't have to be towards that person for whom you have ill will that's that's

315
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:54,720
a tall order to go from ill will to goodwill but instead just to shift over to

316
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:01,520
whomever it's the absolute easiest it could even be imaginary kittens

317
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:09,359
i saw some kitten videos the other day oh my goodness right there's something it's a little heart melting

318
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:15,520
so if that's true for you can you so your imagination for maybe it's imaginary kittens or maybe

319
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:21,200
there's somebody when you bring them to mind your heart really softens

320
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:26,400
but also tan jeff denis robiku he talks about one

321
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:31,760
way to do goodwill for those who have ill will which i think is uh

322
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:38,559
can be a really fruitful way and this that is this recognition

323
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:44,000
that we want to wish good will for those for

324
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:50,960
everybody that's in our own best interests we want the mind not to have ill will but have

325
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:57,040
good will so including those who we find difficult

326
00:57:57,040 --> 00:58:03,680
and can we wish for those with whom that we find

327
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:12,880
difficult can we wish them to learn how to be skillful in their actions so that they may find happiness

328
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:16,798
so we may use that as a phrase

329
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:23,440
may you learn to be skillful in your actions

330
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:30,640
so that you might find happiness and this we kind wish for people

331
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:37,920
that they learn to be skillful so that they can be happy of course we don't want them to continue suffering we

332
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:44,480
all recognize that when people are happy they can take better care of others and take

333
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:51,359
better care of themselves so we can do some loving kindness some

334
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:57,839
meta some goodwill practice for those we find difficult by saying something along the lines of

335
00:58:57,839 --> 00:59:04,400
you can find your own words that are meaningful for you but may you learn

336
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:11,920
to be skillful in your actions so that you might find happiness

337
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:21,680
i think all of us can do this we can wish this which is a different uh

338
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:28,319
it's a shift away from the ill will to wish them that they may learn

339
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:33,520
skillfulness in their actions and maybe with that with us we have this openness

340
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:41,760
this willingness that we could help show them if they wanted to but that's extra only think about that if that's helpful

341
00:59:43,359 --> 00:59:48,880
so the way in which we can use the mind as an ally instead of just thinking that

342
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:55,040
thoughts are there should be no thinking or that we should

343
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:01,040
get ourselves sequestered into a cocoon where there's kind of a dullness or to

344
01:00:01,040 --> 01:00:06,400
feel like we have to figure everything out there's a way in which we can

345
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:13,119
use our thoughts we can replace our thoughts for the unwholesome and replace them

346
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:21,119
with something wholesome so actively use our mind as part of our meditation practice as a way to help them it might

347
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:27,920
help the mind to settle and find more freedom help the heart settle and find more

348
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:33,599
freedom and so may our practice of finding more

349
01:00:33,599 --> 01:00:38,880
freedom be for the benefit of all beings everywhere

350
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:45,599
thank you you
