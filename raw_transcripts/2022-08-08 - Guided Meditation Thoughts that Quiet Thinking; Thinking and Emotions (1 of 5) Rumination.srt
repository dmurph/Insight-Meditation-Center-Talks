1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:08,480
so warm hello for this monday morning

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,840
and i agree with both you all who are

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,560
attending here now on this live youtube broadcast

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,720
in our youtube in the middle of our youtube sangha community

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,520
and also welcome those who might be listening to this later and realize there are people who

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:42,000
for different reasons all kinds of reasons listen to this later and and you're just as much part of my

7
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,360
heartfelt sangha youtube song guys those of you who are alive

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,480
so um

9
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:59,920
so people who meditate sooner or later

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:06,720
will contend with the mind's tendency to think some people think more in words some

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,560
people think more images some people do a combination of both

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,200
and there's a lot of variation in the whole thinking process

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,880
for how people some people are very somatic in their thinking some people are more

14
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,320
mental in their thinking it's just a wide range

15
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:36,720
and thinking has a big impact on our lives it can direct our lives transform our

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,479
lives and it can challenge our lives in big ways so

17
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,600
coming to terms with thinking what i'd like to suggest for this

18
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:53,360
morning is that if and when

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:02:00,159
you notice that your mind is thinking a lot wandering off in thought rather than settling down to meditate with the

20
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,840
breathing that you don't simply let go of your thoughts and begin again with your

21
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,360
breathing but that you take a moment to just

22
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:18,640
recognize how strongly or how much you're thinking and kind of the

23
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:24,640
the attitude of the thinking just uh just briefly touch into it that

24
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,080
way and then rather than letting go of the thoughts

25
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,040
and coming back to your breathing um

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,680
uh bring think about something bring up have thoughts

27
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,840
that are kind of like the balancing thoughts for the thoughts you were having

28
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:54,239
balancing in their pace their speed balancing in their in their

29
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,480
emotional qualities maybe they're in a way that's beneficial for you

30
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,720
so if you're thinking a lot about

31
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,280
i don't know if you're thinking a lot about you know concerns about what's happening

32
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:17,200
the rest of the day have some when you recognize that's what's happening

33
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,720
take it for just a few sentences or so to quietly have thoughts

34
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:30,640
about uh how you might be content sitting here now here and now

35
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:37,280
content that i you know at this moment you don't have to do something or content now that

36
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:43,040
you're comfortable enough in your body or something just have little thoughts

37
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:48,959
it's a little bit of a counter thoughts antidote thoughts and

38
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:55,040
be very helpful of these thoughts we're really aimed at meditation

39
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,799
so oh it's hard to meditate with a busy mind but it's okay

40
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:07,280
i'll do my best or now i think is the time to bring my attention carefully to my

41
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,879
breathing and then you bring it to the breathing and

42
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:18,160
so take a few moments to consciously think something

43
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:24,800
in the wake of having found yourself thinking and maybe those thoughts you do

44
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:30,160
point you back to the meditation in a nice way maybe their thoughts that are kind for

45
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:36,880
yourself maybe there's even kind thoughts directed towards yourself so that's the instruction for today

46
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:43,040
and if you really don't like it you don't have to do it of course so

47
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,280
so assuming an upright posture

48
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:56,280
and gently closing the eyes

49
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,960
and as you breathe perhaps you can gentle your body the

50
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:11,400
gentling within or a softening

51
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,159
and then to

52
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:30,479
leisurely take a few long slow deep breaths three quarters full

53
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,680
and leisurely relax as you exhale

54
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,360
and then letting your breathing return to normal

55
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:16,960
and then direct your attention to the area around your forehead your eyes

56
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,720
and as you exhale relax

57
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,800
maybe as you relax these parts of the body you can have a very light

58
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,880
thought well-wishing or goodwill or appreciation

59
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,199
for this part of your body relaxing around the eyes and the

60
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,199
forehead

61
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,520
maybe softening the jaws

62
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:12,198
exhaling and relaxing the shoulders

63
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,280
and the exhale softening the belly

64
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:02,160
on the exhale softening the whole body

65
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:06,879
whatever way you might be braced against life

66
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,319
let it soften

67
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:38,320
and then settling in with your breathing and as a kind of beginning of

68
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:45,760
meditation on breathing tell yourself some supportive thoughts

69
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:52,560
for what you're going to do now give yourself a little

70
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:59,440
a few thoughts that with that thoughts that carry a nice attitude and have nice words for

71
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:06,880
yourself of encouragement and appreciation

72
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,600
for this practice your practice of mindfulness

73
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,000
thoughts appreciating your practice of mindfulness of breathing

74
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,519
and then settling in to the body breathing settling into the body's experience of

75
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,519
breathing

76
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,560
and you're when you find yourself drifting off in thought

77
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,920
take a moment to recognize something about those that thinking

78
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:42,800
and replace it with thoughts that are supportive of

79
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:48,959
your meditation that are supportive of you

80
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,000
as a meditator

81
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,760
thoughts of encouragement

82
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:10,360
and then give yourself over to the meditation

83
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:09,039
if you find yourself thinking the counter thought might be as simple

84
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:16,799
as here with the breathing is the place to be

85
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,600
let me center myself on the breathing again

86
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:33,120
maybe even adding a very quiet but delightful yes

87
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,280
affirming that that's what you'll do

88
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,840
you

89
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,440
so

90
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,799
so

91
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:12,440
if you find yourself drifting off in thought

92
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,400
have quiet thoughts that return you

93
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:26,320
point you back to here and now

94
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:36,278
that somehow are an alternative to the momentum of the previous thoughts

95
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,840
uh

96
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:11,039
and as we come to the end of the sitting to say a few

97
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,440
generous thoughts of goodwill

98
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,278
and how you say it is as important as what you say

99
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,799
to offer good will

100
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,880
to the people that you'll encounter today or those that you'll run into in the

101
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:39,679
streets and the roads neighbors

102
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:49,600
people that you'll somehow encounter through email or messages or

103
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,440
through the news

104
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:06,000
in an important way we are connected to everyone

105
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:13,000
our lives are deeply interconnected in ways that we can't even see

106
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:21,919
and to the degree to which they are part of your life your part of their life

107
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,840
even if you don't know each other and to come out of meditation and

108
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:34,080
to wish well to this world and to have this well-wishing be the

109
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:39,760
bridge between a kind of inner meditation

110
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:42,880
in the world around you

111
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:53,279
may it be that this meditation supports each of us

112
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,679
to make this a happier world for everyone

113
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:03,919
may this practice of mindfulness support us

114
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:11,279
in making this a safer world for everyone

115
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,840
may it be that our practice

116
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:24,158
is expressed in making this world a more peaceful place for everyone

117
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:29,679
and may it be that this practice

118
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:40,559
allows us or shows us how to offer freedom to everyone

119
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,320
the freedom from our needs and attachments and clingings

120
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:50,200
freedom from our fears

121
00:30:51,600 --> 00:31:00,440
may all beings be happy may all beings be free

122
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:16,820
[Music]

123
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:29,440
so good day everyone and being monday we begin a new uh theme for

124
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:36,080
the week and i'd like to somehow continue with the theme of in general theme of

125
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:42,799
emotions it's in the background or the backdrop for what this theme is

126
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:50,480
and uh so the theme is going to be uh thinking and emotions

127
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:58,399
the relationship between our emotional life and our thinking life thoughts and emotions go hand in hand

128
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:04,000
and sometimes i've noticed maybe in myself and in people i've talked to

129
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:09,919
a very strong division between emotions and thinking

130
00:33:09,919 --> 00:33:15,840
sometimes preferring one over the other but the more that i've meditated the

131
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:24,080
more i don't i can't really separate them out completely from each other that they come together as a piece peace

132
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,200
sometimes one stands out more strongly than the other

133
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:36,159
and sometimes one seems to be the catalyst for the other

134
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:42,640
sometimes thoughts evoke emotions

135
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,559
sometimes emotions arise who knows why and in their wake there come certain

136
00:33:48,559 --> 00:33:54,559
thoughts sometimes emotions that we have

137
00:33:54,559 --> 00:34:00,559
are somehow fueling the thoughts we have are fueling the thoughts that we have

138
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:07,600
sometimes the emotions we have are giving energy to the thoughts that we have

139
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,839
so to really be able to kind of get a handle and learn how to be really mindful of

140
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:19,040
the whole process of thinking of emotions our emotional life it really

141
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:26,240
helps to take stock of this thinking world and start seeing the connection between the two

142
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:33,679
and and today i want to emphasize the idea that you would study this for yourself

143
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:40,800
that you would begin during this week to really take care to notice

144
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,560
uh as you're thinking what role what relationship what impact

145
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,440
does that thinking have on your emotional life

146
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,880
and what in return what impact or role does your emotions have on the thoughts that you have

147
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:05,119
and for today i want to talk about one particular kinds of thinking

148
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:10,320
that uh very important for some of us to be mindful of

149
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,839
and that is a rumination and i just love this word rumination

150
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:20,960
because of its bovine kind of reference that

151
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:27,760
cows you know they eat all this grass and they regurgitate the grass and then chew it

152
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:33,200
and so we take and regurgitate these stories ideas

153
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,880
fantasies all kinds of things and and then we chew on it and chew on it

154
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,680
and this rumination is kind of thoughts turning in on themselves

155
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:52,480
so that there's kind of a black hole or kind of trapped in them and it's often repair repetitive

156
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:59,200
repeating the same kinds of thoughts over and over again um and um not just kind of the ideal

157
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:06,400
daydreaming but rumination is really chewing on something it's really kind of working something or

158
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:13,680
driving something home usually that's not very healthy for us um that's how at least how i kind of

159
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:20,880
under you use the term maybe there's other perfectly legitimate ways of refer of using the word rumination

160
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:26,720
but the idea that uh we're spinning around we're caught up in certain thoughts

161
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,880
and this idea of being caught in thoughts and spinning over and over again is so powerful

162
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:38,880
that psychotherapists will point out that one of the leading correlates or maybe even

163
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:44,400
causes for depression or is

164
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,920
for many people not everyone is rumination so how that works is we're telling

165
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:55,680
ourselves a story about how terrible things are or how frightening and

166
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:01,200
and maybe telling ourselves how you know having self-pity thoughts or discouraging thoughts

167
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:07,040
depressing thoughts that things are too hard or terrible things are happening to me

168
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:12,480
and think terrible things do happen to people but there's ruminating about it over and

169
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:17,839
over again that's a very distinct way in which we become a victim

170
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:23,680
we become a victim of our own thinking their own loops were in and it might be

171
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:30,480
true for example it might be true that uh i am a

172
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:37,920
in um maybe there are certain ways in my life that i'm a careless person

173
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,920
and so it might be true and the other day i spilled some coffee on

174
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,000
the kitchen floor and didn't notice it my wife you know pointed it out and she cleaned it up so there's ways which i'm

175
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,640
a careless person and so i can notice that i can say yes

176
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:02,160
skilled you were careless today sometimes you're a careless person and that's it

177
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:08,000
or it's like gil you're a careless person

178
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,680
people are telling you that this is bad to be a careless person you're a mindfulness teacher so you

179
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:20,400
should really know how be careful and be attentive and not be careless and it's very important that now all these people

180
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:25,839
know that you're careless and now it's really bad that you know i'm such a bad person i'm a careless

181
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:32,000
person and it really speaks badly for 40 50 years of buddhist training and you

182
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,160
know i'm really you know this is really you know it really casts a very bad light on myself and who

183
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,000
i am and my practice and my dedication that i should be a careless person so i should stop now

184
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:50,560
i'm sure you're getting tired already and um but uh so the idea being that

185
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:55,760
that uh uh i'm kind of like digging myself a grave i'm kind of like each of those

186
00:38:55,760 --> 00:39:02,000
littles like a nail in the coffin like oh i'm so terrible i'm so terrible and some terrible

187
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:09,599
and maybe it's like you know each one maybe doesn't have a big impact on me but the continuity of the repetition of

188
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:16,079
it just begins to wear me down and kind of drain me and take things out

189
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,680
so that's what i kind of what i'm referring to is rumination this kind of wearing down of the same message over

190
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:27,920
and over and over again it might not be so conscious that it's thinking because it might be more of an

191
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:33,119
almost like an attitude like an emotion but it is a belief it is an idea

192
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:39,839
that we have and we're kind of repeating it so often and the negative quality of it is draining us

193
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:48,079
so the emphasis i want to make that is in case there's some truth to this statement

194
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,280
say it once learn from it do a course correction the best you can

195
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,880
but there's no reason there's no requirement as human being to repeat the same thought about

196
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,200
yourself over and over and over again now it's very hard to stop doing that of course

197
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,119
but one of the ways to change the direction of all this is start being cognizant that this is

198
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:17,200
working recognize how repetitive your mind is recognize that you're kind of telling

199
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:24,319
yourself the same story the same message over and over again and notice the and notice the impact how

200
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:30,319
is this affecting your energy level your inspiration level how does it what emotions does it bring does it bring

201
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:35,680
fear and how does it affect your body

202
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:42,480
some people who are very very somatic based bodies life will can see that as they have certain

203
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:48,400
thoughts that uh their body begins to shift and change certain muscles tighten up and

204
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:55,599
you know energies in the body shift and change and so to have thoughts about some frightening thing happen fantasy of

205
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:02,160
frightening things happening and fear uh feelings in the body are triggered

206
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:07,280
have thoughts of desire and ruminate about desire and sexual fantasies and

207
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:12,800
other sensations in the body get aroused have fantasies and

208
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:18,480
repetition about all the wrongs that have been done and

209
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,800
starts feeling angry and maybe wrongs have been done but to tell your story over and over and over

210
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:30,720
again don't confuse the harm someone else has done

211
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:36,480
with the harm that you're doing to yourself because to say angry thoughts to

212
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,079
yourself over and over again or critical thoughts against yourself over and over again or depressing thoughts over and

213
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:47,359
over again it's harmful to oneself to do that and so

214
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:54,000
this is the second arrow that we had and so the first arrow is life

215
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:59,359
and that we can't necessarily control but we can have some control over the

216
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:06,800
second arrows so along this line it's very common for people to say

217
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:13,599
that the meditation teachers like me that maybe you can't control always control your thinking mind

218
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:21,040
like in terms of whether you think or don't think but what you can do just like you can't control maybe a big

219
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:27,119
wide river but you can be in the river and find the right place the right

220
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,319
current to be in the right place in the river and avoiding the rapids

221
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:39,280
so we can be in the world of thinking and make adjustments get into a different boat on the river

222
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:45,760
of thoughts go into a different current or an eddy um and where it's

223
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:53,760
safe or worse you know avoid the whirlpools or the holes that you know the rapids

224
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,720
and so to to notice that the rumination notice the repetitive thoughts that are

225
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:05,760
maybe sometimes debilitating and then to uh

226
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:11,920
just notice that notice how repeat rep repetitive they are you can count them it's fascinating start counting how many

227
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:17,280
times you have the same kind of thought it takes some of the some of the

228
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,400
charge or the authority out of them to count them by the time you get to 300 it's like

229
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:27,920
they don't have so much authority or you can

230
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:33,359
see the effect it has in your body on your emotions and

231
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:39,119
you could offer different thoughts you can consciously begin thinking about

232
00:43:39,119 --> 00:43:46,480
something that's more positive not a fantasy in itself but something that's true that's it's that's kind

233
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:53,280
that's generous that's soft and one of the ways to even do it if you're by yourself maybe driving or

234
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,599
something rather than ruminating difficult thoughts is to start talking out loud to yourself

235
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:05,280
in a nice friendly voice thoughts that are supportive thoughts that are good thoughts about what's

236
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:11,839
coming and and um because sometimes the the voice

237
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:19,040
that thinks comes from a different place in our mind than the voice that speaks

238
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:26,000
and so you're tapping into a different side of yourself when you're speaking out loud and maybe there's more wisdom

239
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,040
maybe there's more kindness maybe the more there's more access to a choice

240
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:36,640
of how to be than if you just let your thinkings keep going and

241
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:43,839
but also start experimenting with shifting what you're thinking about it might sound artificial

242
00:44:43,839 --> 00:44:49,520
it might sound a little bit forced and effortful however it's pro if it's better than the

243
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:57,040
alternative try doing it if the alternative you've done it long enough of ruminating and spinning and

244
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,359
the billet you know this kind of draining kinds of thoughts maybe you know those are the ones we

245
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:09,680
should be questioned that they're artificial those are the ones that we should question about you know how much energy we're going

246
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:17,040
into them so you might try to offer an alternative

247
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:22,800
consciously choose what you think and think good things this is not meant to be

248
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:28,560
polyanish it's not meant to be an antidotal thinking necessarily it's

249
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:34,640
not meant to be pretending or that everything is fine it could be very realistic thoughts

250
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:40,160
about what's happening that sees reality what's happening directly and right in the eye

251
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:46,560
but that meets it and thinks about it in wise ways and kind ways supportive ways

252
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:53,920
compassionate ways the ways that maybe you would imagine

253
00:45:53,920 --> 00:46:00,400
so the buddha would speak or the way that some wonderful person that you know

254
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:07,680
wise kind person that you're inspired by how they might speak about the situation

255
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:13,920
so uh this is this is uh what i'm offering today requires some

256
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:21,040
mindfulness but it is a practice that's kind of different than mindfulness but i'm hoping that

257
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:26,400
this investigation and this kind of practice of thinking in new ways

258
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:32,160
will be a tremendous support for your ability to be mindfully present

259
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:38,400
and something can settle the rumination can settle and you can be inspired by a different way to go

260
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:44,960
forward so um uh i hope that you

261
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:50,560
find a way to enjoy this and and take up the challenge

262
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:56,880
if you're one of those people who might ruminate in ways that are not useful for you

263
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:03,040
and and if you're not one of those people then tomorrow we'll take it in the world

264
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:08,839
of thinking from a different angle thank you
