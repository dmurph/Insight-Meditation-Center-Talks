1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:08,599
good morning everyone and welcome then I'm happy grateful for

2
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:15,240
Nikki and Ying who taught here while I was away I was

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:21,640
uh back in the country of my birth Norway for Memorial services from both

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:28,599
my parents and um wonderful to be back there and see relatives I haven't seen

5
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:33,880
for a long time and I'm happy to be

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,600
here so

7
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:49,239
um for this meditation today I'd like to uh evoke an unfortunate

8
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:55,160
term that many people live with and that is time

9
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:02,160
pressure living under the pressure of time not enough time there's uh not

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,680
enough time to do what we have to do with our responsibilities or there's so many things to

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:15,320
do and uh and we live sometimes under the burden of time the pressure of time

12
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:21,880
and if instead of calling it pressure which kind of implies maybe that it's kind of something coming from outside of

13
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,040
us we call it uh tension time tension We

14
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:34,040
Carry in US tension related to time that uh the way that a big part of how

15
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:40,920
we relate to time is a construct of our own mind independent of any

16
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:48,600
philosophical ideas of what time is the way that we relate to the uh time aspect

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:55,320
of life has a lot to do with our constructs our beliefs our orientations

18
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:01,759
our plans our expectations our to-do list all kinds of

19
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,560
things and when we sit down to meditate one of the opportunities is to

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,160
step out of time or to enter into a sacred

21
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,640
time a time that um there is lots of

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,360
time spacious time a time that is not something that

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,480
we have to be tense around or be pressured by don't live in expectations when it'll

24
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:41,360
be over all these are things we overlay on top of this momentto moment life that we

25
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:48,599
live on top of now and to from time to time like when

26
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:55,280
we sit down to meditate or when we have a Sabbath sacred time off is

27
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,599
to be willing to question how we live in

28
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:08,120
time to use the reference point of time to see is the ways that we're attached

29
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:18,000
and we're caught up somehow connected to time and different time than now past or

30
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:25,080
future feeling a pressure around doing and accomplishing that has to do with

31
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:31,239
time and can we relax relax the ion

32
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,760
relax the inner pressure around time and find

33
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,879
time as being spacious maybe no

34
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:51,360
time maybe outside of time maybe a sense of abundant time for these few minutes

35
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:57,560
that we're meditating here a pause and all things having to do

36
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,840
with time

37
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:09,760
and to feel part of something that's deeper

38
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:19,400
Fuller rather than being in time or pushed around by time or preoccupied

39
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:26,478
with time one way or the other there's the idea of being

40
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,918
time we're intimately in

41
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:38,280
time not out of

42
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:46,000
time not doing time but being time just being

43
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:52,320
here so may this meditation be one where we

44
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:59,759
relax all and every tension and pressure around time

45
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:07,880
and if being sensitive to how we relate to time or live with time is

46
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:13,880
um challenging you know not interesting for you you can just put it aside but

47
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:19,840
maybe there's a very light and easy way to step out

48
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,000
of time tension and pressure that allows these few minutes

49
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:33,840
to be an entering into the timeless present the sacred

50
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:41,520
present where this moment this present time is allowed to just be

51
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:47,919
itself not under the dictates of the constructs and ideas of

52
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:55,039
our mind just now so assuming a meditation

53
00:05:55,039 --> 00:06:01,639
posture and gently closing your eyes

54
00:06:04,759 --> 00:06:10,000
and gently taking some gently deeper

55
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:16,919
breaths so you can feel your torso more fully maybe feeling some of the tensions

56
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:19,199
and

57
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:30,960
pressures and as you exit exhale longer than usual

58
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:38,840
relax and soften relax in your body

59
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:16,800
letting breathing return to normal and even with a normal breath

60
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:24,160
normal enough letting go any preoccupation with

61
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:31,520
how you're breathing just breathe in whatever way it is

62
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,520
relaxing on the

63
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:46,120
exhale maybe on the inhale finding places of tension in your body

64
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:51,400
holding and on the exhale

65
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,319
softening and the more the body relaxes and

66
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,639
softens either directly or indirectly We Begin

67
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,800
softening the tensions and pressures that exist around

68
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,680
time time pressure is not

69
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:29,800
inherent with being alive and present now it's not necessary

70
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:48,760
on the exhale softening and relaxing in the thinking

71
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:58,040
mind time pressure has its origin in the mind and how we think and believe

72
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,440
and Orient

73
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,639
ourselves softening the thinking mind

74
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:55,560
and then centering yourself on breathing

75
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:10,040
allowing the inhale to show itself to be there your

76
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:20,160
body without a before and after In This Moment Timeless

77
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:29,480
moment just breathing in just breathing out

78
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:37,399
less your breathing as the body's

79
00:10:38,839 --> 00:10:46,440
breathing less you are experiencing breathing and more the body's experience

80
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,720
of breathing

81
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:09,160
and if you find yourself drifting off in thought you might take a moment to feel

82
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,880
or notice if those thoughts have any connection to time

83
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:19,800
past future pressure

84
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:28,560
tension relax and return with your breathing

85
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
for for

86
00:13:29,079 --> 00:13:32,079
for

87
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:02,040
for for

88
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:42,399
there's a way in which being distracted in thinking takes us out

89
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:47,600
of living time living in

90
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:56,680
time the live time of now the live time which inherently has

91
00:15:56,680 --> 00:16:04,759
no tension or pressure as part of of it it's just

92
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
now

93
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

94
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

95
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
for for

96
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

97
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

98
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
for for

99
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,480
for

100
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,720
what is your relationship to time

101
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:13,320
is there any pressure or tension that's Tim

102
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:22,559
related and if there is don't try to relax it at this

103
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:29,080
point instead see it clearly

104
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:35,440
feel it as fully as you can the tension the

105
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:43,480
pressure and allow it to be there and see what happens give space and

106
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:47,799
time to the pressure you

107
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
feel

108
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

109
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
e for

110
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:38,080
and as we come to the end of this

111
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:45,600
meditation you might consider that attention your

112
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:52,760
attention can be a gift we can listen to ourselves or

113
00:26:52,760 --> 00:27:00,039
listen to others as a gift we can take take time to see and

114
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:07,000
appreciate others and that seeing and

115
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:15,039
appreciating is a gift for people who are seldom seen seldom

116
00:27:20,679 --> 00:27:28,360
appreciated there are people who or say differently that to see and

117
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:34,640
appreciate and listen also involves the gift of

118
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:43,120
time slow down take time to really be with others

119
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:49,159
with yourself sometimes only if we give the

120
00:27:49,159 --> 00:27:54,399
gift of time can other gifts be

121
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:00,760
given kindness friendship love

122
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:07,919
compassion generosity patience and

123
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,360
forgiveness joy and Delight

124
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:21,279
all can Thrive if there's time for them the gift of

125
00:28:21,279 --> 00:28:29,480
time and as we come to the end of this sitting May It Be

126
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:38,480
that whatever way we're going to benefit benefit others whe whatever way we're going to benefit for the happy live for

127
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:44,760
the happiness and Welfare of others consider it

128
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:52,200
begins with the gift of time without there being lots of time

129
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:58,600
open time available time without

130
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:06,720
taking time giving time being in

131
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:13,360
time so many other things are not possible or or or

132
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:18,640
undermined or Limited in some

133
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:29,159
way may it be that as we go into the day today

134
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:35,960
that we offer the gift of time to those around

135
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,600
us may it be that we can live for the welfare and benefit of

136
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:49,440
others by how mindfulness teaches us the gift of

137
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,880
time living in time here and

138
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:03,799
now may all beings be happy be may all beings be

139
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:14,320
safe may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

140
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:25,539
[Music]

141
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:35,919
thank you

142
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:34,480
so a warm hello on this Monday and happy to be back after being

143
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:40,158
away for a couple of weeks and

144
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:50,320
um had a very nice time going back to my homeland Norway birth country and

145
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:56,679
having wonderful time with my relatives there and so I've certainly brought my

146
00:31:56,679 --> 00:32:05,000
practice with me but it was more ordinary in the sense that I was not reading Buddhist books or

147
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:12,440
thinking profound Buddhist thoughts or something it's just living in this present moment and as free and

148
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:19,399
generously as I could and so today following up on that

149
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:25,960
I want to offer for this week uh something very simple and basic that

150
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:31,440
maybe we don't have to even think of it being Buddhist it's just a wise way of

151
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,720
living and it has to do with a little saying that I'm very fond of and I've

152
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,080
certainly mentioned it here uh in this teaching uh YouTube

153
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:49,120
teaching a few times and that's the teaching uh the idea that as you go

154
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:55,159
through your day especially when things are difficult and confusing and maybe you don't know

155
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:03,639
exactly what you should be doing or should be saying [Applause] saying that um a a wonderful

156
00:33:03,639 --> 00:33:09,679
guideline is don't make it

157
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:15,000
worse whatever it's happening don't make the situation

158
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:22,320
worse so if you're angry be careful don't make it worse by speaking The

159
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,799
Angry Words so they hurt people or so they Sever and and ruin relationship

160
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:33,799
ship were in so they divide rather than to

161
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:40,880
unify if you don't know what to

162
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:46,679
do maybe running away makes it

163
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:51,919
worse maybe you don't maybe you don't have to know what to do

164
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:59,360
maybe it's enough just don't make it worse and sometimes uh it's so powerful

165
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,600
to not make it worse part of that is that it gives time to the situation

166
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,800
we're in it may be rather than fing the time or

167
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:15,679
feeling being feeling pressured to react or do something now or say something now

168
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:22,200
and then later regretting it there's uh by holding our tongue by not attacking

169
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:28,240
someone or not doing something that makes it worse uh

170
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:34,240
not going for some substance that's going to

171
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:41,398
somehow bring us into Oblivion or disconnect us from what's Happening or bypass what's happening that in the long

172
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:47,280
term will make it worse whatever it is don't make it worse

173
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:53,040
and that gives time for something more to happen so that's going to be the

174
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:58,800
topic for this week don't make it worse and how to live that way how to live with that

175
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:04,960
guideline and uh I like acronyms sometimes because they help us remember

176
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,000
and kind of Orient us and so I'm going to I have an acronym

177
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:17,440
for the with the word with the word worse and that's what I'll talk about

178
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:23,680
this week and the W uh can stand for

179
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:30,960
weight the O the um can stand for

180
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:39,000
organize or Orient the r can re uh stand for rest or

181
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,750
relax the S can stand for sense or

182
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:51,400
[Music] see and the E can stand for Express or

183
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:58,200
if you prefer empathy so um

184
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:04,920
um so today it's uh weight so part of uh not making it worse

185
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,960
is to uh also is is is can be uh

186
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:17,720
enhanced by understanding the benefits of waiting of taking

187
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:26,359
time giving space giving time for the situation to unfold I probably it's uncountable how

188
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:32,000
many times my life I have not known what to do

189
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:38,040
and sometimes in meditation sometimes socially sometimes in figuring things

190
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:44,200
out when I'm on my own and um and I find I found that if I

191
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:51,200
just wait something unfolds something happens

192
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:57,240
that makes the path forward clear sometimes uh some new thought and

193
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:03,160
idea arises that uh I couldn't have thought

194
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:09,200
about or understood if I was writing tensely on top of the issue the problem

195
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:15,560
I had to relax and allow something else to kind of be there sometimes

196
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:21,560
um it's uh the situation I'm in the social situation I in uh some things

197
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:26,760
begins to switch and change some conversations I've been in um when I

198
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:33,319
wait uh sometimes like I have the opinions that I feel like okay I have to tell this person I have an opinion I

199
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:38,599
know what's right I know what we supposed to do here I know what how to fix this thing that needs to be fixed or

200
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:43,760
something and I can feel my impatience sometimes like you know to really assert

201
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:49,119
myself and I've learned that uh it's not really useful to act that way and from

202
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:55,640
that way and it's useful to wait and then so many times by waiting the person

203
00:37:55,640 --> 00:38:03,000
I'm with says something or opens up the door for something for the conversation to take a different direction or they

204
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:11,160
have the understanding that I was going to assert or they know how to fix something or do something and uh it's so

205
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:19,599
such a wonderful I think profound experience at least for me it feels this way to have not asserted my solution my

206
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:26,400
way and seeing how things evolve and that in some ways in small ways maybe I

207
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:33,079
kind of allowed to let the situation unfold sometimes the Su situation wasn't

208
00:38:33,079 --> 00:38:38,160
solved by that but new information came along that allows us to figure out

209
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:45,200
what's going to happen what to do so I think that uh human

210
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:51,760
intelligence and human social interactions uh do really well sometimes

211
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:57,960
if we give conscious clear time for things to show themselves to reveal

212
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:05,400
themselves takes time for us to see and understand what's happening and sometimes that can be uh

213
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:12,160
you know intentional where we ask questions tell me more tell me more you know I don't understand everything here

214
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:19,119
can you explain that in a different way or what do you think um so we're giving time for the other person to

215
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:24,200
speak sometimes it's uh maybe if we're alone and have some kind of personal

216
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:29,240
challenge maybe we give it all time we wait but go in the way we do it was to

217
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,920
go meditate and I found that sometimes in my life when I have some tension and

218
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:40,160
pressure feel like there's a deadline I have to do something I can't figure something out I can feel the tension in

219
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:46,079
my forehead or behind my forehead or different places in my body and at this

220
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:52,880
is you know I realize this is making the whole situation worse let me go and

221
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,079
meditate and sometimes just 10 minutes of sitting quietly meditating or

222
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:06,000
sometimes I'll go for a walk and just kind of stepping out of um the pressurized time that that I

223
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,839
was giving myself into an unpressured time of just going for a walk and these

224
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:18,000
meditating or going for a walk creates a whole different ecosystem it allows something to shift and change inside

225
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:24,160
something to relax and open gives time for something some inner process to

226
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:30,119
unfold that uh when I finish even 10 minutes sometimes um there's so much more clarity so much

227
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:35,240
more understanding some sometimes becomes clear what to do uh in a way

228
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:41,440
that I couldn't otherwise wait don't make it

229
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:49,920
worse uh uh give time for the situation to clarify itself to unfold to become

230
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:55,319
more obvious uh give time so that uh maybe

231
00:40:55,319 --> 00:41:02,200
you understand or your confus confused but maybe the other person hasn't understood what the confusion is yet and

232
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:11,640
just wait and give time for that person to find their way with the situation um so not making it

233
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:18,920
worse uh is not only an issue of just restraint holding your uh hold staying

234
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:24,920
silent and don't blurting out what you want to say not doing the thing that's

235
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:31,280
impulsive but it's also um more profoundly by not making it worse not

236
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:37,200
giving into to those impulses um uh there's a kind of sacred

237
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,359
waiting or if you don't like the word sacred there's a kind of generative

238
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:47,920
waiting that wait let's see what else wants to unfold here let's see what else

239
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:54,760
wants to happen um it doesn't things don't have to happen on the tip of my

240
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:00,440
own assertion the tip of my own preoccupations the tip of my own fear or

241
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:06,440
anger or desires that are pushing me or pushing into the present moment in the

242
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:12,920
situation um relax don't have that pointed pressure

243
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:19,319
soften open feel sense see wait to for a

244
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:27,559
deeper understanding wait so don't make it worse

245
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:33,359
and by not W making it worse give yourself time to have a kind of

246
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:39,480
generative waiting a kind of

247
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:46,960
uh uh exploratory waiting a discovery waiting uh and a time for intelligence

248
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,559
waiting a time for deeper feeling wait to feel to sense to know what's

249
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:59,240
happening here wait so that's the

250
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:05,720
W so if today if you the next 24 hours

251
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:12,599
uh you might want to um um give yourself

252
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:20,319
the the learning opportunity to spend time allowing more

253
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,960
waiting in all kinds of situations um and see what you learn

254
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:33,880
what happens for that and there's so many different ways that can happen but say for example you have

255
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:40,359
some and nothing's happening you're waiting in line you're waiting for something and you find yourself pulling

256
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:47,160
out your phone to look at the news or email or text or something because you

257
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:53,200
don't want to wait you have this time you want to do something don't do

258
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:58,400
that don't disconnect from your environment don't

259
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:04,839
in his way also disconnect from yourself take the time when you're

260
00:44:04,839 --> 00:44:11,079
waiting for something anyway to do a generative waiting a sacred

261
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:18,839
waiting allow the waiting give space and time to see what else can unfold and in

262
00:44:18,839 --> 00:44:24,400
the in just being here present for your

263
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:31,240
experience so thank you and um and I'm happy to be back here and
