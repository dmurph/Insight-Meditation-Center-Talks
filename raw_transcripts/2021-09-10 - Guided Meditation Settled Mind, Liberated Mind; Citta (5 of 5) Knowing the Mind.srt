1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,320
so good day hello from redwood city

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:14,959
where there's been lightning storms and teeny sprinklings of rain

3
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,080
and uh nice to be here

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,920
so the

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,840
subject of this week's

6
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:41,600
dharma talks has been mindfulness of the mind and or the mind state

7
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:48,719
and we have to appreciate that we have many mind states you know or many minds

8
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:54,559
many qualities of minds and the task of

9
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,640
in the basic teaching of mindfulness is to become familiar with them get to

10
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,400
know it and there's something powerful that happens as we know as we recognize become

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,200
familiar where there's the meeting of just knowing awareness

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,280
and the state of our mind the quality of our inner life and some of it has to do with learning

13
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,520
how to how to be mindful how to have that recognition that knowing

14
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,360
be really simple without an agenda without

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:37,040
you know analysis fixing but and part of that is a willingness

16
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:43,680
to become familiar take your time and get to know it and as

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:51,280
soon as you choose to take your time to become familiar you're shifting the inner ecology

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,640
you're kind of no longer going to be swept away caught and

19
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:02,719
reactive to what's happening you're adding a whole other ingredient to the local mental ecology

20
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:11,520
and that is a place of strength of maturity of freedom of agency

21
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:17,680
of care there's all these qualities that come when we choose to say okay i'm not going

22
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:26,560
to fix anything here or change anything but i do choose to be present for it to be here

23
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,480
as we become aware of the mind state we become aware of different kinds of mind states

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,239
and i want to mention three very general categories

25
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:45,040
first is become familiar with how the mind mind state is when it's

26
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,200
active when there's a agitated that's very active when it's moving

27
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,200
when the mind gets moved around goes here and there when there's activity in the mind

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,879
the other thing to become familiar with is when the mind is stable steady

29
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,440
when it's gathered together it's not fragmented and moving around but it's become familiar with what this settled

30
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:16,239
mind is like and that and part of the advantage of really getting to know the settled mind

31
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:21,840
is that it sets a stage for something to give away

32
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,400
something that we've been holding on to and just kind of can give away it's kind of like

33
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:36,080
like i said what i'm doing with my hands right now we steady them so that something can fall away

34
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,239
it's just something you know and um so so what is it that we don't know you

35
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:48,159
can't really know the task is just become familiar with a steady mind at rest at ease with

36
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,840
it peaceful about it peaceful with it and then at some point

37
00:03:53,840 --> 00:04:00,239
just like you maybe sometimes you go to bed you can't make yourself sleep but you can lay there at some point you're

38
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,319
asleep at some points when the mind is at rest and we're at peace with that

39
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,840
and not trying to make anything happen something can something has a chance to

40
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:20,079
let go so assuming a meditation posture

41
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,079
and

42
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,199
and i often say take a posture that's a combination of alert and relaxed

43
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,560
and maybe today i'll say that take a posture that expresses expresses a degree of respect

44
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:48,120
for you and your meditation you meditating a

45
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:54,320
respectful posture so that you enter into this world of

46
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:59,360
meditation with respect for the meditation for yourself

47
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,080
and for your mind

48
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,039
and gently closing your eyes

49
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:27,360
and noticing become familiar with the state of your mind

50
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,639
just familiar as if nothing needs to change it's just a matter of familiarizing yourself

51
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:42,320
is it agitated is it jumping around is it energized or

52
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,638
is it tired and slow

53
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:57,280
such an important part of mindfulness is that agency we choose

54
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,639
to have to just meet the mind as it is

55
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,759
allowing it to be as it is but knowing it

56
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:20,759
so how's your mind state and what happens to it when you have this very simple

57
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,440
attention to your mind state

58
00:06:51,360 --> 00:07:01,319
and now from within the body within it all taking a few long slow deep breaths

59
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,880
exhaling and releasing letting go

60
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,160
if you're sleepy and tired emphasize the inhale

61
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:21,919
how it energizes if you're

62
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:28,840
over energized excited emphasize the exhale

63
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:45,840
emphasizing being pay more attention to be receptive to allow it

64
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:16,639
and letting your breathing return to normal and continuing for a couple minutes this

65
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,919
process of relaxing

66
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:29,120
and the more familiar you are with relaxing different parts of your body

67
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,599
the more deep and more subtle the relaxation becomes

68
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,919
at some point it's called it's even micro relaxing

69
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:49,880
and then letting your breathing be the center of your attention

70
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,800
and take a few minutes now just to become attuned

71
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,680
to breathing

72
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,480
and as you exhale let go of your thoughts

73
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:13,000
and let go into the exhale

74
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:09,600
and then as you're sitting now what is the quality of your mind

75
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,798
what state of mind do you have how much movement activity is there

76
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,839
how much stillness and quiet is there

77
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,199
maybe the two can coexist

78
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:35,440
or maybe there's a degree of both

79
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:52,000
as you breathe breathe with the stillness of the mind

80
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,320
breathe through how the mind is stable quiet

81
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,600
letting the movements and activities of the mind the thinking of the mind

82
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,480
recede to the background

83
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:20,080
becoming familiar with any ways the mind might be stable and

84
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:27,360
steady hard to see if we identify

85
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,679
with our thinking or the agitation

86
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:40,559
but if the mind if the mindfulness is simple simple knowing

87
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:48,640
see if you can see if you can know the stability of mind the steadiness of

88
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:54,879
the mind the composure of the mind

89
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,120
stillness of mind

90
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:07,280
and if you're aware of the steadiness stillness of the mind

91
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,640
and you're less agitated now or less activity of the mind

92
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:22,720
gently know the absence of that activity that agitation

93
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:33,120
to the degree to which some of the active agitated mind is quiet

94
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:39,158
notice the absence of that that which is absent

95
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:28,799
and as you continue as you breathe exhale

96
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:37,760
just let go of the mind let go into that absence

97
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:44,799
of agitation and as you let go

98
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:50,519
let the mind rest be still be quiet

99
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,279
letting go

100
00:23:37,679 --> 00:23:42,360
the mind lets go of itself

101
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:37,279
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

102
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,919
checking in again with your state of your mind

103
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:51,600
with a simple task of becoming familiar with it as if it's okay to be the way you are

104
00:27:51,600 --> 00:28:00,440
just to know it feel it sense it recognize your state of mind

105
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:11,120
it may be appreciating your capacity to

106
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,480
know to recognize

107
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:24,080
appreciating it that it's a form of independence

108
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,880
autonomy

109
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:38,559
it's a form of maturity and strength that does nothing needs to change

110
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:48,480
but inevitably things do change when we know

111
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:00,559
and then with your knowing awareness

112
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:06,960
your ability to gaze upon things to be familiar with them to know what

113
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:14,240
they are to recognize clearly

114
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:20,240
let your now your attention gaze out upon the world

115
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:32,158
gaze outward and the joys and sorrows of the world

116
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,799
but become in a sense familiar with it from this place of

117
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:45,360
knowing recognition not leaning in and

118
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:52,279
not taking it in identifying with it just knowing it

119
00:29:56,159 --> 00:30:02,080
where the channel of knowing is a

120
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:10,240
valuable challenge a channel for our care and our kindness

121
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:18,480
that sense of autonomy or agency or freedom that comes with knowing

122
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:24,320
is a wonderful place from which to love the world

123
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,960
compassion for the world to care for the world

124
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,840
and so to

125
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:45,679
express that care with dedication of merit at the end of the sitting

126
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:54,080
may it be that any benefit and well-being and happiness

127
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:59,518
that comes from this meditations

128
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:05,840
may we share it with others may the benefit be a

129
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:14,480
source from which we can benefit others may all beings be happy

130
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:22,000
may all beings be safe

131
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:29,760
may all beings be peaceful

132
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:34,840
and may all beings be free

133
00:31:52,880 --> 00:32:00,960
so in this fifth week the fifth day of mindfulness of the mind i want to emphasize that

134
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:08,720
there's many things that we can notice about the mind it's multifaceted and we can spend you know endless time

135
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,559
in the labyrinth of the mind being mindful of all the things but in offering these teachings of

136
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:20,240
mindfulness i believe i like to interpret them that the buddha is pointing our attention to

137
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,080
what is most useful to notice and and what is in a sense onward leading to

138
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,760
freedom to peace and so these eight categories that he talks

139
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:39,279
about in mindfulness of the mind are are divided into two general categories two

140
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:45,200
general divisions one has to do with the mind that's relating to things

141
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:51,679
and so a greedy mind relates to things a mind of generosity relates to something

142
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:56,720
and this is the mind that is kind of involved with the world and that's an important part of the mind and we want

143
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:02,799
to find a way to come to a mind which is wholesome and healthy

144
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:07,840
and at some point the meditation as it settles there's a shift

145
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,399
and what becomes more important is not what the mind is relating to or how the mind's relating or the relating mind

146
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:20,399
but rather it's the mind that is at ease and at peace so it's not actively involved in

147
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:26,240
relating that part of the mind that our awareness that begins to be um

148
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,840
spacious settled um and uh

149
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:36,880
and um and so to start noticing i like to think of it as the mind in and

150
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:43,440
of itself independent of what the mind knows so the quality of

151
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,519
the quality of awareness so we might be aware of something but at some point we become more

152
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:55,519
interested in the quality of awareness than what we're aware of certainly it can possibly be

153
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:01,840
disassociated in unhealthy ways if we don't notice what's happening and but to start noticing

154
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:08,240
the the quality of the mind and then that is what allows the mind to

155
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:13,839
begin to settle more deeply so the second to the last of these eight

156
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:19,679
categories is to know a settled mind as a settled mind

157
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,919
and to know an unsettled mind as an unsettled mind so here we're beginning to track how well

158
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:31,358
the mind is settled or not settled sometimes the translation here is

159
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:37,118
no a concentrated mind is a concentrated mind but the word is not being translated is

160
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:42,240
not samadhi the usual word for concentration but it's

161
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:50,000
a m a long a h-i-t-a which means to be a settle to compose

162
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:57,520
to be um unified to be stable so at some point we start feeling that

163
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:04,880
this in degrees that the mind is starting to get settled starting to get

164
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:11,839
composed unified stable and we start feeling the mind become it

165
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:17,359
doesn't move so much you know if there's a sound then we get

166
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:23,920
interested in it the mind moves kind of to notice what that is um we say the mind wanders away into

167
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:30,000
thought uh direct your mind to the breathing and the you know place your mind in your you

168
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:35,359
know in your in your torso as you feel the breathing so all these expressions involve

169
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:41,520
movement but at some point the mind doesn't need to move anymore it can be aware

170
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:46,560
and be very still it becomes like an a big open space

171
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,000
where things arise in the space and are known but the mind doesn't have to go anywhere

172
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:57,599
because it's happening within within the space and so things are known but they arise

173
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:04,240
within the mind in a sense in awareness and so awareness doesn't have to go anywhere or move anywhere or turn

174
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:09,920
anywhere it's just very still very spacious very open

175
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:17,359
and that mind becomes some people you know it's settled uh composed stable

176
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:24,160
it depends how we want to translate these terms different people orient a little differently to different ones

177
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:30,400
and it's possible to know when the mind is not stable and steady and that's the task is to know that

178
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,000
difference and to know that difference makes a world of difference and

179
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,200
the instructions here are just to know just to be familiar with it it doesn't

180
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:48,000
say adjust it change it make it better there's something very powerful begins happening when we just meet the

181
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,520
experience with knowing mind we're just there to be with it to recognize it

182
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,920
and so to recognize when the mind is not settled the more subtle the mind becomes

183
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:06,720
the more we'll recognize how the mind is unsettled and you know sometimes we can feel that

184
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,240
my mind is really settled and then some other time in meditation we realize oh

185
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,599
it's possible even more settled and then what was settled is seen as for

186
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,880
being more a little bit unsettled and this often can be kind of step in

187
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:29,359
step where we think we've reached some level of peace and you know what this piece is really it

188
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,800
and then later we find oh no that's the greater potential for peace

189
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:40,320
that's possible and this simply becoming familiar with how it is

190
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,160
allows something to deepen to open to relax and

191
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:51,359
the idea of familiarity of just knowing just knowing very very simply

192
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:57,280
the kind of the goal is to just be not don't be excited by the mind state

193
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,960
if it's exalted and big and wonderful and lots of joy and rapture or lots of

194
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:08,880
peace and equanimity or or lots of agitation lots of difficulty in the mind

195
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:14,560
the idea is to become very aquanomous about or easeful with it especially when the meditation goes

196
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:19,839
deeper and deeper and then um

197
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:25,839
um and the idea is to become kind of like as as uh

198
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:32,400
uh as familiar whether it's easy with it as brushing your teeth

199
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,720
you know it's it's that ordinary it becomes you know just okay no nothing exciting it's wonderful but not exciting the mind

200
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,079
doesn't move or get excited by uh by itself and its state

201
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:49,839
and and this uh this ability to discover not necessarily it's not necessarily

202
00:38:49,839 --> 00:38:57,200
having a particular mind state that's important what becomes more important is the

203
00:38:57,200 --> 00:39:04,800
knowing of whatever the mind state is the mind states begins to change

204
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,160
and settle as it's known

205
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:16,320
but you don't get enamored with the mind state we stay appreciating the

206
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:21,440
significance of the knowing and as we learned that knowing can be

207
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:28,400
more and more equanimous and peaceful then something let's go and then it's the last

208
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,800
state of mind that in this list and that's a liberated mind one knows a liberated mind as a

209
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:40,640
liberated mind and then one also recognizes what an unliberated mind is like

210
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:47,280
and so something let's go and in the wake of letting go we know something new about the mind

211
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:54,640
we know the mind that has let go and and the deeper that letting go

212
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,520
you know that also has stages of letting go and we might let go deeply and think wow that was full

213
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:08,079
and then later we discovered there's deeper levels more lovers letting go and the more we let go

214
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:13,520
the more we'll recognize when we haven't let go when the mind is not liberated

215
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,200
and and that's actually quite important because uh whatever degree of liberation letting

216
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,800
go we have of the mind that becomes a support a guide

217
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,880
to highlight where there's still practice to be done where there's where we still cling and

218
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,560
get caught and rather than being disappointed that's really an encourage a useful

219
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:42,560
thing that's where the path of practice is found becoming familiar and seeing

220
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:47,920
how we're caught and we go through the cycle again until the mind settles and gets

221
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:56,720
and something lets go more deeply and more deeply so mindfulness of the mind

222
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,480
and sometimes we're aware of the agitated mind as agitated

223
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:07,760
sometimes we're aware of a settled stable mind as a subtle stapled mind

224
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:13,359
and sometimes we'll know a liberated mind as a liberated mind and

225
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:18,800
and we'll cycle through all these and remembering

226
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:24,319
that it's not the state of the mind that's so important it's the knowing of it

227
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:29,520
that's where something really significant happens

228
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,400
so thank you very much
