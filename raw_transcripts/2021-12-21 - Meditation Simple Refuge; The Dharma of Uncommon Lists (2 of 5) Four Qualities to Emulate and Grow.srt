1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,520
okay so why don't we go ahead and get started

2
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,960
so settling in for our period of meditation

3
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,320
and my aim for this particular sit is to

4
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,920
begin by evoking some um

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:29,920
equality that i'll describe as we're doing it and then um after

6
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:36,480
offering several options for how we might evoke that we'll sit mostly in silence and you can

7
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:42,000
do your regular practice and observe how it was to

8
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,079
sit in the presence of the the quality that we're evoking

9
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:54,960
okay so settling in and closing the eyes gently if that's

10
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,680
comfortable for you just allowing the attention to come

11
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,239
inward

12
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,799
feeling the body sitting

13
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:25,840
maybe feeling where you're being supported so your seat against the chair or the

14
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,360
cushion with a bench or if you're lying down

15
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:39,720
just feeling the support and allowing yourself to be supported

16
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:47,600
letting go into the support of your seat and ultimately of the earth

17
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,799
feeling that stability that groundedness

18
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:20,080
allowing the energy of the body to settle downward in case it was up in the head bringing

19
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,400
it down farther into the body

20
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:32,640
and even from the body we can sometimes let the energy sink down into

21
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,800
the earth

22
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,840
kind of a feeling of rootedness

23
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,920
and then the body may feel like

24
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,680
a tree rising up or if it's more flexible it can feel

25
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,400
like a sea plant rising off the sea floor floating in the water

26
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:24,360
let's do whatever degree you can feel that allowing that sense in the body

27
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,799
and allowing the mind to come into presence

28
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,480
so mindfulness being aware of

29
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,400
any sensations in the body

30
00:03:51,519 --> 00:04:00,640
checking in with the current climate in the heart the mind

31
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,200
how are you

32
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:15,200
or whatever's there is fine we just want to include it in our awareness

33
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:21,919
there's a mood or any emotions or thoughts

34
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,919
we can let them be there but intend to bring the attention into the

35
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,400
present moment

36
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:56,400
to whatever degree possible finding a way to rest

37
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,599
with whatever is present for you right now

38
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,479
so as we continue sitting together

39
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,720
i would like to evoke a sense of refuge

40
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,479
or [Music] confidence in practice

41
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:53,319
or for some of you the word faith may may work

42
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,360
classically there are many many ways to to do this

43
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:06,560
you may have a personal one but i would just like to invite

44
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:14,000
i'll offer a few of them you can see if something works

45
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:22,240
so as we sit we may consider

46
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,280
that we are following a long line of practitioners

47
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:34,800
that goes all the way back to the historical buddha

48
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,919
when the buddha sat in meditation was not so different

49
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:48,080
from this he too had a mind and a body

50
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:53,120
and when he started out it was pretty much like ours

51
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,639
and yet he found awakening

52
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,080
we may be inspired

53
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:31,800
you may consider further that

54
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:39,280
the buddha offered teachings instructions for how to be

55
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:45,840
with our experience what a gift

56
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:52,639
even if you're a new practitioner quite new

57
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:58,000
you may already have a sense that what we learn mindfulness

58
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,199
awareness of the body these are so helpful [Music]

59
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:12,520
given that we didn't really get an instruction manual with our mind and body

60
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,680
you can be inspired by the dharma

61
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,759
it really does work

62
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:32,159
in small ways and maybe you even know in large ways

63
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,800
it's good to be doing what we're doing right now

64
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,480
we can also be inspired or supported

65
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:20,920
by the sangha by the other practitioners on this path

66
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:26,399
we're supported by a lot of people

67
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:34,920
who have practiced through the ears who are sitting with us right now

68
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,120
model for us the goodness that comes from practice

69
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:51,200
some are teachers sometimes it's just nice to know that

70
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,760
there's a bunch of other people sitting out there at any given moment there are people all over the world somewhere

71
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,399
meditating

72
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,320
we can feel like we're joining a vast stream

73
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,480
of practice that will carry us

74
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:50,160
these are the three classic ways to connect with a sense of refuge

75
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,240
buddha dharma and sangha

76
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,920
and i'll look for two other brief reflections that are also

77
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:05,880
in the teachings

78
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,640
we can also consider our own

79
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:26,200
ethical conduct our own goodness

80
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,079
the fact that we try to live well

81
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:41,640
we try to live a life that is non-harming

82
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,959
that includes some care for others

83
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:55,440
a way of being in a world that is somehow peaceful or

84
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,240
beneficial

85
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:11,839
this is meant to be inspiring to us that we live this way that we're contributing in this way

86
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,959
so we can feel happy

87
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,760
with our good intentions and our good actions

88
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,240
and we can also be inspired by our own generosity

89
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,040
what we give

90
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,600
if we have a sensibility that being here is not just about taking but about

91
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,880
offering material resources our time our

92
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,120
attention [Music] our compassion

93
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:26,240
countless acts of giving throughout the day

94
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:33,600
the world really operates on this kind of generosity simple moment to

95
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:39,600
moment couldn't function without it

96
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:47,800
and we contribute this too is meant to be inspiring to us

97
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:12,320
so it said that any of these simple reflections

98
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:18,560
leads to a gladness about the practice

99
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:28,360
a sense of confidence this is a good thing to do

100
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:37,519
and we can just rest in that sense and use it as a

101
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:45,399
bolster or a way of fostering

102
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:52,639
clarity and mindfulness as we continue to sit together

103
00:14:54,639 --> 00:15:00,320
so choosing your usual practice breath or body something else

104
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:06,720
just seeing if this sense of refuge and confidence

105
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:13,839
can inform the way you continue to sit

106
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:27,240
foreign

107
00:24:55,679 --> 00:25:04,240
do you find that sitting with a sense of refuge or confidence in the practice

108
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:08,559
informs your meditation

109
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:18,480
is there some additional clarity to the mind or focus on what

110
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:25,158
you're doing [Music] or a deeper sense of compassion

111
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,919
any difference i'm just noticing that

112
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:49,440
so if you found that there is a positive impact

113
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:55,600
from connecting with your own sense of care sense of

114
00:26:55,600 --> 00:27:02,640
faith in the practice you might consider that that

115
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,840
can positively impact others also

116
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:13,120
even without needing to say anything explicit

117
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:19,120
carrying with you the sense that the dharma is an important part of your

118
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:24,159
life that mindfulness is

119
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:29,520
something that can inform the way we go through the day

120
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:35,039
just carrying that in you

121
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:40,960
can help others they too may feel a sense of connection

122
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:47,520
to the present they may feel your harmlessness

123
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,440
an intuitive subtle way

124
00:27:56,240 --> 00:28:01,679
your benefit and goodness in the world is increased when you know that in

125
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,240
yourself

126
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:13,760
it's kind of a hidden side benefit of all this practice that it does

127
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:17,080
go out

128
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:30,919
and that too can feed back and be a source of happiness for us

129
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,919
so perhaps today [Music] you could just carry in your heart

130
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:59,840
the sense that this practice is important to you

131
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:12,440
just carry with you the clear knowledge that mindfulness harmlessness generosity

132
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,799
are valuable and trust that that will inform those

133
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:22,440
around you also

134
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:54,490
bye [Music]

135
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:03,579
[Music]

136
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,159
so

137
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:29,520
okay so this week

138
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:36,720
um we're doing a theme that i'm calling the dharma of uncommon lists

139
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:44,880
and we started yesterday with a list of five and today we'll have a list of four

140
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,000
and so on so the um and there's a lot of good dharma in

141
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,279
these in these lists this one actually may not be so unfamiliar

142
00:30:55,279 --> 00:31:03,039
so today's list is a set of four qualities that are praised in lay practitioners

143
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:08,240
like us and they appear together this set of four

144
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:14,080
in several different ways they appear as the basis of spiritual friendship

145
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:19,760
they appear as qualities that should be emulated

146
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,039
and they also are listed as forms of inner wealth

147
00:31:25,039 --> 00:31:31,760
so these four are confidence or faith

148
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:37,279
virtue generosity and wisdom

149
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:43,039
so you've likely heard of each of these separately or in other contexts

150
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:50,559
but it's interesting to consider them together as a set if you will

151
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:57,600
so here's the quote from one of the sutas that talks about them as the basis of

152
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:04,080
spiritual friendship so it says and what is good friendship

153
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,158
it's when a person resides in a town or village

154
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,880
and there are householders or their children who may be young or old but are mature

155
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,919
in conduct accomplished in faith ethics generosity

156
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:28,399
and wisdom that person associates with them converses and engages in discussion and

157
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:34,640
they emulate the same kind of accomplishment in faith ethics generosity and wisdom

158
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:39,760
this is called good friendship so [Music]

159
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:46,000
we see that we are encouraged to associate with and emulate people who

160
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:52,640
have the sutta says sada which is the quality that can be translated as faith but also

161
00:32:52,640 --> 00:33:00,159
confidence ethical conduct or virtue generosity and wisdom and altogether

162
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:05,440
that set of four is called conduct which said that these are people who are

163
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:10,640
mature in conduct so first i'd like to just talk about

164
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:17,919
each one of these and then we'll kind of put them together so the first one sata

165
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:23,760
confidence or faith i've come to like the word faith but i i didn't used to

166
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,799
and so i can understand if that word has some aversion for you so it's fine also

167
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:35,440
to use confidence or trust and it's typically stated

168
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:42,240
classically in the teachings as confidence in the buddha's awakening that's interesting it's uh so it's not a

169
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:49,120
blind devotion to a religious figure from the past it's really the confidence that the

170
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:57,200
buddha was able to find a way through the labyrinth of his mind to awaken to

171
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:03,760
a place that is free of great hatred and delusion but more broadly and this is also

172
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:10,720
implied in the in the teachings we could say that faith or confidence is is pointing

173
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:16,240
toward a sincere acknowledgement of higher possibilities

174
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:21,679
if you will so it's kind of the opposite of something like cynicism

175
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:27,358
or sarcasm or other ways where we diminish

176
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,440
our own or other's potential so gil talked last week about

177
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:39,280
self-respect for example and in my experience genuine sata

178
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:47,040
genuine confidence is rooted in some degree of self-respect we have a sense that we are able to do

179
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,158
something good we're able to meditate we're able to practice mindfulness

180
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,640
we're able to be in the world in a way that is somehow beneficial or at least to intend

181
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,960
that to move in that direction so some suitors say that um

182
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:11,440
this is a quote there are beings who are inspired by things that are lofty

183
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:18,400
it's kind of nice so we recognize we can recognize that there are things in the world that are lofty that are

184
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:24,960
pointing toward something [Music] jenny

185
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:31,280
and i remember one time being on a retreat that gill was teaching and he said that we should feel happy about

186
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:38,079
being on retreat because there are people in the world who are inspired simply by knowing that

187
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,839
there are people who go on retreat and so we are fulfilling that for them

188
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:49,760
so to have this kind of confidence or faith i think is a form of wealth like it says

189
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:56,320
in the teachings it enriches us to have a sense of

190
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:02,079
potential so then the second quality ethical

191
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:07,519
conduct or virtue this translates to the word sila

192
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:15,280
it's fairly straightforward the text says here a noble disciple abstains from the destruction of life

193
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:21,040
abstains from taking what is not given extinct abstains from sexual misconduct

194
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:27,119
abstains from false speech and abstains from intoxicants which are the basis for

195
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:32,240
hebesis so ethical conduct is the basis of

196
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:40,400
friendship and it's a form of inner wealth because it directly protects other beings and it also protects us

197
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:47,470
from our own difficulties and also it protects us by bringing what's called the bliss of blamelessness

198
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:54,400
[Music] i think you heard a lot a few weeks ago about celeb when yin for the whole week

199
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,520
on that so what i'll just say now is that this is a

200
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:05,920
time right now both specifically the holiday season but also this time in the

201
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,079
pandemic in our society when we really need people who are genuinely

202
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:18,240
positive forces in the world beneficial not the fake positivity of denial or

203
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:23,359
sugar-coating things but genuinely possessed of

204
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:29,359
some well-being and some sense of acting well in the world and even just just

205
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:34,720
doing our best with good intentions can do this for us ethics is actually meant

206
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:40,880
to be a basis for our own well-being which then translates out into the world

207
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:47,200
so i actually have a lot of faith that all of us are are working in that

208
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:53,359
direction [Music] so then moving on to generosity

209
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,920
the word that's translated that way is actually chaga which is the

210
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,119
movement of mind the intention in the heart toward giving you may have heard

211
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:11,760
the word donna which is more the actual gift that's given but chaga is the mind state that informs

212
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,160
that and the the text around this the sort of classical language is quite nice it says

213
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:23,920
here a noble disciple dwells at home with a heart devoid of the stain of

214
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:31,920
miserliness freely generous open-handed delighting in relinquishment devoted to charity to

215
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:39,599
lighting and giving and sharing it makes me happy just to read that you know it's so needed at this time

216
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:46,079
when it is or or even feels like a time of scarcity or threat or a high degree

217
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,520
of uncertainty psychologically the tendency is to hold

218
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:57,839
on or withdraw when actually exactly the opposite movement is what is beneficial

219
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:04,480
so generosity this chaga this inner movement toward giving helps us to give even when we feel like

220
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:11,839
we don't have very much so this is a good season to of course reflect on and practice generosity when

221
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:18,560
we can and then we go to wisdom panya

222
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:24,320
it's interesting that this is placed alongside the others sometimes people think of wisdom as

223
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:30,960
far off or some high accomplishment but it's placed right alongside these other three

224
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:37,839
and the texts say here a noble disciple is wise

225
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,960
she possesses the wisdom that discerns arising and passing away which is noble

226
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,520
and penetrative and leads to the complete destruction of suffering so that's interesting too buddhist texts

227
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:56,000
often equate wisdom with seeing impermanent impermanence and constancy

228
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,160
for our purposes now we can point out that people who pay attention to the way

229
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:09,800
so many things in life arise and change and pass are more likely to be able to handle

230
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:15,359
surprises or shocks when they come people who have a sense of the flow of life

231
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:22,640
how things come and go can stay calmer when there are large shifts such as what we've seen recently

232
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,960
in the world so i think this kind of wisdom is fairly natural when we've lived a life of

233
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:35,440
awareness we've paid attention to things how can you not notice that they come they go

234
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:42,960
even the even the body isn't constant from moment to moment and surely throughout our lives we've seen many things around our

235
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:49,200
eyes in the past but we can have some wisdom about that some groundedness some stability for

236
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:56,560
others so now let's consider them all together as a set this is a set of four

237
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:03,839
so we have confidence virtue generosity and wisdom so you can see that this encompasses

238
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,000
both individual and relational qualities it has a connection to the material

239
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:16,160
world as well as to the mind it encompasses everyday actions as well

240
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:22,160
as penetrating insight that can be quite deep so

241
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:29,040
recall that in the discourse about these four as the basis for good friendship they were collectively called being

242
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:34,240
mature in conduct so there's an element of maturity in

243
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,599
manifesting all of these we have to have some integration of the practice and of

244
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:46,000
our understanding in order to be able to do all of these well and maybe that there are some of course

245
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:51,440
that we do better than others another thing about these four qualities

246
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:58,160
is that they don't decrease if we keep practicing them and they can't really be taken away by

247
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:04,000
others they persist and they grow through all the ups and downs of life

248
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,400
so even if we go through periods where we have more wealth and less wealth periods where we're healthy and periods

249
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:17,119
where we're ill even as we get older and our faculties just diminish and we can see that the

250
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,880
body is winding down these four qualities can be continually increasing

251
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:29,200
they don't actually decrease so they're worth encouraging in ourselves and others you can see why

252
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,480
they're called inner wealth because they're really independent of the external

253
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:40,160
wealth that we don't have as much control over so we can also emulate these when we see

254
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:46,560
them in others if we see we have a friend who is very generous

255
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:52,480
you know without comparing ourselves unfavorably we could aspire to

256
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:58,720
be as free as they are in the way that they give or if we see someone who's very wise

257
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:04,800
and you know they just seem balanced and they seem able to flow along with things

258
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,800
they seem clear about what they're seeing we can consider oh yeah they seem to

259
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:17,760
really see things well maybe maybe i could um emulate that also so we're meant to help

260
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:23,520
each other in the practice meant to share in this so maybe

261
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:28,640
maybe you're visiting with people right now at this holiday time

262
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:34,079
we often are and i wonder if you can find one or more

263
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,079
of these qualities in some form in each of the people that you are

264
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:46,640
visiting with right now so even even if you have a history

265
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,640
of a difficult relationship with someone perhaps you can think of one way

266
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:58,640
that they express one of these qualities maybe they have some degree of

267
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:05,200
confidence confidence in what's good or maybe they have some kind of virtue

268
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:10,640
some kind of ethical conduct you know they're careful about not taking what's not given they're

269
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:17,760
careful about being truthful when they speak something maybe they have a streak of generosity

270
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:24,160
in them a way in which they give their attention their time physical

271
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:30,480
things or they have some kind of wisdom that you see in them a glimmer of it from time to time

272
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:37,359
so focus on that focus on the goodness of that person maybe even emulate it they don't have to

273
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:42,480
be perfect goodness knows we aren't all perfect or an exemplar of all four of

274
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,240
these qualities it's good enough if people are showing just a glimmer of one of them

275
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,480
take that as the basis for being with them in a kind and clear way

276
00:44:54,480 --> 00:45:00,560
or if you're by yourself at this time of year we can it's good to reflect that these four things

277
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:07,200
are forms of inner wealth and they can be grown through meditative development through reflection

278
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:14,640
so either way this is a great time to be growing these particular qualities

279
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:21,760
of faith virtue to generosity and wisdom i hope this set of four may inform your

280
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,800
day and your week and maybe carry you into the new year so thank you very much

281
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:32,440
see you again tomorrow
