1
00:00:00,839 --> 00:00:07,600
so good morning and welcome and

2
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,679
uh and to begin with the

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:21,880
meditation one of the really useful things to notice to

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:27,800
support dipping into samadei is the way that the discursive

5
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,600
mind the mind that thinks a lot thinks about things has conversations talking

6
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,800
about things in the mind uh living in images and visions of what the mind

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:45,840
can produce The way that that keeps us kind

8
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:52,640
of separated from the body it keeps it uh keeps us somehow uh in a part of the

9
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:59,039
brain mind that's activated more energized in a way that is not uh

10
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,640
usually so relaxing or calm or um it can

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,360
be um we're living in our thoughts and living in the activated energy that

12
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:20,799
keeps discursive thinking going rather than settling deeply in And discursive thoughts can uh be

13
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,240
mesmerizing They can be in captivating They can be have a kind of authority

14
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:34,119
like this is really important to be thinking about And our sense of self of who we

15
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:41,119
are is often closely maybe uh unconsciously but closely connected or

16
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,360
associated with the mind that's dis having discursive thoughts partly because a lot of the discursive thoughts

17
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:54,479
have to do about me myself and I and so what we're learning to do in

18
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,680
meditation especially samadei is to uh become become

19
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:08,959
attuned aligned with something different than that Uh a place that's maybe deep inside

20
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,160
maybe in the torso in the chest or in the belly where there's a feeling of

21
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:22,400
settling a feeling of being more grounded and connected to ourselves

22
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:30,120
And one way to kind of move into this more grounded connected sense sense embodied sense rather than a kind of

23
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,640
disembodied version of the preoccupations we

24
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,800
have is um to start feeling

25
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:48,080
uh whatever degree of well-being there is in the body

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:53,280
And of course there's a lot of feeling of distress feeling of discomfort

27
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,599
emotional challenges There's a lot of ways that we feel the opposite of

28
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:05,599
well-being that we then prioritize So but not to

29
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:12,640
ignore it not to deny it not to betray our unhappiness in any kind of way but

30
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:20,560
to care for it deeply It can be very helpful to not focus on it directly to let it just be

31
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:29,920
there as part of the atmosphere part of the weather in a sense and uh and for somebody to begin

32
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,680
feeling even the ways that you sense of well-being in the torso in the

33
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,799
body Um and that can be a sense of

34
00:03:41,799 --> 00:03:50,680
calm And even if it's just like you know 2% calm next to 98%

35
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:59,599
turmoil allow the turmoil to be Don't stir it up even more Attune yourself to the calm Or

36
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:07,439
there might be a feeling of settleness or a place of settling that's in the torso in the body

37
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:15,639
that's not in the just mind that has all this discursive thinking Settle with the

38
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:23,360
settling Calm calm yourself with the calm And there also might be a feeling

39
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,240
of satisfaction or contentment or to or

40
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:35,720
joy delight or some kind of feeling that's

41
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,199
pleasant kind of pleasure in being embodied in the

42
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:50,199
body instead of activated in the activated thinking

43
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:59,000
So to assume a meditation posture and as I like to say

44
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:05,360
that no matter what the posture sitting standing lying

45
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:11,320
down to give some care to how the body is

46
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:19,080
positioned as a beginning of entering into an embodied

47
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,560
connection to

48
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:33,280
yourself And to support this turning inward into the the pleasure the

49
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:42,520
goodness the calm in the body to gently close your eyes

50
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,240
And it's even more to begin connecting to your

51
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:04,600
body coming into your body more Take some fuller

52
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:13,120
breaths deeper and fuller in a comfortable way

53
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:19,720
but fuller and deeper enough that you're intentionally connecting and

54
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:27,840
engaging the rib the diaphragm the breathing in the

55
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:35,520
torso and feeling as you breathe in the expansion of the

56
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:44,560
torso And then see as you exhale you can slow the exhale just a

57
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:52,479
little bit So it's still comfortable to exhale Slow it and extend it

58
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:08,440
longer Letting there be a feeling of fullness as you breathe in

59
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:16,639
like a full balloon And then a releasing relaxing as

60
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,520
you exhale as the balloon lets out the

61
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:34,120
air It gets smaller comes together

62
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,240
Breathing in relaxing as you

63
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:54,479
exhale and then letting the breathing return to

64
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:04,319
normal But feel now the more subtle way in which there's expansion

65
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,039
As you breathe

66
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:21,400
in and a releasing relaxing as you exhale

67
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:17,640
And as you come to the end of the exhale let there be a small maybe even

68
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,640
infantessimal pause

69
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:33,680
And in that short pause feel whatever sense of stillness

70
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:41,000
or calm pleasure there is in your

71
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,120
body Maybe connected to breathing

72
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:17,200
And as you breathe in and out see if you can drop down into your

73
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:22,399
body out of the discursive thinking

74
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:33,839
mind like you're lowering yourself into a very pleasant pool of

75
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,880
water and feel whatever is

76
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:49,279
pleasant whatever pleasure well-being

77
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:56,800
calm settleness you can find in your body your torso that's breathing

78
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:19,600
as you breathe in as if the expansion the breathing

79
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:26,240
in is breathing through or with or into

80
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,360
The calm and the pleasure however small

81
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:47,120
As you exhale see if you're exhale exhaling

82
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:55,200
into that calmer groundedness

83
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:16,480
settleness Feeling the rhythm of breathing in and

84
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,880
breathing

85
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:26,639
out Letting your

86
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:38,040
awareness stay connected to breathing riding in the on the breathing

87
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:44,600
So there's a sense that awareness is being

88
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:50,440
massaged or awareness is doing the massage

89
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,839
Breathing in and breathing

90
00:13:08,839 --> 00:13:15,720
out As you exhale letting go of your

91
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:19,720
thoughts thinking

92
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:31,800
So there's more room in your awareness to feel the pleasure the

93
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:36,519
calm that might be here

94
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:52,320
And if you find yourself having discursive thoughts

95
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:00,639
conversations See if you can

96
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:07,680
feel how unsatisfying it is for the

97
00:15:07,959 --> 00:15:16,240
body to have this form of thinking How there's more energized

98
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:21,279
activated kind of a pulling away from the

99
00:15:23,079 --> 00:15:28,519
body And how more satisfying it is for the

100
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:34,360
body to be settled for awareness to be

101
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:39,399
settled in the body breathing

102
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:18,440
Taking a few moments to feel whatever it is that might be

103
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:24,759
pleasant comfortable in your body

104
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:35,200
Whatever might be more settled maybe deeper than any ways in

105
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:40,600
which you feel uncomfortable Deeper

106
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:46,880
within than any place that you could be having discursive

107
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:53,720
thoughts Finding the place where

108
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,760
breathing the influence of breathing the atmosphere of

109
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,720
breathing is pleasant enjoyable

110
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:15,760
Maybe as there's a sweetness or a glow in your

111
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:23,679
body which offers the atmosphere in which breathing the

112
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:28,679
breathing body expands and contracts

113
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:53,919
For a very short time maybe only 20 30

114
00:25:54,440 --> 00:26:00,360
seconds entrust yourself to that which is calm or

115
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,120
settled in your body No matter how

116
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:13,559
small give yourself over to it Breathe with it

117
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:36,720
And also spend a few seconds letting your thinking mind

118
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:43,360
become quiet The kind of quiet you might do if you were going to listen to a sound

119
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:49,120
faint sound far in the distance Let your thinking mind become

120
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:54,799
quiet to listen to

121
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,240
feel the most subtle feelings of

122
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:05,240
contentment tranquility

123
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:25,320
And then as we come to the end of this meditation

124
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:32,320
imagine that your tranquility your settleness your

125
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:42,400
calm can radiate from you out into the world

126
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:48,440
that to some degree it radiates beyond the edges of your body into the room where you're

127
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:53,240
at the place you're in

128
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:04,640
Almost as if the whatever empty space is around

129
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:11,760
you receives your calm your

130
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:22,200
well-being And whatever feeling of settleness or calm you

131
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,080
have it can spread outward beyond

132
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,679
the building you're in

133
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:41,440
Beyond the neighborhood you're in just beyond going outwards and

134
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:48,520
outwards and that you can and on that can

135
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:54,279
ride your well-wishing for this world

136
00:28:54,399 --> 00:29:01,278
May your care and love and well-wishing for the world be

137
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:10,679
carried on the wide glow of good will and

138
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:15,519
kindness May all beings be

139
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:21,559
happy May all beings be safe

140
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:32,279
May all beings be peaceful May all beings be free

141
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:40,640
And may how we are settled on ourselves tranquil in

142
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:47,120
ourselves be the way that our good

143
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,960
will can be with us as we encounter

144
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:59,480
others May all beings be happy

145
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:12,579
[Music]

146
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,520
Thank you

147
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:39,080
[Music] So hello

148
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:44,919
and welcome to this con continuation of our samadei

149
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:50,640
series and we've had a break for a week And so I hope that the meditation today

150
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:59,200
was a little bit you know kind of getting us getting you a little bit more back into the the flow of what we've

151
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:06,760
been doing these last months And uh for the topic of this week

152
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:14,919
the focus will be on the second Janna When I was here the last week I was here we uh discussed I discussed the first

153
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:20,320
Janna and um and the second Janna is uh

154
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:27,840
kind of a deeper form of well-being a deeper form of pleasure and joy and

155
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:34,519
happiness And uh one of the characteristics of it

156
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:41,000
um um is that uh

157
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:50,080
uh it is a sense of well-being joy and happiness pity and suka that's born of

158
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:56,640
concentration born of samadei and um born of the state of

159
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:04,840
meditation that comes in the first Janna the joy and the happiness that's there is born of from

160
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:11,840
seclusion from being separated from uh the preoccupations the concerns of

161
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:19,240
our everyday life being separated even more importantly Being separated from unh wholesome

162
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:26,159
thinking to be caught up in the hindrances in greed or ill will to be

163
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:32,960
caught up in in uh kind of a rigid dull mind to be caught in

164
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:40,720
restlessness and regrets to be caught in doubt is unh wholesome And so there's

165
00:33:40,720 --> 00:33:46,799
this delight and joy and happiness when we're no longer caught in the unh wholesome no longer caught up in the

166
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:54,480
mind It's uh the difficulties of the mind and um and uh so part of like and

167
00:33:54,480 --> 00:34:01,120
and they and what's fueling the first John sense is uh vaka and vichara two of

168
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:06,559
the johnic factors of this massage of applied attention and sustained

169
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,720
attention So there is some intentionality there is some giving ourselves to over to the meditation in

170
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:19,638
the first Janna and this joy finally I'm here Oh it's so good to be

171
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:27,679
present and I've been so distracted so caught up in my mind and my thoughts and preoccupations Ah this is good and then

172
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,358
but in order to stay there there is a kind of gentle uh massage of applying

173
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:41,280
and staying applying and staying massaging in this um in the in the

174
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:46,320
second Janna the need to kind of keep applying and sustaining attention is no

175
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:54,919
longer there Um and certainly the applying coming back and connecting again connecting again is no longer

176
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:01,480
needed and also there's a little movement of the mind to stay to ride be

177
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,280
here that is little bit intentionality involved also is not needed because now

178
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,119
we're settled we're kind of rooted here we've arrived ah and the mind is not

179
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:20,640
going to wander off in the second John in the first is that first Janna There can still be some thinking mostly

180
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,920
thinking about the meditation and um the thinking is all wholesome There's nothing unh wholesome about it It all

181
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:34,240
helps us helps us to get connected and be in the practice In the second Jonah uh there's

182
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:41,040
no real need for thinking anymore and the mind now has a lot of space a lot of quiet

183
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:46,160
Some thoughts might arise but there it's hardly anything to pull us away or we

184
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:52,760
don't get caught in them or involved in them and there can be mostly feeling of a lot of empty space beautiful space

185
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,599
clarity in the mind and um so I want to read to you the the the

186
00:35:58,599 --> 00:36:04,119
the classic description of this second

187
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:11,119
gen with the stilling of applied and sustained attention

188
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:20,000
A practitioner enters and abide It's in the second Janna consisting of joy and happiness

189
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:30,240
born of concentration born of samadei calm with calm inner clarity and

190
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:36,200
unity of mind Free of applied and sustained

191
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:44,560
attention free free of thinking and examination free of this kind of so

192
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:50,240
there now there's almost no thinking and so it's characterized by an inner clarity

193
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:58,440
Sometimes the word that's translated as clarity is translated as assurance sometimes as um

194
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,680
confidence and um uh but one of the meanings of it can be clarity the

195
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,880
brightness and uh for me this represents the quiet of the mind of uh thinking has

196
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:17,119
just about stopped and uh and so because there's uh so little thinking that um

197
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:24,800
certainly no discursive thoughts anymore or no conversations within our inner mind the uh it's feeling like the oh

198
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:32,560
that now awareness the mind has a lot of space lot of clarity like the fog has lifted the smog

199
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,560
has gone away and we can see across the vast terrain see the mountains in the

200
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:48,920
distance because of the clarity and um so um the um

201
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:54,400
um and uh and so this is what I said earlier that one of the characteristics

202
00:37:54,400 --> 00:38:00,240
of the second genre there's a real switch now that now we're really here

203
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:06,960
we're settled and um and it feels like we're really arrived we're not easily

204
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:12,240
slipping off we don't need the with the first genre it's very hard to you really

205
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:17,839
feel established too but there is a kind of intentionality of staying there stay

206
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:25,040
here be here stay here and c and Right along ride along Be here And with the

207
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:30,160
first Janna uh this is where some people get in trouble because there's a little

208
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,880
bit of intentionality involved This applied and sustained attention that

209
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:43,599
um that uh if there's uh there can still be some striving some pushing some

210
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:48,880
trying kind of tightening down and uh and so people sometimes are pushing it a

211
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:57,280
little bit And so the joy and the happiness that can arise sometimes gets pumped up or gets uh pumped up and gets

212
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:02,960
to be too much or gets pumped pumped into some particular bottleneck in the

213
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:08,680
body and that some energy can build up there too much There's a lot to do with

214
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:15,680
striving and striving itself is a tightening Something gets tightened when we strive And so the energy of uh the

215
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,440
joy and the happiness gets somehow uh gets compressed or gets blocked or gets

216
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:30,880
somehow uh uh gets interfered with In the second Janna uh uh the the

217
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:36,480
joy and the happiness can get strong um and more likely it gets even stronger in

218
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:44,160
the second and the first But now uh it's less much less likely to uh go arai lima

219
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:49,520
much less likely to be too intense or too tight or too strainful or get

220
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,760
bottlenecked or get kind of blocked or something Uh because now there's uh the

221
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:04,480
intentionality of staying there We're not pumping it up anymore We're not um uh you know um blowing on the flame to

222
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,960
let it become stronger We're just allowing things to be there And in fact uh I'll talk more about this tomorrow

223
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:19,599
The metaphor or the simile for the second Janna has to do with a uh floating in a

224
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:25,200
very peaceful quiet uh uh clear lake Um

225
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:30,880
that is a very comfortable and very clear The water is completely is is uh

226
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:40,000
is somewhat still but uh there is this gentle movement of an underground spring that

227
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,440
refreshes us So the feeling here is there's still some in the in the when

228
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:53,680
it's too intense in the first Janna um there's a lot of movement almost of the joy and the pity in the second uh

229
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:58,960
there's still this movement but it feels refreshing It feels delightful and it

230
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:04,319
has no obstacles to it And this idea that this underwater spring uh in the

231
00:41:04,319 --> 00:41:09,560
lake just has no obstacles as the refreshing water spreads through the

232
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:16,280
body So I'll talk more about this tomorrow uh but um the

233
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:25,200
um the one of the ways I want to emphasize here that one of the lessons of this second Janna is uh to be able to

234
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:33,040
start see clearly the difference between being really you know dipped into the pool of

235
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:39,480
water dipped into the samadei versus coming out of it uh into the thinking

236
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:48,000
mind and how discursive thought um uh conversational thinking Uh it puts us uh

237
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,520
as as sometimes as fascinating and pleasurable that some of those can be

238
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:59,839
There is a kind of uh disconnect with ourselves in that process Disconnect with the wholeness of who we are the

239
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:05,280
fullness of us that's embodied and present here And that part of the

240
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:11,040
movement towards this deeper settling of samadei is to learn how to relax the

241
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,760
thinking mind and trust this deeper place of well-being of subtleness of

242
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:26,720
calmness in the body with the breathing and um and uh and so that the

243
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:32,000
thinking mind is not reinforcing

244
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:38,560
um some of the unh wholesome tendencies of mind The thinking mind is not repeating itself over and over again the

245
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:45,200
same stories and ideas that keep us disconnected from the possibility of a

246
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:51,920
deep kind of uh inner settleness Deep kind of place of being at being calm

247
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,560
deep place of just happy to be alive happy to be present for this moment as

248
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:06,119
it is independent of

249
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:12,880
um you know the concerns about the world around us It's not a turning away from the

250
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:17,960
world uh in a resisting way or escaping

251
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:24,560
way It's a way of starting to cleanse ourselves deeply so that we can come

252
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,960
back into the world in a much better space much better

253
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:36,640
way So we'll go through this different aspects of the second Janna this this uh

254
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:42,160
this week And I hope I'm not expecting you to be dipping into the second Janna

255
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:48,800
Uh some of you might be familiar with it already but um uh some of the individual

256
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:55,800
characteristics of the second Janna can be present in even uh lighter states of

257
00:43:55,800 --> 00:44:01,760
meditation and uh becoming familiar with them can give you a new orientation for

258
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:08,079
ordinary meditation because you can start feeling these qualities characteristics are present in subtle

259
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:14,800
way in a way that maybe you ignored before They never knew to pay attention to it And the more you start feeling

260
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:20,640
these wholesome beneficial qualities within the more engaging it is to be to

261
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:25,800
meditate and dip into this uh this inner world of

262
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:34,880
meditation So thank you very much and um look forward to continuing tomorrow
