3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:24,080
northampton massachusetts on the east coast of the united states which is the land of the nonotuck

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,519
here and i'm very pleased to be with you i teach uh at the

5
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,760
local retreat center which is a insight meditation society about an hour

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:45,039
away from where i am and then across the east coast and i lived for quite some time in the bay

7
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:51,280
area over 20 years and was pleased to also teach at insight meditation center in redwood

8
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:57,120
city when i was there and i'm pleased to be in connection with the sangha

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,359
with the the uh members and teachers so looking forward to practicing with

10
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:08,400
you today so let's rest into our mindfulness practice

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,840
we'll practice until 10 o'clock pacific time

12
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:22,479
and so finding our posture that balance

13
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,840
of ease and comfort in the body

14
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:41,360
as well as alertness and uprightness in the posture

15
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:47,118
and bringing in a sense of dignity also to the posture

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,439
calling to mind the nobility of this practice to infuse the body and the mind with a

17
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:03,360
sense of dignity practice is noble because it's onward

18
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,959
leading towards the development of more compassion

19
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,360
and wisdom and when we have this sense of dignity

20
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,879
in the posture it supports confidence in our ability to meet

21
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,160
whatever may arise even if it's difficult

22
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:36,160
even if it's unpleasant

23
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:44,959
so balancing that dignity with a sense of relaxation

24
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,760
noticing any areas of tightness

25
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:05,840
and inviting in a letting go

26
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:19,840
inviting ease into any areas of holding in the body

27
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:33,680
it can be helpful to begin with an awareness of the whole body

28
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:47,840
that shifting and changing field of sensations we call the body

29
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:01,840
and within that whole field of shifting and changing sensations

30
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:15,840
there are the sensations that we call the breath

31
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:23,919
a wave of ever-changing

32
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:35,680
physical sensations in any moment there might be tingling or softness

33
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:45,520
or tightness or expansion or movement and this

34
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:56,320
ever-changing way we call the breath we can simply rest into an awareness

35
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:03,759
that experience whether we're noticing the breath in the

36
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:09,520
whole body or in an area where we sense it quite

37
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,840
clearly

38
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:25,199
it can be helpful to keep some of the attention well the whole body and

39
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:30,800
really just notice the breath within that larger

40
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:39,840
frame [Music] of awareness of the body

41
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:57,840
and we bring attention to however the breath is presenting itself in this moment

42
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:07,840
and in this moment and in this moment

43
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:35,280
and whenever the mind wanders and mindfulness arises again

44
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:44,560
we can simply notice that mindfulness has arisen again that moment happens outside of our control seated by

45
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,479
previous causes and conditions previous moments of mindfulness

46
00:06:52,400 --> 00:07:00,080
and here we are aware again of what's happening right here and right

47
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:06,560
now and we can notice what mindfulness

48
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:13,599
arises in relationship to whether it's an experience of the mind or the body

49
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:30,240
thinking or an emotion [Music] or a sound or a physical sensation

50
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,840
experience at these six sense stores the five physical senses we're familiar

51
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,080
with and the sixth sense door of the mind

52
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:48,639
where thoughts and images and emotions and moods arise

53
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,319
we can rest our mindfulness there

54
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,919
whenever that experience is not drawing it drawing our attention so strongly simply

55
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:13,840
gently return to the anchor of the breath

56
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:30,720
confusing our mindful awareness with kindness

57
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:44,719
be very supportive and strengthening of the practice

58
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:54,720
knowing that we are sensitive beings

59
00:08:54,720 --> 00:09:02,720
arising at these sense doors unbidden without our

60
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:09,839
outside of our control are pleasant unpleasant and neither experiences

61
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:23,839
and as sentient beings

62
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:34,000
this is this experience of ever changing mental and physical phenomena

63
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:41,519
that's what we much less must meet and over time learn to meet

64
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:51,839
with mindfulness more and more

65
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,320
as a way of relating to our experience

66
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:05,839
that will diminish suffering and harm

67
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:20,160
so each moment of mindfulness allowing for the knowing of what's

68
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,880
arising to be infused with care

69
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:47,839
for our sensitive minds hearts and bodies

70
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:14,639
if we ever find ourselves struggling or in confusion or judgment in the

71
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,560
practice you know those thoughts so i should be being mindful

72
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:27,199
and not being mindful in the right way or simply confused how to do the

73
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:32,720
practice you can remember the simplicity of

74
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,759
mindfulness the simplicity of the instructions not easy but simple simply

75
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:46,480
to be aware of what's happening right here right now in the body

76
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:53,680
and in the mind without pushing it away or trying to

77
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:01,519
cling to it so just accepting and allowing what is

78
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:06,720
arising right here and now in the mind of the body

79
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:16,319
and knowing its presence so if it's frustration or judging that's

80
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,640
here we can simply now frustration feels like this right now

81
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:29,679
it's here it feels like this or judgment judging

82
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:33,840
feels like this right now it's here

83
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:38,000
it feels like this

84
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:46,720
this is the same invitation or instruction

85
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:51,519
or any experience of the body or the mind

86
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,600
if it's an experience of the body tingling tingling is here and it feels like this

87
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:15,840
right now pressure is here and it feels like this

88
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:23,919
so remembering and recalling the simplicity of mindfulness

89
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:33,679
whenever there is any struggle letting go into awareness

90
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:38,799
with non-contention of what's happening right here

91
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:43,840
and right now

92
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:35,839

in modern daily life thank you tara

102
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:05,200
thanks so much kevin and thank you all for practicing with me today

103
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:13,520
i would like to talk about um an approach or a phrase that to me

104
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:19,359
really encapsulates this actually holistic

105
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:24,960
integrated practice that we are doing

106
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:31,119
part of which is our mindfulness practice the holistic practice i'm referring to of course is the noble

107
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:39,119
eightfold path and for me personally

108
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:45,760
it's helpful to remind myself that it is a whole path

109
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:50,800
of eight factors and

110
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:56,800
when i recommit myself when there are moments and times of recommitment

111
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:03,440
there is this framework or approach that really for me embodies or

112
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:11,040
encapsulates that remembering and recommitment and it is a simple um and it is

113
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:18,640
caring enough to truly live that's sort of what it feels like to me and

114
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,839
also i found that i can sort of map all of the factors

115
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:33,599
onto this particular phrase of caring enough to truly live so i want to share that with you that

116
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:40,320
approach and perhaps it will seed some inspiration and perhaps free commitment for you as

117
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,000
well so i'm going to go briefly through each

118
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:52,800
of the factors and talk about how this approach of caring enough to truly live

119
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:59,680
how that plays out for me or how that is enlivening for me

120
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,599
and but first i want to just point to how it also describes for me a way that we

121
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:13,440
feel when we do make that recommitment it describes a sort of a sense of the motivation that often

122
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:20,160
propels us to practice and you know there are these choice

123
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:27,839
points that we sometimes have these inflection points um where perhaps our hearts are

124
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:34,880
calling us to practice to dive a little deeper into practice

125
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:41,920
so for example to practice more intensively or more regularly or perhaps

126
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,440
to take up a new type of practice that our hearts are really drawn to

127
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,839
that we've learned a little about and that would really seem to be supportive or a skillful means for us such as

128
00:38:53,839 --> 00:39:00,160
a brahmavihara practice or the five daily recollections or a concentration practice there are so

129
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:07,599
many so many uh ways in which the buddha taught that would support

130
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:14,880
our whole practice of engaging with the noble eightfold path um but you know we we reach these times

131
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:20,320
in our practice and we can choose to really commit and follow our heart

132
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:27,040
and dive into that practice or sometimes we um falter or become more inconsistent

133
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:35,040
but what i have found that's helpful to recognize is that when there is this

134
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:41,119
act of diving in deeper or recommitting what i feel in my heart is that i'm

135
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:49,599
really caring enough to truly live this life that there is an aspect of caring and an ex aspect

136
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:56,720
of the commitment to life and to truth and so you know just to illustrate

137
00:39:56,720 --> 00:40:03,920
i want to describe one of those choice points for myself

138
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,640
you know um this is going back quite a few years and i had been practicing for quite a

139
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,440
while in my daily life and um over time i had

140
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,839
started to go on short retreats and there was a time where i really did

141
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,119
falter in the practice and i came um came to a quite a commitment in the sense that

142
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:36,240
the practice was really what i needed to focus on and that it began with a health

143
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:42,800
crisis i had you might call it a health crisis or an episode i actually uh it involved

144
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:48,960
having to have surgery on my foot to um actually there was a bone deformity in

145
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:54,560
my foot and that needed to be corrected and in the period leading up to that

146
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,839
and after that in a very long recovery there was quite a time period there where

147
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:06,240
i couldn't walk unaided and i i needed to walk with crutches and many people experience these kinds

148
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:11,920
of difficulties health challenges in life with mobility

149
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:20,240
i was younger and i didn't practice well enough and i was in i suffered a lot because of

150
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:28,160
it i was you know wanting things to be different than the way they were quite a lot of the time and so very much

151
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:34,480
in contention with experience and there was a time where i i just really realized

152
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:41,760
remembering how the practice had supported me in the past in the past that i needed to

153
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,960
really turn back to that practice and try to meet my experience with it

154
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,720
and then um i did that i i began to go on longer retreats and to

155
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,319
practice much more um in daily life and to reach out more to sangha and practice more with sangha

156
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:05,359
but there wasn't even a much starker experience that i had of of really

157
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:12,400
um reaching one of those choice points and committing to the to where my heart was drawing me um in

158
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:18,240
practice and that was um sometime after i recovered i

159
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:24,160
actually found myself being very my heart being really drawn to intensive practice

160
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:31,200
and i decided to take a one month retreat the first one month retreat that i had done and i had the particular conditions uh

161
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:37,119
the privileges in my life that allowed me to to do that to carve out a month from my

162
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:43,760
uh at my workplace a month of vacation and i i went on you know arranged my life

163
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:50,319
and did all kinds of things to be able to do this one month retreat uh and as that

164
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,520
time approached i did though start to feel some trepidations and nervousness and even

165
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,720
some just kind of questioning why am i doing this what am i doing

166
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,000
and that intensified as i came closer and closer to the date at

167
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,040
the beginning of the retreat and you know i was worried about missing my family my

168
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:17,599
my partner my wife my dog and i um

169
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,680
nevertheless drove up to the retreat and i had some extra time and i

170
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:31,119
stopped at a grocery store and still my heart and my mind were filled with these thoughts and worries and i was already missing my

171
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:36,480
family i stopped at this grocery store i went in i came out

172
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,760
and i decided that i had a little bit of time

173
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:49,119
left before i just stay registration started so i would just rest in my car i got into the driver's seat and

174
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:55,520
um i reached down and i uh just climbed the seat back

175
00:43:55,520 --> 00:44:01,440
uh a bit and you know an inclining back i looked up at the ceiling of my car

176
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:07,200
and there right before my eyes were all of these crutch marks on the ceiling all of these

177
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:13,839
marks that had been made inadvertently unknowingly when i had been pulling my crutches into my car over and over again

178
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:20,640
during that time period and at that moment all doubt all thoughts

179
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,480
why am i doing this what am i doing went out the window went out the door i absolutely knew

180
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:33,760
i saw the crutch marks on the ceiling i remembered the way in which i had gone through that

181
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:39,200
stage without mindfulness not really practicing consistently

182
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:46,000
not really knowing doing what i knew in my heart i needed to do to meet difficult experience and

183
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:53,359
i was completely committed i saw the crutch marks on the ceiling i said to myself that's why i'm doing this and you know

184
00:44:53,359 --> 00:45:01,280
encapsulated in that was this knowing of the unreliability of our experience the

185
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:08,800
unreliability of our bodies the impermanence the dissatisfactoriness

186
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:13,920
of life the fact that we we do have pleasant unpleasant experiences

187
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:19,680
and um you know we can't control that we do we can't hold on to the pleasant uh

188
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:25,760
can't make the conditions the way we want them to the conditions are coming towards us and ungovernable

189
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:32,319
and that's so that not self aspect of experience so there was this knowing at that time

190
00:45:32,319 --> 00:45:38,079
and i absolutely never i didn't have another doubt uh thought they flew out of my mind and i

191
00:45:38,079 --> 00:45:44,079
went to that retreat and um the practice continued to flourish from there i was able to

192
00:45:44,079 --> 00:45:50,880
move forward and i in that moment there was a caring enough to truly live

193
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:58,240
there was that energy that motivation to um practice in a way

194
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:03,760
that i knew when my heart would be onward leading for me and for

195
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:09,760
others you know not just for me to alleviate my own suffering but in that time period

196
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:15,359
and my frustration and anger and not practicing well

197
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:21,200
through the experience that i had with you know having difficulty with mobility

198
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,240
and recovery from surgery i wasn't able to be the kind of person i wanted to be

199
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:33,359
in relation to the rest of the world also in my relationships um i my energy was

200
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:41,280
channeled towards frustration and and um was not able to be there

201
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:47,359
and serve my community and also just relate in a way that was was really

202
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:52,560
um ideal in life because my energy was taken up

203
00:46:52,560 --> 00:47:00,240
and in you know being caught in cycles of suffering so i cared enough in in that moment that

204
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:06,560
that well spring of caring enough to truly live to truly follow that um

205
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:12,160
my heart's called towards the dharma you know welled up as i remember that and you know there

206
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:20,640
are poly words for these kinds of mind states that support our that kind of propel us

207
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:26,400
that have bring an urgency to the practice and support a confidence in moving

208
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:33,920
towards it and so there was there was that in those time in that time period for me um

209
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:39,760
the words are some vega which is often translated as spiritual urgency

210
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:45,680
and pasada which is kind of a confirmed faith in the practice

211
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:53,040
or confirmed confidence in the practice and sandega is that knowing that knowing that we

212
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:59,440
have where we realize there is some the way we've been relating to experience has been

213
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:06,800
just causing us more suffering and is not the way through is the way we've been

214
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:12,559
relating with trying to maximize the pleasant you know those habits that we have as human beings

215
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:19,440
responding to the the truth of dukkha the experience of unsatisfactoriness in

216
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:27,920
life by trying to maximize the pleasant or diminish or get away uh um the the unpleasant push it away

217
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:34,880
or just not being aware in our daily lives that response

218
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:40,000
we start to realize that response is not the way that's actually going to bring us

219
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:45,520
freedom or peace and that experience of that knowing

220
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:51,440
is called some vega and then when it's balanced with posada which is some confirmed confidence some confidence in

221
00:48:51,440 --> 00:48:56,800
the practice that that in fact the way to

222
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,800
um to experience that greater freedom and that greater peace

223
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:08,640
is is to practice the dharma is to practice mindfulness in the

224
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:16,400
context of of the rest of the past factors that combination is very potent and powerful

225
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:23,119
and my experience of that is this caring enough to truly live

226
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:29,359
life to truly follow my heart's desire to understand the truth

227
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:36,319
and to engage with this practice so um now i want to just talk a little bit

228
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:41,359
about this caring enough to truly live and

229
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:48,480
how i see it as as mapping onto and relating to our holistic practice of the noble

230
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:56,000
eightfold path so caring i see you know the first two factors of the noble eightfold path

231
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,800
are often referred to as the first basket and they're often referred to as the wisdom basket

232
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,720
and so i actually feel that this basket really points me towards

233
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:14,880
this wellspring of caring and so that may seem a little unusual because oftentimes

234
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:20,240
people sort of contrast wisdom and compassion or wisdom and caring that quite different but when we

235
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:26,480
really look at these um first two factors of the noble eightfold path

236
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:33,359
for me they really point towards the flourishing of caring in our in in our lives

237
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:40,000
uh they they point us towards really beginning with with caring and that that's wives so the

238
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:46,559
first factor is wise view wise view and that is

239
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:51,680
usually mostly described as understanding the four

240
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:58,640
noble truths that's the wise view it's understanding the four noble truths so when we look at this the buddha is

241
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:04,640
one of the first of the buddhist teachings before noble truths and it is based

242
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:11,200
in his own compassion for his own experience of suffering and then his teaching of the the formidable truth

243
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:20,839
out of compassion for us that of compassion for other beings that they could also

244
00:51:20,839 --> 00:51:28,240
understand suffering that they were experiencing and understand that there was this accessibility

245
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,319
of cessation of suffering of peace and ease so the four noble truths in a nutshell

246
00:51:34,319 --> 00:51:43,200
are there is dissatisfactoriness stress unreliability in life because our experiences

247
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:49,839
are ephemeral and we don't control them for example that is part of our experience

248
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:54,960
it's the first noble truth and that's to be understood and then the second noble truth

249
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:01,839
is that there is a cause or an origin for that dissatisfactoriness that suffering that

250
00:52:01,839 --> 00:52:07,760
dukkha in pali d dkha that there is a cause in its craving

251
00:52:07,760 --> 00:52:15,359
craving for example for sense pleasure is craving for becoming over and over trying to solidify our experience

252
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:20,480
craving also for non-becoming to really push away at the unpleasant

253
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:26,480
rejected and this is the second noble truth and then

254
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:34,720
the third is that there actually is a um a cessation of that suffering

255
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:40,640
and it's the letting go of that same craving and the fourth is the noble is actually the noble eightfold path

256
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:45,680
that that is the path to the cessation of suffering so this practice has this beautiful

257
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:51,520
non-linearity to it this cyclical nature and um

258
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:57,680
so this understanding you can see you know of wise view that that the four noble truths are

259
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:03,760
rooted in an experience an expression of compassion by the buddha himself

260
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:09,280
and as we practice them they are also an expression of compassion for ourselves

261
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:17,359
because we are addressing um we are recognizing and addressing and training our minds and our hearts

262
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:23,760
we're recognizing addressing the suffering and then training our minds and hearts towards greater ease and peace

263
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:31,520
and towards the cessation of that suffering there could be nothing more sort of caring than really really making that

264
00:53:31,520 --> 00:53:37,440
commitment to actually understand what causes our suffering and respond to it

265
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:42,559
and and so that's that to me is caring and the second factor of the noble april

266
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:48,640
path is really directly about about um carrying mind states

267
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:56,240
and cultivating them so this is wise intention or wise resolve and there are three wise

268
00:53:56,240 --> 00:54:03,520
intentions that this factor of the noble eightfold path calls on us to cultivate the first is

269
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:10,400
renunciation or simplicity so that means letting go of our greed

270
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:17,520
impulses that cause us suffering in the world also so renunciation or simplicity and that

271
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:25,359
intention is the first and the second two are the intentions of loving kindness and harmlessness so loving kindness

272
00:54:25,359 --> 00:54:32,400
that simple wish for well-being for ourselves and others and harmlessness really relating

273
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:37,839
dropping that intention of non-harm moment by moment and what could be more caring for

274
00:54:37,839 --> 00:54:44,480
ourselves in the world than to cultivate these kinds of intentions um

275
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,880
in in relationship to our own experience and not of others so this is caring in the in the first

276
00:54:50,880 --> 00:54:56,000
basket it is a caring that's infused with wisdom it's based in wisdom

277
00:54:56,000 --> 00:55:01,280
it's based in this understanding of the of the four noble truths but it is

278
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:07,839
infused with caring um also so caring enough caring enough well

279
00:55:07,839 --> 00:55:13,599
to me the enough points to the second basket of the noble eightfold path

280
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:21,440
which is you know um acting on this caring acting on these

281
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,280
intentions following through and so the second basket is called the basket

282
00:55:27,280 --> 00:55:34,000
of ethics or virtue it is really a

283
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:42,640
three factors a combination of three factors which point to um non-harming conduct

284
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:50,000
you know so bringing the non-harming intentions and the caring into our lives and infusing our daily

285
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:56,000
uh relation our relationship to the world our relationship to others our relationship to ourselves

286
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:01,119
interestingly to into you know bringing that

287
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:06,960
really acting on those intentions so the factors the three factors of this

288
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:12,000
second basket are why speech wise action and wise

289
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:19,280
livelihood why speech referring to speech truthful speech so abstaining

290
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:27,520
from false speech all of these are really framed in the abstaining as we drop our habits of harm our lives become to

291
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:34,160
begin to be infused by not harm and caring so abstaining from false speech

292
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:41,359
abstaining from harsh speech abstaining from divisive speech even abstaining from idol chatter where

293
00:56:41,359 --> 00:56:46,480
we are more likely to fall into perhaps us habits

294
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:53,280
that are harming and why is action really pointing to um some of the

295
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:59,440
other uh precepts the typical five ethical training

296
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:06,000
precepts for lay people that many people are familiar with but those are abstaining from

297
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:13,040
killing harming other beings abstaining from taking that which is not freely

298
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:20,559
offered so abstaining from stealing and abstaining from sexual misconduct

299
00:57:20,559 --> 00:57:25,920
right and then wise livelihood to not make a living in a way that is based on

300
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:31,599
harm or deceit so this basket is is this that

301
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:37,440
action of caring enough to infuse and imbue your life with

302
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:43,599
non-harming conduct and one of the most beautiful things i think about the teachings

303
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:51,280
is that this practice of ethics of virtue is one that the

304
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:57,119
buddha taught so that we would experience joy it was about non-harming for ourselves

305
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:03,599
just as much as others because there's a recognition that when we do engage in harm and

306
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:11,920
conduct there is an impact on our hearts and minds that we feel a remorse even if it's

307
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:16,960
underneath the surface it's even if it's sort of subconscious

308
00:58:16,960 --> 00:58:23,119
we there are ripple effects of of a sense of dis-ease in our hearts and

309
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:29,200
our minds so this this particular basket is caring enough for ourselves and

310
00:58:29,200 --> 00:58:36,960
others really and i just want to quote a couple of lines from the dhammapada because i i

311
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:42,559
like to really bring home this teaching this truth that the buddha taught

312
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:48,799
non-harming conduct for our joy so these are a few lines from the dhammapada

313
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:56,480
the buddha said live the dharma a life of good conduct one who lives the dharma is happy in

314
00:58:56,480 --> 00:59:02,400
this world and the next so he equated in this line living the dharma is

315
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:08,079
equated with a life of good conduct and it brings happiness

316
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:14,400
you know what it brings is non-remorse he also said one who makes merit rejoices in this

317
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:19,920
life rejoices in the next rejoices in both worlds

318
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:27,599
seeing one's own pure acts brings joy and delight it brings joy and delight so this is

319
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:33,760
caring enough and caring enough to truly live so that

320
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:39,839
brings us to the third basket of the noble eightfold path the last three factors

321
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:47,440
and and mindfulness is here in this basket and to truly live is to truly be aware actually of what it

322
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:52,960
is to be a human being what is happening and arising in our experience moment to

323
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:59,520
moment so there's this way in which when when we're not mindful we're not practicing this

324
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:05,119
meditative cultivation and we're not practicing you know really

325
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:14,319
cultivating awareness more and more this is a way in which we don't quite feel alive right we know we're separated from

326
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:20,000
our experience we know we're we're not really living it and we're not really

327
01:00:20,000 --> 01:00:25,280
understanding the truth uh when mindfulness is not it's not it

328
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:32,559
when we're not actively cultivating that mindfulness that awareness that we fall back into habits of non-awareness

329
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:39,119
so my so caring enough to truly live this third basket of truly living uh

330
01:00:39,119 --> 01:00:46,000
is referred to as the either the concentration or the meditation basket it has three factors

331
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:51,520
it's wise effort wise mindfulness and wise concentration

332
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:59,599
and all of them involve this cultivation of the mind so that

333
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:07,280
we begin to understand what it is to live the life

334
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:12,480
of a human being what is the experience of life

335
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:19,520
and how it is that we can cultivate how it is that we

336
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,839
can cultivate our minds train our minds so that we experience

337
01:01:25,839 --> 01:01:31,760
less suffering more peace more ease

338
01:01:32,559 --> 01:01:39,200
and so how it is that we can truly live the our you know our hearts intention of

339
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:46,960
living a life um that is one in which we can really

340
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:54,799
meet our experience with that caring we can really meet our experience with that caring and that understanding it's a wise

341
01:01:54,799 --> 01:02:00,079
effort this is getting to know

342
01:02:00,079 --> 01:02:06,400
our wholesome and unwholesome mind states and getting to know and beginning to

343
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:12,160
understand how we can uh abandon the una wholesome which means those kind of mind states

344
01:02:12,160 --> 01:02:20,799
that harm us those that's what's uh that's what's unwholesome so for example um afflictive mind states

345
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:28,000
like impatience afflictive mind states like really rage or there's

346
01:02:28,000 --> 01:02:33,200
you know fear that gets in the way that limits our potential

347
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:39,039
so those nine states we can feel the the harm of those in the moment so this wise effort is

348
01:02:39,039 --> 01:02:44,720
beginning to understand how to recognize abandon those those more and

349
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:50,000
more over time by seeing how they show up in our lives

350
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:57,680
and beginning to understand how we can abandon them and when they do arise just to um

351
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:04,000
overcome them and also this wise effort involves

352
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:09,920
you know uh recognizing bringing bringing forward wholesome mind states

353
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:16,000
so those that are non-harming um that loving kindness i talked about earlier for example

354
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:21,599
gratitude joy these kinds of non-harming mind states

355
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:28,079
understanding over time developing the skillful means to cultivate those more and more and have

356
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:34,880
them arise more and more in our lives and then wise mindfulness where many of us are very familiar with

357
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:42,000
you know mindfulness and this is again about really understanding our experience and

358
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:48,720
and truly living in the sense of truly being there for our lives more truly being aware um

359
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:54,160
and not only that this mindfulness allows us to understand the truth of the way

360
01:03:54,160 --> 01:04:00,720
things are deeply and more intuitively over time as we practice more and more with being

361
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:06,079
aware of what's happening moment to moment and not pushing it away

362
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:13,760
and not trying to cling to pleasant experiences the more we see the actual ephemerality

363
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:22,160
of experience the deep the more and more deeply and intuitively we can understand impermanence and that deep

364
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:28,640
understanding then allows the heart to let go of its habitual entanglement

365
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:33,760
and suffering and reactivity to that impermanent experience

366
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:43,119
so this is truly living the sense of truly beginning to understand the mind's capacity for freedom

367
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:50,720
you know the mind's capacity to understand more deeply the truth and to let go

368
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:57,039
and you know bringing us back to the beginning of the noble evil path to understand more and more the four

369
01:04:57,039 --> 01:05:05,440
noble truths including the third one of letting go of that craving that keeps us on that wheel of some

370
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:13,359
you know and that some sorry suffering and finally wise concentration um

371
01:05:13,359 --> 01:05:20,799
so that is really this gathering collectedness of the mind that supports supports all of the

372
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:27,680
factors really that supports mindfulness and and wise effort it's it's

373
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:33,280
just this um collectedness just coming back again and again and again um oftentimes

374
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:40,160
experienced through a continuity of mindfulness it's the unification of the mind the collective the gatherness it brings

375
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:47,119
stillness to the mind in fact um some people are of the view that this

376
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:53,280
word that is often translated as concentration samadhi is

377
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:58,880
mistranslated as concentration and should be concentrated it should be translated as stillness

378
01:05:58,880 --> 01:06:05,680
so you can think of it as the growing stillness of the mind as we practice wise concentration

379
01:06:05,680 --> 01:06:14,319
so in this last meditative basket of the noble eightfold path

380
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:19,680
of wise effort why is mindfulness and wise concentration

381
01:06:19,680 --> 01:06:25,839
i see the potential for all of us to really truly live and truly live a

382
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:31,039
life that is not harming towards ourselves and others and that

383
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:37,119
is not harming because we begin to really have a deep understanding

384
01:06:37,119 --> 01:06:43,280
of a deep understanding of the truth of the way things are and that living in alignment with that

385
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:49,440
truth and truth of impermanence of not self of the unreliability of our experience

386
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:55,599
that that is what brings great happiness and also brings us in alignment with our

387
01:06:55,599 --> 01:07:01,920
care for the world for other beings and infused with that our care for

388
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:07,680
ourselves so friends uh dharma friends i hope that

389
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:14,640
this framework might have been of some inspiration to you caring enough to truly live as a way of

390
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:20,720
thinking about or pondering the noble eightfold path and i wish you a wonderful rest of the

391
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:26,400
day of practice
