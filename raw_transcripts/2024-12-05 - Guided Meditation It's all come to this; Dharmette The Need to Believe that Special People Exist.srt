meditate which is maybe fortunate timing maybe not but uh here here we go so uh

to recall all the moments of

8
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:25,439
willingness all the moments which you've offered your heart

9
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:31,400
up to the Dharma all the moments of uh

10
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:39,880
sitting or lying down meditation or walking or Retreat or listening to

11
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:44,920
talks or being with Dharma

12
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,560
friends I realized yesterday I've been practicing for

13
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,398
exactly half my

14
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,160
life so just as we

15
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:24,599
begin gather up uh all the goodness

16
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:32,280
from your practice just bring it right in front of

17
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:43,120
you feel it let it seed your

18
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,840
mind

19
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
e e

20
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:29,479
now all those moments of practice

21
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:42,479
all the moments of [Music] pain of uh greed and hate wisdom

22
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:52,240
love and it's all come to this

23
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:26,960
and so in attending to this moment we actually honor bless all of that

24
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,638
gently tending to your life

25
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560

26
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520

e e

28
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:05,919
the question how might it have been

29
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:12,120
otherwise becomes uh

30
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:26,360
meaningless just this breath

31
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:45,839
body our life as it constellates in this moment

32
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,160
gentle

33
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,160
nonviolent with

34
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:18,000
uh all

35
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
experience

36
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320

37
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320

e e

44
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:31,959
we plot out our

45
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:37,040
pleasure budget our pleasure as a way

46
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:44,000
of taking the edge off the intensity of The Human

47
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:54,800
Condition devise way is out

48
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,959
of anicha uncertainty

49
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:06,079
game out the contingencies

50
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,120
is try to soothe ourselves into

51
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,399
safety we reash the

52
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:33,440
past trying to think our way through it so as

53
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:39,920
to digest it learn its

54
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:57,279
lessons such innocent movements of mind

55
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:02,120
who could blame

56
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:30,639
us but there's a deeper refuge on offer

57
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,360
go for

58
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
Refuge

59
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840

60
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840

e e

72
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:09,960
just letting the Winds of Change blow right through

e

82
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

83
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
for e

84
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:50,320
okay um so uh good to sit with you

85
00:29:51,120 --> 00:30:00,480
um so I read um Rachel kushner's uh recent novel

86
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:06,360
creation Lake um last week and

87
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:12,200
um there's a line that that um struck

88
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:18,919
me uh she she writes one of her characters says um Charisma Charisma

89
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:27,159
does not originate inside the person called charismatic it comes from the need of

90
00:30:27,159 --> 00:30:34,080
others to believe that special people

91
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:43,600
exist kind of heart leapt up at that line and

92
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:50,840
uh and it um invites the question in in my mind like what is what is my need to

93
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:56,120
believe in special people

94
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,960
is idealization making of special people is idealization

95
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:11,679
just a facet of the human mind and there are certainly people who

96
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,799
Express particular gifts certain we could say parames you

97
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:23,720
know uh but special people special people that gets us into the realm of

98
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:29,240
projection and idealization and comparison

99
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:36,320
special people uh turns a quality into a person

100
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:45,000
turns a a verb into a noun so what what is it what is it about

101
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:50,039
our need to believe that special people exists where does that

102
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:55,120
come from and and what what are the

103
00:31:55,120 --> 00:32:00,639
pleasures and also the ca of

104
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:10,480
idealization and for each of us to consider you know like what what is

105
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:19,960
your default assumption about yourself your power your relative place

106
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:25,399
amongst the special people whever they

107
00:32:25,399 --> 00:32:32,000
are and how do you position yourself in relation to

108
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:37,360
specialness some people identify with the special ones I

109
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,120
want to be on that team some people want to own the special

110
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:48,440
ones some people are sexually titilated by specialness some people get

111
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:56,279
competitive and want to tear something down specialness evokes jealousy and

112
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:03,000
some self death doubt in others arrogance in yet

113
00:33:04,039 --> 00:33:11,120
others and in reflecting on it struck me like maybe part of the belief in special

114
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:19,039
people comes out of the Dynamics of of childhood you know

115
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:25,440
where our lives depend on the power of

116
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,720
others you know and we so want a a parent or caretaker

117
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:40,240
to be omnipotent to control you know like our our

118
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:49,679
safety is contingent on their power our safety increases with their

119
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:55,600
power and the disillusionment and uh or fear

120
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:01,600
engendered by the realization that uh this parent this person this

121
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:09,320
caretaker this whatever not special very human this parent very

122
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:18,040
human this person doesn't exert much control over the world at

123
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:26,720
all and then we grow up but as Adam Phillips um once

124
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:32,720
commented um adulthood is not a cure for

125
00:34:33,399 --> 00:34:39,118
childhood and we're kind of left in a way with an

126
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,240
unresolved relationship to

127
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:51,118
specialness and maybe there's some transitional role for

128
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:59,640
idealization uh seeing someone as special but that can't be the last word

129
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:06,320
and part of Dharma practice is about untangling

130
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:14,920
specialness and goodness maybe we say specialness um

131
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:20,800
requires a self and goodness does

132
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:31,680
not sometimes uh teachers uh start to think that they are the

133
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,839
goodness or that they own it or something like that but it's it's just

134
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:43,920
nature refracted through a particular body you

135
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:51,800
know and by the way if you like have some theory that I'm like massively

136
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:57,200
shading Gil and Andrea or something that's not it this not this not this is

137
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:06,319
just r AEL Kushner got me started you know it wasn't like I saw something horrible or you know

138
00:36:06,319 --> 00:36:12,839
right so okay we start to notice the the

139
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:19,880
uh the childlike longings that that lead us you

140
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:26,240
know to put special ones on pedestals to make

141
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:32,040
them special and um and it's not like we have to

142
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:38,640
we're disparage a person we look up to but we notice the movements of our mind

143
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,319
in relation to specialness and we do this in part

144
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:51,599
because we know specialness can never be

145
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,599
sustained there's always [Music] disillusionment and part of spiritual me

146
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:05,000
maturation is opening to some measure of ambivalence that is the kind of Hallmark

147
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:12,640
of the human realm loving even amidst

148
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:18,800
ambivalence a love that's a little less

149
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:25,560
naive less and less specialness but there is reverence you

150
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:33,079
know the reverence is not

151
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:41,119
um it's it's not really for a person it's it's it's for goodness

152
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:51,640
itself and that still you know seeing

153
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:59,440
goodness that makes me want to get on my knees but I'm not bowing to special

154
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:06,480
to touch into goodness to actually feel it let it reverberate with our own

155
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:13,040
hearts that doesn't bolster or threaten selfworth at

156
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:19,920
all that doesn't make me feel less than as I look

157
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:25,880
up and that doesn't evoke the urge to possess or to be on that team it's just

158
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:32,520
a kind of Deep honoring I know goodness when I see it

159
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:38,440
you know I don't need to deify it into some form of specialness I don't need to

160
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,960
turn into a

161
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:52,000
noun but there's something in in that kind of you know and and this can be goodness

162
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:58,160
of of a million different varieties but in that kind of full

163
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:05,000
full recognition of uh of goodness we we

164
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:13,839
partake in it you know we partake in it it's it's like two two Bells

165
00:39:13,839 --> 00:39:17,599
resonating at the same

166
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:28,240
frequency and uh nothing is owned no selves are needed comparison

167
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:35,319
that the whole grammar of comparison is a million miles away so beside the

168
00:39:35,319 --> 00:39:44,319
point yeah maybe say this like mudita some way sympathetic

169
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:53,680
Joy our aspiration um becomes more and more

170
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:59,240
about being ordinary than becoming

171
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:05,760
special you know special is just the the charade the egoic

172
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:13,680
charade but the the parame me is they feel so ordinary from the

173
