1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,680
so hello hello everyone and

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,960
welcome warm welcome

3
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,320
and uh there's all these warm good mornings and

4
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:33,760
hellos on the chat and i appreciate them all as a large

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:39,600
network of warm warmth greeting goodwill that we're

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:46,480
participating in here whether you're on the chat or not so thank you

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,280
so imagine that

8
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,600
there's a door that it's a glass door

9
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:05,600
and that glo glass door has never been cleaned

10
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:14,799
and you don't really know what's on your other side but because it's so dirty you can't see

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,960
and then it occurs to you to wash it you clean the door

12
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:27,600
and all the dirt is on the inside where you are and lo and behold you can see

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,159
i see out and there's a beautiful

14
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,240
beautiful natural setting wow that's pretty cool

15
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:46,720
and then it occurs to you to open that door and all you do is open it big door you

16
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:54,600
open it wide and now you stand gazing upon that natural setting

17
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,600
and in a way it's easy to forget that the door is open

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:07,119
the door is clean there's a clear view because the natural setting is so so

19
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,399
beautiful and such so interesting and you've never seen it before

20
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,840
but what is uh then then the evening comes and you look out the

21
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:25,200
door and you see the sunset and wow never seen a sunset like that

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:30,879
and then you go there late in the evening when it's dark and you look out and

23
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:37,840
it's spectacular to look out that open door and see this the night sky and the stars

24
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:45,840
and then you're there early in the morning dawn and you see little birds and little animals coming out and

25
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:53,280
it's so special you didn't know it's wonderful to have a clean and now even an open door

26
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,440
at some point it dawns on you how special it is to have a clean door

27
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,560
how special it is to have an open door the openness of the door

28
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,840
is special the openness of the door is

29
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:18,519
certainly allows you to go in and out but allows you to see unobstructedly

30
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,040
so when we do mindfulness practice in part it's a cleaning of the of the

31
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,959
glass so we can see clearly but it becomes more than just cleaning

32
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:37,519
it at some point it becomes opening the door opening wide

33
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:44,239
and not only being amazed or not of what you see through

34
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:50,080
the open door but to be

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,040
appreciating that the door is open

36
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,080
the open door doesn't need to be open or closed the door doesn't need to be open and closed

37
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,280
the space that's the open door doesn't really

38
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:13,439
is not ruffled concerned contracted repulsed by anything that's seen through

39
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:20,560
the open door and so the same way in our

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:27,360
when we can let go of our clinging let go of

41
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:35,440
needing so something to happen doing something all the time and just find the open door in our minds

42
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,479
and our hearts we can gaze upon things

43
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:47,280
simply we can also gaze upon the openness

44
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:56,759
where nothing is needed where there is space

45
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,479
where there is freedom where there's no obstruction

46
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:08,880
where there is no resistance

47
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:14,479
and this can be in the nature of how we're aware

48
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,680
so assuming a meditation posture

49
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:33,759
and assuming that your door is already wide open

50
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:43,440
really assuming that's the case no matter what is happening it's just seen in the

51
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,560
vista through that open door

52
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:55,840
whatever thoughts agitations have whatever reaction you have to my words

53
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,720
whatever attention you have in your body nothing needs to be different

54
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,479
for now for a few moments here

55
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,319
nothing needs to be different

56
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:24,400
except imagining you're seeing it through an open door clean open door

57
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:30,120
and everything is allowed to be itself

58
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:41,680
and the gift that we give when we look out the open door in the natural setting it is a kind of gift to let each thing

59
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:47,360
in the natural world be itself not to appropriate it or do it or

60
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,039
improve it just be the natural world be

61
00:06:53,360 --> 00:07:01,240
so yourself at this moment whatever is happening

62
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,160
let it just be

63
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,720
whether it's comfortable or uncomfortable something you desire or don't

64
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,720
desire it's just the view through the open door of the

65
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,720
mind

66
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,560
any attempts to do something

67
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:58,479
is this it can be just seen through the open door that doesn't need

68
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:05,280
anything to happen he can just marvel and see

69
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,759
the attempts to do something or to get away from something fix something

70
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:18,639
judge something it's just part of the natural setting

71
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:23,240
that is seen through the open door

72
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:04,360
so

73
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,800
so

74
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,959
so

75
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:56,320
the door is always open

76
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:07,360
it helps to remember that we're seeing through it

77
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:11,560
until all things

78
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,440
so

79
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:44,120
foreign

80
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,000
so

81
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:23,120
and as we come to the end of the sitting imagine you're sitting in a easy chair

82
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:29,200
relaxed at ease gazing out upon

83
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,559
through an open door not into a natural setting

84
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:40,880
and how it is to be at ease nothing to do calm

85
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,320
settled and if you don't feel that way now you

86
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,919
might adjust your posture so you'll be more comfortable

87
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,799
for these last few minutes

88
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:16,559
and imagine again you're sitting quietly peacefully

89
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:24,480
gazing upon a natural setting and then you turn that gaze inward

90
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:31,000
as if you're looking within the natural setting within you

91
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,080
looking inward into the depths of your hearts

92
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:44,000
into a place within where you recognize your ability to be

93
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,559
friendly

94
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,200
whether that's through thoughts feelings intentions

95
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,000
through a warmth or an inspiration

96
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,360
friendliness gazing upon

97
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,760
all things in a friendly way

98
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:26,919
looking upon yourself

99
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,960
in a friendly way being your own friend

100
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:48,880
and looking out into the world to be a friend to the world

101
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:56,559
not an enemy to anything

102
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:05,279
but a friend and as a friend

103
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:09,399
as an expression of friendship

104
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:16,000
to have well wishing for this world

105
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:23,200
may all beings be happy

106
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:30,398
may all beings be peaceful

107
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:36,278
may all beings be safe

108
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:42,240
and may all beings be free

109
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:50,360
so they can know an open door

110
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,240
for their life

111
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:06,869
[Music]

112
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,720
so

113
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:23,700
[Music]

114
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:28,600
thank you

115
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:57,440
so coming this last week on the sati patana suta the discourse on the

116
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:04,559
foundations for awareness for establishing awareness

117
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:12,480
so i want to uh to tell you a little bit about this text is it's kind of uh cliff notes

118
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:19,200
it's kind of it's uh it doesn't go into you know great ex explication of what's really being

119
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:25,440
taught it's more like brief statements and uh and then down through the

120
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:31,279
centuries teachers have then expanded on it and clarified it for people

121
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:40,240
used it as a basis for giving instructions and those underst the instructions the understanding have changed over time or

122
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,919
the text is amenable to many different ways of understanding and interpreting

123
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,120
and maybe that's one of the reasons why it's remained so popular is that it's uh

124
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:56,720
you know it is more notes where the meat of it is

125
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:01,440
comes forth in the teachings that are received about it

126
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:09,358
when i was in the first many years that i studied this text and enjoyed it

127
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:15,679
um what i kind of the the lens or the interpretation that i used to under

128
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:22,878
understand it i had a lot to do with the very common verb expressed in the text

129
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:29,200
which is repeated many places in the different exercise is

130
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:36,480
to understand or to know uh paganiti to know

131
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,679
and and there's so many of the instructions were to know something

132
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:50,480
not to fix it not to be concerned with attaining anything or getting anywhere

133
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:57,599
it was not about judging anything or having commentary about things but just to know the simplicity of it

134
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:04,400
and i came to appreciate how powerful it is to just be present for something to know it to be aware of

135
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:12,079
it giving it the gift of allowing everything to be itself

136
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,079
rather than we are becoming free maybe you'll never be free

137
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,560
what we do though is that we give freedom to everything else and everything receives our freedom from

138
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,839
us including our inner life so much so that maybe there's no sense

139
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:37,359
of talking about a self doing it it's everything is given

140
00:35:37,359 --> 00:35:42,640
its freedom to be itself and

141
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:48,960
and so i found it so freeing and so satisfying to have this very

142
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:56,079
clear present moment awareness that was just abiding in the present allowing things to be as they are

143
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:02,320
it was very freeing very nice then as time went along

144
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:07,839
i came to appreciate more and more a different aspect of the sati patano suta

145
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:13,440
and that is that i understood it now as uh describing a

146
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:20,000
journey and it begins by saying there is a a um

147
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:25,359
is nowadays popular to say the beginning is there is a direct path

148
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:31,520
for the purification of beings for liberation and

149
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:38,160
and another way of understanding the word direct here literally means the word one

150
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:43,359
is um in the early you know the first things translators did it is

151
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:49,200
there's one way and uh and that kind of it was a little bit jarring for many of us just there's

152
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:54,400
only one way and then became the direct way but i think

153
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:01,680
that nowadays interpreting it more and i think it's very likely what it originally meant the word one here

154
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:06,880
we meant unified there's a unified way and all these parts of ourselves get

155
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:13,440
unified all these practices all these four foundations get unified and work together

156
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,960
but they and they work together in part as a journey as a path that unfolds over time

157
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:24,640
and there's a number of things in the sutta that to me suggest a path that we follow

158
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:31,280
and and one of them is that just the idea of going from body to the

159
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:37,119
feeling tones to mind states to the inner activities of the mind the

160
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:42,960
dhammas is um it goes from the uh goes kind of from the outside

161
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,040
into the depths of who we are i mean to the deeper deeper areas only we can see

162
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:55,440
so with the the body uh that's you know you can see each other's bodies we can see our body other

163
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:02,240
people we can see people's bodies externally and a lot of it has to do with things

164
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:07,839
that we feel and sense maybe a little bit more um in our

165
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:13,920
physicality feeling tone and that's what that's the way the ancient world talks about it

166
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:19,200
it's the physical aspect the other three foundations are often seen as as a part

167
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,200
of the inner mental world so the feeling tone

168
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,480
is uh something a little bit deeper it's like how the world has impacted us

169
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:35,839
um and in a way of that it's pleasant or unpleasant or is uh

170
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:42,800
you know welcoming or not welcoming it's a little deeper kind of the deeper re uh consequence in ourselves for

171
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:48,240
feeling something we're not neutral it has a kind of effect on us

172
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:53,359
more deeply it's the state of our heart the state of our cheetah our mind

173
00:38:53,359 --> 00:39:01,440
that is maybe more intimate more personal than just what happens in our body

174
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:09,119
and and then more deeply it becomes the operating system the operating activity of the mind

175
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,960
that is really the linchpin for everything else and how we relate to

176
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:20,240
everything and how we live in this world and the choices we make and

177
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:27,280
and so that going from the body feelings mind states to adamas is this journey i like to think of a

178
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:33,920
journey home coming deeper and deeper into ourselves to the place where we can make a difference

179
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:40,480
or the practice can really make a difference to transform something very deeply and the transformation in this fourth

180
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:47,920
foundation foundation is a transmission is represented by the transformation from the

181
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,040
being caught in the five hindrances to being uh in

182
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:59,680
having awakened the seven factors of awakening and one of them leads to

183
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:04,800
they say to darkness the other leads to light one leads to

184
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:11,799
obscuring wisdom the other to revealing wisdom

185
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,920
so this journey and the other place where the journey is manifested is in the refrain we

186
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:25,040
talked about many weeks ago and each of the 13 exercises has a refrain it's the same refrain

187
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:31,119
and it begins by kind of once we're settled

188
00:40:31,119 --> 00:40:38,480
and the awareness is strong then there's ability to kind of be 360 degrees aware within ourselves outside

189
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:44,640
of ourselves internally and externally

190
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:51,280
and then as we settle further then the they're starting to see the changing

191
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:58,800
nature of phenomena and we see things arise and then as we also see things cease

192
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:05,599
and then we see things arising and ceasing together it's a kind of a journey to deeper and deeper stillness

193
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:10,800
until the rising and seizing happens together and then we go deeper still and there's

194
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,240
a deep kind of equanimity of just just a clarity of mind

195
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:21,920
just a clear awareness lucid awareness and just enough knowledge to know what's

196
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,920
happening in the moment in the most simple possible ways it's a mind that's very equanimous very

197
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,599
peaceful very at ease where then at some point because of that ease

198
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:40,880
there's no more effort to protect ourselves or build ourselves up or try to have something or to be anyone

199
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:48,240
and something deep in our psyche can release that the tradition refers to as clinging

200
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:53,440
and clinging to nothing whatsoever in the world

201
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,480
so it's a journey of awareness that we do so on one hand in the early years i

202
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:04,960
thought of it there's no journey just being present for what is and then later i came to appreciate that described a

203
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:11,520
journey and then i came to appreciate how these work together that as we practice just being present

204
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:17,440
for things as they are uh giving each things the freedom to be its

205
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,480
own thing not trying to manipulate anything or change anything just to see it and see

206
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:28,400
see this this this just that not needing anything to change

207
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:35,440
that involved that brings about change and one of the ways it brings about change is that

208
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:43,119
uh we're actually no longer doing the common human thing of always

209
00:42:43,119 --> 00:42:49,280
instigating the change always trying to fix and maneuver and get and understand and you know figure

210
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:55,119
out or analyze or plan the whole world whole

211
00:42:55,119 --> 00:43:00,240
domain of human activities comes to a rest when we all we do is be

212
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:06,560
present not trying to do anything not doing anything is a radical thing

213
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:13,040
and it's kind of like this house of cards has been built and we're holding in place running

214
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:18,480
around keeping all the cards in place when we stop doing that everything settles and the cards come to rest on

215
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:25,280
the table and the the the house of cards that we built is often one that's not needed

216
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:33,040
or we don't need it all the time and to be always shoring it up and building it up is exhausting

217
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:38,560
and so the very practice of being present for things as they are without needing to change anything just

218
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:42,640
appreciating that um

219
00:43:44,400 --> 00:43:50,400
begins a process of change and it puts us on a path

220
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:56,560
of maturing in this practice and you almost can't

221
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:02,960
can't avoid maturing in this practice if your your practice of mindfulness of

222
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:09,119
attention is sincere and if you're practicing a certain

223
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:15,440
thoroughness or certain um wholeheartedness or a certain kind of

224
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:22,240
um persistence like this is what you're doing and and so

225
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:27,440
day by day week by week month by month the practice of mindfulness just being here

226
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:34,559
practicing meditation every day something settles just being present for what is

227
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:40,560
the advantage of having the sense of a path is that it's a little bit encouraging to

228
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:46,079
kind of give ourselves to the practice more fully to know that it's leading to a good place

229
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:52,480
the disadvantage is that people will huff and puff and strain and expect and be discouraged because they're not going

230
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:59,119
the way they want the advantage of just being present for things as they are

231
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:04,560
and just not just being aware of them in a simple way is it's a very freeing and relaxing

232
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:11,520
the disadvantage sometimes is that people don't have a sense that of how far this practice can go how

233
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:18,240
radical transformation it can bring about in us and so they shortchange themselves

234
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:25,280
they they don't kind of let their inner system um go through the open door

235
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:30,319
they don't let the kind of like the ch the uh there there's something inside that is

236
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:36,480
held in check or not really allowed to kind of let go and move and flow

237
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:43,760
because that maybe can happen easier if we know there's an open path to walk

238
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,480
open door to walk through so there's different ways of kind of

239
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,720
interpretations for understanding this text and many more than what i said but for me this has been very important

240
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,880
this distinction between um or this the distinction and then the harmony

241
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:09,280
between these two very different modes of practicing sati patana one is just being present for things as

242
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:14,880
they are and that's it and the other is being present with the uh with the

243
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:23,359
orientation towards a path of practice that we're developing and because it's a unified path

244
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:30,880
um we include everything everything comes together into this

245
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:36,880
open space of awareness practice

246
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:42,560
so thank you very much and we'll continue with a summary or

247
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:49,720
conclusion for this text for the rest of the week thank you
