1
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:15,599
so good day everyone and the way we could say perhaps a good year

2
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:22,320
and kind of like good morning good beginning of this new year for us on this

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,599
7 a.m sitting and teaching so i'm happy to be here for this anniversary day and so we'll have a zoom

4
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,880
meeting afterwards and for those of you who don't want to be on zoom

5
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:42,879
i think i'll just keep the youtube on and you won't necessarily

6
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:50,800
get all of it but you'll get half of it of myself responding and talking and a little bit and and um and

7
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:57,760
uh the zoom link is the is at the very top of this chat and i'll

8
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,199
post it near the bottom when we finish here as well it's also found on the imc

9
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:10,159
website in two places in the calendar section of it from where it's listed as an event and

10
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,159
on the what's new there's a little notice also in the bottom right hand side

11
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:24,080
of the home page and if you use those links you have to use the password which is meta m-e-t-t-a if you use the link

12
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:30,079
that's on the chat you got a picture right there and i won't turn it on until i finish here so

13
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:35,280
there might be a minute or so in between

14
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:45,040
so so

15
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:58,799
as a child i spent a lot of time swimming in water and i loved to go underwater and

16
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,040
swim as far as i could without and holding my breath and that explains maybe a little bit why i

17
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,479
um a little bit i pay a tiny bit attention to

18
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,520
people who do free diving and people who do records for free diving

19
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:21,840
underwater the longest the deepest distance down into the water or or in

20
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,760
the ocean or perhaps a whole you know swim the longest underwater or be longest underwater

21
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,760
and i think they're one of the records i believe for staying underwater without breathing is about 11 minutes

22
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:40,560
so it's kind of phenomenal that people can train to do that but one of the things that people who do

23
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:45,599
that learn to do is to quiet their thinking

24
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:54,080
because thinking takes up a lot of oxygen you need a lot of energy and to think and um and so they

25
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,080
they're certainly aware and engaged what they're doing and very hyper attentive to what they're

26
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,840
doing in a very particular way um but uh their ordinary

27
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,080
um energy draining battery draining uh app has been turned off the

28
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,239
discursive thinking the commentary that they do

29
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:24,879
and so this also happens in meditation it's one of the reason why in deeper meditation it seems that we stop

30
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,959
breathing because there's very little need to breathe when this

31
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:36,239
heavy app that we have that's really kind of going on all the time in the background and

32
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:44,400
you know it's one of these apps that kind of take over and and work even you know

33
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,560
behind the scenes uh our thinking app so to uh to as we get into meditation

34
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:59,760
the idea is to enjoy it settle into it and settle into that

35
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,360
enjoyment into the contentment into the quiet into the peace of it even if it's just hints of it

36
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,480
kind of orient kind of a paradigm shift where we're orienting towards something else

37
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:18,959
besides our thinking and we're orienting towards the breathing and the peacefulness the

38
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:25,280
quiet the stillness the the joy and the contentment that comes

39
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:32,639
from developing samadhi and with that there's a shift away

40
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,720
from the thinking mind the commentary mind the dis having discussions and plans and

41
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:46,720
memories and all that and so to appreciate the value of that appreciate how good it feels to let that

42
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:54,000
part of the mind go quiet and if these deep sea divers can do it certainly we can do it as we do our own

43
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:00,160
kind of version of deep sea diving which is dipping into samadhi deeping it

44
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:05,840
dipping deepening into this kind of states of goodness and wholeness

45
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:12,080
that don't require us to think think a lot and when we realize how safe it is and

46
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:20,479
good it is and nourishing it is then we begin to let go of the the tremendous

47
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:28,560
interest the mind has with this app the thinking app so

48
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,199
to assume a meditation posture

49
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:42,400
and to relax tremendous amount of what we're doing in

50
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:52,000
the going into samadhi is in fact relaxing letting things become tranquil

51
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:57,039
not only letting go and relaxing the body

52
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:05,520
but also taking some of the mental apps offline they're not needed or energy drains for

53
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,720
human battery and they can come back online again

54
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:16,560
later but we're letting go or relaxing

55
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:23,600
doing less and less except for us settling in steadying

56
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,280
ourselves on the breathing and enjoying it

57
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:39,199
so taking a few long slow deep breaths on

58
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:46,160
the exhale thinking of it as turning off

59
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:54,240
so much of the unnecessary apps we have running the tensions in our body

60
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:59,199
softening the shoulders especially

61
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,400
softening the belly

62
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:17,120
and if you are taking some deep slow breaths then as you stop that appreciate that

63
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:21,680
you are letting go of that effort

64
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:31,840
and now you're just letting yourself breathe in a more easy way

65
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:42,080
and then to continue relaxing the body a

66
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:48,319
bit the surface body of the shoulders the

67
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:51,360
face the belly

68
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:04,720
and deep in the body the deep holding resistance bracing

69
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:13,599
the deep holding ourselves

70
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:27,840
even holding ourselves together

71
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,599
and then to also

72
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,839
orient yourself to the quietude of the mind

73
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:57,760
let's let yourself become aware in the ways of the mind is quiet

74
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:02,320
clear relaxed

75
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:14,320
and as you exhale settle into that quiet

76
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:23,279
letting go of the thinking mind and if it doesn't let go completely it's

77
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:29,360
okay for now let it recede into the

78
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,839
background

79
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:50,800
and then with the mind let the mind land on your breathing

80
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,399
and have the mind the attention

81
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,560
find uh establish yourself to be steady on the breathing

82
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,120
steady the mind on its focus on the

83
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,399
breathing and much of our physical experience of breathing

84
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:30,720
is in fact silent doesn't require thinking the silent feeling and sensing

85
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,240
of the body steady yourself on that experience of

86
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:44,839
sensing the changing flow of sensations as you

87
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:47,839
breathe

88
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:09,440
as you exhale letting go of your thoughts and letting go into

89
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:15,839
a quiet steadiness on breathing

90
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,720
and if you use any thoughts at all let it be thoughts of counting the

91
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:28,880
breath counting up to one or up to 3 or up to

92
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:35,680
10 or simply the word yes

93
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:43,839
so said so quietly in the mind that it's almost like you imagine you're saying it

94
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,320
steadying yourself on the breathing and whatever good feelings that come

95
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:11,839
with the quietude and steadiness breathing in and breathing out

96
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:12,320
appreciating the quietude that's here even if your mind is

97
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:17,680
thinking a lot look past it

98
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:24,240
to the quietness steadiness of attention on breathing

99
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:32,639
a paradigm shift away from your thinking mind

100
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:39,040
to a quiet steady awareness of breathing

101
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:51,839
and whatever goodness is in that attention

102
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:09,440
switching from thinking to a quiet seeing

103
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:16,639
a quiet sensing aware of breathing

104
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:33,840
steadying yourself on the breathing

105
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:32,369
[Music]

106
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:52,960
and then as we come to the end of this sitting appreciating the paradigm shift from

107
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,520
thinking to seeing

108
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:03,360
seeing with the quietness of the mind

109
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:10,000
so we're not seeing through the filter of our thoughts ideas opinions

110
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,640
but we're seeing through the quietness

111
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:23,039
steadiness and safety of

112
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:32,559
simply seeing simple awareness of what is

113
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:40,320
and in the maybe the comfort and safety of meditation

114
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:47,279
can you turn the gaze of this quiet

115
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:54,640
steady seeing awareness

116
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:04,158
to the people in your life

117
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:14,240
those who are close and you have contact with those who are far away and you don't have direct contact those who you know

118
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:17,840
personally and those who don't

119
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:31,039
and see if you can simply from meditation gaze upon them

120
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:40,080
quietly silently without the judgments and the stories

121
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:48,480
anticipations of what it means just gazing on them quietly

122
00:29:52,559 --> 00:30:00,720
and see if that gaze that awareness can be kind that in the quiet and safety of

123
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:09,840
privacy of your own meditation a kind steady gaze

124
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:16,880
be still and gaze upon all everyone kindly

125
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:30,320
not complicating it with your stories ideas memories plans

126
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:37,840
just the simplicity of others

127
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:51,600
and perhaps that kindness then can be expressed in the words of

128
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,039
kindness you might repeat after me

129
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:05,840
may they be happy

130
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,360
may they be safe

131
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:24,480
may they be peaceful

132
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:36,799
may they be free

133
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:50,440
may all beings everywhere be happy [Music]

134
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:01,649
[Music]

135
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,760
you
