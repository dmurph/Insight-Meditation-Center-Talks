1
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,120
so warm hello here at the beginning of our

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:18,880
week and happy to be back with all of you and have this chance to

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,519
share the dharma the teachings the meditation

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:32,558
so one of the i would say most central

5
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,640
features of early buddhism the buddhism that you find in the

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,160
teachings of the buddha as saved in that the tradition we're in the therabad and

7
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,079
buddhism this penitential feature is this idea of

8
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:57,840
on one hand not causing harm and the other hand doing what is

9
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:04,799
doing what is wholesome and and kind of

10
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:12,000
everything the whole tradition kind of centers on this and and i'll talk more about

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:19,759
that in a little while but for the meditation uh this is also an orientation that

12
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,799
we're sitting here really to care care for the world

13
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:31,520
but in particular we're learning how to care for the world by first foremost in a sense caring for

14
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,759
ourselves in meditation is a is a

15
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:42,799
way of learning how not to harm

16
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:49,840
and instead to learning how to do what's beneficial and wholesome

17
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:57,280
and there's something about the uh heightened attention

18
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,560
sensitivity to the details of our direct immediate experience

19
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,560
that gives us a new information but maybe better information about how to

20
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:14,640
orient ourselves to towards avoiding harming ourselves

21
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:21,120
and instead bringing benefit so if this is the

22
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:29,200
as a fundamental principle or purpose of this early buddhist meditation practice everything one does

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,480
in meditation can be evaluated through that point of view

24
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,280
is what i'm doing now beneficial is it harmful

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,360
and sometimes it's not always clear if that's the one or the other so then we just kind of keep following

26
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,640
the instructions and doing it but it also implies to how we're

27
00:02:54,640 --> 00:03:01,760
practicing that is how we're doing the instructions are we doing it in a way that is harmful

28
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,159
in a way it is beneficial and harmful can be

29
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,760
too high expectations or being critical of oneself and

30
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,879
if one kind of wanders often thought to be angry with oneself

31
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:25,200
those are all ways of harming oneself or having high expectations and insisting i have to have a certain

32
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,840
experience in pushing and having greed for meditation experiences any kind of greed

33
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:37,680
or attachment to what we're going to attain is a kind of self-harm if it's not

34
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,879
obvious now what part of what happens in meditation practice is we have

35
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:48,239
a higher and higher sensitivity to what is where the harm is where the

36
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:55,120
stress is and we learn to slowly let go of that and and be able to come into greater and

37
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:03,040
greater beneficial states um and it's transformative to do so

38
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,720
the um and we realize that the harmful ways in which the mind operates

39
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:14,000
the heart operates are really not necessary

40
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:21,120
and that's expanding expending unnecessary energy and that it's quite wonderful and

41
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,840
appropriate to move into states of being that are

42
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:32,560
beneficial and if we want to care for the world it turns out that the more we can learn

43
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,199
to do this for ourselves the more we have the more we have to offer the world the more we have

44
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:44,479
a way of meeting the world that does the same thing

45
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,160
so

46
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:57,120
to begin with a meditation posture

47
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,240
that seems um

48
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,800
i see some some messages of the sound is low yeah i'll try to speak a little louder and there might be some setting that

49
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:18,479
later on we can adjust here i don't know so assume a meditation posture

50
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:25,120
that um

51
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,280
you think will be beneficial for you

52
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:39,199
and what's beneficial includes what helps you to be attentive

53
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,560
aware present

54
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:53,840
so there's a kind of attention through the body

55
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:03,120
so [Music] gently closing your eyes

56
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:12,639
and then i usually instruct to take a few long slow deep breaths but as you do so

57
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:21,360
can you do it in a way that just feels beneficial feels like a good thing for you to do

58
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:29,360
not overdoing it deep inhale

59
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,840
appreciating the full

60
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,560
breath in

61
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:50,880
appreciating the release of the breath the exhale

62
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:04,720
and then to let your breathing return to normal

63
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:14,639
and perhaps you find it beneficial a way of even caring for yourself

64
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,080
too quietly as you exhale

65
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:25,599
relax different parts of your body

66
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,840
perhaps you can soften around the forehead and the eyes

67
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:45,840
the eyes don't have to do any looking when we sit in meditation

68
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:53,199
the organ of perception we use more than seeing is sensing and feeling

69
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:59,039
through the body

70
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:04,400
as you exhale to relax the other muscles of your face

71
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:17,680
in the long term it's beneficial to let go of tension in the body

72
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:26,720
and if you can relax your shoulders

73
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,400
or soften some of the muscles around the

74
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
shoulder

75
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:58,000
perhaps softening the belly relaxing

76
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:23,839
perhaps as you exhale to release tension in the arms and the hands

77
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,240
as you exhale maybe releasing the thighs

78
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:51,839
legs any holding or gripping there

79
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:07,839
and then turning your attention more fully to the experience of the body breathing

80
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,680
breathing there are many circumstances in life

81
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:21,920
where one of the best things we can do for ourselves is to breathe consciously

82
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:33,839
with awareness it can be grounding and settling

83
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:44,839
he can protect us from wandering off into thoughts and mind states which are not

84
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,079
beneficial even harmful sometimes

85
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,480
the buddha said that mindfulness of breathing brings great benefit

86
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,160
and perhaps as a way of getting closer and

87
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,399
more intimate with the body's experience of breathing

88
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,839
maybe a quad may let the thinking mind become quieter

89
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,040
and perhaps there can be a deep appreciation

90
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:43,839
of breathing maybe even a love

91
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:51,040
of this body of ours which has been breathing and keeping us alive

92
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:57,440
for many years and in a sense returning

93
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,079
the favor

94
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:12,639
by being present acknowledging experiencing fully

95
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:24,320
the body breathing

96
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:32,399
and letting go of your thoughts every exhale so you can better

97
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,839
settle yourself when breathing in and breathing out

98
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:54,320
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

99
00:25:55,520 --> 00:26:04,080
whatever we learn in meditation about not harming ourselves

100
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:15,840
is directly learning something about not harming others

101
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:21,278
whatever we learn about benefiting

102
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,080
ourselves orienting ourselves to wholesome states

103
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:36,400
of mind is directly related to our ability to

104
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,840
have wholesome states of mind as we encounter other people

105
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,639
states of mind which are beneficial for them as well

106
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:58,320
and appreciating that these two are mutual and almost

107
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:05,919
maybe not exactly the same but closely related benefiting oneself and

108
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:11,679
benefiting others to understand that meditation is not

109
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:18,720
only done for oneself but knowingly and or unknowingly

110
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,720
it also brings benefit to the world

111
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,960
and one of the ways to benefit oneself

112
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,880
is to wish to bring benefit to the world

113
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:40,559
to have well-wishing good will

114
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,520
a simple care and so as we come to the end of the

115
00:27:53,520 --> 00:28:00,840
sitting allow yourself to be still and quiet as

116
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:08,158
possible and gaze upon the world with kind eyes

117
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:16,399
with a caring heart

118
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:23,919
and perhaps we can all wish that the benefits of this meditation practice

119
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:32,398
spreads out from the meditation into the world which we encounter today

120
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,360
may it be that the benefits of this meditation

121
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:47,360
brings benefit and welfare to others may all beings be happy

122
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:52,799
may all beings be safe

123
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:59,840
may all beings be peaceful

124
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:05,840
and may all beings be free

125
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,158
and may we contribute to this

126
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:30,010
[Music] possibility [Music]

127
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,919
you

128
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:23,840
uh

129
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,840
um

130
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:41,519
okay so now their sound sorry

131
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:47,840
forgot to turn it on again after taking my drink of water

132
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,200
so the um

133
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:07,279
so i'm going to tell a semi-story there's a beginning of this and

134
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:14,960
um i call it a semi-story because what we often find in the discourses of the buddha is we find

135
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:22,320
the context is set up for the buddha to teach and that context is a little story about

136
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,279
who the buddha encounters in their situation what they ask him and and then the buddha responds and so

137
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:35,039
it's not really a full-blown story but exactly but but so the semi-story that

138
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:41,120
begins up begins this teaching that initiates this teaching

139
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:47,679
is uh the people of kalama the buddha has this

140
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:52,720
very famous text called the kalama suta and some for some people it's their

141
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:59,279
absolute favorite discourse of the buddha and there was a

142
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:06,880
wonderful zen teacher by the name of yvonne rand who is now dead but

143
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,120
she was very much involved in trying to address the ethical issues in

144
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,640
western buddhism in the united states here in the 70s 80s

145
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:28,399
90s a very ethical wonderful teacher and she made a rather dramatic statement

146
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:37,200
that this particular discourse the the kalama sutra

147
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:43,440
should everyone should have a tattooed on the inside of their eye eyelids so she wanted it to people to

148
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:49,120
always know it and have it close by and one of the reasons for this is that

149
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:54,799
what i'm going to teach in a moment is a protection against

150
00:33:54,799 --> 00:34:01,679
some of the more dangerous ways that people can adhere to religious teachings

151
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:08,158
it doesn't have to be dangerous but historically in human history there's people that are here for these reasons

152
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:13,358
can create tremendous problems so um

153
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:19,919
anyway the buddha is in the territory of the kalamas and they come out to see him and they

154
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:26,560
ask him a question they say in our town lots of different religious teachers of

155
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:32,480
different kinds come through and they all kind of are saying this is the truth this is the truth and whatever

156
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,878
everybody else is saying is not true and how is it buddha that we can

157
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:44,240
discern know which of these teachers is teaching the truth and which of them

158
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:50,720
is not so what criteria can we use for for understanding who's teaching the truth

159
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,240
or not and and so um

160
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:04,079
the buddha first offers criteria that we should not use for this purpose and

161
00:35:04,079 --> 00:35:10,799
and then he does a very interesting thing he changes

162
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:17,920
directions or he he puts aside this question about truth and untruth to

163
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:27,839
offer something which for him is more primary so anyway so the criteria that you should not go by

164
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,800
you should not use for deciding what is true and and false is to go by

165
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:42,560
tradition the religious tradition that you're part of the teaching lineage so you shouldn't go

166
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:48,480
because it's traditional the lineage you know your particular teacher lin your teacher and your teacher's teacher

167
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:54,160
just because you're adhered to this particular lineage political party or whatever it might be

168
00:35:54,160 --> 00:36:00,960
don't take that as automatically is true don't go back to true because it's popular it's the

169
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:07,920
common view of the times don't go don't take it as true because

170
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,760
it's in the scriptures sacred texts don't take it as a criteria criteria for

171
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:19,760
what is true because it's logical you've worked it out logically and therefore it must be this way

172
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:24,839
used reason don't go by

173
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:31,599
intuition preferences and don't go by the reason of confidence

174
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:39,839
of the speaker so a speaker who's very competent and eloquent and clear and and seems to really understand

175
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:47,040
what's happening don't just simply believe it because you think that speaker knows

176
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:53,839
and then finally i don't believe something's true or untrue because the

177
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:59,040
person saying it is your teacher so at this moment i'm your teacher

178
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:05,359
in a sense i'm teaching and you're listening so please don't take what i'm saying

179
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:12,880
as either true or false just because i say it is not a reliable source of to to really know for yourself this

180
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,960
is true or false and and in replying this way before you

181
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,838
replies this way the buddha says to the kalamas

182
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:30,640
it's reasonable that you should have doubts about what is true and not true so he really appreciates them they're coming to him with this question

183
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:37,680
so he gives this list of things but not to go by and then um he um

184
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,520
he offers his own criteria and so here not the criteria for what is maybe what

185
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:50,000
is true or not true but maybe this is implied but probably what the buddha is doing here is he's if that's the case

186
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:56,000
he's changing the whole either changing what is defined what he means what's meant by

187
00:37:56,000 --> 00:38:02,400
truth or he's he's has his own idea of what truth is which he doesn't explain in a text

188
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,838
or he's simply

189
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,880
changing the the flow of the conversation to be what he emphasizes instead of

190
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:20,800
focusing on what is true and not true that what is religiously true and religiously not

191
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:29,440
true as statements as beliefs or something that's a little bit outside of oneself that that's not his interest

192
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:36,400
and um and rather he says that um here's

193
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:44,720
the buddha's criteria is that is it harmful or beneficial

194
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:53,440
both in in and of itself and also he says does it lead to harm or does it lead to welfare

195
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:58,720
is it wholesome or unwholesome

196
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:04,880
and and do the people who you think are wise are they critical of this or not

197
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:11,599
critical in this so it doesn't mean that you take what the wise say as being true

198
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:18,640
but you do have respect for what they their point of view and if they're critical of something

199
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:24,000
then maybe it's time to look more carefully and and pause

200
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:30,079
and is it praised by the wise and then maybe you don't necessarily

201
00:39:30,079 --> 00:39:35,119
believe it then either but maybe then it's worthy of further investigation

202
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:42,000
so but the core the core thing here is it uh is it harmful or beneficial

203
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:49,040
and i can't underscore how much and how i think wonderfully this is the central kind of

204
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:55,040
pivot or orientation that the buddha has he's not so

205
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:01,520
interested in religious truth religious doctrine but rather he's

206
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:06,720
interested in what we can know for ourselves

207
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,000
that is harmful that brings harm or brings welfare

208
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,560
and to it's a radical thing to fully brought

209
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:25,839
all forms of harming to an end in ourselves i mean what a fantastic

210
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:32,640
thing you look at what read the newspapers and see how much harm human beings are

211
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,319
inflicting on each other and then there's you know the ass mounts more harm that

212
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,839
never makes it into the newspapers into the news

213
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:49,200
and um and to to be a person who doesn't inflict harm

214
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:56,640
on themselves or someone else is a phenomenal thing i think it's like you know a gymnast at

215
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,880
the gymnastics you know some it's such a beautiful such an amazing thing to have worked through and

216
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:09,359
found a way where there's no inclination no tendency to cause harm

217
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:15,200
and maybe the opposite we are inclined to do what's beneficial

218
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,680
what brings welfare to ourselves and to someone else and so there are all kinds of lofty

219
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:28,319
religious states we can attain there's all kinds of wonderful perspectives on life and ex experiences

220
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:37,760
we can have that people say are spiritual or religious and these aren't to be devalued

221
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:45,760
in and of themselves but i think in this criteria the buddha has one wants to be careful not to assume

222
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:53,280
that that gives us a privileged access to what is true and what is false

223
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:58,720
unless it has taught us something from the buddhist point of view be very careful

224
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:04,960
for the buddha those states also are evaluated looked at what does this teach

225
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,400
us about how to live a life that is beneficial

226
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,000
that avoids harm over and over again that's what the buddha is interested in

227
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:23,119
so you could in modern english ideas say the buddha is more interested in

228
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:31,440
ethics than he is in religion he's interested in how people act and how people behave

229
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,680
and and and and to do so both behave with our

230
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,160
bodies our speech and also in our minds that don't cause any harm but what makes

231
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,319
it kind of beyond ethics is that is the thoroughness in which the buddha points to that's

232
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:55,359
possible to do this that the the level of peace the level of

233
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:02,640
of well-being and happiness the level of freedom that's possible when there's no

234
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:08,240
inclination to cause any harm is a in his experience of radical

235
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:14,640
non-clinging non-compulsion of freedom and liberation

236
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:21,839
and so this potential this possibility which is kind of a phenomenal uh human capacity and

237
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:27,520
possibility but it doesn't matter if we so much if

238
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:33,200
we take the buddha's path all the way to its end what matters is that we're practicing a

239
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:41,599
life of doing what is beneficial avoiding what is harmful and to do it

240
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:47,920
in a beneficial way so part of this teaching then also

241
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:53,839
is not only beneficial and harmful but also to really make a distinction between

242
00:43:53,839 --> 00:44:00,720
what is unwholesome and wholesome and that is going to be the theme for the next couple of weeks

243
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:07,280
on these 7 a.m sittings and teachings is i want to look at this

244
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:13,520
very important topic that the buddha concept of the buddha of wholesome wholesomeness and

245
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:18,720
unwholesomeness and this week it'll be that

246
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:30,000
and there's an alternative translation for this pali word kusala k-u-s-u-u-l-a

247
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:38,079
so sometimes it's translated as wholesome and unwholesome and sometimes it's translated as skillful and unskillful

248
00:44:38,079 --> 00:44:46,079
and for this first week i want to look at the it as wholesome and unwholesome and next week is skillful and unskillful

249
00:44:46,079 --> 00:44:53,680
and this is a a um pivotal orientation for

250
00:44:53,680 --> 00:45:00,560
all of the buddha's teachings and to really understand uh this idea of kusala and akusala and

251
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:06,160
understand it well gives you access to really begin kind of it's like the key to understanding so

252
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:11,839
much of what the buddha is about and if you understand these two the two things together

253
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:17,040
the avoidance of harm and doing what is beneficial and the notion of wholesome and

254
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:24,319
unwholesome then you're well on the way to discover what the buddha is all about independent

255
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:31,119
of feeling that you have to know what is ultimately religiously and doctrinally

256
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:39,200
true you're on the way to become a person who is true true in that they're free

257
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:44,800
of the causes of harm and filled with these beneficial ways of being in

258
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:50,560
the world so that's an introduction for what's coming up and

259
00:45:50,560 --> 00:46:01,760
i look forward to our time together and thank you
