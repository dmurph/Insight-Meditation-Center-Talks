1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,600
so welcome to our monday night

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,319
drama talk

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,480
and so what i had in mind today is to

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,799
maybe unpack this poem um

5
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,000
a little bit together and just reflect

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,119
upon this poem that i just

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,160
uh read

8
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,720
and so i said that this poem sometimes

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,920
and the title is translated as a single

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,760
excellent night or an auspicious day

11
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,520
the first time when i read this poem and

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,000
i was

13
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,039
very touched

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,199
without knowing anything about this poem

15
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,320
the context of

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,360
it and the significance of it

17
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,120
i took this poem with me on

18
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,719
to various locations i read this poem

19
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,080
to the dharma cistern who's

20
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,640
in the in the hospital bed

21
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,840
and i took this poem and read it

22
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,359
at the memorial service

23
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,040
and i took this poem to my heart

24
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,200
i memorized it and reflected upon this

25
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,960
and so maybe i'll read the discipline

26
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,320
one more time

27
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,799
and then we'll kind of unpack this

28
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,280
together

29
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,720
and now unpack one stanza at a time

30
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,799
it's an auspicious day

31
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,280
the buddha said don't chase the past

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,479
or long for the future the past

33
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,840
is left behind the future is not

34
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,600
yet reached right where it is

35
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,280
have insight into whatever phenomenon

36
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,120
is present not watering

37
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,400
and not agitated by knowing

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,800
it one develops the mind

39
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,480
argently do what should be done today

40
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,879
who knows death may come tomorrow

41
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,760
there is no bargaining with mortality

42
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,160
and

43
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,200
his great army

44
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,280
whoever dwells thus ardent

45
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,800
active day and night is

46
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,640
says the peaceful sage one who has an

47
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,830
auspicious day

48
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,899
[Music]

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,120
so so what does this

50
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,159
mean to not chase the past

51
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:05,840
or long for the future

52
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,800
past is left behind the future is not

53
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,360
yet

54
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,760
reached

55
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,120
we all probably have experiences of this

56
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,239
and where we

57
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,879
might be chasing the past or lying for

58
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,360
you the for the future

59
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,560
right and for me

60
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,840
right away what becomes a vivid

61
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,760
is you know for

62
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,120
most of us when we are

63
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,480
getting older and older

64
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,280
we chase the youth that we used to have

65
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,760
and we really long for the use where we

66
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,640
had before

67
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,040
and name is pandemic it's probably not

68
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,560
hard to feel this kind of

69
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,840
lying for the past

70
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,280
or the future and the vacation

71
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,599
the vacations that you used to have

72
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,320
where you can travel to different places

73
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,280
and we can't be chasing the past

74
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,600
in this way you know whatever

75
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,360
accomplishments that we may have had

76
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,080
in our earlier careers and work and job

77
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,680
family or maybe even

78
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,400
you know you were the dance champion in

79
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,840
high school

80
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,240
and so in the suta and this is the maj

81
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,880
manika

82
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,280
yeah one one and let me see 131

83
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,960
where this poem shows up and the buddha

84
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,960
explained this

85
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,280
how does one chase after the past

86
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,720
and he said one gets carried away

87
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,919
with the delight of

88
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,120
in the past i had such a form or such a

89
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,000
body

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,199
in the past i had such a feeling

91
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,919
in the past i had such a perception in

92
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,360
the past i had such

93
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,080
a thought fabrication or mental

94
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,680
formation

95
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,600
in the past i had such a consciousness

96
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:39,840
this is called chasing after the past

97
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,240
i don't know if everyone is familiar

98
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:44,960
with this particular formula

99
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,720
and in that the buddha is

100
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,240
pointing at how one gets stuck

101
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,080
in the past and getting carried away by

102
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,639
it

103
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,840
endless ways that are related to

104
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,280
ourselves through this um this list

105
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,440
that's called the five aggregates

106
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,280
those are the things that we often

107
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,800
identify as

108
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,160
ourselves i mean

109
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,880
this is me

110
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,800
and i'm struck by the key word that's

111
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,680
being used

112
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,919
here um by the buddha and that is

113
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:30,479
and he defines how one chases the past

114
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,720
by that one would take delight

115
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:37,440
in the past

116
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,720
and this form of a taking delight could

117
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,680
be you know

118
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:45,360
and really getting um

119
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,800
consumed by the past in that

120
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,800
you know that may be pleasant

121
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,880
experiences we had

122
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,080
before and who we were before in the

123
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,120
past

124
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,400
and this taking delight

125
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,199
could also happen even when it's

126
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:04,479
unpleasant

127
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,280
it experiences unpleasant history

128
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,680
we could be defined by those

129
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,440
and when we're being defined by them

130
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:22,560
we get hooked by the past

131
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:30,319
even when we do not like them

132
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,479
you know sometimes um i can see

133
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,520
you know and then and sometimes i had a

134
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,800
certain recognition

135
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,120
that you know i used to be this way i

136
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,919
really didn't

137
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,120
didn't like it but somehow being really

138
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,440
annoyed by it

139
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,639
i actually get hooked by how

140
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:55,680
i and how i get myself identified with

141
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,479
those

142
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:01,599
and so this is taking delight in

143
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:04,960
the past this way or that way that

144
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,360
we how we are and how does one

145
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,039
not chase after the past and the buddha

146
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,039
continued by saying

147
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:17,840
well if one does not get get carried

148
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:18,639
away

149
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,080
with the delight in the past

150
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,879
in that and i in the past i had this

151
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,000
kind of a form

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,360
or the feelings and perception or the

153
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,320
mental formations or the consciousness

154
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,680
and then this is called

155
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:37,440
not chasing after the past

156
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,320
and so the formulae is quite simple you

157
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,000
know if we stop

158
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,519
being consumed to stop taking delight

159
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,040
in the past and we no longer

160
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,300
have that kind of um

161
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,839
[Music]

162
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,680
uh force

163
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,760
in us to begin to chase the past anymore

164
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,040
so so this recognition that

165
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,880
there is a possibility there is a choice

166
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,399
not to get swept away in the past

167
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:17,360
so how do we really do that

168
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:22,320
in our meditation practice in our

169
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
mindfulness practice

170
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,240
when i began to notice that

171
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,279
one is being hooked

172
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:34,320
by the memory and by the history by the

173
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,839
stories that were lived

174
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:39,680
in the past and that's when we began to

175
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,080
have

176
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,360
a choice well we see

177
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,360
wow you know here here i am

178
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,560
but i'm hooked by this story and i

179
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,360
recognize this is happening

180
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,760
when we begin to recognize that this is

181
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,120
happening

182
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,640
this is where um

183
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,680
detaching from

184
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,720
being taking delight in them

185
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,959
or detaching from being

186
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,480
attracted by the past the story of the

187
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:18,320
past

188
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,440
we can begin to loosen the hook with

189
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:24,880
it and often

190
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,399
what happens is when we're being mindful

191
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,279
we can for example rest our attention

192
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,040
in the body shifting from the stories of

193
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,320
the past

194
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,680
to what's happening in our body

195
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,240
then the memory and the images that came

196
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,839
from the past

197
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,920
can simply become kind of a

198
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,720
ripple that flow through in our

199
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,959
awareness

200
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,440
there's no need for the story of the

201
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,079
memory

202
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,519
and the the past to take a foot

203
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,000
in us so it's possible that

204
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,160
you know our mind may have a thoughts of

205
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,240
the past or the stories

206
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,250
but they don't have to be a problem

207
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,160
[Music]

208
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,560
it's when we begin to take delight in

209
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,240
them and really being

210
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:27,040
consumed by them that we get swept away

211
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,360
but when we're aware we can see

212
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,880
the memories as simply memories

213
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,160
they flow through like clouds in the

214
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,959
wide open sky

215
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,120
and similarly how does one

216
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,480
long for the future the buddha used a

217
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:52,320
similar language

218
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,880
no one one gets carried away with the

219
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:56,160
delight

220
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:59,040
in the future you know i might become

221
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,320
this way

222
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,839
i might become that way

223
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:09,040
and that this is becoming this is

224
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,160
what in the sutra it says this is called

225
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:17,120
placing expectations on the future

226
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,000
we all have this kind of experience in

227
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,880
our own

228
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:25,839
lived experience right

229
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,240
and maybe

230
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,639
there are lots of examples that we can

231
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,000
take

232
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
we're not comfortable with what is

233
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,560
happening here and now

234
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,079
sometimes we construct

235
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:49,839
a future in our head

236
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,600
and then we hook onto this

237
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,160
kind of constructed experience and we

238
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,720
really go after that

239
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,360
and to pull us out of what is happening

240
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:07,839
in the present experience

241
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,639
and so there's a form of expectations

242
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:16,639
in the future here's a construction

243
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,880
of um

244
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,519
it is a form of a mental construction

245
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,000
and we can believe in them so strongly

246
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:28,880
that they

247
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:35,839
become almost real for us

248
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,880
and similarly the buddha kind of

249
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:39,920
explained

250
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,120
you know how not to place expectations

251
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,959
in the future

252
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:48,959
and and and the the same formula was

253
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:52,320
prescribed by not

254
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,880
do not get carried away with the delight

255
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,600
in the future

256
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,720
and it's easy said and then dumb

257
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,040
you know we all know that and it's very

258
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,079
easy to fall

259
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:11,360
into this form of a taking delight

260
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,440
but what it takes is to become

261
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,120
recognized that this is happening

262
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:20,000
you know maybe expectation expectation

263
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:23,600
or projection is happening

264
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,880
and allow ourselves to then rest into

265
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,639
the field of awareness

266
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:34,639
to simply notice projection being

267
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,360
projection

268
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:42,040
and planning being planning our

269
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:46,639
expectations being expectations

270
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,199
sometimes they're really momentary maybe

271
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:51,920
they're just

272
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:55,839
one or two thoughts they come and go

273
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,839
just like a snap of the finger

274
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,480
but if a feed onto them you know

275
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,199
continue

276
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:06,639
to plan and

277
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,240
tell our stories and

278
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,880
and this can become something really big

279
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,680
take us away

280
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:21,920
but when we began to see

281
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,440
this expectations the simply being

282
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:28,320
expectations the thoughts as a thoughts

283
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,600
there is a real sense of lightness

284
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,519
in all of this experiences

285
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,759
and so the next stanza the buddha

286
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,199
brought us back

287
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,639
to where where it is here and now

288
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:50,160
why right where it is have insight

289
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,079
into whatever phenomena is present

290
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,240
not fattering and not agitated

291
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:09,519
by knowing it one develops mine

292
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,959
and it's disappointing that

293
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,440
this is this moment is where we live

294
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:20,000
the present moment the present

295
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,440
experience

296
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,360
the present phenomenon is

297
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:30,320
where we live and this is where

298
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,040
insight

299
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,279
can happen and this is where we practice

300
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:41,199
this is the field of our practice

301
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,440
but very interesting though in the sutta

302
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,360
it says that even in this

303
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,240
practicing with the present experience

304
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,480
there can be two ways

305
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,680
and one way is skillful and one way is

306
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:01,040
not very skillful

307
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,519
so when i first direct this i was kind

308
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,720
of puzzled wow

309
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,600
you know i thought being present was you

310
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:09,360
know it would be all

311
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:13,360
good and fine but there can be a way

312
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,480
that one will be

313
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,600
being present and we there can be still

314
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,199
unskillfulness in there

315
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,280
so how is that possible

316
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:29,120
and so let's let's take a look at this

317
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,400
so what happens is with respect to the

318
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,559
present experiences the present

319
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,000
qualities

320
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,280
an unskilled person can take

321
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:42,799
whatever is arising as i

322
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:46,960
me my

323
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:49,840
so what happened

324
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,520
so whatever is happening

325
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,840
[Music]

326
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,520
in one way an unskillful way

327
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,600
is that we take that this is me

328
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,720
for example right now

329
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,360
if there is a little moment of a sadness

330
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,200
that happened

331
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,000
in the field of emotion

332
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,679
one way to relate to this

333
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,600
sadness momentary sadness that

334
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:27,360
i'm a sad person i've always been

335
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:31,440
there sad so much sorrow in me

336
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,640
now what happens

337
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,320
we began to construct

338
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:43,679
myself in this simple moment of sadness

339
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:49,120
a moment of grief

340
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:52,000
oh my god

341
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,000
i am really miserable i've always

342
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,679
been very miserable i don't know how to

343
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,559
get out of this

344
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,039
and this is what the buddha is pointing

345
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:08,640
at

346
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,559
we can make self out of the momentary

347
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,919
experience that's happening and when we

348
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,039
do this

349
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,400
what happens is we get

350
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:26,400
hardened into this experiences

351
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,559
and this becomes more permanent than

352
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:31,039
what it

353
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,279
is

354
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:39,039
and most of the time our emotions flows

355
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,240
up and down this way and that way

356
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:45,679
throughout the day but we can oftentimes

357
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,039
pick onto hook onto

358
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,080
certain forms of emotion and make

359
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,120
it ourselves

360
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:59,760
i remember gil fransto sometimes would

361
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,280
teach

362
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,200
that it is more skillful to be

363
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,080
situational centric

364
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,919
rather than self-centric

365
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,720
or you know in another word in this

366
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,200
particular suta maybe we can say

367
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,520
it's a phenomenon centric rather than

368
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,159
self-centric

369
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,039
whatever phenomena or situation that

370
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,559
comes about

371
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:30,799
in our present lived experience

372
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,200
we simply see this as the situation

373
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:38,240
or the phenomenon

374
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:41,760
and this is the skillful way of

375
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,320
being with our experiences and the

376
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,840
self-centric approach

377
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,080
would be turning everything that is

378
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,320
happening into

379
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:59,840
something related to i me and mine

380
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,840
and for example you know if you drop a

381
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:07,039
plate on the floor

382
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,400
maybe the immediate the reaction would

383
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,080
be i am so sloppy

384
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:18,400
but is it is it really all about you

385
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,640
i use it to just well this is a

386
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,080
situation that just happened

387
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,039
and so i get identified with the

388
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,000
situation

389
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,360
what happens is there can be a lot

390
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,480
of dukkha a lot of stress that comes

391
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:41,200
along with it

392
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,960
our experiences become stuck

393
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:50,480
and no longer flows

394
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:59,600
like the clouds in the in the sky

395
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:02,799
and so the opposite and that if if we're

396
00:22:02,799 --> 00:22:03,360
not

397
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,039
taking this phenomenon

398
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:12,000
and the situations as i mean mine

399
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,799
and there can be simple transient

400
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,480
changing

401
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:20,400
experiences arising in passing

402
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:26,400
and when this happens there can be a

403
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,760
quality of

404
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:32,400
not being wavered or shaken

405
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,080
by agitation by farthering

406
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:41,600
the agitation happens when there is a

407
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,480
center

408
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:46,559
like the center of the self

409
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,240
when there is no center of self

410
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:55,679
the agitation cannot shake anything

411
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:58,960
there's nothing to shake

412
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,200
so when one develops the mind in this

413
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,840
way

414
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:14,799
mind will no longer be shaky

415
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,600
or restless

416
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
and so the poem goes on

417
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,520
by encouraging this

418
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,880
and so the the next stanza says

419
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,480
ardently do what should be done today

420
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:39,679
who knows death may come tomorrow

421
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:42,720
there's no bargaining with mortality

422
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:46,158
and his great army

423
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:51,360
i don't know what more is to be said

424
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,440
about this particular line

425
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,279
because it is true

426
00:23:57,279 --> 00:24:00,720
we don't know we don't know

427
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:05,840
when death may come

428
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,200
it may not even be tomorrow maybe next

429
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,600
moment

430
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,480
and i know this can be can sound

431
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,760
um untrue unreal

432
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,039
but we really don't know

433
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:32,159
and oftentimes you know our

434
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:34,880
intellectual mind understands that you

435
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:35,279
know

436
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:38,799
when everybody gets born and

437
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,240
death will be part of it i think

438
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,600
one of my teachers philip muffett

439
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,440
sometimes would like to quote his

440
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:50,000
teacher john sumato

441
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,400
and that birth

442
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,720
has a death as life sentence

443
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:02,880
and it's it's true and yet um

444
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:05,279
we often live our lives with the

445
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:07,520
complete denial

446
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,880
that this might happen to us it might

447
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,840
happen

448
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,840
anytime

449
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,440
and so the buddha knows this

450
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,520
and knows the preciousness of a

451
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,880
practicing

452
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,840
in this moment here and now

453
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,360
and so argently do what should be done

454
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,240
today

455
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:36,400
ardently do what should be done right

456
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,840
now

457
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:43,840
because we don't know

458
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,520
and the poem ended with this line

459
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,039
whoever dwells thus ardent

460
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:56,240
active day and night

461
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:59,440
yes says the peaceful sage

462
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,840
one who has an auspicious day

463
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,840
i love this definition because

464
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,039
oftentimes we associate

465
00:26:11,039 --> 00:26:14,480
auspicious day with some i don't know

466
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,679
special days

467
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,919
like yesterday i know it's a full moon

468
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:19,039
day

469
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:22,400
and even in the buddhist tradition and

470
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,159
maybe many different spiritual

471
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:26,240
traditions full moon days

472
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:32,080
is considered to be auspicious day

473
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:35,120
but the buddha had a different

474
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,480
definition for this

475
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,600
whoever dwells thus ardent active day

476
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,640
and night

477
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,039
practicing ardently day and night

478
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,440
this

479
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,679
says the peaceful sage is the one who

480
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:57,039
has an auspicious day

481
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,480
i love it because this makes

482
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,520
the practice very accessible we don't

483
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,559
have to wait for

484
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:11,200
some special day in order to practice

485
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:15,840
this day if we practice here and now

486
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,520
it's an auspicious day

487
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,159
the other translation a single excellent

488
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:23,600
night

489
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:27,760
or an an excellent day

490
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,279
and so we just need to become become

491
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,480
fully present become aware

492
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:42,159
of what is happening cultivating our

493
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:42,640
mind

494
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,440
skillfully

495
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:49,600
seeing what's true

496
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,640
right in front of us

497
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:57,120
this is where the peace lies and this is

498
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,240
where the freedom

499
00:27:58,240 --> 00:28:03,200
is found

500
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,080
i'm gonna close tonight by just reading

501
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,880
this poem

502
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,880
one more time maybe by now the few lines

503
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,240
even

504
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,840
sinked in in you in some way

505
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:23,200
the buddha said don't chase the past

506
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:27,039
or long for the future the past

507
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,320
is left behind the future

508
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:33,679
is not yet reached

509
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:37,520
right where it is have insight

510
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:41,520
into whatever phenomenon is present

511
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:45,919
not fartering and not agitated

512
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:51,200
by knowing it one develops the mind

513
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,559
ardently do what should be done today

514
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,159
who knows

515
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,520
death may come tomorrow there is no

516
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,840
bargaining with mortality

517
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,360
and his great army whoever

518
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,480
dwells thus ardent

519
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,240
active day and night is

520
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,440
says the peaceful sage one

521
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:19,679
who has an auspicious day

522
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:26,320
may you all have an excellent night

523
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:41,840

524
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:51,710
[Music]
