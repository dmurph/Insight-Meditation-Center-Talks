1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,600
so hello everyone and and uh I appreciate all the

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,960
greetings on the chat and especially when there's a new name that I haven't

3
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:18,800
seen for a long time so thank you for making yourself known this way

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:25,680
and and my fond feelings for so many of you that I know and those

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,880
of you I don't know I'm delighted to know you this way

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:39,800
so um one of the principles

7
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:48,640
of mindfulness meditation is to keep things simple and perhaps radically

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,280
simple and I'll say something a little bit complicated to get to the

9
00:00:54,280 --> 00:01:01,120
Simplicity and that is uh I propose

10
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,720
that we assume that anytime we're thinking

11
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:13,119
about something that's not in the present moment Here and Now something in

12
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:20,920
the future the past something someplace else that in the background of that is a

13
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,680
belief a belief that it's valuable to do so a belief of something we have to

14
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:35,640
accomplish or get or fix or REM remember or hold on to or get rid of belief in a

15
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,920
certain um understanding of what it means to be a human being in relationship with other people and a

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,520
belief in what is right and wrong and belief in how we've been harmed or

17
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,240
benefited and and many of these beliefs we don't think of as

18
00:01:53,240 --> 00:02:01,119
beliefs uh we're just doing the matter of fact things with our thinking and um

19
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,320
and when we meditate in a sense we really don't need

20
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:13,400
to think believe in anything or very very little that's

21
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:21,680
nothing about that's not here and now and so the radical Simplicity is

22
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:28,080
to say to if you're thinking about the future thinking about the past thinking

23
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:37,959
about fantasy thinking about something which is not here to in a loving way delightful

24
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:44,239
way say no thank you not

25
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,720
now not now

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:58,319
and just know that you're not rejecting thinking about these things just not

27
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,920
now no thank thank you and in doing so you're also letting

28
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,920
go of the beliefs that you're supposed to think or it's useful to think or there's value in

29
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,440
thinking about these things which of course there's a time and place for that

30
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:24,040
but not now not now no no thank you and to say that with enough love or

31
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:30,959
enough kindness or enough Simplicity that it becomes a gentle

32
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:40,280
returning to here and now just now just here just with the

33
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:48,519
breathing and there's so little we need to believe in if we

34
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:56,360
are if we enter into the world of our present moment

35
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:01,640
experience I often emphasize breathing

36
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:08,120
for some people breathing isn't uh so useful to as a focus of

37
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:13,920
meditation so then some people would just use the body as a whole the whole

38
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:21,040
experience sensations of the body some people will do sounds as their

39
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,759
home base their anchor and uh just stay let stay in the

40
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:34,080
present with the flow of sounds Keeps Us grounded in the present and

41
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:41,280
then we might know other things as we go along but anything that takes us away

42
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,840
not now no thank

43
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:56,280
you where the no thank you and the not now is a whole it's a warmhearted

44
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:04,000
welcome back here here in this experience here and

45
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,759
now so gently assuming a meditation

46
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,919
posture and closing your

47
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:33,440
eyes and feeling your body here in

48
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,719
space supported from

49
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:49,000
falling falling with a pull of gravity by whatever surface that's holding you

50
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,479
up chair a cushion bed a

51
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,639
floor and feel the weight of your body against this surface

52
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:14,319
as a kind of definitiveness this is the

53
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,160
place where here

54
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:33,160
is and then feeling the vibrating in

55
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,360
pulsing or sensing experience of a

56
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:47,400
body this is the experience of now

57
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:07,080
and in this wide experience of here and

58
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,520
now is there a home base a place where it's easy for your

59
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,720
attention to rest or stay

60
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:32,520
focused for

61
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:24,919
and if you find yourself thinking about other things and other

62
00:08:24,919 --> 00:08:29,319
places other times

63
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:38,839
to remind yourself not now with a no thank

64
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:48,560
you welcome yourself back into your body into your present moment

65
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:57,920
experience and if you're thinking a lot about Here and Now chances are you're believing in

66
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:06,160
something that maybe you don't have to believe in so much

67
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,720
actively even that you might say no thank

68
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:23,079
you keep returning to a radical Simplicity of your

69
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,839
experience Here and

70
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
Now

71
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
for

72
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320

to remain very simple here and

83
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:51,560
now stay close to your body's ability to be

84
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:57,959
sensing sensing the body sounds

85
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:08,360
smells tastes sights stay close to the body's ability

86
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,199
sense rather than staying close to your

87
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:24,000
thinking rather than being IM mesed in beliefs of what you

as we come to the end of this sitting to take a few

109
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,679
moments to feel your way or allow

110
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:13,320
yourself to be as simple as you

111
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:21,398
can almost staying close to

112
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:34,840
the to the simple way that you feel yourself alive right

113
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:41,760
now without the filter of beliefs interpretations

114
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:47,640
stories expectations

115
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:58,200
projections simply being here with the body

116
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:07,760
with the breathing with the flow of

117
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:22,240
Sensations a radical Simplicity that for right now for the next few

118
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:28,880
minutes all needs are put aside

119
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:36,799
any need that can't be satisfied in

120
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:41,760
meditation just be here and

121
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:55,960
now and in this Simplicity of being turn your gaze now outward into

122
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:01,159
the world and what is it like

123
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:08,159
to meet encounter think about

124
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:13,840
others from a perspective of this Simplicity of

125
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:24,000
being meeting others without need for

126
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:31,000
anything meeting others without judging anything self or

127
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:41,320
other meeting others and allowing them to be who they

128
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,600
are in the Simplicity of our

129
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:57,559
attention and in this Simplicity of being

130
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:09,960
what form of connection or Rapport do you tend to have with

131
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:24,559
others Simplicity of being where you're safe nothing is threatening

132
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:37,799
what way of what attitude or feelings do you have of a simple human

133
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,440
connectivity to

134
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,760
others and without anyone else

135
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:00,120
knowing from within see if you can generate basic

136
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:06,638
human Good Will wishing others

137
00:31:06,679 --> 00:31:14,398
well at the level of this radical Simplicity of being simple

138
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:21,320
connection may all beings be

139
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:30,720
happy may all beings be

140
00:31:34,039 --> 00:31:39,039
safe may all beings be

141
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:48,279
peaceful may all beings be

142
00:31:56,159 --> 00:32:01,960
free and may it be that in your each of our Simplicity of

143
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:07,080
being Simplicity of attention here and

144
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:14,200
now may it be that we provide others with

145
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:17,840
safety with

146
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:29,120
peace with freedom from any projections and demands that we have

147
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,320
and maybe in so doing support others in their

148
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,360
happiness may all beings be

149
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,669
[Music]

150
00:32:55,960 --> 00:33:00,840
happy thank you for

151
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:49,000
so welcome to this second Talk part two of core

152
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:56,440
teachings and uh so to discuss further the second Core teaching that of having

153
00:33:56,440 --> 00:34:02,399
no views and what this means uh maybe it's a strange expression so it needs

154
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:09,280
some explanation but it means uh finding a way of living being

155
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,638
alive even if it just for a little while in meditation or a little while walking

156
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:23,280
in nature or a little while just in the evening and maybe looking out the window

157
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:29,000
at the stars or something of

158
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:35,480
of not depending on any

159
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:41,720
belief not depending on any religious belief or political

160
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:47,320
beliefs not depending on uh any point of

161
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:52,960
view certainly there are beliefs certainly there are points of

162
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,720
view which are pragmatically useful

163
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:04,400
and I say that carefully so we don't automatically think beliefs points of

164
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:11,200
view are true in some absolute philosophical or

165
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:19,960
Universal way but rather they might be functionally true practically true in

166
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:27,760
certain circumstances but not in others and uh religious people often

167
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,079
hold on to views very strong beliefs about what is Ultimate and what is true what is right and what is

168
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:40,440
wrong and it's very hard to let go of that to believe that

169
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:47,160
anything else is valuable but in the Simplicity of meditation we see

170
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:52,880
clearly that certainly holding on to any belief

171
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,720
system or actually operating with actively with any belief system

172
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:06,680
interferes with our capacity for peace interferes with our capacity to tap into

173
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:12,880
a deep natural sense of well-being Happiness joy

174
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:19,599
peace that uh is possible to experience completely free of anything

175
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:25,000
that we are believing so some people then feel it's

176
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:30,040
it's a it's a betrayal to our beliefs betrayal to our responsibility as human

177
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:36,560
being to let go of these fundamental beliefs religious beliefs that maybe

178
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:42,480
we've grown up with and that the very way in which we see the world or Orient

179
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:49,400
ourselves but as we get quieter in meditation more concentrated in meditation you can see how it those

180
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:57,800
things if they're operating actively they hinder us they get in the way and there is a a phenomenal sense of

181
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:05,599
Liberation and freedom that can happen when we're no longer navigating the world navigating ourselves through any

182
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:12,720
belief system whatsoever does that give us the opportunity to then live in the world

183
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:20,800
without any operating principles without any functional pragmatic beliefs probably

184
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,560
not uh I think that uh we we have to

185
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,960
understand what what is practically useful uh in our society in the world of

186
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:39,599
other people and uh different cultures have different practical kind of orientations

187
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:44,760
points of view that they're operating from and some of them are pretty deeply

188
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:51,760
ingrained even in the language which we which people speak and um and it's not like uh some

189
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:57,640
of these core deep World Views views about self and others are right and WR

190
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:03,119
wrong they are ways in which we manage to navigate negotiate the world together

191
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:08,800
with other people and they have a pragmatic usefulness but to see them as such to

192
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:15,560
see them as contingent to see them as being uh relative or uh to see them as

193
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:21,800
being um provisional uh means that we don't add

194
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:27,680
an extra layer of holding on or insisting or forcing ourselves and too

195
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:34,160
often in this world we see conf competing beliefs and people who want to impose their beliefs on

196
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:39,520
others and too often we see people struggling with beliefs that are very

197
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:46,800
negative to themselves and make their life much more difficult than it needs to be beliefs that uh that justify

198
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,960
violence and greed beliefs that justify seemingly uh negative

199
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,160
self-use and so to discover it's possible to breathe and live and see and

200
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:07,240
smell and touch uh in a with a radical Simplicity free of All Views belief

201
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:15,200
systems clinging of them gives us a taste of freedom but also gives us a

202
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:21,920
vantage point to see the operation of these views and beliefs that we have to

203
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:28,119
see them arise see them occur we have a by by kind of clearing the canvas in a

204
00:39:28,119 --> 00:39:37,000
sense we see the pain Strokes as they're made and um and so um then we have much

205
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,760
more choice we have much more ability to see it as being uh a contingent uh

206
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:49,160
provisional kind of point of view we can look and see how is this useful and when

207
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:54,520
is it useful when is it not useful uh how do I hold on to it and so

208
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:02,200
we have much more wisdom about the beliefs we have but we but so so the path of uh Insight

209
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:08,599
Meditation is to discover this radical place where we're not dependent on any

210
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:14,319
worldview at all any belief system at all and even Buddhism even beliefs in

211
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:19,400
Buddhism have to be let go even beliefs in that it's possible to get enlightened

212
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:24,440
have to be let go even the beliefs that there's a path to practice everything

213
00:40:24,440 --> 00:40:30,960
falls away and um and uh and it's replaced by

214
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:36,760
something and it was replaced by something very fundamental that is not

215
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:42,359
that's more having to do with maybe instinct or some deeper Wellspring

216
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:50,240
inside of a source inside of understanding that um is not based on uh

217
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:58,319
or centered on or um or um attached to

218
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:05,200
uh all the constructed beliefs that we have all the ways that we have

219
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:13,839
constructed uh World Views that uh have an origin and it's you know uh

220
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:20,640
historians of philosophy and sociology and anthropology can see show

221
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,000
how fundamental worldviews that people have have a history that they come from

222
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:33,640
certain uh philosophers thinkers cultures in a particular way down through the times and and for example in

223
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:41,599
the modern West modern America modern California maybe more than some places um the world view that came out

224
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:49,200
of Freud and young um you know some you know in over the last 100 120 years or

225
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,240
so have radically shaped um uh parts of

226
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:59,520
modern culture but without us knowing that that's the origin of it and we just

227
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:04,760
take it for granted that that's certain things are just the way they are it's the way Nature Made

228
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:10,480
Us and so by getting really quiet and peaceful we can begin questioning or

229
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:16,200
seeing these operating principles that are not necessarily required to be happy

230
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:23,240
and free and to be functioning in the world in an effective and supportive way

231
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:30,440
for towards everyone and one of those like operating principles that is left is that um it's

232
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:39,119
something as simple as um uh if you get a thorn in your foot uh you pull you you

233
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:46,200
sit down and pull off the thorn rather than keep walking and having go dig deeper and deeper in is there a belief

234
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:55,559
system that you take out the thorn you can say you believe it's useful to take it out but um it's a it's such a deep

235
00:42:55,559 --> 00:43:02,599
kind of sense of obvious that you want to stop harming yourself and it's simple thing to do it doesn't

236
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:08,280
really require believing anything because it operates so on a much more

237
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:14,599
basic level than having to logically think what should I do here and what's my beliefs and I'm going to go look at

238
00:43:14,599 --> 00:43:19,960
the text the manual for Being Human Being what do you do when you have a a thorn I don't know I don't know what to

239
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:27,400
believe in here so as we kind of drop into this radical Simplicity of being there's a a

240
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:32,920
different kind of uh way of responding to the world that's closer to that of

241
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:42,440
pulling out a thorn and and uh the simplest way that I have of describing this is a radical or

242
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:49,599
a thoroughgoing dedication to non-harming not as a philosophy not as a

243
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:57,640
logic that's been worked out but rather as um uh with a from a clear

244
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:04,760
sensitivity that if we harm others intentionally we are harming ourselves

245
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:10,480
we are putting a thorn in our hearts and of course we don't want that thorn there

246
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:16,480
so we'll pull it out and that means that uh we pull out the intention to

247
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,960
consciously intentionally cause any harm to any other people and uh and that is a

248
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:30,280
phenomenal uh foundation for healthy life and a healthy Society maybe it

249
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:36,480
doesn't provide everything we need to do and everything we need to organize and every perspective we should have about

250
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:42,280
what goes on in our society but what a phenomenal Foundation Foundation of

251
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:47,960
freedom and non-harming and um and it's almost as if

252
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:54,240
for non-harming is a fundamental belief but it's it's not quite a belief it's

253
00:44:54,240 --> 00:45:01,480
just a uh it's more more almost biological in nature rather than

254
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:08,079
philosophical in nature so um so this movement

255
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:14,359
towards uh having no views no views no no religious views no views of what's

256
00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:21,040
ultimate no no religious views that we hold on to insist on this is the truth

257
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:29,160
this is um one of the core core could I say beliefs maybe so core

258
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:35,319
beliefs that I have core teachings that I have core pragmatic useful

259
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:43,280
orientations that point to something that is beyond beliefs beyond anything

260
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:50,640
dep depends on views and um and to know that as I've said to know

261
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:58,519
that place to know that possibility then lets us return into the world of

262
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:03,920
views World Views orientations perspectives that we have on life and

263
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:09,400
hold them lightly and hold them only in the sense that is this useful and how is

264
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:15,359
this useful and let's use them for the benefit of everyone including self let's

265
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:22,160
use them for an more ultimate purpose the purpose of ending all harm in this

266
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:29,760
world that we live in so thank you very much and um May you

267
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:35,079
go forth today uh with this that kind of Simplicity of

268
00:46:35,079 --> 00:46:43,079
being that is devoted to non-harming thank

269
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,880
you for
