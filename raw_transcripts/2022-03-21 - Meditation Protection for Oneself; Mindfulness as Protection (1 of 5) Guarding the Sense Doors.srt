1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:07,520
okay so we'll go ahead and get started now good to see everyone i think you all

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:14,400
know that um gil is on retreat this week so i'll be here for the five days of this

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,480
week and i'll be continuing with our you know the the theme for a while now

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,800
has been the sati patana suta and so that's about mindfulness so um

5
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:33,120
we'll take a little interlude this week to look at mindfulness as a

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:40,000
protection and in particular we're going to look at some images from the suttas the sutas

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,800
are totally rich with images for mindfulness there are so many similes so many

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,399
metaphors and i thought we would just look at some of them this week

9
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:57,520
with this theme of mindfulness as protection protection of ourselves

10
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:03,760
protection of others we'll look at different aspects of it throughout the five days of the week

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:10,159
there's so much protection that comes from seeing clearly which is

12
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,479
the function of mindfulness you know for example we don't get swept up by strong

13
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:23,680
feelings or high views in our daily life we probably experience that ourselves

14
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:30,960
also when we have some clarity and clear seeing we have a choice about how we respond to

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,560
what's going on in the moment and you know we can see

16
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:41,840
and feel quite clearly the harm that comes from unwholesome states and so

17
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:49,840
then it's natural to choose the wholesome becomes much easier ethics become clearer when we have mindfulness

18
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:56,240
and also we have some wisdom that comes with it we can allow things to just arise and change

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,320
and pass thus essentially freeing ourselves from them

20
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,759
through mindfulness and then we can also help others by being stable and calm and

21
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:18,080
present that automatically brings some benefit to others around us even if they aren't practicing themselves

22
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,440
and you know getting to the greater matters of life mindfulness allows us to

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,520
meet aging illness and death with some presence and clarity these things that

24
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:36,000
we know are inevitable for us as humans so that's a wide range of wonderful

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,120
benefits that come from protections really that come from having

26
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:47,200
some presence of mind so that's what we'll be exploring this week different aspects of that day to

27
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:52,640
day so why don't we go ahead and sit

28
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:59,040
so finding your meditation posture

29
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:06,959
allowing yourself to settle in [Music] perhaps closing the eyes if that's

30
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,920
okay for you

31
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:20,159
maybe taking a long slow deep breath and allowing the body to soften and

32
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,599
relax on the out breath

33
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,000
i'm just feeling into the stability of where you're sitting

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,120
proceed against the chair or the cushion

35
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,760
your legs or your feet against the floor

36
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:08,159
and just taking a moment at the beginning of the sit to

37
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:15,200
sense the alignment of the body so you can even rock back and forth a

38
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:22,479
little bit or forward and back just slightly to really find that middle point

39
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:28,720
sometimes in front of the computer screen we tend to lean forward a little bit so you might particularly pay

40
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,000
attention if you need to settle back at all

41
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,840
and then just allow yourself to be supported by what you're sitting on

42
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:08,000
and gently softening the muscles of the face the expression

43
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:11,320
on the face

44
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,758
softening the eyes and the eye sockets

45
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:37,039
down through the neck and the shoulders letting the shoulders release

46
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,638
imagining the shoulder blades sliding down the back

47
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,160
and softening down through the chest area the heart the lungs

48
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,479
rib cage

49
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,360
the belly

50
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,280
down to the hip joints

51
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:39,918
and the arms and legs letting go of any bracing or tightness

52
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,840
so just inviting some ease in the body

53
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,840
and then turning the attention toward the sensations of breathing

54
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,240
just however the breath is coming in going out

55
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:34,880
for many people breathing is something that feels safe

56
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,639
and so we can consider the breath to be kind of a home base

57
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,680
for the mind and if for some reason that is not the

58
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,720
case for you you can also consider the body posture

59
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:58,120
just the sitting posture and the feeling of that as the home base

60
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:19,720
i'm just having this sense of resting

61
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,680
sometimes the resting of the body can encourage the

62
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:46,800
mind also to find

63
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:51,000
some some degree of rest

64
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:44,480
and when the mind inevitably gets lost in thought

65
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,279
there's no need to criticize but we can just bring

66
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:57,839
back awareness of the breath with a sense of returning to safety

67
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:07,560
sense of now i'm home again

68
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:16,079
so the mindfulness is mostly staying with the breath or the body

69
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:23,120
just a simple breath meditation but we can notice that the

70
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:28,720
mindfulness is protective in the sense that

71
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,560
it will notice when the mind is moving off the breath

72
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:40,720
so the mind is moving out toward getting in trouble

73
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:46,800
often and so it's actually the awareness that

74
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,519
is doing the protection

75
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:07,000
but we just use the breath as the home base to help us have that protection

76
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,880
and as we settle in a bit farther

77
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:50,079
and there's a bit more mindfulness even just a bit more

78
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,839
we may begin to enjoy this sense of protection

79
00:13:55,839 --> 00:14:02,959
we maybe begin to feel that the mind has a little bit of strength or resilience to it

80
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:10,480
and that has a pleasant feeling and it's fine to enjoy

81
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,720
that sense of mindfulness

82
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:22,560
even if what we're mindful of is some pain or

83
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:28,720
even a busy mind we know that as long as the awareness is there

84
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:36,920
we have some protection some benefit even

85
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:24,240
often when the mind wanders it's going off into the territory of

86
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:29,600
wanting or ill will

87
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,080
or confusion

88
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:42,960
and even just knowing that it's already protection but we may find

89
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:48,080
that bringing mindfulness to wandering thoughts

90
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,919
they naturally just fade

91
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:58,919
there's something about noticing them that

92
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,640
them

93
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,280
hello

94
00:26:54,000 --> 00:27:01,279
this mindfulness that we cultivate on the cushion [Music]

95
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:06,559
carries out into our daily life

96
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:09,919
likely we've seen that

97
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:19,360
as we see it as a protector

98
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,799
it will continue to serve that function throughout the day

99
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:32,080
so it can be helpful still to have some kind of an anchor or a home base

100
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:38,799
as we move about the day i often use uh the body

101
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:43,840
so the general feeling of my body

102
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:50,399
wherever i am that's certain to be in the present moment

103
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,720
so that can be the place to help orient the mind to

104
00:27:57,279 --> 00:28:03,799
and then having that awareness is what is the protection

105
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:10,559
so when we're there in the present moment and aware of how the body is

106
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:17,840
we're less likely to get caught up in what someone is saying to us

107
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:24,640
or in extraneous concerns letting the mind

108
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:31,840
wander off into anxiety or excessive rumination

109
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:40,559
and then we can enjoy that sense of knowing that we're in the present moment

110
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:45,840
where it is really the only place we can be safe

111
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:51,519
even if what's happening is not to our liking

112
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:59,010
we know it's safer to be there [Music]

113
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,278
and somewhere that isn't so real

114
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:11,799
and we still have a choice about where to put the mind within the present moment

115
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:22,519
but you might consider that as you go about the day how is mindfulness protecting you

116
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:38,039
serving you like a good friend

117
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:53,120
and this will automatically help others we'll talk more about that as the week goes on but maybe for today just

118
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:58,679
staying with the sense of it as protecting yourself

119
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,450
[Music]

120
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:30,569
[Music]

121
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:56,559
so this week we will continue to talk about

122
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:02,880
this wonderful quality of mindfulness but the theme will be different aspects

123
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:08,559
of mindfulness as protection and

124
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:14,320
in fact i wanted to show you you can see on this wrist i have this red

125
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:21,600
cord on this one i have a little white cord these are called protection cords and

126
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:28,159
you may have received them at some retreats or other

127
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:34,640
other buddhist event and i'm remembering that um one time

128
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:41,840
the teacher uh i think it was john travis asked was he when he was receiving one so what is this protection

129
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:49,120
from and the monk who was giving it to him said it's protection from yourself

130
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:54,320
and i've i found that to be a useful idea in some sense they're just pieces of

131
00:31:54,320 --> 00:32:01,600
string but we can conceive of them as protections from our self and i think as

132
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:07,519
we practice we come to understand that that is useful

133
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:13,440
that's a useful image so speaking of images this week we'll be

134
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:19,679
looking at images or similes from the sutas that relate to mindfulness

135
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:25,840
and there are a lot and you know as i was sort of looking through and collecting up the various

136
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:31,279
images it was clear that that protection is really a theme and

137
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:37,200
different aspects of it so maybe i'll just talk for a moment about

138
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,720
the value of these images and similes that there are in the sutas i don't know

139
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,519
how many there are but there are certainly well over a hundred different images used

140
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,559
for various qualities and experiences in the teachings it's clear that the

141
00:32:54,559 --> 00:33:01,519
buddha was a kind of a a teacher who liked to evoke that

142
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:06,799
aspect of us you know the images the feelings

143
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,039
the our connection to them and often the images relate to things

144
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:18,480
that are quite accessible in in life you know images of

145
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:24,880
simple feelings that we have or well of course many of them are agricultural from you know his time but

146
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:31,039
we can imagine that fairly well still and they're meant to be i think quite

147
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,159
experiential you know we're meant to have a sense a really a visceral sense

148
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:42,960
of what that image is pointing to and that may speak to a different part of our heart than

149
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,760
just hearing words or or having ideas so that's one of the reasons to look at

150
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,039
them carefully they speak maybe to the non-rational aspect of us

151
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:01,039
which is not the irrational aspect of us but the non-rational hopefully you can

152
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:07,200
see the difference and it's possible i have found that

153
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:13,440
these images maybe i read them at the time and i think oh yeah okay that that makes sense i can

154
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:20,000
kind of feel that but sometimes they can really bubble up during a sit you know the mind will we

155
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:27,440
read something about fear and then um and it's nice in the moment and then during a sip maybe when fear comes up

156
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:34,638
that same image will suddenly have meaning i've found it's like oh that is what that was referring

157
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,800
to that's exactly what it feels like wow and so i hope maybe you'll take in some

158
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:48,560
of these images um and consider just store them maybe store them somehow in your mind or your heart

159
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,480
and see if they come up for you sometime

160
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,839
so each day has a theme which is some aspect of protection and we'll be looking at these images sometimes one

161
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:10,160
sometimes more than one each day that relate to a certain theme so today's protection related theme

162
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:18,240
is called guarding the scent stores and so that is it's about mindfulness as a

163
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:23,359
basic protection for our self and guarding the scent stores means

164
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:29,119
taking care with the eyes ears nose tongue body and

165
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:35,920
mind such that inputs to those senses don't overwhelm the mind

166
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:41,359
in buddhist teachings there are six six cent stores those ones that i named

167
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,400
so one basic image that's used is

168
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:54,640
the image of six animals that are bound together by a rope and so the animals are a snake

169
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:00,720
a crocodile a bird a dog a jackal and a monkey

170
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:05,839
pretty different kinds of animals and so you can imagine that

171
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:13,599
what happens is each one wants to go in its own direction each one tries to go toward its

172
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,079
natural place and when he wants to go up to the trees and the bird wants to fly and i think it says the snake wants to

173
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:26,800
go to the ant hill but anyway they're all going in a different direction and if you just tie

174
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,520
them together with a rope and let the rope go uh the strongest animal is going to win

175
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:38,800
and they'll all have to go that way and so this is the the the idea here the

176
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,160
metaphor is that the six animals are the sixth sense faces that each want to do

177
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:50,160
something different our eyes are going somewhere our ears our mind and so if we're just you know

178
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:56,160
willy-nilly let that happen what kind of whatever is the strongest is what we'll end up doing

179
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,400
and that's really not so helpful but that might be kind of how we go through our day when we're not mindful

180
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:09,920
so then the contrast is to have the same six animals bound with a rope but they're tied up to a stake

181
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:15,839
and the stake is put in the ground and so then what happens is the animals can't actually go

182
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:23,520
and eventually they get tired and they lie down so the image says and so the same thing

183
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:30,160
is if we have mindfulness of our senses then our sense doors

184
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:36,880
then we don't get drawn off and they're not running off in different directions you know we can just hear things but we

185
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:44,160
don't start thinking about that and worrying about that or being angry about the thought about the sound and so

186
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:50,320
eventually things will settle down quiet down we can maybe see this sometimes in meditation

187
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:58,320
also applicable in daily life when all of our when we have all six senses operating

188
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:04,160
so then um so that's maybe one way we can think about how mindfulness guards are sent

189
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:10,640
stores prevents them from running off but i want to also talk about another

190
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,400
nice image that's more specifically for the sixth sense store of the mind which

191
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:23,400
is the one where we often get in trouble i think we can see so this is one that's from um

192
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:28,640
mn19 uh a suta about thoughts about different kinds of

193
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:35,280
thoughts and so when we have many different thoughts in our mind that are related to the

194
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,280
hindrances um actually the suta says they're related to sensual desire ill will or

195
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:48,640
cruelty but we could probably include all entrance related thoughts since i know you just talked last week with gil

196
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:53,680
about the hindrances and so when we have a lot of thoughts like that

197
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:59,839
it's a kind of a drain on the mind and if we keep track of what we're thinking

198
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:05,680
with mindfulness then we can kind of redirect those unhelpful thoughts

199
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,400
and the image given is that of a cowherd who is trying to handle a pack of cows

200
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,920
does it ever feel like your thoughts are like a herd of cows going in different directions

201
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:23,520
you've got to try to kind of keep it together so the image is like this it says just

202
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,520
as in the last month of the rainy season in the autumn when the crops thicken

203
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:34,960
a cow herd would guard his cows by constantly tapping and poking them on

204
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,839
this side and that in order to check them so the idea here is that it won't be good

205
00:39:41,839 --> 00:39:47,359
if the cows get into the crops and eat them and so the cow herd stays close to the

206
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:54,400
cows i'm kind of poking them this way in that and when the mind has a lot of these thoughts then in the same way we

207
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:01,359
have to kind of guard our mind carefully by doing a lot of noting practice for example or really paying attention to

208
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:06,800
those thoughts each time they come and maybe one thing to note also is that

209
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,160
the cowherd is not angrily beating the cows to get them back in line

210
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:19,599
he's just tapping them gently but firmly and so if we do that in our mind and we

211
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:24,720
gently but firmly you know note okay nope not gonna go off into anxiety no

212
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:31,280
not gonna ruminate about my housemate etc uh as we do this the mind will tend

213
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:38,560
to settle down the same way that the six animals get tired when they're bound to the stake and eventually settle down

214
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:44,480
and then the nice thing is that we don't need to be checking so actively with the with

215
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,240
the mindfulness the mindfulness also can change and so there's another image given in

216
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,520
that same suta again about the cow herd and it says

217
00:40:55,520 --> 00:41:02,319
just as in the last month of the hot season when all the crops have been brought inside the villages

218
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:07,359
a cow herd would guard his cows while staying at the root of a tree or out in

219
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:12,560
the open since he only needs to be mindful that the cows are there

220
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,599
so it's a whole different image right the cows can just be

221
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:24,400
you know out in the field because there's no crops left that they're going to eat and so the cow herd gets to just rest

222
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:30,560
under a tree and just kind of watch that they're there and in the same way if the mind is in a

223
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,760
more skillful place having thoughts of non-ill will non-cruelty

224
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:41,760
um thoughts of generosity uh it's fine just to know that those thoughts are there

225
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:49,599
or maybe it even settles down enough not to have very many thoughts and then we can just be calmly present

226
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:55,599
so this this protection that's called guarding the scent stores

227
00:41:55,599 --> 00:42:00,960
could be quite active or it could be quite relaxed it depends

228
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:08,400
on the state of the mind and what sort of external inputs and internal thoughts we're experiencing at a given time how

229
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:15,200
we need to be mindful of them in order to guard our senses so over time

230
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:22,720
we'll find that we can be with more and more challenging situations mindfully

231
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:27,839
so the mind gets less reactive overall and so we'll find that the

232
00:42:27,839 --> 00:42:32,880
the nature of guarding changes throughout the course of our the long

233
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:41,040
arc of our practice as well as you know the short-term arc of just how the mind is right now

234
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,480
so the hope then is that during this week we'll

235
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:52,560
build a picture out of different images of the many ways that mindfulness serves as a protector

236
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:59,040
and today we looked at this idea of guarding the scent stores of not letting the mind run out

237
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:05,119
in the same way that seems like the images are about animals the same way that animals kind of wander off

238
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:10,240
if we don't uh keep track of them so i hope that's a helpful

239
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:16,000
image for you to get started on today or maybe it's later in the day for you

240
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,640
but consider maybe consider today what it would be like to guard the scent stores with mindfulness

241
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:28,240
and to see mindfulness as our our simple protector

242
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:31,960
so thank you
