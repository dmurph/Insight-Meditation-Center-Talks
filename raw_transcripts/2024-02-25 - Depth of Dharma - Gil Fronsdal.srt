1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,760
hello everyone here and hello to people

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:09,040
online

3
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:17,000
so I thought a littleit abrupt for me to come out of meditation

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,439
and now suddenly have to

5
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:26,880
speak um

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:35,800
so so what I'd like to do today is to uh bring in a perspective

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:43,399
and orientation on our life or in our practice Buddhist practice from another

8
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:50,280
uh domain another field and that's often can be useful because it kind of you

9
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,239
know helps us to kind of see what we're doing in a new way whether it's looking at our Buddhist practice a new way or

10
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:04,720
whether independent of that almost looking at our own own life in a new way that's kind of the hope for this

11
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:13,960
talk and I like to think of that what I'm going to point towards is um um

12
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:22,439
the the depth of the Dharma but rather than thinking of the Dharma as something outside of you um

13
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,960
it's the depth of your Dharma or the depth that's potentially yours how to

14
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:35,200
understand yourself in some deep way and the orientation I'm going to

15
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:43,360
provide is a way principles or point of view

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,960
that chaplain use when they offer spiritual

17
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,200
care especially here in California uh chaplain who work in hospitals are

18
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,039
offering offering spiritual care to anybody who willing to or wants to have care for from them including people who

19
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:08,039
are atheists and non-religious and um and chaplains are

20
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,360
in California are are even though there might be Buddhist or Christian or Jewish

21
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,440
or Muslim chaplains they're explicitly working in the hospital as an Interfaith

22
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,879
chaplain so as an Interfaith CH chaplain you're not there to prze you're not

23
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,480
there to Pro provide people with the mean meaning of life that you have from

24
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:39,319
maybe your own religion you're there to discover uh what's going on for that

25
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:45,280
person in some deep way understand them deeply for for example in terms of the

26
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,080
meaning of life uh you might want to discover what is their understanding of the meaning of life or in what way is

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:59,840
the meaning of life for them been ruptured and their suffering maybe like in hospital there's they represents

28
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,440
someone who's maybe going through some tremendous loss sickness old age all

29
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:11,560
kinds of things can happen with people in the hospital and so it's ruptured maybe what was meaningful for them what

30
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,959
a meaningful life meant for them being debilitated maybe having their life

31
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:24,599
radically changed overnight and never to be the same again and so there sense of meaning has been

32
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:31,720
ruptured and so a chaplain is there to meet that and care for that without prosing without providing them with

33
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:37,920
meaning so this idea that there's these orientations that chaplain use used to

34
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,159
understand people deeply so that they can support people deeply in times of

35
00:03:43,159 --> 00:03:50,760
great difficulty and so there are five paired areas that chaplins are looking

36
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:57,360
at looking at considering people that um I'd like to kind of present here for us

37
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,640
today and as you listen and think I'm most interested in is to maybe it

38
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,560
supports you to be able to or want to kind of look at yourself more deeply to

39
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,599
use these five categories to really look at how does this work for you and not

40
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,120
just your first ansers for them but uh there's the art of think well that's the

41
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:27,240
first answer but but you know if that's true what's deeper what's

42
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,680
more deeply true around the same category and keep kind of going down

43
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:41,400
deep so I'll say I'll list what these five categories are five areas they're pair pairs of things and uh don't try to

44
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,639
memorize them now because I'll go through them slowly and you can always go back listen to the talk if you want

45
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:54,479
to get all of them but now just listen and see what what uh what kind of seems

46
00:04:54,479 --> 00:05:01,960
important for you to for yourself so the the the five pairs are

47
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:11,000
meaning and purpose agency and um

48
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:19,000
autonomy identity and dignity community and

49
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,479
kinship healing and Reconciliation and they're kind of in a

50
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,840
very interesting list they're kind of progressive in some ways where they could be seen that way

51
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:38,039
so the first meaning and purpose you know the big question is what's the meaning of life

52
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:43,160
uh a subset of that is what's the meaning of your

53
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,319
life and um and I would like to propose that everyone has some sense of what

54
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:54,880
their meaning of their life is whether it's implicit or explicit whether it's

55
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,639
conscious or unconscious and many people receive a sense of mean meaning of life what life

56
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:07,440
is about what's important in life to do and and and uh from their society from

57
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,080
their religions from their family in such an early age that people don't even know they're living that way it's just

58
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:21,240
like you know this is how things are and um and uh I saw that with my my children

59
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:27,280
they were quite young that uh how much I was acculturating them to a certain

60
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:35,319
point of view about what it means to be a human being what it means to be human being in relationship to other human beings at first I was a little bit

61
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:44,240
horrified you know to see see the conditioning we were doing but it has to be this way uh everyone has to somehow

62
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:49,680
everyone who lives in a society and a culture has to some way or other um have

63
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:57,400
a language to speak with people and we don't then they communicate and find our way and you know it isn't that you know

64
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:05,800
this two-year-old who's learning to speak um you know uh is being oppressed

65
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:13,639
because you know this the way English words are

66
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:19,560
spelled doesn't make a lot of sense you know you know I'm one of those

67
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,599
people who complained for 60 years 70 years about this kind of an inest but um

68
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:32,639
but you know you know you just have to go along with certain things so it with speaking people you can give you you can

69
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,120
communicate so things are passed on in a very early age and I saw for myself as I

70
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:46,879
started doing Buddhist practice that those layers of ways I was conditioned got uncovered and How Deeply it went I

71
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:53,120
can't tell you if it went all the way to the bottom but I certainly saw a lot of ways and that's why I so so so see it so

72
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,720
well what I was doing for my children and so I was conscious of it but I tried to do it responsibly and care carefully

73
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,960
and not to limit them but still I knew that you had to teach them language you

74
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:13,440
had to teach them how to be in a culture and in a certain way and um so but so what's the meaning

75
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:19,560
of life uh uh some people the meaning of life as I said and like in hospitals but

76
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:26,360
many places is unfulfilled they think that life has a certain meaning like to have children

77
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:32,039
and some women some people don't have children and their meaning is really ruptured

78
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:37,959
it's really painful because they grew up with that that was their primary purpose in a

79
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:43,640
sense for other people it was to fulfill their parents' ideas of what kind of

80
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:52,080
career they're going to have and that was the primary meaning which operated in their life some people uh without it

81
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:57,680
being called the meaning of their life it's um if you watch them you say

82
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,959
wow from all I can tell the meaning of their life is to

83
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:08,880
hate you know that's all they seem to be about and uh or the meaning of life is

84
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:17,120
to be wealthy to have desires and to have status and that seems to be what their life is about and but it's

85
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:22,200
unexamined and if you ask them you know what's the meaning of your life they might not be able to say anything deeper

86
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:29,959
than that that's the operating principle of what their life is about and um but is the meaning of life

87
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,640
to live in resentment is that what life is should be really about the purpose so

88
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,760
meaning and purpose are closely related uh many times so the meaning

89
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:48,720
gives us the orientation of what we want to do with our life what we want to accomplish and um and

90
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:56,000
so um you know is is life just about becoming wealthy is it is it more about the

91
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
quality of relationships that that there's love and community and that we support and are engaged in is life about

92
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,040
feeling fulfilled in some deep inner way that has nothing to do with material

93
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:15,760
well-being and status and these kinds of things and um so you know what's the

94
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:23,880
meaning what's the purpose and people who have no purpose sometimes find themselves disoriented feel lost feel

95
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:31,720
like they don't fit into society don't fit into this world they're confused sometimes they're depressed by it all

96
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,880
some people who think some one way something something of a particular is

97
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,120
Meaningful in a particular way and but they can't fulfill that meaning again it's very challenging for them some

98
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:51,760
people have a meaning that they thought was the purpose of life but something happened that pulled the rug from

99
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:58,079
underneath that and either they can't fulfill it or it doesn't make sense anymore um some people their their

100
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:04,000
religion they grew up with with provided meaning and and amazing meaning the people community people were all their

101
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,880
whole meaning of life was centered around the meaning provided by their religion but at some point they could no

102
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:17,120
longer Believe it or follow that and then they were lost like what do I do now how do I find my way so chaplain in

103
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:23,320
offering spiritual care are listening for this and they're not prosti they're not telling people what it should

104
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:28,760
be now as a Buddhist teacher I'm not a chaplain in that way so For Better or

105
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:37,519
For worse I'm offering Buddhist meaning and Buddhist purpose uh and uh but often what I try

106
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:44,519
to do when I meet with people is one-on-one is to listen first and foremost what the people I'm talking to

107
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:52,160
want what is their intention for their life and then see how this practice can support that in the appropriate way and

108
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:59,959
the exception for that is I'm also listening for suffering how's this person suffering and and is it there is

109
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:07,079
do I have a role to be a mirror for that or engage them around that and to support them around that because some

110
00:12:07,079 --> 00:12:12,920
sources of meaning some orientation around meaning and purpose cause just more suffering for themselves and maybe

111
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:18,560
for other people as well and that's one of the purposes primary meanings that I

112
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:25,040
think Buddhists offer Buddhism offers and that is um that one purpose

113
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,240
of human life is find Liberation or freedom from suff

114
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:38,040
uing this can seem to be not so Grand or altruistic or something that other other

115
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:43,440
meanings could be but it's a powerful one for Buddhists The Liberation from

116
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:48,720
the freedom from suffering and it's not the end of it all

117
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,519
but there might be more meanings to it for example you could ask well that's nice for you and when your suffering

118
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:01,839
ends then what what's the meaning of life then and some Buddhists will say then oh the

119
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:08,639
meaning of life is to help you end your suffering or to help end the suffering for the people other people because part

120
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:15,360
of the meaning for life is that we are related to each other and our wellbeing

121
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:23,199
our purpose in life is also related to the well-being of those around us the purpose of Buddhist life is not

122
00:13:23,199 --> 00:13:29,560
just to end suffering which seems like a neutral thing it's also to thrive in a

123
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:36,560
very deep way and the Buddha didn't use exactly the word Thrive because he didn't speak English but he there were

124
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:42,279
other words that he used that are related to the to how what we mean by the word Thrive to live in a sense of

125
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:47,440
abundance expansiveness and um and so the purpose

126
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,480
of life is to is to free this inner possibility from a Dharma point of from

127
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:58,000
Buddhist point of view uh it's the Dharma want to live in harmony with the

128
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:04,160
Dharma aligned with the Dharma but the Dharma is not in a book The Dharma is

129
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,240
something that lives inside of us and Buddhist since in the west we often say

130
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,600
that we want to so that you have a power you know power greater than ourselves you know

131
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,040
something you know we want to be aligned to higher P power is a kind of language

132
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:26,199
some people use I think the Buddhists would say something like I would say yes that's

133
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:31,440
great we do but the higher power that we can find is within

134
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:37,560
ourselves so it's it's not exactly us it's not exactly you but it's not apart

135
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:43,279
from you but it's this uh inner movement of something that can happen when when

136
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:49,519
something is set free set free from what set free from all the restrictions that

137
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:56,639
we live under all the limitations we put ourselves under and so this movement towards freedom from suffering is a

138
00:14:56,639 --> 00:15:03,120
movement that sees and feels how we limit ourselves how we restrict ourselves how we oppress

139
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:08,680
ourselves um because that's suffering and so to

140
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:16,399
begin uh seeing and feeling oh look at that not only my suffering but I I can

141
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:24,800
feel how this is a limitation to my growth I see how this is a a um a not to

142
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:31,000
my growth but just limitation to how life wants to grow how life wants to be expressed the Dharma wants to be

143
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:39,240
expressed here and this thing that higher power that's within us is our own maturation or inner maturation growth

144
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:45,399
set free that we're amazingly capable of to live with tremendous sense of of

145
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:52,160
Peace of joy of strength of wisdom that it's very hard to take

146
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,800
personally and so uh so this idea of being free from then limitations and

147
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:04,000
restrictions ties into the next uh chaplaincy orientation and that is uh

148
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:09,519
agency and autonomy PE and this means that uh we're

149
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:15,120
not living under oppression not living under things that keep us in certain

150
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:22,160
kinds of prison restricted autonomy me autonomy means that uh in this context

151
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,120
is that other people are you're not controlled by other people you're not controlled by institutions that have

152
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,040
greater power over your life than they should have uh you're not um coerced

153
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:42,199
into living the way you want to live uh you are not oppressed and but you can make your own

154
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:48,360
choices you can follow your own guidance do what you want to do the

155
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:56,240
representation of of uh you know that represents this kind of restricted life is prison that uh it's awful to be in

156
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:03,560
prison so much of the autonomy is Tak taken away explicitly and I've met prisoners who

157
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:10,038
have all this kind of ordinary autonomy Tak taken away and they have more inner

158
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:17,000
freedom than many people who come to IMC it's remarkable to see where they

159
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:23,000
find their autonomy autonomy about what their inner life is about what they

160
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,160
choose to respond to and how they respond and they found a certain kind of freedom

161
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:35,600
to make choices for themselves that you can see and Fe look in their eyes and see what they

162
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:42,160
have and um so this idea so uh uh agency the ability to

163
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:48,320
act to not be restricted from doing what needs to be done so for Buddhists to

164
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:54,600
have some sense yes it's possible to be free it's possible to let this Dharma

165
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:00,840
onward leading Dharma move through me and grow it's possible to open my heart

166
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:10,720
in such a way that I can be of service to others or love others be connected in a deep way it's possible but I can't do

167
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:17,880
it why can't I do it well I have responsibilities I can't go on Retreat I

168
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:23,799
have you know to read the newspaper have coffee in the morning I can't

169
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:29,520
meditate I have I have no I have no autonomy

170
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:35,000
you and um and then of course you know so so then so there's these things that

171
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:40,679
keep keep us in check and so you know so we don't feel

172
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:47,799
like we can act do what we want to do me some people have responsibilities and families and and uh some things some

173
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:54,880
people feel like they can't practice because they can't go and Retreat because of family responsibilities and I tell them well I

174
00:18:54,880 --> 00:19:01,039
learned maybe more about myself in the Dharma with the limitations of having

175
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,640
raising kids that I did on in monasteries I lived in it's a great

176
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,840
practice and in terms of learning autonomy learning agency and where it

177
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:19,440
really counts uh you know for me I learned tremendous amount under the limitations of

178
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,480
parenting that uh I wouldn't say it's like prison

179
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:33,000
but but uh but I do want to refer back to what I just said about these prisoners who

180
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:39,960
found the freedom right so if the prisoners can do it in that setting maybe I could learn something about it

181
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,120
in family you know maybe so

182
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:52,760
um so then so we have purpose me um we have um meaning and

183
00:19:52,760 --> 00:20:01,960
purpose and then agency and autonomy and then we have um

184
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:08,520
um uh identity and dignity one of the ways that I

185
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,080
understand chaplains is that they they one of their functions of these hospital

186
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:20,799
chaplins or any chaplain I hope any human being I hope is um I've coined a

187
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:26,200
new English word um because I believe English gives

188
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:32,760
us that freedom sometimes I have loving arguments with friends about this you can't do

189
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:39,919
that um uh chaplain are dignifi you see I have enough autonomy

190
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:47,600
in agency that I can make up a new word dignifi and um and so they dignify other

191
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:54,559
people they bring out the dignity in people and respect them and honor them and value them people in our society not

192
00:20:54,559 --> 00:21:01,320
enough people in our society are honored are respected in deep ways and sometimes when people are under

193
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:08,120
challenge like in tremendous difficulty in hospitals their dignity has been taken away and chaplain come and that's

194
00:21:08,120 --> 00:21:14,799
one thing chaplain offer identity and dignity identity and worth and identity

195
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:23,159
is a kind of awkward thing for Buddhists to talk about sometimes unfortunately because uh

196
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:28,400
there's been a long history of this teachings of no self and you're not supposed to have an identity like of

197
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:33,919
identity let go and it's true there's a tremendous amount of letting go of

198
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:39,640
self-de of holding on to ideas of self that Buddhist do but

199
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:46,640
only when the practice shows us that the identities we're living under restrict

200
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:51,960
us limit us some identities don't do that some

201
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,559
identities actually do the opposite that kind of give us more space

202
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:04,320
so uh someone who is a calls themselves identifies I'm a Buddhist

203
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,880
practitioner well if they come and tell me that as a Buddhist teacher I say

204
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:16,480
great I'm not going to take that away from you that that teaches me it tells me that you have certain values and

205
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:22,600
purpose and meaning for your life of what you want to do with your life that I want to

206
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:28,919
support and if there's some attachment to being the pr practitioner which then

207
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:35,000
I'm not worried about it because the practice the mindfulness um the Dharma will show you

208
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,559
sooner or later where those limitations are and so that all that all comes out

209
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:47,039
in the wash and but identity is very important identity know means you know where your

210
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:54,000
place is in society you know how you fit in society how to find your way in society you know your place in your

211
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:59,640
family you know your role and roles are Maybe sometimes like hats you wear you

212
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:06,720
take on and off but still you know what hats you're wearing at any given time you know something about yourself you

213
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:12,640
know yourself well you have confidence in yourself you have understanding of

214
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:19,279
what makes you work you understand what drives you your your values your meanings your

215
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:24,600
purposes uh you have a clear sense of how you live in relationship to other

216
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:31,440
people and how to interact with it and how to care for yourself in relationship to other people all this fits under the

217
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:37,520
title of identity and many people are deeply challenged around identity some

218
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:44,880
people are challenged when the identity they had seemingly has been removed from them or lost or you know so some people

219
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,919
when they retire feel completely lost because that role that identity is no longer

220
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:56,360
there and um and so chaplains listen where's is that you know where is that the

221
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:03,480
suffering that people have and how do I care for that and meet that and support people I can't provide to anybody with

222
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:09,360
identity but uh chaplain listens to the suffering at least that's there because

223
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,200
and then sees what can support this person to find a new identity what can support the person to let go of the

224
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,440
identities that have been harmful for them no longer

225
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:26,240
needed so meaning and purpose agency and

226
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:32,000
autonomy identity and dignity and Buddhism is a lot about

227
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,200
dignity the some of you know that the the people who attain some degree of

228
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:45,039
Liberation in Buddhism are called the noble ones you know that's kind of highlights

229
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:52,039
this is important movement direction we're going and then there's uh community and

230
00:24:52,039 --> 00:25:00,720
kinship and I think most people for most people we understand how important Community is family friends uh our tribe

231
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:07,520
our village uh the people around us that you know uh help our mirrors to help us

232
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:13,039
understand ourselves people who help us feel like we belong that we're connected That We're Not

233
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:19,960
Alone um many many of the ways in which we as human beings grow and develop um

234
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:25,320
as children is clearly in relationship to other people clearly in relationship

235
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:32,360
to our parents and we're we're ired for that relationship to affect us for a

236
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:37,919
lifetime and if that something goes a skew with a parent child relationship

237
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:44,200
when the child is Young it can be challenging for that child the rest of their life you know we call it sometimes

238
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:49,960
attachment disorders nowadays and if something goes well in that relationship

239
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:56,720
um the child feels secure in the world by feeling Security in their family in the first 5 years they're alive then

240
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:03,279
they go into they feel oh the world is a place it's okay to feel secure in and so it makes a huge

241
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:08,880
difference and so you know we we we learn from each other we influence each

242
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,279
other we're influenced by each other we um it touches something very deep inside

243
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:20,679
of us when I was walking down here to teach today uh somewhat narrow my house

244
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:26,919
is a is a house that I've walked by a lot and uh it's been being remodeled for

245
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:33,960
years and I I I it feels like almost like it's a hobby house for someone or they seem

246
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:40,720
to work on the weekends or evenings and they come with all their buddies you know it seems like just a nice time and

247
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:47,320
and they seem to be doing a really nice job with this relatively small wooden house so I've kind of admired what

248
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,000
they're doing and but this morning there was someone with a uh pickup truck kind

249
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:59,559
of looked like they were going to do some work or something and um so the first first time I said hello I said are

250
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:05,240
you working here and the person was a little bit cautious yeah

251
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:11,960
sometimes so I said I've been admiring this for years and it turned out that he was the owner and he's been doing it for

252
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:18,240
years and and uh and so we had a delightful conversation I appreciated his work I really appreciate how nice

253
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:25,320
they done in the house and appreciated his work and what he did and then finally he asked me what do you

254
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:31,679
do so so that's a little bit of a you know personal question right and and so

255
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:39,799
I thought what do I say you know what is this because sometimes I've told people what I do here in Redwood City like when

256
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:46,279
little league with my kids they're the Little League parents as soon as I tell them they walk

257
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,720
away Buddhist Buddhist teacher right or something so I said I'm a meditation

258
00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:00,470
teacher because that's a little bit safer you know I I I could say I'm in

259
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:06,000
[Laughter]

260
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:14,120
entertainment and so um what i s meditation to he was like wow you know said you know so I can't you must sit

261
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:19,200
still or something and uh and so we talked for a while and it was kind of

262
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:24,279
nice and I and I told them that I've been a Buddhist monk for many years and

263
00:28:24,279 --> 00:28:31,440
and um and he said you really must know how to be still I can't still still a I have to always be active and I said yeah

264
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,960
I you know I can be still but I love act activity too um I mean it's you know

265
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:45,840
that doing this kind of work you do is so much fun and it's engaging and I love it to do that kind of work and I used to be a farmer I said and and um so what

266
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,640
was I doing in that conversation so a number of things were happening community and

267
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:58,200
kinship first one that happened was I was walking down the street and I saw this man there and

268
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:05,600
and I thought I can't stop and talk to him I want to come down here and be here early at IMC so that I can be in

269
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,519
community and kinship with some of you and um but I could feel that the the

270
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:18,320
resistance I had to stopping the sense of like there's some other place to go didn't feel right that's where the

271
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:26,000
suffering was that's where the strain was I didn't want to live with that that didn't seem right so what happens when I

272
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,120
let go of it hi are you working on this house or

273
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:37,159
something I just kind of just s like the most natural thing in the world and that was the person of the moment to be in

274
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:43,159
community with and kinship with there was some commonality perhaps because of seeing that house for years thinking

275
00:29:43,159 --> 00:29:50,240
about it just you know he's only about 10 houses away from me and um so it's part of my

276
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:56,840
neighborhood and um so it is that the meaning of life for me to connect to

277
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,960
people and Community I don't know if I would say that is it the Dharma in me that's

278
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:08,279
coming forth and being expressed I would say yes that's just life coming forth in

279
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:15,200
me and um and then uh I was in community with him and then I felt kinship with

280
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:22,200
him when he said he's you know has a trouble sitting still but he likes being active I loved it you know I thought

281
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:27,559
that's that's a beautiful thing I felt more connected to him and it's kind of kinship and I wanted to share that sense

282
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:32,880
of kinship with him with a sense that I too like to be active and to do work and

283
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:39,159
you know it felt wonderful to have that wonderful connection so by the time I was ready to leave he offered me his

284
00:30:39,159 --> 00:30:44,480
hand to shake it and it was felt a wonderful little contact there and you

285
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,559
know a little friendly engagement and so community and kinship

286
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:56,559
is something that is a wonderful part of human life and that gets ruptured sometimes it gets broken it gets

287
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:03,880
challenged and and each of these five areas uh relate to each other they

288
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:08,919
influence each other or connect to each other and each of these five any one of

289
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:15,559
these five areas can be broken for people can be challenged could be uh deficient in people's

290
00:31:15,559 --> 00:31:20,679
lives each of these five areas are ways in which Buddhist practice comes alive

291
00:31:20,679 --> 00:31:25,760
for us one of the one of the answers to the

292
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:32,399
uh to the question what's the meaning of life is from I would say from a Buddhist

293
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:39,399
point of view the meaning of life is to be alive is to live and why that's a

294
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:47,080
significant answer and uh rather than you know kind of avoiding the question is that uh

295
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,919
Buddhists when we do this meditation practice we understand intimately

296
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:59,799
personally acutely how much we block our life how

297
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:06,840
much we restrict our living how attachments how clinging how fear

298
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:14,960
resentment even desires that we have actually limit us rather than having un unfetter

299
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:22,600
desires to use your your credit card as much as you want is actually a

300
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:29,200
limitation to be the most wealthiest person in this planet it and live just

301
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:35,360
for that purpose probably it means a truncated life something is blocked and

302
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:42,840
restricted and anyway whatever whether that's true or not we can to the degree to which we interfere with our life

303
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:50,639
being lived fully and freely that's something we can feel what happens when our when the our

304
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:56,799
life is being lived fully it's so then we can feel then we

305
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:02,000
can feel like this is good this is being alive in a way that's satisfying and

306
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:08,360
deeply meaningful there's there I don't know if it's a study or whether it's a thought

307
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:14,120
experiment but I've read about um comparing two people on an assembly line

308
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:19,600
doing the same mundane assembly line routine one person is

309
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:27,519
bored and the bored person their life energy is gets drained from them they the other person

310
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:35,039
sees it as a game how fast they can do it how well they can do it and just completely absorbed in doing it and

311
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,639
enters into a flow State and a flow state is a state of of

312
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:46,120
of well-being of joy of Engagement of self dropping away in a certain way and

313
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:51,480
it just feels so good to be in the state it doesn't matter that it's a mundane

314
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:58,760
boring activity from the external point of view just being a alive is so

315
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:05,760
great so this idea of the purpose of life is to be alive works if you believe that the

316
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:13,839
Dharma the Deep our deep self has wisdom and love and care and Community as part

317
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:22,398
of it and that's what we can discover when we do this practice in fact there's a tremendous resource within us that can

318
00:34:22,399 --> 00:34:28,760
provide us with meaning agency

319
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:38,040
identity dignity Community kinship and oh the last one healing and

320
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:43,280
Reconciliation so some people that's their primary need at chaplain C uh in

321
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:49,638
the hospital or other places that all the other needs are what they are but the limiting factor for the person is

322
00:34:49,639 --> 00:34:57,000
healing and Reconciliation and uh something is broken and healing is usually with

323
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:04,680
reconciliation was with other people healing is with something else with oneself or with what one takes as being

324
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:09,760
the purpose of life or the meaning of life for that which is Ultimate and

325
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:16,520
sacred and um so that's the task mindfulness can have a powerful role for

326
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:23,839
that mindfulness is a healing movement to feel and see where the break is and

327
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:32,040
allow the Dharma to move through Us in such way that a tremendous amount healing can happen from the Dharma being

328
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:38,640
allowed to move through us the heart knows how to heal and so we're allowing that heart to

329
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:44,480
heal through this practice so I'll go through the name

330
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:52,160
them again maybe as I name them this time why don't you see if any one of them might be kind of the one that's

331
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,400
more interesting for you to spend time considering me

332
00:35:57,400 --> 00:36:03,560
meaning and purpose agency and

333
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:11,760
autonomy identity and dignity uh community and

334
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:15,760
kinship healing and

335
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:25,160
Reconciliation we could say these are needs we all have and is any one of them a need that

336
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:34,200
is more you oh today that's the one that seems up for me or it's just the whole

337
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:41,920
catastrophe so um so thank you for listening to this and I hope this kind

338
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,880
of gave you a different perspective especially those of you been coming listening to these talks Buddhist talks

339
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:54,200
for a long time it's a new A New Perspective to kind of look at yourself with and and maybe to have conversations

340
00:36:54,200 --> 00:37:01,119
with friends so in about about um 7 minutes or so or 10 minutes

341
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:06,720
there'll be this potluck you're all here welcome to attend and even whether you

342
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,079

343
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:17,599

344
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:24,480

345
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:32,359
the ice a little bit and um maybe just say hello and then you can go to say hello to someone or maybe find

346
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:38,280
out a little bit more about them or maybe um tell them which of these what
