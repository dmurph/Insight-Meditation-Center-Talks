1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,600
you so welcome my name is Maria strotman

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,380
sounds so strange to say that I haven't given my name in so long

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,960
I'm going to read a quote for you and unfortunately

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,560
I have forgotten where I got it so you'll just have to trust me that it's a great source

5
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,619
there is a dimension of life of awareness that you can discover

6
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,460
tune into rest in that is silent deep

7
00:00:37,460 --> 00:00:42,840
embracing of all an imperfect balance with it a kind of

8
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,940
wisdom that says yes these are the inevitable changes on the

9
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:55,160
surface and here's the Stillness of awareness Underneath It All

10
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:03,140
there is a dimension of Life of awareness that you can discover tune into rest in that is silent deep

11
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:10,380
embracing of all and imperfect balance with it a kind of wisdom that says these are the

12
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,760
invis inevitable changes on the surface and here's the Stillness of awareness

13
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:22,979
Underneath It All so I I've read this and I thought about

14
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:28,259
it a bit and I thought you know this is really this is really reassuring what a

15
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:33,799
wonderful idea that there's a Stillness Underneath It All

16
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,960
and it's a kind of wisdom and I can just be with this in this

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:49,880
space this embracing this space and I thought about

18
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,360
the idea that this was gladdening to the heart and so I have been thinking about

19
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:03,360
gladdening the heart for some some days a week or so

20
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,599
and tonight we're going to speak about gladdening the heart gladdening the heart having a little

21
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:16,620
heartbeat light light not happiness but a gladdening of the

22
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:24,180
heart a quickening of the heart an uplift of the heart so we're going to begin

23
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:30,120
I'm going to invite you excuse me I'm going to invite you to eat some

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:36,780
blackberries with me now I would love to be able to pass out blackberries but I don't have any with

25
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:44,099
me and anybody listening who's not in this room wouldn't have access anyway that just would not be fair

26
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:50,940
so you're going to have to use your imagination to conjure up these blackberries that we're going to eat

27
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:57,780
and use your use your visual memory your sense of smell your taste feel the

28
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:06,500
juiciness and we're going to go Blackberry eating with Galway canal

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:16,440
I love to go out in late September among the fat over ripe icy black blackberries

30
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,159
to eat blackberries for breakfast the stocks very prickly a penalty they

31
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:30,840
earn for knowing the black art of blackberry making and as I stand among them lifting the

32
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:38,879
stalks to my mouth the ripest berries fall almost unbidden to my tongue

33
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,340
as words sometimes do certain peculiar words like strengths or

34
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:52,379
quenched or firmed many lettered one-syllable lumps which I

35
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:59,400
squeeze squinch open and Splurge well into the silent startled

36
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:07,040
icy black language of blackberry eating in late September

37
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,739
did you taste any blackberries did you see any blackberries

38
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:20,060
just the intensity of being with blackberries

39
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,880
I squeeze squinch open Splurge well in the silent startled icy

40
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:36,080
black language of blackberry eating in late September

41
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:43,680
the feel of being in those blackberries and really experiencing those

42
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:50,240
blackberries there's they don't have any meaning they don't have any fundamental

43
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,800
relationships to what it means in the world they don't have anything to do with

44
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:03,960
suffering they have a little bit to do with pleasure here but it's just the tasting and the seeing

45
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:12,840
and and the being with those blackberries that I want to call to mind here it's the joy the Delight of just

46
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:18,660
being with it being in the process of eating those blackberries

47
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,660
unlike the joy of getting my iPad to stay awake

48
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:30,479
so when I speak of gladdening I'm talking about that uh introducing to

49
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:36,120
our practice or recalling in our practice the Delight that comes from

50
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:42,060
practice it's not uncommon to hear someone say I am so grateful for my practice I never

51
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:47,220
could have gotten through this without my practice the practice has been so important to me and it's beginning to

52
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:52,400
feel like a terrible burden to have this practice

53
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:58,139
and so I want to remind us that the practice is to be held lightly

54
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:07,139
that the practice is really a gift and not a burden

55
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:13,380
too often our practice has something to do with how we do it and when we do it and how

56
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:19,139
often we do it and am I doing it right and how far along am I in my practice

57
00:06:19,139 --> 00:06:26,220
and what's going to happen next but the gladdening of the heart

58
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:33,900
is really about the Delight that just happens just happens it's not like we do

59
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:40,380
something to make a gladdened heart it's a gift to just kind of come as it's

60
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:48,080
like Grace you know sprinkles on you when you least expect it

61
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:54,199
we're not managing suffering when we talk about gladdening the heart

62
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,160
we're not trying to write a sense of ill will

63
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:09,660
we can be in the presence of ill will and still glad in the heart I heard something Gill said a couple of

64
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:15,780
weeks ago where he said okay so if you can't bring yourself to push away ill will

65
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:22,500
at least be grateful that you want to at least be grateful that you want to

66
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:29,460
that's a gladdening of the heart that's in not taking everything that's happening to you and condensing it down

67
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:36,620
into some black hole of seriousness and an inevitable pulling

68
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:43,440
but really being with the process of just living being alive

69
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,860
I want to recall the joy that arises in practice

70
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:55,759
for this to be enough in practice

71
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:05,280
to not think of our practice as something that is of a lace a suitcase

72
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:13,759
that we carry around full of all our tricks but that the suitcase contains us

73
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:22,879
so that we can experience the smoothness or the roughness of what we are experiencing

74
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:28,979
the intensity of it or the boredom of it

75
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:35,039
whatever the experience is we want to be totally present for it

76
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:42,060
because in being totally present for it it is just itself

77
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:47,880
it isn't something that we have to make into a story of Our Lives

78
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:54,779
another piece of this that I've been thinking about is that we we have us the story of our life

79
00:08:54,779 --> 00:09:00,839
and okay we accept the fact that we're changing all the time but there's this little thread that we

80
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:07,080
carry around with us that's that's Maria Here Comes Maria and Maria was here and now she's there and she's going to go

81
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,560
over there pose you could meet every moment and you

82
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:19,200
don't have to be Maria or Audrey

83
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,800
or anybody else you don't have to be someone you don't have to be the person you think you are

84
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:32,399
you don't have to be the person someone else thinks you are you don't have to be meet any expectations you can just take

85
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:38,519
the next step in this experience just the next step you don't have to be anything in

86
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:43,640
particular how does that feel

87
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:52,160
not to have to be who you think you are who you have been

88
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:05,820
so um those of you in this room probably remember that the Reigns of New Year's

89
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:11,580
Eve when there was a lot of flooding and the the storm was significant

90
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:18,360
and early in the morning I was out on my back deck I live on the third floor of this Condo

91
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:25,680
building and I was it was dark so I couldn't actually see anything but I could hear

92
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:31,320
the storm and what I heard was water the water was

93
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:38,519
dripping through the trees the water was hitting the roof the water was running in the gutter the water was

94
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:46,800
rushing down below which is I have to tell you not common it's usually dry down below and here it was rushing

95
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:52,980
through the area around our building and all I could do was hear

96
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,200
all he could do was hear so I was just listening to water

97
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:03,300
I was listening to water and all of a sudden I had this feeling

98
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:10,399
of total Delight just wow water

99
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:17,760
I thought how magnificent it was because all I was doing was just hearing

100
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:24,420
I wasn't thinking about what the water was doing or where it was going or why is it here or how much is there

101
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:31,459
I was just listening and in being totally in the moment

102
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:38,339
there was Delight it's not like I was going after Delight

103
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:43,440
I was just listening and that to me is what it means to

104
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,959
Gladden the heart to be available for the heart to be gladdened

105
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:56,040
to be totally totally present for whatever is happening

106
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:03,259
without without an opinion about what's happening you know just just here

107
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:14,760
today I read a story about uh two people who are friends so

108
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:23,480
uh there was an article it was in the New York Times and it was about too unlikely to be friends people

109
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:30,660
one of them was a well-known Christian conservative who speaks out against gay marriage and abortion

110
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:38,100
she's a former civil rights lawyer who spent most of her career fighting to desegregate schools and protect

111
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:45,120
transgender kids from bullying these are two pretty different people and they were both assigned to the same

112
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:50,820
committee called let's see it's called the U.S Commission on International religious

113
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:56,279
freedom one was was assigned to the committee by a

114
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:01,680
Republican and one was assigned to the committee by a Democrat I'm going to let you guess which one was

115
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,260
which and the two of them went in he is uh

116
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:15,000
he's a white man older Conservative Christian from Louisiana

117
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,540
she is a Hindu from South Chicago

118
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:29,100
really different people but it turns out they had much more in common than they had separate from one another

119
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:34,139
and the two of them began testing what checking with one another when they were

120
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:39,600
trying to get they were looking at at religious freedom outside the United

121
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,700
States we won't go into why they were looking outside the United States but that's

122
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:49,940
what the commission was formed to do and they would support people who were being

123
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:56,880
penalized by their government or by other people because of their religion and the two of them were often fighting

124
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:04,019
on the same side and the consequence of that was that they began they actually became

125
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:10,139
friends and they kept in touch after their commission assignments expired

126
00:14:10,139 --> 00:14:15,300
to their great surprise and the the the man said you know what I

127
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:21,959
realized I realized we were friends when I when I realized she was in my prayers

128
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:28,920
and it made me really careful of that how I referred to anything because I didn't want to offend her

129
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:35,000
and so I became much more careful in my speech and as I was listening to that

130
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:43,620
I teared up and I realized that that tear was not about sadness and

131
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:51,240
it wasn't about happiness it was a tear that arose from the hope

132
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,380
that polarization doesn't have to be the sad thing that it is

133
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:02,940
that people can talk to one another that people don't have to be on opposite

134
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:08,579
sides of things and just the presence of that I found so hopeful it brought tears

135
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:14,160
to my eyes that is a gladdening of the heart

136
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:22,139
that that appearance of Hope that reassurance of hope that

137
00:15:22,139 --> 00:15:29,940
possibility lightens the heart and you say ah it's

138
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:36,240
possible and you can see it's possible this is what I mean by gladdening the

139
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,699
heart but it's possible not to notice it we could just go through life not noticing

140
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:48,360
it that would be pretty easy actually if I am determined to be upset about

141
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:53,360
something I'm not going to not be upset about it

142
00:15:53,459 --> 00:16:00,300
if I'm overwhelmed with a sense of Injustice or righteousness I am not going to be able to see a way

143
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:06,079
out of it I'm just going to be bemoaning it

144
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,500
in the same way last week I found myself

145
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:23,940
talk uh I was very discouraged I'd been working

146
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:31,100
on a project for about a year and a half and it looked like it was just over it just was not going to happen

147
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:37,860
and in that moment I thought you know I'm going to be okay with this I'm a

148
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:43,860
good Buddhist if it was meant to be if it was going to happen it was going to happen if it hasn't happened I can just

149
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:50,639
be fine and Meanwhile my heart's just going oh oh how can this how can this be true

150
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:57,839
this particular project is not something that personally benefited me but something I really believed in

151
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,959
and it looked like it just wasn't going to happen and so like somebody encouraged me to go look at this other

152
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:12,240
place go check these people out and I thought I've checked so many people out I did had a meeting with them

153
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:18,720
they were terrific they had great plan that it was much less expensive than the

154
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:26,400
other proposal that had made to me I was so excited about it and as I was reporting it I found myself saying

155
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,160
I see the approach of a Pollyanna complex I so much want this to be true

156
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,220
that I'm just going to believe anything and in that moment I realized it wasn't

157
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:45,600
it was a fear that I couldn't be Pollyanna that it was a fear that I couldn't be optimistic

158
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:49,520
I'd been so discouraged before

159
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:58,200
and to suspend the opinion about whether I was being

160
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:04,500
overly optimistic and just said well let's just see what happens let's just see what happens and of course I still

161
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:09,679
don't know what's going to happen because it's a process

162
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,100
but in the moment that I let go of either denying optimism or totally

163
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,200
embracing optimism and left myself in the place of just I wonder what's going

164
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:28,639
to happen everything's lighter

165
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:33,960
I didn't have to have an opinion about whether I was being optimistic or not it

166
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:42,000
just didn't matter it was let's see what happens and that let's see what happens part

167
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,059
is is the place of a gladdened heart

168
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:53,460
it leaves hope and possibility and a sense of

169
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:58,580
freedom a sense of freedom

170
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:07,220
think of how much courage it takes to be really present

171
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:14,880
it implies a great deal of trust you have to trust

172
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:21,840
that the people you're talking to the position you're in is is somehow going to not hurt you

173
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:27,179
we get kind of in the in the habit of vigilance

174
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:33,000
I have to be careful about this I have to be careful about that I have to watch my sense of that I have to be careful of

175
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,200
free speech I have to be careful of wise speech I have to be careful and we find ourselves being vigilant about

176
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:45,780
everything and the energy of that vigilance

177
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:52,140
sets up a barrier to experiencing something just as the

178
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:59,760
raw experience because now we're measuring it against all of our little safety tags

179
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,740
how does it how does it measure against that how does it measure against that how does it measure against that

180
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:13,200
not only does it take a lot of energy but it distorts what we see and how we

181
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:20,520
experience just being alive I am not advocating that one gives up

182
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:26,820
all diligence or vigilance only that we see when vigilance is

183
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:33,600
operating that we notice it that we notice how careful we're being

184
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:39,960
one of the really great things about retreat is that you can just sit

185
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:46,140
in a fairly safe place you don't actually have to talk to anybody you don't have to explain yourself to

186
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:53,700
anybody you'd kind of have to explain yourself to yourself

187
00:20:53,700 --> 00:21:00,960
but it's a relatively safe place you can just you can allow whatever feelings you have

188
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:07,440
to come out to allow whatever things you have been suppressing in your

189
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:14,580
life to just kind of happen in a safe place well suppose we could do that more often

190
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:20,299
suppose we could do that without having to be on retreat

191
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:40,460
suppose suppose we could just show up for this moment and not worry about anything

192
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:47,280
for just this moment just this one not all of them just this

193
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,980
one it's safe in this room right now

194
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:59,820
right now it's safe and as soon as I said that I felt myself

195
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,019
take a deep breath wow

196
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:15,620
in the last days of the Buddha the the suta Maha paranab niba nabana

197
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:21,179
suta the last days of the of the Buddha there is uh there were a whole process

198
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:28,380
procession of people who were coming to see the Buddha at the end and each of them that came there's a you

199
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:35,880
know how suits are there'll be a phrase that keeps getting repeated this happened and then the next people come and the same this happened and and the

200
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:41,159
phrase that was that that kept happening was this one and the blessed one spent

201
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:48,179
much of the night instructing them in the Dharma rousing edifying and

202
00:22:48,179 --> 00:22:53,880
gladdening them rousing edifying and gladdening them

203
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:59,340
this is what the Buddha chose to do in his last hours and days

204
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:06,360
rousing edifying and gladdening the rousing is about energy the edifying

205
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:12,179
is teaching the truth of the dhamma and the gladdening is the appreciation

206
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:17,820
for the fact that if if we have a heavy heart if we are loaded down and burdened

207
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:25,320
we can't take anything on and the gladdening the loosening of the

208
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,320
strictures around how we experience something is key to being able to move

209
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,639
forward in practice

210
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:45,000
gladdening is one of the first steps in uh the string that's called the uh the

211
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:50,280
gladdening Pinhead the string that leads to samadhi you

212
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:56,880
know there are five things there's Gladden Joy

213
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:03,000
Tranquility happiness and samadhi

214
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,100
it isn't like you you do something to get to those steps what you do is step

215
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:13,860
into the flow when each one leads to the other and a gladdened heart leads to Joy

216
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:21,539
how wonderful it it moves when you're in the flow when

217
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:28,880
you're just allowing something to happen when you're just allowing the experience to be

218
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,260
and when you're in meditation the SE can inevitably lead to samadhi and deep

219
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:40,039
concentration in a place where you can see things clearly

220
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:47,700
that I maintain that we're more likely to be able to see things clearly just as we're walking

221
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:55,500
around in the world off the cushion if we can do it with an unguarded heart

222
00:24:55,500 --> 00:25:05,400
with a gladdened heart and so I seek that not as the thing

223
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:13,220
but as an opportunity the opportunity for just thisness

224
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:25,280
okay there we go

225
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:39,720
so the other thing about gladness that I wanted to to talk about is that gladness arises out of out of practice

226
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,880
and supports it you know it's not like

227
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:53,220
uh now let me put it another way if I recognize Delight in sitting and

228
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:59,640
meditating I'm much more likely to meditate and if I'm meditating more I'm much more

229
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:05,279
likely to give up the strictures around my limits on how I will experience

230
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:12,120
something I'm much more likely to have a light heart I'm much more likely to be involved in

231
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:17,220
the mindfulness of this moment I will grow more familiar with what mindfulness

232
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:22,260
means I will become a person who knows what's

233
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:27,900
happening in this moment not ahead of time or behind

234
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:33,840
but experiences this moment and says oh I know I'm sitting here

235
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:37,580
I know I'm speaking

236
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:46,880
where we treat the experiences actually happening and not just part of the story

237
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,940
so that mindfulness just becomes habit

238
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:03,059
that leads to a gladdening of the heart and the gladdening of the heart in turn

239
00:27:03,059 --> 00:27:09,659
leads to Joy leads to increased attention to our practice

240
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:17,580
it is a both an evolution of practice and something that supports the practice

241
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:24,559
it becomes something that's not a task that's something that we can be aware of

242
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,840
so it kind of works like this the the uh excuse me

243
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:37,580
I'm going to take a drink here hold on

244
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:00,960
okay so uh tomorrow I'm leaving on a road trip at 7 30 in the morning and tonight I was coming here to talk

245
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:07,500
and I've got this project where I've got vendors yelling at me why are you not answering my bid and the reason I'm

246
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:13,980
going on the road trip is that my mother's in hospice and I want to go see her while I can

247
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:20,820
and you can imagine there's a lot all kinds of family Dynamics around this I have lots of siblings where I'm going

248
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:26,700
so that's been on my mind and why are you doing this and why aren't you doing that and I'm you know I'm doing laundry

249
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:33,360
and I'm packing and and my husband decides he wants to rebalance our investments again today

250
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,760
and so late this afternoon I found myself in the midst of great chaos

251
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:43,400
mental chaos a lot of mental chaos

252
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:52,440
and I had my sister on the phone who wanted to tell a story that which wasn't relevant to the time

253
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:58,320
and a text from the person who's going to take care of my plants what what are you are you ready to tell me about that

254
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:04,799
and I I looked at my hands and I realized they were moving like this moving moving

255
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:11,820
moving and I said well I could just let the hands move I don't have to move

256
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:17,400
and as I dissociated myself from the the train of I have to get all these things

257
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:23,520
done I was able to say well what will I choose to get done in this

258
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:30,080
moment I'll end the conversation with my sister talk to you tomorrow

259
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:38,220
and just okay some things are going to fall down the realization that the chaos

260
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:45,860
was really just trying to do everything at once which wasn't going to happen

261
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:51,480
so I could become filled with anxiety and stress

262
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,740
and lose my sense of presence

263
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,960
by getting lost in the story of all the things I had to do or I could just say oh things are

264
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:09,080
falling on the floor look

265
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:18,500
you can actually do that that's what I did I said well some things are going to fall on the floor

266
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:26,159
and just the act of saying that even if I didn't quite believe it

267
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:33,240
I didn't quite let go of everything I breathed easier

268
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,380
more easily

269
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:44,399
see it can't be about all the things I want even my good

270
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:51,539
intentions if I'm too wed too well as a good Buddhist I'm going to be

271
00:30:51,539 --> 00:30:56,580
totally equanimous In This Moment I'm going to deny that things are

272
00:30:56,580 --> 00:31:02,340
falling on the floor because then I have to be you know there for the fact that things are falling on

273
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:10,159
the floor things are not getting done things are things that people are unhappy

274
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:19,679
why didn't you call me and in that moment of realizing

275
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:26,000
things don't have to be better to be at ease with them

276
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,440
the at ease part is not everything's smooth and I don't have to

277
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:41,600
worry about it but rather I'm okay with everything's not smooth

278
00:31:42,059 --> 00:31:45,260
everything's not smooth

279
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:55,260
and to not make it a a piece of responsibility or judgment it doesn't

280
00:31:55,260 --> 00:32:02,120
have anything to do with me it's just how things are right now

281
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:11,039
you know I could tell myself stories about how I should have organized my day better but what's the point of that the

282
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:17,760
day is already over so that's not useful

283
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:25,919
I am here and this is what's happening I am here and this is what's happening

284
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:31,980
oh knowing this is what's happening is a lot easier than writing down the list of

285
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:34,880
things that could be true

286
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:43,440
to to be in the presence of stress and say how do I know I'm stressed well

287
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:49,679
there's this tight feeling of this pulling okay so so just let it have all the room

288
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:54,679
in the world and watch it spread itself out

289
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:03,299
and notice does it have colors my stress tends to be Gray but sometimes it's red

290
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:09,120
I have a sense of red and Heat and sometimes it's just boring old

291
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:16,640
pulling and to be right there with that feeling

292
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:24,419
frees you from having to think about all the reasons that you might be stressed you're just dealing with you're just

293
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:32,220
feeling stress so just feel it just be there with it just notice it

294
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:36,140
give it a name hi Fred

295
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:52,260
there doesn't have to be a story attached to everything that we experience can just be itself

296
00:33:52,260 --> 00:34:00,120
just as we can just be the person that has shown up for this moment we don't have to be something

297
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:06,320
just this and the Heart gets lighter

298
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:13,020
we don't do it to make the heart lighter we just lighten the load

299
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:16,638
stop carrying around the burden

300
00:34:20,339 --> 00:34:25,500
if we were to cultivate gladness of heart what would we do

301
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:32,898
what would you do how would you do it what would you what would you do how would you be

302
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:43,020
the most important thing is to just be present just be

303
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:48,480
here really here and not in this story

304
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,618
the story of your life

305
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:58,859
and to be here with a sense

306
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:05,760
of ease you know if you're here

307
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:13,500
you're not there you don't have to compare yourself to

308
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:18,599
anything you just hear you you just experiencing

309
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:25,099
this and just this is actually easy

310
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:31,160
it's oh just this

311
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:46,260
one one of the practices that I took on a few years ago that I still practice diligently as the

312
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:53,539
practice of of equanimity practice and it's the the moment when I say

313
00:35:53,940 --> 00:36:00,859
my suffering is dependent on my intentions and actions not what other people want

314
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:10,700
despite what I may want things are as they are may I see things just as they are

315
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:18,078
the act of saying that over and over and over and over again to myself

316
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:27,320
frees me from the requirement to explain all of my experiences

317
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:34,320
I see things just as they are that's how I want them to be or only

318
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:40,800
looking this way at them yes even the practice of meta can be distorted you

319
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,740
know if we do meta purposely to get rid of ill will

320
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:52,920
and be a better person and get along with our neighbors more these are all very good reasons for

321
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:58,380
doing meta however now we've set out an agenda

322
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:04,740
where these are my intentions and if my intentions don't come through then I'm there's something wrong here or the

323
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:14,099
practice is wrong or I'm doing it wrong or I'm wrong whereas if you do meta with the idea of

324
00:37:14,099 --> 00:37:20,160
really wishing yourself well really wishing someone else well just just that

325
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:26,720
no further than that just wishing all beings well

326
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:34,460
there is a softening of the heart an opening of the heart

327
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:42,240
and ill will does not coexist with that we don't do it to get rid of ill will

328
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:49,980
we do it so that that's the condition that we're introducing into as our contribution In

329
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:56,240
This Moment of just an open gladdened heart

330
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:11,160
and we cultivate the Eightfold Path it turns out that it's really hard to

331
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,578
have a gladdened heart if you're cheating

332
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:23,040
cheating at anything if you're taking the shortcut that is

333
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:28,140
harming someone else if we're not living up to the ethics of

334
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:35,760
the of the uh precepts if we're not if we're taking what's not freely given

335
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:41,960
well it ordered this this little bit won't hurt this isn't hurting anybody

336
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:47,579
it turns out that that squeezing of Our intention of the

337
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:54,359
squeezing of our the way we are in the world shuts down the heart and burdens

338
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:58,578
it so that we can't have a gladdened heart

339
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:11,460
and we say oh I I guess I I just maybe I don't I guess I won't do that anymore

340
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:19,520
and the Very Act was saying I don't want to do that anymore opens up a space

341
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:25,859
the other day I had this ridiculous uh well not

342
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:31,039
ridiculous I had this strong experience of Shame

343
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:38,760
strong experience of Shame and it was triggered by something I watched on television it wasn't something I had done

344
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:43,280
but I recognized the feeling of Shame

345
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:52,140
you know that kind of cringing feeling and you want to go high then or you

346
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:57,660
come up with something more like bravado where you think about injustices or

347
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:02,760
why do I feel this way and all of those thoughts came and went in my mind and I

348
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:07,800
thought okay so shame has been triggered because the

349
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:14,040
people in this program were so shameful but the shame is mine

350
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:21,078
there's something that there's something that I'm not able to recall

351
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:30,420
that has been triggered by what I saw so I don't have to own the shame or

352
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:37,020
figure it out or decide what it means I can just feel that shame and let it

353
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:40,280
just be

354
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:46,520
and watch as it fades away

355
00:40:48,119 --> 00:40:53,339
it was quite odd not to ask what's this about

356
00:40:53,339 --> 00:40:57,680
but just let to be just let it be

357
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:04,680
and then turn the direction turn your awareness in a different direction I

358
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:11,880
also didn't have to grab the shame and roll around on the floor in it either I get to say huh

359
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:17,700
that feels really icky and I know I didn't do anything so it

360
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:21,740
isn't that I have something I have to stop doing

361
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:29,160
and so I look at something else and say there is some Delight in this world

362
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:34,500
and there is some virtue and some things that I do in this world

363
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:40,560
and I'm going to think about them I'm going to think about the other people that I know I'm going to think about

364
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:47,660
kindness and the heart is gladdened

365
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:53,579
I'm not shoving anything under the rug with that movement I'm just allowing

366
00:41:53,579 --> 00:42:00,200
something else in the view the way one would if you were

367
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:07,260
you were on you were trying to meditate and you can't you can't quite settle

368
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:14,460
just can't quite settle and so you decide to think of someone

369
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:20,579
who does settle and you just sit and picture that someone

370
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:24,380
and you're inspired by that

371
00:42:25,619 --> 00:42:33,020
and you settle inspired by the possibility of that

372
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:38,000
taking refuge in the possibility

373
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,119
I'm hoping I'm going to put my hand right on this

374
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:09,119
this is a poem by uh David bud Bill winter tonight sunset

375
00:43:09,119 --> 00:43:14,940
tonight at Sunset walking on the Snowy Road my shoes crunching on the Frozen

376
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:21,300
gravel first through the woods then out into the Open Fields pass a couple of

377
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:27,660
trailers and some pickup trucks I stop and look at this guy suddenly orange red

378
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:33,000
pink blue green purple yellow gray all at once and everywhere

379
