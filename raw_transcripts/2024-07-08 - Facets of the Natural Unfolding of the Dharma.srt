1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,439
so good to be with you all um and those who are here in IMC and those who are

2
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:14,240
online also and so very delighted to be here um

3
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:21,640
I want to share some Reflections today that's inspired by uh what Gil offered

4
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:29,240
maybe uh couple of weeks ago um where he spoke about um kind of this natural

5
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:35,840
unfolding of a Dharma or use the term naturalist

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,600
Dharma and I've been reflecting about this a lot uh recently uh inspired by

7
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:48,280
what she he shared and in my own practice and so I want to offer

8
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:55,399
something uh based on my own Reflections and learnings with this and there is an

9
00:00:55,399 --> 00:01:01,760
interesting sutta I would like to bring in this is a poly Canon text

10
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:07,080
um and this is in angut nikaya uh 10.2

11
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:14,560
for those who might be interested in kind of looking it up and the sutta described a kind of

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:22,159
natural flow U of the Dharma and that started from Sila or the cultivation of

13
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:29,600
ethical conduct and that leads all the way to Awakening and so I like to read the sua

14
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,920
it's actually quite evocative when I read it uh

15
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,960
first and the translation is based on um

16
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:47,439
uh uh banti su's translation and it's called making a

17
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:56,039
wish so here it is practitioners an ethical person who has fulfilled ethical

18
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:04,439
conduct need not make a wish may I have no regrets it's only natural that an

19
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:11,239
ethical person has no regrets when you have no regrets you

20
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:17,519
need not make a wish may I feel Joy and the poly term is

21
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:24,480
pamoja it's only natural that Joy it's only natural that Joy Springs

22
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,959
up when you have no regrets when you feel Joy you not make a

23
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,720
wish may I experience Rapture and the poly term is pity for those who may be

24
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:47,280
um familiar with it it's only natural that Rapture arises when you're

25
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:55,599
joyful when your mind is full of rapture you need not make a wish may my body

26
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:02,599
become tranquil it's only natural that your body becomes tranquil when your mind is

27
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:07,640
full of rapture when your body is tranquil you

28
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:14,080
need not make a wish may I feel Suka or Bliss or

29
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:21,159
happiness it's only natural to feel happiness when your body is

30
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:28,159
tranquil when you feel happiness you need not make a wish may my mind be

31
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:34,200
immersed in some body or concentration it's only natural for the

32
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:42,239
mind to be immersed in somebody when you feel happiness when your mind is immersed in

33
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:50,519
somebody you need not make a wish may I truly know and see it's only natural to

34
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,920
truly see and know when your mind is immersed in

35
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:06,840
somebody when you truly know and see you need not make a wish may I become dis uh

36
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,920
disenchanted and dispassionate it's only natural to

37
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:18,959
become disenchanted and dispassionate when you truly know and

38
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:24,600
see when you're disenchanted and dispassionate you need

39
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:30,759
not make a wish may I realize the knowledge and vision of a freedom

40
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,840
it's only natural to realize the knowledge and the vision of a freedom

41
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:42,639
when you are disenchanted and dispassionate and so dot dot dot and and

42
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:51,240
so the Su ended with this and so practitioners good qualities flow on and

43
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:58,080
fill up from one to the other U from going from the near shore

44
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,960
to the far Shore and so that's the sutta of making a wish

45
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,160
you don't need to make a wish when I read

46
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:16,800
this I feel myself both um very happy about knowing this

47
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:24,140
and at the same time like really really is this really like

48
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:31,520
[Laughter] this so um some of you may be familiar

49
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,280
with another sutta that kind of have a a a similar kind of flow there's a a kind

50
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,039
of unfolding that overlaps with this one to a big degree uh it's the teaching on

51
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:49,919
liberative dependent arising and it didn't start with a CA

52
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,600
but it started with uh some different um aspect of the the Dharma and then it

53
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,360
also unfolds on just kind of like like this very naturally towards Liberation

54
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:08,639
and freedom so how is it this possible uh

55
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:14,160
like this Le for most of us a Dharma practice

56
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:20,400
doesn't feel that natural as I was reflecting about my own

57
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:29,280
practice you know lots of ups and downs and and it's bumpy you know and um lots

58
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:37,360
of Zig and zags and sometimes you feel like you're taking one step forward and three step backwards so so there's all

59
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:46,599
this range how do we understand this kind of natural unfolding of the

60
00:06:46,599 --> 00:06:52,319
Dharma and so I wanted to unpack this a little bit and I like like to

61
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:01,919
distinguish uh with two words the word of normal versus

62
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:07,560
natural what is normal and I looked up the definition a little bit and and

63
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:12,639
natural seems to mean that it's something that confirms to a certain

64
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:18,280
kind of a standard or commonality and so other words that we

65
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:25,080
often use and that are kind of like you know normal is usual you know it's

66
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:32,680
regular something like that and so it's normal that we stop at the TR traffic light and red light that's kind of

67
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:39,800
normal we all behave like this and that's the norm of the society and uh it's normal that we line

68
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:45,440
up in the G grocery line to go through the checkup counter and that's normal

69
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,759
right and there is a kind of a normaly to it a norm it guides how we behave uh

70
00:07:52,759 --> 00:08:00,840
in some way um within ourselves and in the society and natural

71
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:08,639
um natural is a little different natural comes from this word

72
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,400
nature uh it's a kind of quality that's manifesting

73
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,759
or uh expressing itself according to the nature of

74
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:27,360
things and kind kind of have a certain kind of alignment or harmony with the

75
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,279
nature of things so it's nor it's natural that we're born

76
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,120
and then we'll die and that's the nature of life

77
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,480
um and uh it's natural that apple trees

78
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:52,000
grow apples that's the nature and I as I was sitting here today

79
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,880
this morning I just kind of vividly uh realized when we sat for a while and

80
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:05,240
kind of all the walking and the movements and the sounds settles down

81
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:13,399
all it's natural becomes quiet when there's not a lot of movements and doing and it's natural to

82
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:19,720
quiet down and so that's the nature of

83
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:26,680
things um sometimes what's natural is also

84
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:33,240
normal and just like this uh you know some part of us know that we're

85
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:39,600
born will age and we die eventually and so that's kind of normal some part of us

86
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:44,959
knows that and and yet um also a lot of

87
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:52,920
times what seems to be normal is actually not necessarily

88
00:09:52,920 --> 00:10:00,440
natural let's take this birth and aging death as an example again

89
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,760
now even though some part of us knows you know that's the nature of

90
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:13,640
life but if we look at our uh Behavior how we

91
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:21,000
manifest in how we relate to this nature our normal behavior often does

92
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:28,000
not match to the nature we don't like

93
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:35,399
aging we don't like death and um most of the time you hear this a lot and the

94
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:44,000
various people said this we live as if world would never die and that's truth that's normal way

95
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:51,959
of how sometimes a lot of times how we live you I noticed when I just sat down

96
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:59,560
today I didn't not bring my glasses and I looked at oh my I don't need the I'm

97
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:06,600
going to read this pages okay and then some part of me had this you know um I

98
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,480
don't like it kind of this moment of feeling and that's the normal thing I

99
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:21,240
don't like what actually pretty natural for us to eyesight deteriorate and deteriorate

100
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,360
and all that but when we're are seeing it we can begin to see

101
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:32,480
oh and there is this part of normal uh habitual

102
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:39,959
tendency to not liking it and it can Harden uh for a lot of us

103
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:46,440
the when we're not noticing it that we believe that is the normal

104
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:55,399
way you know it should not be happening you know this this shouldn't be here or

105
00:11:55,399 --> 00:12:00,680
um our loved one p passes

106
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:10,639
away um it's hard for us and uh we really

107
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,680
wish that would not be the case yeah that's kind of a normal

108
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,279
behavior normal tendency of our minds and

109
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:30,079
hearts and so this behavior and manifestation can be normal but they

110
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:38,160
actually don't reflect the nature or the natural um unfolding of our lives and

111
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,560
because of that often there can be a kind of inner

112
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:48,880
tension between the two and I like to

113
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:54,040
say this inner tension is actually good

114
00:12:54,720 --> 00:13:01,079
news this inner tension itself um

115
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:06,279
uh carries and this aspect of us that

116
00:13:06,279 --> 00:13:14,120
actually is aligned with nature and a aspect of ourselves that did not want it

117
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:22,680
to come together uh in some kind of harmony with the nature and so you know that's a hint as

118
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:29,519
the way how we might practice with this is this may be a good news a worthwhile

119
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,880
to uh explore and not to uh dismiss right away oh you know this is painful

120
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:46,360
this is not good I don't like it um so and in reflecting about this

121
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,680
and we can see there can be a a host of

122
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:58,160
seemingly normal ways of relating to ourselves or relating to the world that

123
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,839
actually leads to Dua or leads to suffering and often this kind of

124
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:11,680
seemingly normal Behavior Uh tends to arrive arise under

125
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:19,079
a lot of influences of um underlying great hatred delution and that's kind of

126
00:14:19,079 --> 00:14:24,279
the three poisons that the Buddhist teachings uh point

127
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:31,600
to and instead um of enlivening us and this

128
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:37,959
kind of a forces when we operate in that mode they tend to take a lot of precious

129
00:14:37,959 --> 00:14:46,360
moments and energy away from us um uh there sometimes at times I would

130
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:52,199
feel that they're actually deadening uh far more than what we

131
00:14:52,199 --> 00:15:00,160
think I want to use some examples of this um for example

132
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:05,720
when our body and mind may be distressed whether it's because of

133
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:13,399
physical pain or emotional pain or mental pain um there can be a normal

134
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:21,920
Tendencies uh that come up and to try to fix them get rid of them or being scared

135
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:28,480
about it or being frustrated even angry about it when we can't really do

136
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:37,480
anything and to to alleviate the pain and uh and then there also other

137
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,040
cases for example that uh remember my son is very

138
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:49,759
generous with his Praises of some dishes I make at home you know you know tell me

139
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:56,880
oh this is the best parak paneer I've ever had and so it's

140
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,759
great and I could feel momentary happiness but then at the same

141
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:09,199
time Bo there can be this sense oh look at me you know there a kind of uh

142
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:15,360
flowing happiness just tightens up and that becomes you know that becomes about

143
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:21,399
me and so there can be the all of this kind of normal ways that we

144
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:28,639
feel and sooner or later through our Dharma practice we can begin to see that

145
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:35,079
this kind of seemingly normal and habitual Tendencies are actually not

146
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:42,720
serving us not like a rubbing thoughts on wounds you know if we already have a

147
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,160
physical pain do we think um beating ourselves up

148
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:54,560
is going to help you know if we're already uh emotionally

149
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,759
stressed and we kind of kick up a big fixing a self-improvement project would

150
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:06,280
help not really right uh and yet that can be kind of a

151
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:11,000
norm that we go to

152
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:20,959
um and so um the big part of the Dharma practice is began uh to little by little

153
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,760
to see through this kind of a patterns that almost feel like

154
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:34,120
automatic and they are wired in in US somehow and we can begin to see through

155
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:39,679
this and say oh actually they are harming us

156
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:47,919
more than serving us and so we can learn to begin um to have different kind of

157
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,679
choices in how we choose to respond to the situation we're

158
00:17:53,679 --> 00:18:00,520
in and so in a way uh we can say that our our Dharma

159
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:08,440
practice supports us to find the ways from following the norm and the Norms

160
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:15,320
that don't necessarily serve us and can this kind of a Norms that leads to Anda

161
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:21,240
and to become more and more aligned with the nature of our

162
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:28,400
being I'm not saying that somehow all of the normal ways of our manifestations

163
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:34,000
are problematic and you know lead to Dua that's not true and in fact there are

164
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:40,240
many supportive um uh Norms or the

165
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,760
culture that we live in that supports us to become more and more aligned with the

166
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:54,480
nature of our being I'm often reflecting kind of coming to a community like this

167
00:18:54,480 --> 00:19:00,280
IMC uh that that um sits in the culture

168
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:06,240
of generosity a culture of kindness and when we kind of soak

169
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:13,559
ourselves in and that's very nourishing to our heart and mind it's in in fact

170
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:21,480
enlivening to to some degree for us and so our um and so I'm not uh

171
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:29,520
trying to to say that all of the norm Norms or uh normal way of a being um

172
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:35,480
is uh is an sort of an issue more

173
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:42,840
importantly um the invitation is for us to begin to be able to discern what are

174
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:50,520
the uh ways that we manifest that are supportive to us and what are the ways

175
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:57,400
that actually leads more harm and so I want to a shift gear uh to

176
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:03,600
talk a little bit about about how we do this you know we we know there are this

177
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:11,039
patterns that um manifest in us that often I would say it's not even just

178
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:19,480
within us we all know that many ways of Habitual ways of engaging in the world

179
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:27,400
um because it you know it feels normal to us it's also because it feels normal

180
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:34,720
of you know all around you know and it's normal to be living a very busy or in a

181
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,919
very competitive environment and uh and that's kind of a normal all around

182
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:47,440
us and how do we find our ways uh to come more more aligned or in harmony

183
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:56,120
with nature how do we do that and so uh Gil likened um this

184
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:03,600
process as a kind of a natural naturalist um practicing in line with a

185
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:09,159
naturalist Dharma and so in a way we're

186
00:21:09,159 --> 00:21:15,799
learning um to be become kind of a naturalist of our own

187
00:21:15,799 --> 00:21:23,360
being um in my mind and if you um think about the naturalists you know in the

188
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:30,559
wilderness the naturalist often have a a kind of a curious old open uh kind of

189
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:36,440
Discovery attitude in terms of exploring uh what's out there they not kind of in

190
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:42,559
a big rush to try to nail something you know they're in this open and learning

191
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:49,520
and receptive engaging kind of a process and that's the same way in terms

192
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:55,960
of this naturalist orientation within in our own

193
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:02,760
practice we're directing ourselves to begin to see being curious about what's

194
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:10,720
really happening here what is this tension about how does this manifest and how

195
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:20,240
does it unfold how do we get caught in the normal uh habitual uh Tendencies and how

196
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:28,120
do we become free and the Buddha Dharma teachings

197
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:35,000
ofer first this kind of um uh orientation for us to begin to learn to

198
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:40,679
to look in this way and I would say the mindfulness

199
00:22:40,679 --> 00:22:47,159
practice being present with our own uh being is a big part of this and we're

200
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:55,440
learning to kind of really begin to see what's happening and the Buddha recognized that

201
00:22:55,440 --> 00:23:01,919
uh in his time and and there are different kinds of a

202
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:08,080
people and in one of the sutas he spoke about um kind of four

203
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:15,520
kinds and there is one kind of um people that's set to go along with the

204
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:23,960
stream and those are the people who take part in chasing worldly Wings some of

205
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:31,400
you would know the eight worldly Wings the king and loss and praise and blame

206
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,600
and you know these are the things that we Chase and that's true uh in the

207
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:42,640
Buddhist time as well and in his time that seems to be

208
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:49,360
the norm because that's the stream people follow along so so there is this

209
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:58,559
um uh this kind of a person that follows goes along with the stream and um

210
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:06,200
I remember just reflecting about my own experience for a long while I bought in

211
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:15,960
in those ideas you know and I had this idea of what I have to do and um to make

212
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:24,480
myself successful or to have some sort of good life and I went along with a lot

213
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:32,320
of what you know a deep culture in uh instilled in me and um almost feels

214
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:38,399
ancestral you know kind of instilled in me and and I keep bumping my head

215
00:24:38,399 --> 00:24:46,480
against this and just um and often after some long while it

216
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:52,799
just feels like a dead end it's like wow I'm not getting anywhere just keep going

217
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:58,520
with this and so and there is a second kind

218
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:05,039
of a person that the Buddha spoke about and the B Buddha spoke about is the

219
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:13,240
second type of um people and they are called who goes

220
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:18,760
against the stream that one doesn't take part in

221
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:26,919
this kind of worldly Pursuits and the person lives a more of

222
00:25:26,919 --> 00:25:33,880
a spiritual life and what's really interesting about this part of U description I'm going to

223
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:39,880
paraphrase it and not reading the the suit itself and in fact this person this

224
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:45,000
kind of people going against the stream feels like it's got a lot of

225
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:53,600
difficulties too so they they're not like they're just oh I'm just happy but said there's a lot of um

226
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,679
difficulties and they actually you know they cry and they have things happen to them

227
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:07,240
so I loved it and I feel like that's the nature of going against a

228
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:14,279
stream just to say um learning to be natural doesn't mean it's easy no one

229
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:20,799
said it's easy and um and so this um going against

230
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:26,600
the stream is to learn the Dharma practice learn the practice that goes

231
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:33,320
against the stream of great hatred delusion which is a popular culture we

232
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:41,440
live in yeah it can feel like a going against the stream and going against the stream of

233
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:48,360
the Notions of being Speedy or efficient or convenient you know that's that's

234
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:54,200
what I we hear a lot right and and

235
00:26:54,240 --> 00:27:00,039
um but this going against the Stream

236
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:05,919
it's not necessarily easy to do even though we're learning to come in line

237
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:12,159
with the nature more and more and what's natural

238
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,159
isn't easy or

239
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:25,480
convenient or efficient so the Buddha went against the

240
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:32,520
stream of his own times and his own circumstances and he went against his

241
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:37,919
own family and Society culture Norms he lived

242
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:43,799
in and you know he realized you know his

243
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:52,640
life wasn't just about power status and a wealth which he lived Le based on the the documentation

244
00:27:52,640 --> 00:28:00,720
and record seems to be the kind of life he lived in and so he left uh all of that and

245
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:08,399
engaged with all kinds of different kind of practices including quite extended years

246
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:14,840
of aesthetic practices but it's not until he

247
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:20,039
remembered an experience under a rose apple tree when he was

248
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:27,640
little and that he spontaneously entered a kind of um a deep sense of a

249
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:33,679
well-being being and that is not dependent on pursuing

250
00:28:33,679 --> 00:28:41,000
anything and he realized oh there's something different here that

251
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:48,840
is um a kind of a natural Wellspring um natural welling up that is

252
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:56,200
not dependent on keeper pursuing and chasing uh externally and so that's kind

253
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:02,559
of a a turning point point for him to discover this more of

254
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,960
a naturalist Dharma and so he began to more and more

255
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:15,559
come in line with this natural upspringing or not natural welling up of

256
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:20,278
the Dharma and that led to his

257
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:29,760
Awakening and so that's the um and that's this this aspect

258
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:38,440
of practicing and you know going against the stream um but becoming a naturalist

259
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:46,399
of our own being um and being the naturalist we're not going to just kind of know ins and

260
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:52,399
outs of the nature uh overnight but we keep exploring and keep

261
00:29:52,399 --> 00:30:00,039
dis discovering in the midst of difficulties and challenges

262
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,000
and um and the more we discover within the

263
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,640
more will begin to recognize that the Alternatives of going

264
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:22,039
along with the normal stream of agreed hatred delusion They don't serve Us in the long

265
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:28,799
run rage on top of hate or anger

266
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:35,159
um doesn't serve us or frustration on top of a

267
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:41,240
fear they're not nourishing or greed on top

268
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:47,559
of more desire and aversions that's just endless you know

269
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:54,320
this it's it's endless that's the poly term called some samsara it's endless

270
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:03,279
you know we can keep swimming in that we can even feel like we may sometimes have a kind of feel smart about it in some

271
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:09,720
ways but they're just endless in this kind of um

272
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:16,080
Circle and so the invitation is and that we practice

273
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:22,639
sincerely patiently gently and

274
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:32,000
honestly and gradually little by little our practice uh deepens and

275
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:39,720
enriches and in this way and the practice life gradually they become more

276
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:44,760
and more part of who we are how we

277
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:53,159
are and maybe that's um pointing to this kind of a felt sense of the natural

278
00:31:53,159 --> 00:32:00,679
unfolding of the Dharma began to emerge in US and it may you know initially it

279
00:32:00,679 --> 00:32:07,440
may feel like a small stream that comes to us and over time it becomes more and

280
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,799
more natural you know oh you know I'm not going to go to beat myself up and

281
00:32:12,799 --> 00:32:18,600
I'm you know I'm choosing to be kind to myself and so that becomes more and more

282
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,880
natural in the sua

283
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:31,960
uh it describes this when Sila that ethical conduct becomes more and more

284
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:39,559
natural our actions speech and a mental activities are more and more aligned

285
00:32:39,559 --> 00:32:44,480
with this kind of deeper sense of inner

286
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:50,200
goodness generosity kindness

287
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:56,760
compassion and it's just natural to not go to engage in ways in ways that are

288
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:04,320
are harming us and I remember um for those who U have small

289
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,639
children or have you know have a chance to observe small

290
00:33:09,639 --> 00:33:15,919
children you see actually lying is not natural in

291
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:24,000
us the kids little toddlers the first time they lie you would just

292
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,080
know because it just feels off it's

293
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:36,720
awful it's really not good and you can see when they release

294
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:44,399
that burden of you know they tell the truth they they release that burden wow

295
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,240
they're so happy they're so

296
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:59,320
relieved and so we can come in contact with that and that's very natural in US

297
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:07,600
and I was reflecting you know on know one of night my neighbors do a lot of uh

298
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:16,200
yard work and um he's um it's very

299
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:23,440
inconvenient at times it feels like he and um you know he would spend a whole

300
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:31,118
day caring for some plants and and and and maybe you know other people will

301
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,320
think it's neither convenient or efficient I could

302
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:41,839
have done something different to make it go very quickly and get

303
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:49,878
done but he's so happy he's so happy spending that day whole day caring for a

304
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:58,359
few little plants or a tree what's the trade off right is a

305
00:34:58,359 --> 00:35:04,480
more convenient and more efficient would be better than taking away from a whole

306
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:12,839
day of happiness and joy and so this natural unfolding when

307
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:19,400
there is a seala and there is no regret we don't have to wish oh they let me

308
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:24,800
have no regret it's just natural that's natural that way and when there's no

309
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,119
regret our heart is happy it's joyful it's just like that you know you don't

310
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:38,240
have to analyze it we know that and so this sutta went on in this

311
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:45,839
unfolding and this kind of Joyful happy heart and mind it's easy for us to get

312
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:52,200
gathered and collected concentrated because we're not so busy

313
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:58,800
thinking about making a big project to get concentrated it's just natural

314
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:05,040
it's just like that and when we're steady gathered

315
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:11,240
collected it's easy to see it's conducive for us to see

316
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:16,960
clearly because that's the nature you know if we're all stirred up

317
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:24,319
and rocking around it's very difficult to see clearly but if it's a study we're

318
00:36:24,319 --> 00:36:32,560
gathered not um um chaotic it's just very clear things

319
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:39,079
are very clear and uh when things are

320
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:45,680
clear it's natural for the Deep kind of insight to

321
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:53,839
emerge in us we don't have to hunt for them they just come forth for

322
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:59,599
us and I uh sometimes reflect that Buddha did not have anyone who give gave

323
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:06,160
him a map he just really curious really there

324
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:13,200
to look at his own nature and so the Insight becomes very

325
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:18,078
natural it's naturally emerging to

326
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:28,560
us it can become easy for us to see oh wow just claiming

327
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:36,760
something um like you know I'm the best to cook over oh a delicious meal that's

328
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:42,720
a big claim that's a big leap you're making right it's easy to see wow you're

329
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,920
just making a huge leap here almost feels

330
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:55,200
ridiculous and that's easy to see that becomes easy to see when we're um

331
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:03,160
gathered collected and we're really open ourselves to see this kind of a

332
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:11,000
phenomena and when our mind are um pulled off and inevitably it will happen

333
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:19,200
pulled off into something and we recognize that's happening and we come back we come back

334
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,720
to the present and so that's

335
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,160
um that's part of the the

336
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:38,119
natural that's part of the natural unfolding of the practice too that is we

337
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:44,960
recognize that we're off and then we come back and so there is this a third type

338
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:52,079
of the person that the Buddha spoke about um which is um called someone who

339
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:58,440
is steadfast on the path and to someone who entered the

340
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,760
Dharma stream and who is steadfast on the

341
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:15,640
path and I really like that you know it's not some big Grand fireworks happening but

342
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:22,119
it's really saying that once we know clearly more and

343
00:39:22,119 --> 00:39:30,960
more we find our way we know the path we come back again and again and we stay on

344
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:36,359
the path in this steadfast

345
00:39:36,359 --> 00:39:45,319
way and so it's by staying on the path in this steadfast way that one crosses

346
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:52,480
over to the far Shore and that's the fourth type that the Buddha spoke

347
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:58,680
about and so may that be the possibility for all

348
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:02,240
beings so thank

349
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:12,720
you um we have time maybe just for one short

350
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:18,760
reflection if anyone okay

351
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:27,680
Bill Ying you you spoke a lot about what's natural in us um

352
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:36,319
and I wish I'd knew more biology but I have this idea um about

353
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:42,720
our natural tendencies to uh seek the pleasant more

354
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:49,800
pleasant of the four worldly winds and to avoid those that we don't like um you

355
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:55,960
know I'm I'm sure that it's built into our DNA yeah

356
00:40:55,960 --> 00:41:04,160
to to to uh seek some and do our best to avoid others yeah but um you know I

357
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:11,200
thinking about it I I don't think it's hardwired I think it's softwired these that these are only very strong

358
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:18,880
Tendencies but but maybe the genus if I may anthropomorphize of darwinian evolution

359
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:24,920
is that it it's still malleable that with with uh effort and

360
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:31,680
conscious awareness and and we can we can morph all that but but how

361
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:38,440
does that sound to you great sounds great it's hard to use the words you

362
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:43,640
know completely accurately but yes so in

363
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:52,400
fact I would say that um it does feel quite natural that we

364
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:59,119
naturally seek for something it's natural we can see it this way it's also

365
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:05,839
in that this is um conditioned way in

366
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:13,560
that when we're reinforcing kind of um in this way it

367
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:19,839
becomes more and more kind of a part of a norm of us it almost feels natural

368
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:27,960
that way but when we're begin to see oh it's through us keep feeding this way

369
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:33,920
it it becomes like that kind of like you saying it's a software it's really

370
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:41,119
software and yet when we're seeing it that's where we begin to have a

371
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:47,119
different possibility and you you're using the word we're becoming more conscious of

372
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:53,079
it when we're not seeing this normal almost becomes kind

373
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:58,880
of we believe it's natural to us we don't believe that is a different

374
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:05,200
possibility yeah it's great oh and by the way that suit that you read at the beginning was great I've never read it

375
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:13,760
before but I will reread it yeah yeah thank you yeah thank you so why don't we end with a moment of

376
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:17,480
a dedication of a merit

377
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:32,520
together May whatever benefit a merit that arose out of us practicing together

378
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:38,800
and learning Dharma together be a source of nourishment for our own heart and

379
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:45,160
mind and body and may the benefit and goodness be

380
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:54,119
shared wide open with all beings may all beings be well happy and

381
00:43:54,119 --> 00:43:58,960
may all beings be free

382
00:44:04,130 --> 00:44:11,599
