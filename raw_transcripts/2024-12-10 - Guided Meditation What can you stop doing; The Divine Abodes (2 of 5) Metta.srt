3
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:31,359
there um yeah we we will uh check into uh the

4
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,399
recordings I don't know if I'm supposed to post those or they're being posted but uh it was

5
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:47,960
recorded and um we'll get that up okay uh let's um let's practice

6
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:02,960
together e

7
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:37,880
so just uh just beginning with the kind of uh

8
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:46,759
sweetness of community spiritual

9
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,758
friendship which is not uh its own kind of silo

10
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:08,000
but actually a sense of um

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:12,640
belonging and shared

12
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:30,000
sensitivity that uh allows us to uh

13
00:02:30,519 --> 00:02:38,800
meet the intensity sometimes brutality of the

14
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,360
world we we've genuinely cannot

15
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,440
do this

16
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:31,760
alone

17
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,760
e e

18
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,080
just settling into your your posture

19
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:19,000
and take not Hans says like a Nector settling to the bottom of a glass of

20
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,000
juice

21
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,880
but it's not like we push the nectar

22
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:59,840
down we just let time

23
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:05,880
and Stillness become our allies

24
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:59,039
there's entropy but there's order two let me just let the Dharma

25
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:07,560
order organize our body

26
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
mind

27
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
for

28
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

29
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,440
e e

30
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:38,880
and how many things might you stop

31
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:48,920
doing how many of our routines do we associate with

32
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:56,480
practice that are actually just a kind of reiteration of our

33
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:01,320
self-doubt agitation

34
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

35
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

36
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
for

37
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

38
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

39
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,160
e e

40
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:39,680
how simple might awareness become how simple might you

41
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:59,040
become so relaxing all of the push and pull

42
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,160
all the self-improvement and all the

43
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:15,959
acceptance all the moving to and

44
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:36,880
from all the ways in which we continually hum The

45
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,920
Story Of Me Mine my

46
00:14:51,759 --> 00:15:01,000
life all the willfulness and control

47
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:27,959
how simple can we

48
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
be

49
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
for

50
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

51
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

52
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,880
e e

53
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,960
the sense of self is an avatar we

54
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,840
use to organize our greed and

55
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
aversion e

56
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:20,080
maybe it's safe enough in this

57
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:30,720
moment to put that down

58
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

59
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640

73
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:33,069
[Music]

74
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:42,299
[Music]

75
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,120
e e

76
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,720
okay so

77
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,720
um that's good to uh good to say with

78
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:27,480
you um so uh non-hate love love is the theme

79
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:32,919
this week and

80
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:40,720
um sometimes we have the sense that disliking

81
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:46,360
liking loving are are three points along the

82
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:54,880
same spectrum and um that uh you know when I

83
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:02,000
I you know I might hate you I might like you I might like like you or I might

84
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:08,240
love you right but

85
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:18,279
um that's not right to my mind uh love steps outside of the realm

86
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:24,240
of ordinary hedonic

87
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,720
preference in other words um love

88
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,840
is not another species of

89
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:42,799
wanting the the the Buddha suggested that uh that wanting and fear

90
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:48,679
are are two sides of the same coin the coin of

91
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:54,600
clinging and it seems like we wanting fear such different

92
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:01,799
states but at the

93
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:13,559
um excuse me at the at the felt experience level

94
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:19,519
of wanting and fear what is shared is is a certain kind

95
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:26,720
of motivational desperation and there's some interesting

96
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:33,799
brain silence science that um highlights the some of the shared kind of

97
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:40,279
neurobiology of wanting and fear kind of motivational

98
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:47,240
pressure salience that's either negatively or positively valanced making something

99
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:54,039
wanted or feared and both

100
00:31:54,039 --> 00:32:01,880
States contract the Mind both States make this moment in and of itself

101
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:08,080
essentially meaningless you turn the moment into a

102
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:13,840
transaction fear and wanting turn life

103
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:25,039
into uh a dollar store or something and met uh is the Mind Made

104
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:32,480
vast loving kindness practice is is stepping out of

105
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:39,120
wanting and fear and so love is not like some strong

106
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:45,600
form of wanting it's an entirely different motivational

107
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,919
stance it's an openness and a receptivity it's what's

108
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:58,158
left in the wake of letting go

109
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:06,879
love is what's left when the motivational desperation Fades

110
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:17,480
away love uh met you know um loving

111
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:24,679
kindness It's many things functions in many ways but first there a purification

112
00:33:24,679 --> 00:33:30,880
practice and you know by purification

113
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:37,440
practice uh you know technically I mean Extinction

114
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:43,000
learning um much pain depends on

115
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:49,080
avoidance not all but much pain depends on avoidance

116
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:55,720
and the medicine is often to approach the avoided experience the

117
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:03,880
feared experience to drain the affective charge from our anxiety and

118
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:10,280
avoidance and um mindfulness is one type of

119
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:16,960
approach moving towards a lot of the instructions we give are about moving

120
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:24,079
towards right love in a sense is an even deeper

121
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:32,720
approach than mindfulness not always but often the more fully we

122
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,079
permit ourselves to experience what's avoided the more completely we're

123
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:45,440
released from that pain the more efficient the extinction learning is the

124
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:51,520
more thoroughly discharged the knots of

125
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:59,520
uh pain avoidance anxiety untangle and love love is like the

126
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:06,920
fullest approach we can make we get so

127
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:16,359
close you know our our love to um yeah to our our our pain or what

128
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:22,200
whatever may be that it it starts to unwind this is this is kindness as a

129
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:26,560
kind of purification practice

130
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:34,880
we should unpack you know what's meant by love that's not everybody's favorite word I know some of you probably are

131
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:41,200
cringing you know like love love love love

132
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:49,280
um so what's meant by this well uh a mentor years ago once said

133
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,440
like Matthew there's a difference between kindness and

134
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,119
niceness and you're being nice

135
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:06,920
okay the kind of love I'm speaking about is not is not

136
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:16,560
niceness there is a love that um in is Tangled Up with

137
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,400
possessiveness and a love that relinquishes control entirely a love

138
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:29,560
that's a kind of pure generosity giving Donna

139
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:38,160
there's an you know an attached love and that's okay like that's I'm not dismissive of that we're

140
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:44,560
not uh monastics and we're going to have to pick our

141
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:51,079
spot and partners parents children ethical

142
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:57,760
commitment some attachment I feel is irreducible you know to those

143
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:04,760
those relationships um a friend I've known for many years

144
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:14,520
since since um his now teenage daughter uh before she was born and uh

145
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:21,119
not so long ago I asked asked him how how are you you know and he quoted Susan

146
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:27,200
orene to say uh a parent is only as happy as

147
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,599
their least happy

148
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:39,960
child I thought about a line uh from uh

149
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:47,160
from the uh songwriter an an def Franco said something like uh all be your lover

150
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,839
even after our atoms are dispersed will be pushing up daisies and

151
00:37:52,839 --> 00:38:00,880
my crush would just be getting worse it's kind of romantic

152
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:07,880
yeah can we consent to the the Dua in that we

153
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:15,480
know is encoded in that not be surprised that that's going

154
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:22,160
to hurt can we bear that with Grace and not

155
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:29,440
resort to some utopian fantasy of the love completely devoid of all

156
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:39,400
attachment is not a perfectionistic path we have a tendency to try to shoehorn

157
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:47,760
our spiritual ideals into every aspect of our life is not

158
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:56,400
natural and so we we recognize we live in some measure of ambivalence we can

159
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:03,680
consent to the forms of possessiveness inherent in some kinds of Love even as

160
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,640
we try to let go and we

161
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:16,960
cultivate a love that is devoid of possessiveness that uh loving kindness

162
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:26,520
is a kind of um uh a love that seeks no control

163
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,680
the proximate cause is um the capacity to

164
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:39,680
see goodness love in the face of goodness that is

165
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:46,040
what the Wellspring of meta love and the face of

166
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:53,000
goodness and amidst the the ascendency

167
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:59,440
of hatred and confusion and

168
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:05,280
hypocrisy um I I become so so sensitive

169
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:12,920
to goodness forthrightness honesty it it sometimes Feels Like

170
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:18,599
Oxygen like my heart is just like longing can we be

171
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:24,240
honest can we uh recognize

172
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:32,680
