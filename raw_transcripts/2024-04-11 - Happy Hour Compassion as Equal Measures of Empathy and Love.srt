116
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

117
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:20,600

121
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:02,799
free thanks everyone thanks for your

122
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:10,880
practice ah it is so nourishing practice compassion practice for others for

123
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:15,960
ourselves for all beings there's a nourishment in the

124
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:22,640
Heart It expands the heart um and as you

125
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:28,720
noticed I talked about balancing meeting the

126
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:34,279
challenge whether it's for others or for ourselves meeting it in the mind and

127
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:41,000
balancing that with with the level of goodness and and goodwi because if we're

128
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:47,440
just meeting Challenge and pain oh this is hard this is painful oh we Veer into

129
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,960
overwhelm and what's called empathetic distress it just becomes grief and

130
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:58,360
painful that's not compassion practice uh and if we're not meeting the pain p

131
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:05,440
and sorrow at all and if it's just may may I be well may you be well that's meta practice which is lovely wonderful

132
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:13,159
and it's not compassion practice so if you want to practice compassion equally meeting both the challenge the pain oh

133
00:27:13,159 --> 00:27:18,200
yeah my back is really hurting okay may there be ease may I have ease yeah this

134
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:26,320
is painful so both meeting and holding it with ease both at the same time same

135
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:36,279
measure so we have have some uh time to engage together to share to um reflect

136
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:44,519
in small groups and will'll be in uh small groups of three in the moment and

137
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:50,880
the invitation is um to share if you like for your own benefit not educating

138
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,600
not impressing anyone for your own benefit what was this practice like for you speaking out loud letting yourself

139
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:05,519
be held with witness just one nugget and then next person will offer another nugget will go in alphabetical order in

140
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:13,360
first name um and then the third person'll come back to you so you'll go round and round and please stay with the

141
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,760
practice not what happened before yesterday to not um giving each other

142
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:25,200
advice or asking questions even if you didn't understand what someone said just

143
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,679
it's their experience um Let It Be we're just sharing and holding each other with

144
00:28:30,679 --> 00:28:36,080
kindness and don't try to fix other people's problems we're not here to fix

145
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:43,240
each other problems we're not here to have our problems fixed we're just here to to to share and be held witness and

146
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:51,399
see if we can hold ourselves with kindness and other people with kindness that's it's a different way of being um

147
00:28:51,399 --> 00:28:58,200
it's um in in the happy hour um uh breakout rooms and the etiquette guide

148

152
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:35,120

154
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:51,720
questions can also type them in chat if you like you can raise your Zoom hand your physical hand I may actually I

155
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:57,000
do see maran's physical hand I usually don't see physical hands but there you are actually your Zoom hand just went up

156
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:02,159
ah Zoom has become smart Maran

157
00:30:03,919 --> 00:30:09,799
please I'm thinking that equal measure of equinity not equinity meta and

158
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:17,000
empathy means not to be become flooded with the empathy is that and is there

159
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:22,720
any more you wanted to add to it I think I think I felt like I heard that

160
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:28,919
differently than before and I I think I felt a little confused maybe a little confused but I'm tell me tell me what

161
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:36,240
the confusion might be I was thinking um I think the re first thing I thought

162
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:42,840
was to give as much love as as the pain as big as the pain to give that much

163
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,799
love great I don't know yeah great that's so so wait there's nothing wrong

164
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:54,679
with that either right yeah yeah yeah so what's the so where's the confusion then Maria that sounds very clear to me that

165
00:30:54,679 --> 00:31:00,760
okay is it does that seem different to me than tell me how it sounds different so I

166
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:08,639
join just joining them but to to join them so they become compassion seems a

167
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:16,960
little different than saying equal measure of both ah ah yeah

168
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,799
I see I see I think I'm getting a Nuance you're saying it's um I think the Nuance

169
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:28,840
I'm trying to bring in here with the equal measure with the emphasis on that

170
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:35,000
is um is not to get overwhelmed with with the pain with the with the empathy

171
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,279
part just as you were saying because compassion is made up of two parts one is empathy feeling another person's pain

172
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:47,080
U mirror neurons lighting up like oh really feeling someone's pain or we're feeling our own pain this is painful

173
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,919
this is hard but if if we lean into that too much it just becomes pain practice

174
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:59,039
it's doesn't it's no not compassion and as I mentioned um if we lean too much

175
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:06,159
into the uh meta practice just Goodwill then we're not really meeting the pain which is fine it's meta practice uh but

176
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:11,600
sometimes maybe it's as if we're pushing the pain away we sometimes it could be that way if there is pain but we're just

177
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,120
kind of pushing it away and just leaning into meta um which may not be skillful

178
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:22,760
sometimes depending on what's Happening so so my saying equal measure is to

179
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:29,039
really bring this importance of of the uh both are important both meeting not

180
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:34,240
turning away both meeting and and bringing love to it and the way you put

181
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:41,200
it which is meeting and you're welcome to comment more if you want um which is to meet the suffering with equal measure

182
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:49,399
of Love is is the same thing is is putting it in the same way so does that

183
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:54,840
uh yes that's very helpful yes great thank you thanks Maran thanks for

190
00:33:38,559 --> 00:33:45,440
it's so nice to focus on somebody else or others and um so it was nice to spend

191
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:52,399
the energy and the time to really put that energy out instead of you know not

192
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:58,200
always being this direction yeah so thank you oh thank you

193
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:03,679
Nancy so lovely that you could join tonight I'm so sorry to hear you've been

194
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:08,878
sick for the past 10 years that's a 10 year 10 days gosh I just made it yeah

195
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:14,878
I'm so glad you haven't been sick for 10 years that was interesting um yeah I'm

196
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:23,919
so glad and wow only 10 days only 10 days getting better every minute

197
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:31,398
only that was an unintentional te yet yeah but but yeah glad glad you could

198
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:38,240
join and yeah lovely it's it's healing to be um practicing meta and compassion for others and and for yourself as well

199
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,919
because you have been suffering it's it's it's not easy to be safe there is something healing about doing that

200
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:51,800
though is to get the attention you know I think when you're sick you sort of draw withdraw in yeah and it's sort of

201
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:58,040
nice to remember to put the energy out there too exactly that's right yeah

202
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:04,520
you're pointing out something very important which is sometimes when we are um sick or we're having challenging time

203
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:10,800
we get a little um caught in our own suffering in our own pain and our like

204
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,079
poor maybe even going to Poor Me Like H and then when we when we practice M and

205
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:22,599
compassion for others oh just like me oh yeah there are other people I wish them well so it expands our perspective it

206
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:28,599
makes it lighter it make makes our s our our pain our suffering lighter it's not as heavy it's like carrying this thing

207
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:36,040
oh yeah it's it's a little lighter so I so appreciate you you you bringing that in yeah yeah it actually feels healing

208
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:42,200
to me somehow yeah very much so yeah it's it's um and when you say this I'm

209
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:49,359
reminded by um what I remember reading uh some time ago about um um you know uh

210
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:54,640
there there many um uh instructions or invitations for example if somebody's

211
00:35:54,640 --> 00:36:01,000
not feeling well or if they're depressed one of them is to reach out to somebody else who's having a hard time to give

212
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:07,920
them support so call up a friend who's having a hard time if you're not feeling all that call them and give them help

213
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,200
you know so that you're not be being self uh um not self-centered but you

214
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:18,960
know self yeah self prup exactly yeah or something about what you were talking

215
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:26,960
about balance keeping the balance too that um is feels right there too yeah

216
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,040
yeah anyway thank you ma'am thank you thank you Nancy so glad you you can join

217
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:38,359
us hope you feel better soon thank you thanks

218
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:54,560
Vicki hi Nikki hi yes I I really liked this combination of the balance also and

219
00:36:54,560 --> 00:37:00,720
appreciated you saying that and I I too wanted a little more thought on um just

220
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:07,400
how you gave that example to help others if there's anything else in Wise mind

221
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:14,359
when when one is in an emotional mind you know how how you

222
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:20,200
shift yeah so so let so thank thank you for

223
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,960
that reflection and question and and I'm going to ask you if you would um as

224
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,440
you're asking the question give me a little more specificity so that I know which direction to go yeah I was

225
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:41,640
thinking today as I was you know finishing up taxes and I was getting a little bit of a hanging at myself I

226
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:47,440
thought for not doing it sooner you know and I thought you know give it a rest I

227
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,760
could say that to myself but I found my body feeling more uh tense than I wish

228
00:37:53,760 --> 00:38:00,920
it were and so how you um sort of talk yourself down when you know it doesn't matter

229
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:06,880
you'll get it done and just you know give it a rest it's the puppy thing you know

230
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:12,200
yeah yeah I'm so glad you gave the example so so what

231
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:17,280
um I'm I'm still working on my taxes so what I'm what I was hearing you saying

232
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:22,359
give myself a ranging why don't you work on it sooner why don't you get it and

233
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:29,359
and my you know where I go when I when I find that there is a judgmental mind like what are you doing it's like it's

234
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:36,520
okay sweetheart it's okay sweetheart I literally tell my it's okay sweetheart it's all right it's okay it's just it's

235
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:44,720
like it's okay it's okay um so it's it's an expression of of kindness and that

236
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,880
it's okay and also equinity right because you give that voice you listen

237
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:55,440
here yeah I listen to myself it's okay sweetheart it's all right it's okay it's

238
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:02,800
okay it's it's it's um um It's a combination of equinity like it's not the end of the world it's okay and it's

239
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:08,280
also a compassion like yeah you're really beating yourself up and this is not helpful right now it's okay sweetie

240
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:15,839
it's like like lay off like it's okay but but focus better if you just you know stop it yeah yeah but it's it's

241
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:25,280
more gentle it's like yeah it can we can we can drop this we can drop this with gentleness and kindness so that's my

242
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:31,319
invitation yeah with with taxes yeah especially

243
00:39:31,319 --> 00:39:41,400
taxes thanks Vicki yeah thanks ah and I see um couple of

244
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:48,079
Reflections in chat let's see um yeah Jerry says to give someone your

245
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:56,000
full attention to me is a for of Love indeed agreed and um one

246
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:04,920
reflection uh from one of you is feeling sad for someone very different from feeling empathy to me it feels same in

247
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:11,520
my heart um so feeling sad for someone is that the same as

248
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,400
empathy um it it can feel the same it can be the

249
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:22,480
same for some it might be more physical when you were feeling someone else's

250
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:29,359
pain the empathy could feel more visceral for some people could be expressed as sadness for some people so

251
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:34,920
we're all different so for the person who wrote this yeah it could be for you

252
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:40,880
feeling the empathetic pain of someone could be feeling sad with them it could

253
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,079
be that but and it can express itself in many other many different ways as our

254
00:40:47,079 --> 00:40:55,119
mirror neurons can can fire and express themselves in many different ways given our individual makeup

255
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:59,720
so and Richard says the middle

256
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,720
way yeah not sure that probably referred to something I was saying in real time but yeah I like the middle way maybe

257
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,040
that was about the balancing the the two uh empathy and and love

258
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,720
so so thank you all thank you for showing up the happy hour practicing and

259
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:25,319
cultivating your heart your mind for the sake of all beings may all beings be

260
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:32,750
well may all beings be happy be including ourselves I'll ring the bell three
