ourselves and so this week um we did opening to

11
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:43,600
the uh aspect of Earth elements

12
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:50,759
grounding and uh enlivening through being with our breath

13
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:56,960
and enriching our experiences by being with um our

14
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,119
emotions and thoughts and then the we also included

15
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:10,959
spaciousness yesterday kind of really like this mountain Inner Mountain a life Mountain

16
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:17,640
surrounded by nature and the space And So today we're coming to

17
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:23,879
the um piece of

18
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:30,920
um um of clarifying or seeing clearly

19
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:38,400
knowing clearly I kind of have been preparing ourselves um along the way and

20
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:45,920
so today we'll be uh going through the sequence um but then also open to clear

21
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:55,040
seeing and clear knowing so okay we'll begin

22
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:02,440
[Music]

23
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,959
pausing pausing to start

24
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:25,200
start from where we are and start from how we

25
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,599
are just as it is

26
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,080
releasing demands for things to be

27
00:03:51,799 --> 00:03:56,959
otherwise releasing expectations

28
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:06,799
Here and

29
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:20,440
Now what is the felt sense of here in this

30
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:25,079
place and this time

31
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:51,720
feeling and sensing the global sense of a body

32
00:04:51,720 --> 00:05:02,039
sitting lying down standing however your posture is

33
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:19,840
like arting your attention to wherever the body makes a

34
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:26,280
contact with the floor Earth

35
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,520
chairs beds

36
00:05:33,319 --> 00:05:36,319
sensing

37
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:46,600
contact pressure

38
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,280
weight temperature

39
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:21,680
allow this earthy body resting into the contact

40
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:43,198
maybe there is a sense of a resting down or resting

41
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,080
back allow the contact to

42
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:08,599
become as big as it likes to or as

43
00:07:08,599 --> 00:07:13,400
deep as it likes to

44
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:38,879
a sense of a rootedness

45
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:56,720
grounded steady quiet

46
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:06,319
sitting like a quiet Mountain Within

47
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,120
quiet

48
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,200
breath quiet aliveness

49
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:12,560
you may not have a words for them and that's totally okay

50
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:36,519
sensing and feeling a quiet

51
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:39,920
flow of the

52
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:54,680
breath enlightening the whole

53
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,360
body e

54
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:44,240
you may be rhythmic in and

55
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:47,839
out up and

56
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:56,279
down or it may be not

57
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:21,439
a sense of a wonder and awe may come in

58
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:43,399
the movements of the emotions can

59
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:55,560
enrich in Rich this very sense of Being Human

60
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:29,160
sensing and the [Music] feeling the spaciousness

61
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:35,160
all around or

62
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,209
[Music]

63
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,160
within e

64
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:46,680
releasing stories

65
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:54,079
ideas and conceptual overlays

66
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,680
allow the knowing and

67
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:20,279
seeing to be emerging from the felt sense

68
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:59,880
Let each breath slow freely

69
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:16,519
Let each sensation

70
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,959
dance fre

71
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:36,120
Let each thought

72
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,000
float

73
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920

104
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:31,470
[Music]

105
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:20,600
[Music] so we finished

106
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:27,600
um this sikaya 22.11

107
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:36,240
uh that Ed the three similes of the sutta to um highlight or kind of

108
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,279
describe some overarching characteristics of the

109
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:48,519
practice and today um I feel like I have more to say

110
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:54,080
about the sua and that is um I like to

111
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:03,600
Circle back to the opening statement of the suta and this is let me read this line

112
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:12,440
that I say that the destruction of the tins is for one who knows and

113
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:17,600
sees not for one who does not know and

114
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:27,360
does not see and so this sense of um knowing and

115
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:34,880
the see seeing is a very important uh kind of um

116
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:40,799
aspect of our cultivation you know using the similes

117
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:46,159
of the chicken and eggs and hatching and

118
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,519
um the Oz handle being worn off and and

119
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:59,720
the rope that ties the uh ship rots away

120
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:05,399
um and they uh what they also offer is

121
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:11,638
that this layers layers of beliefs of fixed

122
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:19,760
ideas and our conceptual overlays are shedded are kind of put

123
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:29,599
down or uh let go of and when this happens um

124
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:36,800
um there is a increasing degrees of knowing and seeing little by little and

125
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:43,480
they become more and more available to us and this kind of knowing and seeing

126
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:52,480
is very different from um the you know reading the book and getting some sense

127
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,920
and that is one aspect of um a knowing

128
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:04,320
but it's not uh the complete aspect of the knowing and so

129
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:11,400
when we're only counting on conceptual level of understanding and to want to

130
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:20,200
manage our way through the conceptual lenses often we shut down so much of

131
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:26,160
ourselves that can know can see

132
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:33,200
differently the part of ourselves that knows and sees don't always speak

133
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,960
English or Chinese or Spanish you know

134
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:46,839
so um you know our body knows maybe through the responses in the nerve

135
00:35:46,839 --> 00:35:55,280
systems or responses in our cellular kind of a feeling or uh in the movements

136
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:02,920
of the breath our heart knows uh that may manifest as

137
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:08,480
a certain kind of a felt sense in our heart

138
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:14,480
space and so much of our training is to begin to

139
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:23,430
open to this wide range of ways of a Being Human that is able to know and

140
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:32,240
[Music] sense in this um Rich ways when we allow

141
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:41,160
this a wide ranged way of knowing and then seeeing and Things become more more

142
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:47,599
clear and so today I'm kind of wanted to bring yet another simile this this is a

143
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:54,640
week of uh simile from the sutta it's not from the same sutta but I think it's

144
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:02,359
relevant to this notion of uh knowing and seeing and this Su is

145
00:37:02,359 --> 00:37:13,760
from maim nikaya and 39 it's a Simo of um a clear Mountain

146
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,400
Lake and I like to kind of expand a little bit because you know in order to

147
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:26,960
get to a clear Mountain Lake and I would imagine you have to kind of you know get

148
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:32,359
on a high Bing Trail and and walk um to

149
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:38,160
get to the mountain lake and so for

150
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:44,160
me uh this part that was not actually you know hiking and walking the mountain

151
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:52,960
trail is not part of the the sutta but for me uh it evokes something in me that

152
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,440
is um the person in order to get to the Clear Mountain

153
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:07,000
Lake um has to take the path has to walk kind of like us having to

154
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:15,920
practice um walk the Noble eight-fold Path and as we engage in this as we hike

155
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:22,200
in this Mountain Trails uh we put down a lot of

156
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:28,839
preoccupations that we have in our mind about things um

157
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:36,240
uh we want to do or projects we need to manage and we're more and more present

158
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,280
on the trail in the Mountain Trails and maybe we'll have a sense of a

159
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,720
slowing down and maybe a sense of a life Mountain comes

160
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:53,760
in and so the Chatters in our mind might quiet quiet

161
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:03,160
down and so that's the process of the practice a so we put down a lot of uh inner

162
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:09,079
Chatters or preoccupations and when we get to the

163
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:15,319
mountain lake um can our mind and heart feels

164
00:39:15,319 --> 00:39:24,000
more clear I want to read you this um Mountain Lake Sim here it

165
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:34,720
says practitioners it's like a Lake in a mountain range transparent clear and

166
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:42,400
undisturbed standing on the shore a person with eyes could see oysters

167
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:47,440
shells Stones Pebbles and a fish moving

168
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:55,040
about and holding still that person would think this is a

169
00:39:55,040 --> 00:40:03,280
transparent clear and un Disturbed Lake here there are oysters shells

170
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:09,839
Stones Pebbles and a fish moving about and a holding

171
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:16,480
still practitioners in the same way a

172
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:23,680
practitioner understands the Dua as it is and so on it goes through all the

173
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:33,040
four noble truths and knows this clear clearly just like seeing through um the

174
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,760
clear transparent undisturbed Mountain

175
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:43,920
Lake can see things moving around and see

176
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:49,839
things um without the filters that we put on

177
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:55,800
without the filters of our own judgments

178
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:02,680
beliefs and without out all the act reactivities that may be

179
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:09,640
operating and so that becomes available and possible to

180
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:18,400
us and one thing I'd like to highlight that um in the sutta that we went

181
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:24,160
through this week that we know that this seeing and

182
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,960
knowing becomes available available to us

183
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:36,640
naturally uh when the uh kind of stings faded

184
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:44,800
away and also I'd like to say that the cl Clarity uh sense of being really

185
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,599
clear they don't have to come all at once you know it's not like a big band

186
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:58,200
you know kind of big switch or something that you just turn on but

187
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:05,200
rather um the felt sense with the similes and this hiking the mountain

188
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:12,240
trail the mind gets more and more clear uh it feels more at least to me it

189
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:19,640
feels more like things become increasingly clear little by little

190
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:27,760
little by little and gradually and so for most of us

191
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:33,839
that's the process of um our practice it's a gradual

192
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:39,960
process little by little we're less caught by the habitual

193
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:46,559
reactivities or little by little uh that we begin to experience a kind of a

194
00:42:46,559 --> 00:42:51,960
well-being or joy to whatever degree that may be

195
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:59,400
available to us and little by little we chipping away

196
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:03,200
the Tendencies underlying

197
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:13,599
Tendencies and I would also say that um for most of us and that the uh there are

198
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:19,760
also times that the things get very very

199
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:28,680
difficult and the invitation is that we practice with a kind and Compassionate

200
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:37,079
Heart as best as we are able and this phrase as best as we are able is very

201
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:44,079
important because that's the truth of how we can practice we can't practice

202
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:52,040
more than what we're able and surely we'll get lost on the

203
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:58,480
path and whenever we're able we come back

204
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:08,040
and period we come back that's it releasing kind of blaming judging

205
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:14,599
shaming criticizing we know those are just extra

206
00:44:14,599 --> 00:44:22,280
um burden that we had to carry and so even though I'm using this

207
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:29,000
mountain hike um as a a way to illustrate this

208
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:36,319
uh but the path we're undertaking is a Inner Path in fact so

209
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:44,400
much of the training is about us staying where we are how we are right here and

210
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,680
we stop trying to fix ourselves up and fix

211
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:58,760
others and so we make ourselves available to uh different possibilities

212
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:05,280
I like to end uh with a quote from uh

213
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:12,119
windberry and this says the world cannot be discovered by a

214
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:17,280
journey of Miles no matter how long but

215
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:22,960
only by a spiritual journey or journey of 1

216
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:28,839
inch very arduous and a humbling and the

217
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:33,960
joyful by which we arrive at the ground

218
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:40,079
at our feet and learn to be at

219
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:50,939
[Music]

220
00:45:55,079 --> 00:46:05,720
home thank you dear may we all learn to be at home
