10
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,880
uh yeah so so I was was reading a uh uh

11
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:28,560
an evolutionary uh Anthropologist um I'm reading about the

12
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,280
the sort of Origins of of War of cooperation the possibility of

13
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:43,280
peace and uh the article the article doesn't exactly say that there are like

14
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:50,320
good forces in US cooperation and then bad forces violence it's not exactly like there're

15
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:58,880
sort of like the the two wolves in inside of us love and hate it's more like one wolf and it can

16
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:08,599
become War or peace and so the uh the the author GL

17
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:15,319
glowaki I think the name is says um the traits and the technologies that allow

18
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:22,200
people to mobilize achieve Collective action cooperate across groups and

19
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:30,760
sanction spoilers to enable peace are the same traits that are used to wage

20
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:38,800
War the better our species became at creating peace the better we also

21
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:46,200
became at Waging War goes on to say while Intergroup

22
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,360
coalitionary aggression and interr group

23
00:02:52,360 --> 00:03:01,840
cooperation maybe evolved traits peace is an invention

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,159
yeah so um the kind of same tremendous

25
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:22,519
human intelligence and effort and Ingenuity all of that can be leveraged

26
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,760
For Love or hate for war or

27
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:35,920
peace and of course I'm reading this because I'm uh concerned you

28
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:45,040
know and um what what will become of us as a society species what will become of

29
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:53,560
me of each of us peace is an invention that kind

30
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:59,000
of there's cooperation and there's war you know

31
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:07,840
violence but peace that is an invention and so can we invent it can we

32
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:16,320
invent it aenta said um that we find our

33
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:23,800
freedom in the same place we find our suffering so beautiful we find our

34
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:30,720
freedom in the same place we find our suffering so it's all

35
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,320
right here and

36
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:44,440
uh let um that's it that's

37
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:05,280
it so finding a posture that feels uh

38
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
sustainable

39
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,639
e

40
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,360
so what's already what's already

41
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
here

42
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,620
we uh go [Music]

43
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:15,280
looking but uh the grace is in being

44
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:27,000
found some uh alienation when we go uh go

45
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:36,599
looking try to make something happen make something of

46
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:41,879
ourselves Grace is in being

47
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,638
found let your self be

48
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
found

49
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

50
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

51
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,199
don't uh go looking for the breath let the breath find

52
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
you

53
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:46,800
let the breath uh suffuse you drench

54
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
you

55
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

56
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

57
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:25,480
you don't need to go anywhere to be

58
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
found

59
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

60
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

61
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

62
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

63
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:59,680
in the the looking there's a maybe a sense of duality

64
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:05,800
alienation me looking for something me looking for my

65
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:09,880
breath me looking for

66
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:23,000
peace but in being

67
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:31,040
found much of that melts away

68
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:40,959
there's no ground anymore for

69
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,360
self-doubt

70
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
refound

71
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

72
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

73
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

74
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

75
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

76
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:04,520
all freedom is uh found in the same place as

77
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,799
our

78
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
suffering

79
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:46,880
we don't have to go looking somewhere for a

80
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,720
freedom we rehearse our freedom In This

81
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
Moment

82
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:20,320
embody

83
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:30,720
Freedom so we let go of looking for something

84
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
thing

85
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

86
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

87
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

88
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

89
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

90
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

91
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:20,240
so much forgiveness for the ways our mind

92
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:30,440
forages where is we uh

93
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:40,200
look rep peace

94
00:23:51,559 --> 00:23:55,880
seek so we just come back

95
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:02,080
resting in uh it's already

96
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
here

97
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:48,559
being found by Stillness being found by

98
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
silence

99
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:22,640
letting that heal the kind of fundamental alienation always

100
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
looking

101
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

102
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

103
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

104
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

105
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

106
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

107
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

108
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:30,039
e

109
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:51,480
okay uh so um so welcome welcome

110
00:29:51,480 --> 00:30:00,039
um I uh honored to uh to be with you and

111
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:05,840
um um yeah from

112
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:11,360
2017 20077 until

113
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:17,880
18 I had a you know did a group weekly or bi-weekly in LA or San

114
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:26,159
Francisco and um it's been six years but some intuitive sense of uh it's time to

115
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:34,120
uh to start start something up and so uh so here we are and um yeah very happy to

116
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,720
um to be with you

117
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:48,880
so teaching teaching is it's a weird it's a weird thing you know I

118
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:57,360
still I still do find it kind of strange that anyone wants to listen to me if no

119
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:03,039
one wanted to listen that would be very understandable and I know you're going

120
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:11,080
to say like no Matthew that's just the self-hate talking I get it but I don't think it's

121
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:17,960
that I actually don't think it's that um it's

122
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:27,919
because most of the time in my life I feel like a kind of big dumb happy

123
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:33,279
golden retriever not a Dharma teacher it's my

124
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:41,080
spirit animal the retriever really is that's like kind of

125
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:46,440
the Baseline self viw you know and experience of

126
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:54,519
myself but the thing is you know our mind is not not our own it uh it

127
00:31:54,519 --> 00:32:01,840
constellates in you know in very particular way is based on the totality

128
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:07,519
of the conditions your mind your mind is not your own there's

129
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:15,240
continuity but then what gets drawn forth from conditions a lot a lot right

130
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:22,240
and so who we are is partially reflected by who we are when we're with

131
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:28,399
others what others pull to the surface it's not like the real self is the kind

132
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:36,200
of Retriever and this is like some performance no the Buddha emphasized friendship

133
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:43,399
spiritual friendship associating with goodness because our mind is not our

134
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:48,840
own and something happens to my mind when I'm with

135
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:55,440
Sanaa something happens to it it's not a performance something happens to

136
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:02,559
it and it it becomes very easy

137
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:08,320
to uh to know love it

138
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:15,399
becomes very easy to to sense the Dharma you know like

139
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:22,399
some uh living presence between you and I and

140
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:30,639
it's there even you know in chat I can't see a face but I I am you know just the

141
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:38,519
names that's enough that's enough and so on the one hand I don't

142
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:44,760
feel very identified um with the role of of

143
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:52,840
teacher but a big part of how I actually know myself know my heart is from taking

144
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,919
the seat and so um

145
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:06,760
all of that maybe is a long winded way of saying that I'm here for me you

146
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:17,158
know but while I'm here I kind of want to be useful

147
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:24,200
yeah and so uh and how we

148
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,520
begin as we begin I've been uh thinking about

149
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:37,520
um about pedagogy how how Learning Happens how do we

150
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:45,118
actually absorb the Dharma how does it become sort of woven into our

151
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,720
biology and it's something maybe pedagogy is something we Dharma teachers

152
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:56,159
have been a bit in curious about you know I sort of like inherited certain

153
00:34:56,160 --> 00:35:02,640
ways certain pedagogical assumptions about how to how to transmit the Dharma

154
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:09,599
and I think there's incredible wisdom in that but it you know I wonder okay how

155
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:17,720
do we how do we actually learn how does this thing go so was reading something about um

156
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,800
lessons from uh lessons from cognitive science

157
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:31,560
for learning sort of what gleaning some kind of core lessons for for Learning and

158
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:37,800
um excuse me the author said uh people learn new M material better when it

159
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:44,400
creates impasses in their current mental models contradictions conflicts

160
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,119
anomalies uncertainties and ambiguities which stimulate

161
00:35:50,119 --> 00:35:58,359
curiosity inquiry questioning problem solving and deep reasoning to restore

162
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:05,160
cognitive equilibrium impasses in the current

163
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:10,319
models we're all trying to kind of stay balanced to

164
00:36:10,319 --> 00:36:15,839
keep our equilibrium and we

165
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:23,480
prefer knowing to not knowing we prefer familiarity to uncertainty or shock we

166
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:29,359
we really have routinized our mental life to a to a large degree

167
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:35,240
and um for good reason right if I'm walking and I

168
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:41,520
Stumble very very quick impulse to get back you know into balance to

169
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:47,200
reestablish balance you know before I even think you

170
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,839
know there's just aware whatever body propri reception it's like off balance

171
00:36:52,839 --> 00:37:00,720
okay do my best to write myself and that's a very um it's a

172
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:07,119
wholesome impulse but our Dharma paath is a kind of dialectic

173
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:13,440
between equilibrium and disequilibrium a little bit like you

174
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:20,200
know what I was saying about learning learning creating impasses in the

175
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,599
models so if it's all upheaval if it's all disequilibrium nothing gets

176
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:34,119
integrated it's kind of chaos right just trying to get a kind of some kind of

177
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:41,359
footing right and on the other side if it's all

178
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:47,400
kind of like cruising altitude equilibrium we do we sort of get

179
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:54,000
too the models become too comfortable too familiar our Dharma understandings

180
00:37:54,000 --> 00:38:00,599
become stale in a way and so the path is this kind of

181
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:06,760
dialectic between uh equilibrium and de

182
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:13,480
disequilibrium between uh kind of coziness and being thrown out of the

183
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:20,839
nest pamet troan said like to be to be truly alive is to be thrown out of the nest Moment by moment

184
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:26,440
right and so the path the Dharma path it

185
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:33,200
um it feels like home and it feels like

186
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:38,319
Exile it's so um it's so wonderful to

187
00:38:38,319 --> 00:38:43,440
come home you know hopefully it feels like

188
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:49,520
that to to come home and to feel the kind of coziness

189
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:56,119
of of home you know and the Dharma is a lot like that it's this kind of sense of

190
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:05,079
like I knew this but I forgotten I'm returning I'm remembering um I'm like uh the heart is

191
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:13,720
returning to its native ground okay yeah and that is such

192
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:21,560
um that's a beautiful way and so the lots of people have talked about the path certain kind of

193
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:28,760
homecoming but we all know that spending all time maybe at home is not good we

194
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:34,119
venture out into the world to be

195
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:39,960
startled you know the startling quality when

196
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,319
we feel uh kind of estranged from our

197
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:52,560
prior models our prior understandings the stess of what we took to be

198
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:59,319
so and that kind of sense of of possibility and deep liveness when the

199
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:06,160
you can kind of sense it like the current model the current mental model the current frame the current Dharma

200
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:11,599
understanding starts to develop a little crack right as like part of us wants to

201
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,599
like patch it up right and there's some fear there you know it's like wait a

202
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,920
second the kind of ordinary reference points losing

203
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:30,680
them and then there's this incredible kind of openness too in that

204
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,119
disequilibrium and this can happen in a lot of ways when we look at the the

205
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:43,440
world when we look at the enormity just how deep the first Noble

206
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:49,280
Truth the Buddha's first Noble Truth of dukka just how deep that runs when we

207
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:58,640
look at the immensity of of goodness and Beauty the the Buddhist Grace you

208
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,400
know that disequilibrium can happen when we look into the eyes of another

209
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:09,680
person but don't look in that familiar

210
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,960
way where they lie you know a foot

211
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:21,480
behind kind of the plexiglass of all the accumulated

212
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:28,079
Concepts we have we just look at somebody maybe into the eyes maybe we

213
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:35,240
just gaze at them that kind of deep mystery of their being

214
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:45,040
onsets this disequilibrium happens when the kind of song of

215
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:52,200
self that we've been humming incessantly

216
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:04,000
stops scientist Jude Pearl said um you cannot answer a question that you cannot

217
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:10,240
ask and you cannot ask a question that you have no words

218
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:17,800
for so maybe part of what the Dharma is about

219
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:23,319
is finding finding words actually words for

220
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:28,559
new questions new questions of about

221
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:40,119
ourself our life our deaths to others new questions about um Love and

222
00:42:40,119 --> 00:42:49,040
Death and what consolation is possible given the UN graspability of

223
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:56,160
all things the unpossess ability of all things what is possible what consolation

224
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:04,000
is possible what kind of piece might be

225
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:11,480
invented so I

226
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:20,680
uh I look forward to uh to our questions together and

227
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:26,119
um and uh to be uh Changed by their

228
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:34,200
articulation so a deep uh bow to you all welcome and
