and inviting breath to move through just as

63
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,960
it wants to move

64
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:52,879

66
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:08,120

00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:52,039
moment is enough nothing needs to be accomplished taking Refuge cultivating stability and

133
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:56,440
presence for the sake of yourself and

134
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240

135
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278

136
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:26,519

breathed

138
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

139
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:38,240
and as we turn to bring this sitting period to a close appreciating that we've showed up

140
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,399
we've done our best and whatever happened or did not

141
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:49,120
happen to accept it just as it was just as it had to be

142
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:55,039
given all the con causes and conditions of our mind and appreciating that we've

143
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:01,200
planted seeds planted seeds of wholesome

144
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:08,080
wholesomeness which will flower in their own time letting go of any

145
00:29:09,399 --> 00:29:14,600
judgment and appreciating also the community that's supporting us and

146
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:19,880
practice practicing with us dedicating the goodness trusting

147
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:26,360
there is goodness co-created from our practice together and dedicating this

148
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:33,240
goodness to the well being of all beings everywhere may all beings be well may

149
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:40,399
all beings be happy may all beings be free including

150
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:55,799
myself thanks everyone thanks for your

151
00:29:56,080 --> 00:30:02,679
practice so so as I mentioned earlier

152
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:11,640
um there various themes in my mind and what seemed most um applicable now was was this idea

153
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:18,279
of cultivating stability cultivating stability when um especially during the

154
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:24,640
holidays when there's so much happening there's so much seems to be happening um

155
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:29,880
and also you know there could be is a busy there could be stress there could

156
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:36,200
be just so much happening so the best gift we can give ourselves lovingly BL

157
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:41,919
through ourselves into others is to establish a sense of stability calm

158
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:47,159
groundedness um not to get reactive when

159
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:52,200
things go wrong which inevitably they do

160
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:57,720
because this is the human life so this gift of stability gift of groundedness

161
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:04,440
and and the twist tonight was was the invitation to do it really lovingly

162
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,840
really lovingly addressing ourselves kindly gently as if a beloved

163
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:16,559
other as if a child who's training being trained in something and just not quite

164
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:22,399
getting it right okay sweetheart it's all right yeah this is great keep keep

165
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:28,039
cultivating being in the present moment so that aspect of meta not so much in

166
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:33,960
the phrases may you be well may I be well may I be happy but in the way we relate it to the practice of

167
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:39,519
stability as oh just because I care for you dear one I care for you so much I'm

168
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:45,360
inviting you to be in the present moment and and I invited you during the practice to actually try that on even if

169
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:50,440
it's felt ridiculous or unfamiliar to address yourself kindly to see what

170
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:57,440
happened what might have lit up because as as I did that though I

171
00:31:57,440 --> 00:32:02,600
dress my myself kindly but really in this practice I addressed myself just really reminding myself that yeah this

172
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:09,679
is for your benefit dear we're doing this for your benefit oh yeah something shifted something became available that

173
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:18,519
was quite lovely so so now we have some time to um connect with with community

174
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:26,480
in small groups uh if we want so one invitation if you want is to um actually

175
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:33,200
wait I'm going to bring up mea just so that I speak around these

176
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:40,840
themes of uh practice as put in chat earlier so it's a reminder that we're

177
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:48,320
practicing mea meta um in small groups uh as well as a

178
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:55,080
continuation of our practice um as um yeah treating treating

179
00:32:55,080 --> 00:33:01,760
the small groups also as as practice they're not separate it's not like you just practice and now go and be in the

180
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,880
rooms and just chat no no no this is also a formal practice how we relate to

181
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,799
others how we relate to ourselves it's it's really part of this interactive way

182
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:20,679
of um practicing is is where the rubber meets the road even more perhaps I would

183
00:33:20,679 --> 00:33:27,480
even go as far as saying that maybe our meditation practice is preparation for this higher bar practice of relational

184
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:33,679
how do we show up do we show up with kindness and care for ourselves kindness and care for

185
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:39,200
others so with the m mindfully listening and speaking being embodied allowing

186
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:46,399
some of the awareness to be in the body embracing compassion notice with kindness if there's internal reactions

187
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:53,519
or discomfort holding yourself and others with compassion and staying on the topic so

188
00:33:53,519 --> 00:34:00,840
the topic for tonight is um practice that we did the invitations to

189
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,880
to Really address yourself kindly gently with as if you're mentoring yourself to

190
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:12,919
stay in the present and not becoming reactive or impatience okay sweetheart I

191
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:18,398
care for you and really reconnecting with the intention it's for my own good

192
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:24,200
how was that did did that connect did something light up um if not it's

193
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:31,240
perfectly fine you're sharing for the benefit of yourself to be held witness sometimes when we many times when we

194
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:36,320
speak out loud other insights come in that we hadn't realize when we're

195
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,480
silent um take turns briefly sharing concisely allowing space for others so

196
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:48,240
each person uh Will Go reverse alphabetical order according to first name each person will say just a tiny

197
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:53,800
bit or you can say pass um and then the next person the next person avoiding

198
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:00,920
cross talk not giving advice interrupting commenting just keeping this space

199
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:08,440
safe so and and um yeah really it's not so much what you say but how how you

200
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:15,880
show up how we show up for one another okay I'm going to create the

201
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:23,320
small groups and um yeah and also if you wanted you can

202
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:34,160

um um yeah cultivating

204

stability during the holiday especially do you feel the need for that maybe that

205
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:53,839
would be another theme to to go around another one more time to see the value in cultivating non-reactivity and

206

stability especially in these times all right so I'm creating the okay welcome back

um I have a uh uh sort of

219
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:46,599
a what did you call it um a light up a lit up experience at

220
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:52,280
the very end of the meditation I'm usually very very much in touch with my

221
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:57,599
left side and often focus on my left arm

222
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:04,359
it sort of lights up my whole left side at the very end of the meditation

223
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:12,000
all of a sudden my right side was lit up alive and it was amazing I I wasn't even

224
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:18,599
thinking of doing that it just it just happened which made me feel very uh

225
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:26,280
whole so thank you thank you for the nice nice thank you so much for sharing this this is so lovely and interesting

226
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:32,720
and and um uh part of uh what what I'm hearing

227
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,960
perhaps is you know and and and actually let me ask you something Kim did you find that your mind was getting more

228
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:46,720
settled through this this um practice before the other side became lit up yes

229
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:54,839
because it was at the it was at the very end and yeah I was getting more and more settled yeah yeah it's it's lovely it's

230
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:00,920
um so the when the mind gets settled more and more settled it seems like

231
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:07,599
these um uh you know energetic channels open up in our body right energetic

232
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:15,160
channels that we don't have so much conscious control over um and and you

233
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:21,599
know trying to activate your you know the other side that's not really lit up like whereas when we really really

234
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:28,280
settle there's a sense of contentment in the body the body's like oh here is a flower here's I'm going to B bance I'm

235
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:34,800
going to balance out the energies Without You Really Trying dear so it's it's a lovely

236
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:41,960
gift thanks for sharing that and and that tells me that your mind was really settling yeah that's really lovely

237
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:47,880
beautiful thank you Kim Diana I see your

238
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:56,920
hand um in my meditation I the I have a light bulb go

239
00:39:56,920 --> 00:40:05,000
off oh wait light up it went boing like that and what it was for quite some time I've

240
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:10,119
heard you use the term sweetheart in connection with others and I've used

241
00:40:10,119 --> 00:40:15,920
that somewhere along the line in life I learned to say sweetheart to maybe dear

242
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:22,560
friends or family member or cat in a natural way and the light bulb was that

243
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:28,040
I would never think of using that term with myself

244
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,560
ever and then it went oh and and so

245
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:39,760
that's much for me to reflect on and I can't what what an obstruction there

246
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:46,599
must be to to not even think of it or think of

247
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:53,000
myself with a term of endearment other than you whatever because you drop

248
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:59,480
something or whatever you can't do something like that never would have thought of that so it's much to

249
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:05,280
appreciate about this it was really quite jarring

250
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:13,520
to realize that so thank you thank you Diana beautiful I'm so happy for you

251
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:19,200
that it's being seen that is a huge Insight right for it to become available

252
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:25,839
because we usually go along our lives and we don't examine the way we're addressing perhaps ourselves to see that

253
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:32,480
oh oh dear this is um and now that you've seen it you cannot unsee it which

254
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:37,920
is and it's fine it's you know it being jarring is okay as long as you're gentle

255
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,079
with yourself sweetheart you this is jarring this is it still feels awkward

256
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,160
right now it's just awkward when I'm trying it but I'm going to keep trying it's not like natural yet so yeah it

257
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:56,839
will now that you've you know with with this practice um in this tradition

258
00:41:56,839 --> 00:42:02,240
really awareness is is the lead it leads

259
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,040
everything else when you become aware um everything else will follow on its own

260
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:13,599
naturally it's not so much a push and shove and trying to make it happen so

261
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:20,800
now that you have become aware that this um feels like an unfamiliar pattern or

262
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,559
or or or or a unfamiliar way to address yourself with kindness and with

263
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:33,280
Endearment ah there's awareness there's Sati there's mindfulness and and trust that

264
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,359
rest the rest of it will unfold on its own you don't have to push and shove and

265
00:42:38,359 --> 00:42:45,520
really try it so hard so um let it it will unfold for you I have no

266
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:51,880
doubt yeah beautiful thanks Diana thanks so much for sharing that beautiful Insight
