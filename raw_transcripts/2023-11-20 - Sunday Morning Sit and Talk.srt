1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,480
okay well I did not expect to be giving a talk today um I

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,519

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,199
gave um so I am Hillary and um I hope

00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:23,359
that she will bear with me as I I don't know quite what I'm GNA say thank you I

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:28,560
have some some fans

6
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,480
um I know it's probably whoever was going to speak might have thought to

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:40,480
speak about Thanksgiving today because it's coming up for those who celebrate

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:47,000
that um or for those who honor um the

9
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:57,559
Native Americans uh who have been here for thousands of years and and how um

10
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:05,400
how with each prayer they teach rather than imploring a deity or

11
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:12,840
God please do something for me there is a thankfulness a gratitude a

12
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:21,000
thank you and so I'd like to just offer that as a beginning um to feel deep

13
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:28,400
gratitude for this place that we have this Dharma Center where we can come

14
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,720
together um in peace

15
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:43,479
and really want to uh honor how important sa is especially with all the

16
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:47,600
things that are going on in the world right

17
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:54,360
now so starting with gratitude but then

18
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:01,439
wanting to acknowledge that there's a lot going on that's heartbreaking

19
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:06,799
I don't know about you does anybody wake up in the middle of the night with this

20
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:12,040
dist tread and fear just raise your hand if that's true for

21
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,760
you okay not everybody that's wonderful those of you who didn't raise

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:25,360
your hand somebody come up here and give a talk you were farther on the path

23
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:30,760
perhaps than I so the the

24
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:37,800
the poem that keeps coming to me in the middle of the night is uh by Wendel

25
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:43,720
Berry the Peace of wild things when despair for the world grows

26
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:50,080
in me and I wake in the night at the least sound in fear of what my life and

27
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:57,159
my children's lives may be I go and lie down where the wood Drake rests in his

28
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:04,239
Beauty on the water and the great Heron feeds I come into the Peace of wild

29
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:10,360
things who do not tax their lives with forethought of grief I come into the

30
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:17,760
presence of Still Water and I feel above me the day blind Stars waiting with

31
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:25,840
their light for a time I rest in the grace of the world and I'm

32
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,280
free I spent a lot of time outdoors in nature

33
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:43,840
I'm in the E chency program and I find such Solace um and such peace in nature so I

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,120
really recommend that

35
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:56,560
um and I would imagine that a lot of us wanted to gather here

36
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:04,000
together for some kind of Solace for some kind of

37
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:10,599
sharing the grief and the suffering not to do this alone but do

38
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:16,599
this together

39
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,720
um I know that there are a lot of feelings that

40
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:31,600
are coming up right in all of us and some of them are

41
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:39,759
um are are just very hard to hold Just Popcorn style if somebody could just

42
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,919
people just name some feelings that are coming up for you right

43
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:54,280
now anger anger sadness sadness fear fear sadness

44
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:01,320
sadness grief grief gratitude gratitude

45
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:09,759
joy joy happiness

46
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:17,520
happiness appreciation energy

47
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:24,000
energy frustration frustration uncertainty

48
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,479
uncertainty love love

49
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:36,199
connection wonder

50
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:44,280
wonder so a lot of different feelings coming up right now a lot is

51
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:52,600
here and our practice is here to help us to find that centeredness that inner

52
00:05:52,600 --> 00:06:01,479
peace when there's lots of Chaos in our personal lives and in the world

53
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:09,199
and it feels to me like this is the great

54
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:17,280
teaching of Buddhism it is when there is chaos when there is

55
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,560
uncertainty when there's fear when there's anger when we don't

56
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:30,599
really know the way forward we stop we pause

57
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:38,120
pause we take a breath and we close our eyes and we see

58
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,720
if we can find some inner

59
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,840
peace and from that place we can then

60
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:56,440
respond wisely in the world and not from reactivity of fear

61
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:01,400
and in anger and retribution

62
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:12,198
and this is something that is wise for all people to do and

63
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:18,319
all all organizations All Nations

64
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:23,800
everyone right to pause for peace to feel some

65
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:32,879
peace and to have compassion for all [Music] beings right I remember tign not

66
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:41,680
Han in the 60s he was exiled from his country for choosing

67
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:50,240
peace and not choosing sides knowing that all people suffer everyone on all

68
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,159
sides when there is not

69
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:00,599
peace so how do we make peace

70
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:06,599
with what is what we're feeling that's what we're here

71
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:12,000
for and we have feelings for a reason because they're here to tell us

72
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:19,440
that something is right or something is wrong something

73
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,080
needs sometimes something needs to be

74
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,200
done so what what do we do with these feelings I mean we

75
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:38,760
[Music] can go into our fight

76
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:46,279
fight Freeze and I don't know how many of you are

77
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:52,360
feeling um what do you feel some sense

78
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:58,000
of anger who is feeling that right

79
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:03,440
now okay okay and how many people are feeling

80
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,680
like you want to

81
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:14,040
flee just run away and you may have be raising your

82
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:19,560
hand more than once and how many people feel

83
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:27,640
Frozen you can't move okay yeah so I would like to Just In

84
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:33,920
This Moment like acknowledge that a lot of us may be feeling kind of frozen or

85
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,959
feeling like we might want to run or we might want to say some things that might

86
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:48,240
be a little unskillful in this moment and just let your

87
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,040
body find a little bit of movement one of the things that can happen in our in

88
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:01,519
our practice we sit still and we hold these feelings

89
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,920
in and if we are really feeling fear and

90
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,079
anxiety and anger it can really lock those feelings into our

91
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:19,240
bodies and we can be more and more traumatized so I invite you just to

92
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:25,770
bring in a little bit of movement to unfreeze might be a little rocking

93
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:33,240
[Music] motion might be from side to

94
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,639
side just let your body find what it needs to do and you can close your eyes

95
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:45,079
you don't have to feel self-conscious but just find a

96
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:53,240
little bit of motion so these emo

97
00:10:53,240 --> 00:11:00,839
emotions have some place to go and then

98
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:08,040
you might find that you feel inclined to take a deeper breath in and

99
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:18,440
out find a little ease in the body and then you might find that

100
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:24,680
placing a hand on the heart or placing a hand on the belly

101
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,880
or find your place your way of bringing some compassion

102
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,680
to whatever you're

103
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:44,240
experiencing you might just practice or just just invite

104
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:49,399
you to uh explore with your eyes closed

105
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:56,749
you might even try just stroking your hand down your [Music]

106
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
arms

107
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:12,760
you might like to just cup your your hands around your

108
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:27,279
face or if your mind is going and thoughts are woring around in there you

109
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,600
might even place your hand in your forehead in the back of your skull I

110
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:37,800
love to do this when I am my thoughts are

111
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:44,600
racing just feel the the comfort of your own hands

112
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,480
offering you

113
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:59,279
support and then you might just bring your hands down to your thep tops of

114
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,800
your legs your thighs perhaps just rubbing your thighs a little

115
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:15,959
bit maybe even just holding your

116
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,760
knees just to let yourself know that yeah I'm

117
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:37,040
here there's part of me that can support this part that is

118
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:46,240
feeling a little bit out of balance and then you might place a hand

119
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:51,839
on your heart and you could also place a hand on

120
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:59,240
your belly just feeling the warmth of your

121
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:05,160
hands or maybe they're cold the warmth of your body and just

122
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,680
sing whatever is

123
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:20,560
present and just feeling the support of your [Music] own your own kindness your own

124
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:33,519
compassion and we also may feel some sense of guilt I'm okay In This Moment a

125
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:41,519
lot of people are not but having compassion for being a

126
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:48,920
witness to all that is happening we too suffer along with all of

127
00:14:49,959 --> 00:14:55,000
our our fellow human beings and all of

128
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:00,160
our more than human beings we we too are suffering and

129
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,040
deserve

130
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:13,680
compassion and then just noticing

131
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:17,839
actually let's just give ourselves a

132
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:26,759
hug one of the things that I do is I teach mindful self-compassion courses

133
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:35,160
for 6 weeks 8 weeks and it takes a long time to begin

134
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:42,399
to learn to be able to take in compassion a lot of us don't feel like

135
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:48,040
we are worthy of that everyone else is worthy of our

136
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:55,160
compassion but we're not worthy of our own our own self- compassion and we

137
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:02,399
need to know as the Buddhist said you are are as worthy of love and compassion

138
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,079
as any other being on the

139
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:17,880
planet so there is a lot of of sadness and

140
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,000
grief and anger and other feelings I invite you just to put your hands up

141
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:28,959
like this and choose a hand to put the side

142
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:36,800
and the grief the anger those hard feelings choose a hand and maybe just

143
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:45,560
curl that up a little bit not in a fist not tight but just like you were holding

144
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:50,959
a little bird that was wounded in your

145
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:58,600
hand and then with your other hand come up underneath that hand and cup it cup

146
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:05,730
those feelings with whatever compassion love

147
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:11,880
[Music] kindness might be present in

148
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,558
you to hold

149
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:31,440
both so there's a practice in and mindful self-compassion that's called

150
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:35,399
meeting unmet

151
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,160
needs and so invite you just uh if you feel like you want to close your eyes

152
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:50,200
for just a moment or just have a soft downward

153
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:54,000
gaze and I'm going

154
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:00,919
to just invite you to so be present for

155
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,919
an emotion that is here for you right

156
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:14,640
now just one that you feel that you can hold without feeling

157
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:28,880
overwhelmed and seeing if you can just name name the feeling

158
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,400
what is

159
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:41,440
this and noticing what happens when you give it a

160
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,039
name if it feels like it's magnifying it's getting

161
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:56,559
bigger that's not actually what where the intention is the intention is just

162
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:05,280
to meet that feeling and say I see you so what is that for me if I say the

163
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,520
word fear I will feel more fear it will magnify and so that's not helpful so I

164
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:22,799
might say something like oh unease unease is

165
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,880
here so it's honoring the truth of how I'm feeling with

166
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:37,520
without becoming overwhelmed by it and also noticing how we're seeing

167
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:46,919
the feeling how are we relating to it if I say I am afraid that becomes an

168
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:54,760
identity I become blended with that feeling I feel like that's all that I am

169
00:19:54,760 --> 00:20:00,919
and then I feel overwhelmed so if we we can instead say

170
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:06,039
something like unease is

171
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:13,600
present there is unease here or there is anger or sadness or

172
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:20,158
whatever it is so just giving it a

173
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:34,159
name and then seeing if you can feel where it is in your body maybe it's in

174
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:39,960
several places you might just kind of scan your body from head to toe and see

175
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:43,919
where does that that feeling live in

176
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,679
you and find the place that it might be strongest maybe it's in your heart in

177
00:20:52,679 --> 00:21:00,760
your chest or in your belly or forehead just finding that place and

178
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:08,360
seeing if you can bring your awareness to that place and notice how close you

179
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,440
can get to that feeling without getting overwhelmed by

180
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:19,919
it maybe you need to just

181
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:30,120
stay a few inches from it or a few feet or maybe you need to to be really far

182
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:35,960
away bringing your awareness out as far as you need to to not feel overwhelmed

183
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:41,840
by the feeling and then to see if you can bring your awareness

184
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,480
closer and see if if you can get a little closer just around the edges of

185
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:55,470
that feeling perhaps and then seeing if you can

186
00:21:55,470 --> 00:22:01,640
[Music] bring some warmth some kindness perhaps

187
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:05,799
putting a hand soothing hand

188
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:15,960
there and perhaps there are some words of support that might be helpful for you

189
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,278
to

190
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:29,960
hear perhaps it's I'm here I'm here for you I care I see you I feel you

191
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:43,039
you and if you feel like you need to bring your awareness out you might bring

192
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:51,320
your awareness to parts of you that actually feel okay what parts of you feel okay right

193
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:01,799
now and see if those parts can hold hold this part that

194
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:05,600
feels sad

195
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,240
afraid

196
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:21,240
angry and see if you can just allow to be here for just a little bit if you

197
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:28,880
feel like it's overwhelming feel free to open your eyes look around the

198
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:34,000
room feel your your

199
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,720
body connected to your

200
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:46,480
seat feel your feet on the

201
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:52,880
floor so just letting yourself

202
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:59,159
soften around this this feeling

203
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:07,039
bring some warmth some soothing and

204
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,720
allowing softening soothing and

205
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:33,200
allowing and then feeling

206
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:43,398
into an unmet need that you have right now what is the need that you might

207
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:50,000
have maybe it's a need to

208
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:59,759
feel peace safety

209
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:14,679
compassion and seeing if you can actually either through your hand

210
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:22,559
through your breath breathe this in feel

211
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:29,799
this this quality that would be nourished ing right

212
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:38,120
now seeing if you can feel that in the air that we breathe together all of

213
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:45,919
our good intentions all of our good wishes can we collectively breathe them

214
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:50,799
in from each other and breathe them out to each

215
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:02,320
other you might even if you feel inclined to

216
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:09,760
open your eyes and look [Music] around perhaps make some eye contact

217
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:16,679
with someone in the room and sense some loving kindness some compassion from

218
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:23,520

count the cost of all that has been broken and all that has been lost I

255
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:39,159
cannot understand the suffering that life brings war and hate and hunger and

256

a million other things when I've done all that I can and

open heart and the light on the Hills is full
