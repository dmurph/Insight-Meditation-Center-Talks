1
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:08,519
okay welcome uh welcome to you all yeah uh invited folks to chat

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:15,519
in um Dharma themes for uh talk I

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:26,720
appreciate everything that's been said I'll find something in there try to speak to it but um let's uh let's

4
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,960
it e

5
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,560
so just um Beginning by by uh sensing the

6
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,159
presence of other beings

7
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:41,759
the the goodwi uh in this uh Network we call SA

8
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:15,400
just checking into the the energy in your body

9
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,000
mind you tired you

10
00:02:22,519 --> 00:02:28,160
wired both

11
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:31,840
settled bright

12
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:44,120
just kind of uh inclin towards

13
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,840
balance

14
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:32,760
e e

15
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:12,519
and we relax what we can relax but we relax so that we know more sense more

16
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,639
feel more more

17
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,360
brightness we relax in other words

18
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:37,520
so that we can be uh genuinely

19
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,639
alert

20
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,680
e e

21
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:14,000
we're we're not practicing hypervigilance but there is a quality of poise in the

22
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:23,199
attention such that some phenomena sprung up

23
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:30,120
prominent we would uh appreciate it quickly

24
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:44,199
we're cultivating an attention that uh selects its

25
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:53,560
object and magnifies magnifies that

26
00:06:53,560 --> 00:07:01,479
object we soak into it the breathing sound

27
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:08,240
mental images body sensation emotional

28
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:22,039
sensation and so we're alert and

29
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:32,599
oriented and develop a kind of uh Fidelity to the object maybe we

30
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:39,199
say somei concentration maybe just very

31
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:50,080
briefly but as if uh the attention soaks into the

32
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,240
object and the rest of the world remains in the

33
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
background

34
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

35
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,440
e e

36
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:49,600
and it can feel almost uh neglectful not to tend to the landscape

37
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:54,240
of threat and opportunity in every

38
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:02,279
moment and feel neglectful not to think and

39
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:12,120
worry can feel neglectful not to give thought it's

40
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:23,320
due but that's just

41
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:36,880
habit and for right now it's not neglectful to be

42
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:42,040
very very

43
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
simple

44
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

45
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

46
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

47
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,160
e e

48
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:37,000
we just kind of practice putting

49
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:42,839
down our

50
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,560
life it's the busyness that is

51
00:13:57,160 --> 00:14:03,360
Samara always something to worry

52
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:13,839
about something at stake something

53
00:14:23,079 --> 00:14:29,880
vulnerable and part of our practice is opening to all of that and

54
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:36,240
another part is giving our heart

55
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,600
rest so that we can meet all of that

56
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
lovingly

57
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

58
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

59
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
e

60
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

61
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:31,880
e e

62
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:10,880
don't uh miss the goodness that's already

63
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:27,760
here don't miss that which you don't need to engineer strive

64
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
towards

65
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

66
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

67
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

68
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
e e

69
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:36,360
making the object of attention the mind the affective

70
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:41,480
feeling tonal qualities of our

71
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:59,320
mind kind of energies and flavors of the Mind

72
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:05,640
brightness or

73
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,120
dullness agitation

74
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:25,039
Tranquility grasping aversion peace

75
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,799
just to notice that is enough awareness does its own

76
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,320
work without

77
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:01,480
you e

78
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:54,000
if there's some measure of stability

79
00:23:54,000 --> 00:24:00,440
maybe stability itself becomes the object

80
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,240
becomes more grounded more

81
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
open

82
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

83
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

84
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

85
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

86
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

87
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

88
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

89
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,080
e

90
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,279
okay thanks folks um so I

91
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:12,960
saw uh grief um mortality contemplating

92
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:20,440
one's death anxiety uh relation to the world

93
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:28,080
equinity and uh I think we can I think we can talk

94
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:34,760
about that so

95
00:30:45,519 --> 00:30:50,600
um I don't recall who it was or somebody

96
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:57,320
who's maybe done nursing with hospice patients

97
00:30:57,320 --> 00:31:03,159
taking care of people at the end of their life but uh they said something like

98
00:31:03,159 --> 00:31:08,480
um I don't know what I think about this but they said uh the

99
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,960
degree of one's uh non- Enlightenment is

100
00:31:13,960 --> 00:31:20,120
is correlated with the degree of fear around death you

101
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,799
know and

102
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:32,679
um I thought I was pray pretty free but I don't know one thing I remember I was

103
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:40,519
going up and cleaning the windows on irc's community room if you've been in

104
00:31:40,519 --> 00:31:47,159
that room as a high ceiling it's a high ceiling and I was on the roof and I

105
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:54,600
don't know what I'm doing but my job on that cleaning day was to clean

106
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:02,320
the you know uh whatever the windows up there you know

107
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:09,720
uh skylights I they were and um and I kind of had some of them were

108
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:17,279
sort of accessible and like it was not it was not like a clear drop 30 ft but

109
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:23,480
then some were unprotected and so I'm just out there cleaning the

110
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:32,440
windows considering how unenlightened I am cuz I was not ready to die on an IRC

111
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:39,639
work day and okay that's like the visceral kind

112
00:32:39,639 --> 00:32:45,360
of Dimension maybe maybe our body kind of is

113
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:52,360
always um uh in resistance in some way to that

114
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:58,519
I I read a piece on uh Rah you know from ROM doss's nurse

115
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:05,639
the end of of ramd das's life and just as the end was coming as he took a

116
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:10,760
breath tried to take a breath and couldn't get enough breath

117
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:17,120
in after all these Decades of teaching so beautifully

118
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:25,320
about about letting go uh what the nurse described in Ram das's face was uh Was

119
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:32,399
Fear as touching you know how do we know we're ready to let go of

120
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:42,519
this life I I don't know that we can ever know but it's a worthy object of

121
00:33:42,519 --> 00:33:51,519
contemplation for many reasons um one just to clarify what's actually

122
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:57,200
important in our lives you know just to sweep away what we know will be

123
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:03,039
absolutely meaningless at the end of our life and there's a lot that seems maybe

124
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:10,320
important now that really won't be that that's sort of humbling just to see that

125
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:19,358
Gap you know but we already know that in on a hard day or something like

126
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:27,878
that the stuff you know the stuff of life is like totally totally meaningless

127
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:33,560
offers absolutely no consolation and so it's worth looking at

128
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:39,000
like what what offers genuine consolation on a hard day at the end of

129
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:44,280
a life and so we we were practicing

130
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:52,320
clearing away that which is unimportant you know and maybe the question about death

131
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:57,880
doesn't clarify everything maybe we shouldn't take the counsel of death

132
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,880
100% at face value maybe there are some things that won't feel meaningful then

133
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:13,000
that do feel meaningful now and that's okay maybe but we want to live in the shadow

134
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:23,599
of finitude and part of the function of the death

135
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:31,040
contemplation is um is to sort of pre grieve

136
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,160
loss loss for which the heart is utterly unprepared is

137
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:43,079
always more gruesome and so in a sense we're we're

138
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:48,720
trying to uh open to finitude while we still

139
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:55,280
have time to begin to allow our heart to acclimatize to the truth of

140
00:35:55,280 --> 00:36:01,040
anich uncertainty impermanent which is almost always kind of startling no

141
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:08,960
matter how prepared we think we are anicha is startling but we can make

142
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:14,400
progress right remember maybe shared this from Michelle

143
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:22,520
McDonald asking like n you know sadas kind of revered burmes uh monk you know

144
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:28,480
how he practices he was in his 90s he says when I breathe in I say I know

145
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:37,800
I will die when I breathe out I say I know everyone else will die and um and then he said and so when

146
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,119
I do I will not be

147
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:51,839
surprised we uh contemplate death um because

148
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:59,400
anxiety anxiety is unimaginable without a

149
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:07,480
future anxiety is directed towards the governing uh what is you know maybe we

150
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:15,079
influence but ultimately ungovernable and and so the notion of

151
00:37:15,079 --> 00:37:22,680
like a a futur lessness there's no potential room for anxiety in

152
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:27,720
that and so death is um in some sense

153
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:33,720
it's the intersection of all anxieties we have like what's the final thing that

154
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:41,640
we wish to avoid when we wish to avoid some eventualities it's like the threat

155
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:48,839
to our life is is ultimately what gives fear its power the way fear Tangles up

156
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:56,960
with anxiety and so to become uh a quanus

157
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:06,079
even little bit with the reality of mortality um this is this is a way to

158
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:13,400
cut through anxiety we know how the story ends We Know How It Ends already

159
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:18,680
there's no drama yeah the wisdom of No Escape

160
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:25,400
there's no drama here we know how the story ends okay what does that do to the

161
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:31,800
heart maybe we see the way in which that

162
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:39,079
um that can free us up but in the process of freeing ourselves up we um we

163
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:47,200
grieve we grieve right before the three characteristics Tuka n not become

164
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:53,359
freeing we grieve them we grieve them

165
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:59,920
and uh that grief as I I've talked about

166
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:05,760
often it's just like that's the Growing Pains of Dharma you

167
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:12,280
know it's how for many people that's how it feels to

168
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,920
grow and so

169
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:27,079
um it is uh it is onward leading and we get to practice with with small losses

170
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:33,720
or with deep you know brutal losses to find

171
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:40,000
ways of bearing bearing it you know of

172
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:50,640
letting our hearts kind of thought out wake up ah this is the

173
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:58,359
law this is the law this is the lawful unfolding and we like just appreciate

174
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:05,040
the law you know okay I'm governed by

175
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,359
this let me live in accord with that

176
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,960
understanding and so we we grieve you know we begin to

177
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:24,280
um begin to let some of the anxiety melt

178
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:33,359
because it's no longer a question and this is also for me what what feels

179
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:40,560
important in beginning to uh to open to

180
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:46,119
um you know the the enormity of suffering in the world it's too much

181
00:40:46,119 --> 00:40:54,440
from the perspective of my stupid little life you know my little life it's too

182
00:40:54,440 --> 00:41:04,000
much too much so pH I used to use as a kid I was told by my parents like last

183
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:10,560
year they said that was your that was what you said a lot too much it's too

184
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:16,400
much it was my way of saying like ah

185
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:22,839
Dua it's too much you know

186
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:29,640
and it still feels that way maybe I got into practice a way of meeting that

187
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:35,599
intuitively I knew all about anicha even though my life

188
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:42,440
was protected privileged in a number of ways insulated from

189
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:51,280
the the intensity of anicha at least for a while and uh and now as I contemplate

190
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:57,720
the kind of um Global suffering you know it feels

191
00:41:57,720 --> 00:42:03,800
like yeah my life is too small a portal into understanding

192
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:13,160
that that the the ascendency of greed Hayden delusion in politics in this the US it's

193
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:18,599
it needs a broader view climate you

194
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:24,760
know uh the Florida you know it's like it

195
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:31,040
needs a broader View and of course we stay very tactical and

196
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:37,359
obviously like compassion is a verb as tnan says we act now there's a lot we

197
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:44,520
can do just now and to really open to the fullness

198
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:52,599
of what the Buddha was talking about the kind of like like truly truly giving up the

199
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:59,119
utopian fantasy that makes a lot of strength a

200
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:08,280
lot of strength and it feels like if my view isn't vast it overruns my

201
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:16,839
heart and there's something about contemplating our own death the sense of like the Horizon is had the the moral

202
00:43:16,839 --> 00:43:22,319
Horizon is somehow beyond the scope of my

203
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:29,318
life but um that let

204
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:33,839
