1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:08,400
so good morning everyone and before I start I some of you have contacted us about a

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,519
hum in the in the recordings and so I'm

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:21,039
using a different mic the issue might have been related to the mic that you had and so I know if those of you who

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:30,720
noticed this uh want to say something at some point in the end of the the session that would be nice to

5
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,800
So welcome everyone to our morning's

6
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:44,920
meditation and one of the

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,760
invaluable areas to care for be careful with and

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:58,000
caring is um uh has to do with our thinking thinking during meditation

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,600
some people are at war with their thoughts some people are enamored with

10
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,000
their thoughts some people are 100% committed to their thoughts some people

11
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:17,280
are uh are subservient to the authority of

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:25,840
their thoughts every thought is true or something and but in meditation

13
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,920
uh you what the idea is to start learning how to think and what to think about that

14
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:39,200
supports somebody and at this uh approach stage

15
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:45,560
of samadei there can still be thoughts but the difference is that

16
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:53,360
now the thinking comes from a deeper layer level deeper source within us than

17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,360
anxious thoughts uh desirous thoughts thoughts that have a lot of clinging

18
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,640
involved or force behind them or a lot of ego or self around

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:14,760
them and um and the thoughts that the that come into play are quieter softer

20
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,640
lighter more like more like they float float through rather than they don't

21
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,680
have any force they don't have any force behind them or there's no tension connected to them and they are thoughts

22
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:35,440
that have to do with the meditation itself very simple thoughts about yes

23
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,640
this is good yes here is where the attention should be what happens if I

24
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,400
come a little closer in to the sensations of breathing what happens if

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:53,239
I open up more widely to the sensations of breathing can I just stay

26
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:59,200
longer with the sensations of breathing these very simple sometimes they're a

27
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,519
little bit like giving ourselves instructions sometimes a little bit like exploring the

28
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:10,840
situation just trying very subtly different um ways of being with the

29
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:17,760
experience it's very small adjustments very small things it would be almost as

30
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:25,680
the thoughts would be almost as light almost as almost not there as it would be

31
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,440
driving down the freeway and the subtle ways in which you're constantly

32
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:38,799
adjusting the steering wheel to stay going straight and it's done almost probably without any conscious thinking

33
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:43,840
but there is a conscious engagement that's there that

34
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:51,519
so that that light almost so there's a way of thinking and that way of thinking ah is

35
00:03:51,519 --> 00:04:00,400
also uh can be akin to love can be akin to uh being uh gentle

36
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,519
non assertive a kind of thinking that is not

37
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:13,680
going to be judging not going to be reactive or alarmed but just just

38
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:21,160
like oh here here my friend let's try this let's be here um like you're with a friend who's

39
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,199
maybe trouble with something and here let me let

40
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:33,360
me you know let me let me put my hand on your shoulder or here would you like to

41
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,800
link arms as we're walking through the park um here

42
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,040
um I'm here with you and so there's no kind of thoughts

43
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:51,280
that are making opinions up or stories up or reacting or projecting ideas it's

44
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:58,080
very simple instructional about the experience and sometimes they're very subtle thoughts that just to yourself

45
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,160
kind of very simple are doing field notes describing the situation no and

46
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:10,880
you know you're doing this thinking appropriately if it doesn't distract you

47
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:16,400
it keeps you on track keeps you right here in a nice way you feel the support

48
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:26,160
of it it's like a friend who you know puts their hand gently on your back shoulder saying "It's okay it's okay um

49
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,039
uh you can do this something." And

50
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:39,840
um and then uh and part of that is to begin to recognize oh here this is the

51
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,479
onward leading nature this pleasure this well-being this is

52
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:53,280
good yes this can help me stay stay with this stay with it what's happening and

53
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,400
this is the onward leading this is where I adhere and the onward leading nature

54
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:03,880
of samadei at some point can feel like a

55
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:11,319
gentle thread a gentle cord which is pulling you along

56
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:17,120
um and um maybe like you have a

57
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,919
um uh you know maybe you have a you're on a

58
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:29,919
a sled and you can feel that your friend in front of you or maybe it's a a horse

59
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,840
or something is is pulling you along and you can feel the pull you can feel the

60
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,479
direction or you can feel the the slide yes here

61
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:47,479
here and maybe that's the thoughts the very subtle here yes

62
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:52,680
now so feel the pull the pull of

63
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:57,440
samadei so assuming a meditation

64
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,400
posture and as you're sitting here without anything else just recognize in the broadest

65
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:18,000
possible way how you are how are you now how would you answer

66
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:24,000
that question even in very simple ways

67
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:30,160
feeling how that is for you to be this

68
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:40,800
way and then taking a gentle but full breath and on

69
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:46,759
the exhale settle into the very middle of how you

70
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:52,560
are where the edges can relax

71
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:07,960
closing your eyes and feeling how you are in your

72
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:16,520
body what's the global general feeling sense of being in your body

73
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:28,319
and then in the middle of that taking a few long full

74
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,560
breaths and as you exhale to settle into the middle of all

75
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,080
that allowing the edges to relax

76
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:56,160
and a more general way what's the global experience of

77
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:17,839
breathing and then breathing a little deeper than usual on the

78
00:09:17,959 --> 00:09:24,040
exhale settling into the middle of your

79
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:28,240
breathing with the edges

80
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:48,880
relaxing taking two or three more deeper breaths

81
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:57,040
and the exhale letting your thinking mind settle

82
00:10:10,839 --> 00:10:16,440
relax letting your breathing return to normal

83
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:34,079
and feeling the rhythm of breathing in and breathing

84
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:05,640
At the end of the exhale Having a pause that's just long

85
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:13,200
enough that the urge to breathe in can be accompanied by a little

86
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,600
thought subtle quiet loving thought yes yes to breathing

87
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:25,639
in as you allow the inhale

88
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:01,760
at the beginning of the exhale maybe experiment with a very

89
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,519
subtle quiet thought that simply says

90
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:17,279
instructs "Let go with no demand no expectation

91
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:22,760
just a reminder to be with a letting

92
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,079
go of exhale

93
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,519
and very calmly

94
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:14,720
gently recognize maybe with little thoughts

95
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:20,360
recognize any signs you have of becoming

96
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:28,560
settled becoming calm becoming

97
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:36,199
intimate with a cycle of breathing in and breathing out

98
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:28,120
the quiet thinking sometimes a nonverbal

99
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:36,440
thinking the nonverbal knowing thing that keeps you connected to the

100
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:42,880
process of settling

101
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:51,279
concentrating entering into an

102
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:59,480
immersive experience of samadei with your breathing

103
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:26,919
and might there be a some place deep

104
00:18:26,919 --> 00:18:31,360
inside deep inside the

105
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:41,200
center of your settleness or calm where there's There's a gentle

106
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:48,320
pull that says here come along

107
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:57,799
here settle here focus here

108
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:08,559
or perhaps more profoundly you can feel the

109
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:11,520
gravitational

110
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:22,320
pull that has the message let go

111
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:31,760
here let go into here

112
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:38,120
this place this spot

113
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:20,919
and if it feels right let there be a subtle quiet

114
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:26,400
thinking about your meditation experience

115
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:33,120
that helps quiet the thinking

116
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:40,919
mind that reassures the thinking mind it's

117
00:21:40,919 --> 00:21:45,840
okay to be quiet to be

118
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,320
here to simply

119
00:21:52,600 --> 00:22:01,320
engage in dipping in to the samadei

120
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,919
and as we come to the end of the

121
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:47,480
sitting to see if from the quietest place where you can

122
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:53,000
think or maybe the deepest place

123
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:59,200
The place that is most settled and

124
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,440
calm

125
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,760
content have thoughts of

126
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:19,799
goodwill thoughts of generosity

127
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:30,880
of respectful care for the people you might encounter

128

149
00:30:16,799 --> 00:30:20,120
thank you

150
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:13,320
so hello and welcome to this next part of the series on

151
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:19,039
samadei and we're in this approach stage of samadei sometimes called access

152
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:24,799
concentration and um and as we get more and more

153
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:30,640
settled into meditation more settled more

154
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:36,600
absorbed more intimate more immersed in our

155
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:42,159
experience this is what samadei is is and sometimes samadei is

156
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:47,279
felt to be uh any situation not just meditation

157
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:52,960
where you're we are absorbed in what we are doing immersed in what we're doing

158
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:58,559
some people will describe this as becoming one with what we're doing some

159
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:06,240
people describe it as being deeply intimate some people describe it as being um kind

160
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:12,600
of onepointed gathered together just at just here just with

161
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:22,159
this and um some people describe samadei more as a state a broad wide expansive

162
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:29,919
state that is centered fully here with one thing right now at this moment at this

163
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:37,000
moment sometimes it's called there's a momentary samadei where we're

164
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:44,320
very established in the present moment but the awareness is fully there for one

165
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:50,720
moment of experience then something very different another moment and it's freely takes in the range of things that come

166
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:59,039
in through the different sense doors and um so it doesn't necessarily have a single object um which uh going into

167
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:06,120
deeper samati really usually uses simplifying into a primary kind of

168
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:13,279
object and a lot of this different sense doors start kind of uh receding from

169
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:18,559
awareness and so in deeper samati uh person might not be hearing sound so

170
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:26,640
much not conscious they're they're still capable of it but that's the the attention is so absorbed in like the

171
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:31,919
breathing that uh we don't necessarily hear very much

172
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:38,480
or smell or so so the the whole world of samadei things begin to shift and change

173
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,240
and it is a state shift there's a radical sha changing from business as

174
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:51,799
usual with how we go through our lives and one of the ways that this takes uh shape is that our thinking begins to

175
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:57,519
change as we start getting into this approach stage thinking more and more

176
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:02,559
tends to be wholesome there's less and less unh wholesome thinking there might

177
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:08,800
be still some desires aversions doubt that come up the hindrances might still

178
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:14,200
be there but they're fairly weak now and

179
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:19,679
so if you you should people who come into sumati should really understand the

180
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:24,720
hindrances well have studied them a lot and familiar with them so that the

181
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,919
subtle pull of them no longer grabs us we're able to say no not now stay

182
00:34:30,919 --> 00:34:39,679
here and there's kind of an overriding movement towards kind of a healthy way of thinking a meditative way something a

183
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:49,280
supportive way of thinking thinking about just here just now being here stay here continue here

184
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:55,560
relax here don't cling don't push don't pull back stay

185
00:34:55,560 --> 00:35:01,040
persist and But that thinking feels healthy it feels wholesome

186
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:06,119
and uh to some degree we can come to this juncture with approach the approach

187
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:12,079
stage where we begin to either it happens naturally this kind of more healthy way of thinking about the

188
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,640
meditation itself about the present moment experience or it's easy to make the

189
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:24,240
shift and it is a shift where we're no longer involved in the usual way of

190
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:29,280
thinking which maybe for many people is not so healthy that uh is not so

191
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,560
productive of calm stability peace even

192
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:42,880
well-being and so uh to begin to uh appreciate we're actually shifting out

193
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:50,560
of business as usual it's not a rejection of it is not from a by a version of it but it's important to

194
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:57,839
really appreciate that uh um uh you know if you want to go for a nice swim in a

195
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:03,200
pool generally you go and change into a bathing suit so that you're shifting

196
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:10,520
into a state into way of being that makes more sense that's more appropriate for a nice swim and

197
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:16,720
um there is a kind of recognition oh we're going into a different mode here

198
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:23,839
so that we're not because otherwise many of us are so committed to the usual mode of thinking the usual mode of being the

199
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:29,839
usual preoccupations but at least in principle to understand this is a shift we're

200
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:35,040
taking and we're going into we're going into the pond we're going into the lake

201
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:42,480
for a swim in a sense and yes it's appropriate uh to take on my take off my regular

202
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:48,640
street clothes to have my bathing suit um that um and so yes it's appropriate

203
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:54,480
to put down our preoccupations about work and family and thoughts and desires

204
00:36:54,480 --> 00:37:01,760
and all kinds of things that um resentments that we have it's appropriate for this time because we're

205
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:07,160
now entering into this kind of a new world a new way of

206
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:12,720
being and um and this is where this this transition really begins to take hold in

207
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:20,960
this approach stage and there it's a little bit wobbly still the mind wanders off and we we come back be here and this

208
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:28,160
is where it's really helpful to have this quiet peaceful way of thinking it says yes here stay here it's okay you

209
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:34,000
don't have to go off not now not now stay here

210
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:39,119
and as we're staying here with present and the approach begins to happen some

211
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:45,280
of that approach feels like a onward leading like there's momentum like we're on a slide and we just kind of need to

212
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:51,119
let go to let the slide carry us uh it might be the onward leading

213
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:59,440
nature might have different ways it's experienced by people um sometimes it can be feeling like um

214
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:06,240
you know I very much follow my breathing in my in my belly the movements in my belly and sometimes it's almost like

215
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,599
there's a little thread in there that's pulling pulling me along come here

216
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,640
follow that thread stay right here where there's there's a little bit of pressure

217
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:23,720
a little pulling it's almost like almost like it's not exactly that but it feels like Oh yes here is

218
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:29,320
where I'm being absorbed in here's where I'm really

219
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:35,920
connected i don't know if this metaphor works for for you but I I've found it um

220
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:42,960
helpful for me um uh sometimes that I'm a that uh I'm kind of like a kite that's

221
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:49,359
in the sky floating nicely but there's a nice little thread uh cord that goes

222
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:56,960
down to ground and and that thread uh that rope holding to the kite in the air

223
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:02,640
it needs to be constantly taut uh you don't want it to be slack and you don't

224
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:08,480
want to be too tight if it's too tight the string might break if it's too loose

225
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,640
the kite will fall and um and so the job of the person who's with the kite is to

226
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:19,720
keep the just the right tautness there uh so that it flies

227
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:26,880
well and so just the right tautness there just you here stay there feel that

228
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:34,800
pull don't pull too hard don't lean into it relax it's always a relaxing always a

229
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:41,920
letting go a releasing into releasing into the onward leading nature releasing

230
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:48,599
into the immersion releasing into the lake into the

231
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:55,240
pond releasing it down the slide and um and

232
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:01,760
uh and the uh when my kids were growing up we went to a lake nearby that had a

233
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:08,160
water slide and it was fun you could go fast and splash in the slide of samadei

234
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,000
there there's not really a splash it's like it's very peaceful but sometimes it

235
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:19,920
could be sudden a sudden shift like oh I'm here i'm in the lake or sometimes it

236
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,880
can be a slide that has no bottom and it just but you find yourself in this

237
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:34,760
peaceful space so subtle

238
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:41,800
quiet soft thinking not too much not too

239
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:47,599
little a different kind of thinking than ordinary but a thinking that's about the

240
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:54,400
meditation itself thinking that's without greed without trying too hard

241
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,800
without criticizing anything just simple just the facts just the field notes just

242
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:07,440
a little exploratory aware so that that subtle thinking is part of this

243
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:14,119
gathering together unification that all of us is participating cooperating in

244
00:41:14,119 --> 00:41:22,319
just gathering together into this immersive experience of samadei and then feeling the pull

245
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:31,119
feeling the the little bit of onward leading nature and not to get excited not to

246
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:37,720
push it more but to always remember to feel and relax let

247
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:46,079
go almost like letting go into the experience is the way to be with it more

248
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,839
fully so I hope that uh

249
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:57,920
uh this makes sense and um just as I was saying this in my mind

250
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:05,119
back of my mind I I wanted to say um refer to it as the poetry of samadei and

251
00:42:05,119 --> 00:42:11,280
I don't think I've been anyway speaking poetically but uh maybe there's

252
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:17,680
something about the aesthetics the sensibility of poetry when it's really

253
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:23,040
moves us in a deep way that uh comes into play that supports this

254
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,680
onwardleading nature this subtle thinking where the poetry of samadei the

255
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:37,200
poetry of beauty here poetry of sweetness here yes this

256
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,440
is good so thank you very much and

257
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:52,240
um if some of you would like to meditate more a dayong it's not quite on this

258
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:58,000
topic of samadei but certainly hopefully supportive that tomorrow I have a dayong

259
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,800
retreat on Friday on uh mindfulness of emotions and

260
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:10,560
um and that will be uh through the insight retreat center on their menu you

261
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:17,599
see um uh uh online retreats it's also there's a note about it uh in the what's

262
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,800
new section of IMC's website and I think it's from 9 to 4 at California

263
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:30,160
time it's uh online so thank you very

264
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:37,000
much and uh we'll do another day tomorrow on approach
