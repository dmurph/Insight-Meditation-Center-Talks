1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,400
so welcome uh welcome folks um happy New Year to

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,480
you it's good to uh good to be together good to

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,199
practice so um one of the uh sa members

4
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:30,359
sent me sent me this uh yesterday uh from James Baldwin

5
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:40,120
um he wrote um if it hurts you that's not what's important everybody's

6
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:46,360
hurt what is important what Corrals you what bull whips you what drives you

7
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:53,680
torments you said you must find some way of using this to connect you with

8
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:01,480
everyone else alive this is all you have to do it with

9
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:08,360
you must understand that your pain is Trivial except in so far as you can use

10
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:13,920
it to connect with other people's pain and in so far as you can do that with

11
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:22,200
your pain you can be released from it and then hopefully it works the other way around

12
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,119
too in so far as I can tell you what it is to suffer perhaps I can help you to

13
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:36,040
suffer less then you make oh 15 years later several

14
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:42,360
thousand drinks later two or three divorces God knows how many broken

15
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,079
friendships and an exile of one kind or another some kind of

16
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:58,640
breakthrough which is your first articulation of who you are that is to say your first

17
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,880
articulation of who you suspect we all

18
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:18,440
are this is um what um the way our pain becomes

19
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:27,360
valuable more than trivial and pain is um sitting is not uh

20
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,840
merely about that but it is about that

21
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:41,000
so let us um let us sit and practice and uh feel our bodies

22
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:47,599
and find a way to uh our pain into

23
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,840
goodness for

24
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,120
and just know yourself as a

25
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,120
sensory system

26
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:13,040
what we call our life will only ever

27
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,280
be sensory

28
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,720
experience and so we breathe

29
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:46,680
relax so as to sense more of what's

30
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:02,840
here to begin saturating oh awareness with

31
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,960
uh sense

32
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,639
experience

33
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,639
e e

34
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:46,599
as you breathe see where your breath reaches and where it doesn't

35
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,759
without

36
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:15,520
straining see if you can breathe in a way that

37
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,039
unifies the whole field of your

38
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:29,479
body that doesn't privilege the front of your body over the back

39
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,000
or your torso over your

40
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:59,879
toes sensing the impact of your body breathing across

41
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,159
the whole

42
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
body

43
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,440
e e

44
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,839
perhaps you gently rest the inner

45
00:09:52,040 --> 00:10:01,320
gaze one spot the blank uh mental

46
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:11,800
green our discurs of thinking usually needs a kind of

47
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:14,800
accompanying

48
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:26,040
imagery and sometimes our eyes [Music] move so we just rest in a kind of

49
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,759
simple relaxed way

50
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:42,399
so we breathe and feel our body unifying the field of

51
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
sensation

52
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

53
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

54
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

55
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,160
e e

56
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:49,079
whatever um pain might be in your

57
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:59,240
life where invited to to use that

58
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,160
connect us to

59
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:23,959
others to see it nature as not self

60
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,240
to depersonalize Sam

61
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
Sara

62
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,959
e e

63
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:11,319
we begin to articulate uh

64
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:16,920
who who Baldwin says you supect we all

65
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,920
are

66
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:48,240
and the compassion can get

67
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:52,519
very vast very

68
00:16:56,120 --> 00:17:00,839
quickly and don't worry about the detail

69
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:10,280
tells how to implement this intention or that

70
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:18,039
intention the suspicion that uh compassion can't scale all the

71
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:26,558
way the sense of paralysis in the face

72
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:34,880
of the endlessness of of suffering don't let any of

73
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,080
that close your

74
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:57,559
heart can work out the details another time but right now

75
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:04,919
we honor what's

76
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:22,240
shared we use our pain to connect us

77
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:30,760
deeply to others

78
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

79
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720

80
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640

81
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640

82
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

83
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

84
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,559
e e

85
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:47,399
it's almost like uh our our breathing conveys the

86
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,158
love to uh all the parts of our own

87
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:59,278
body radiating outwards

88
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:15,200
just the Deep honoring of the condition of sentience

89
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:26,320
that we can be at EAS and we can suffer

90
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:41,440
how completely this is shared across space and

91
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:49,960
time all beings it's always been like this

92
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:17,520
in that love uh fear and all the

93
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:21,279
rest sort of just

94
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
melts

95
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

96
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

97
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
e e

98
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,159
knowing how deeply Our Lives intertwine

99
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:07,880
I undertake the training precept to protect

100
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
life

101
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

102
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,859
[Music]

103
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,080
e

104
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:59,080
okay so from uh from uh

105
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:06,039
tolto and AAR famous line all um all happy

106
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:12,120
families are alike but each unhappy family is unhappy

107
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:18,799
in its own way and in the Buddhist

108
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,720
tradition unhappiness maybe we say duk

109
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:31,440
suffering is charted quite meticulously the varieties of suffering

110
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:36,559
the three species of suffering

111
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:42,720
the um four types of of clinging the

112
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:50,320
hindrances the feathers the the the subtle Fe the OA cesas the subtle

113
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:56,679
feathers attachment to light a million ways to suffer the fever

114
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:05,720
dream of thirst that is gr and the the heart on fire of

115
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:11,000
hate the uh foggy bewildered

116
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:18,480
indecisiveness of delusion all these different ways of U

117
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,440
that we can suffer that we do

118
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:29,799
suffer But ultimately I I might might say it's the

119
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:37,720
reverse of Tolstoy suffering is suffering clinging is all

120
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:44,480
of the same piece it's the expression of

121
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:54,760
Freedom that is highly varied there's more you could say of our

122
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:01,398
personality in our freedom than there is in our

123
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:09,679
suffering your spontaneity and aliveness and and we could say

124
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:17,679
uniqueness is found not in your suffering but in your

125
00:32:19,399 --> 00:32:28,320
freedom and everyone who suffers uh a lot reminds me of everyone

126
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:35,080
else who suffers but everyone who is

127
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:41,000
free they seem free in their own distinctive

128
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,240
way and my pain you know it almost feels like oh

129
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:55,159
that's my brand you know that's so intimately me it's not

130
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:02,760
self same old story actually locks up

131
00:33:03,399 --> 00:33:09,679
our uniqueness Ben Lerner said uh nothing's

132
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:16,120
a cliche when you're living it nothing's a cliche when you're living

133
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:21,559
it and that says something important about suffering the kind of felt

134
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:28,320
distinctiveness of it part of what Baldwin was trying to explode in that

135
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,600
passage I shared but yeah the felt distinctiveness

136
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:41,240
of our suffering suffering feels so uniquely ours

137
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:47,639
so particular it could never be a cliche my heartache could never be a

138
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:54,279
cliche no no and we're so alone in it that's kind

139
00:33:54,279 --> 00:34:01,559
of the Hallmark of suffering in a way is sense of disconnection the sense of the

140
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:09,679
absence of empathic connection with oneself and we're divorced from others

141
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:16,960
and divorced from the sense of the shared human predicament it feels unique our pain

142
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:25,398
feels unique but it's not there's more of our particularity in

143
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:30,000
our in our freedom than there is in are

144
00:34:31,399 --> 00:34:36,520
suffering when I um when I meet people on the

145
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:41,839
path um you know in a retreat or talking

146
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:48,000
in some context I try to attune um to the particularity of their

147
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:56,200
heart the kind of shape of their heart mind and

148
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:02,520
uh you know was sort of yeah trying to use the Carl I think Carl Rogers

149
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:08,920
language to inhabit the world of the other as if it

150
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:15,640
were your own without losing the as if condition as if it were your own without

151
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:21,440
losing the as if condition and that empathic

152
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:28,000
Attunement sensing into the suffering it always maybe not always but

153
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:34,200
it almost always feels familiar kind of

154
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:42,880
familiar even if our lives have been very different even if one of our

155
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,800
experiences of suffering may be less intense more intense there's

156
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:55,920
some access some sense of uh sharing in

157
00:35:55,920 --> 00:36:03,079
the pain it feels familiar but

158
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:11,319
um it's your freedom that I find startling and

159
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,800
novel and it's very lovely to

160
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:26,520
um follow along in the lives of practitioners and um witness the kind of

161
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:33,000
growing freedom to follow along maybe over period of many

162
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:38,640
years and it's uh lovely and inspiring

163
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:44,960
because I'm often detecting some flavor of freedom

164
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,319
in you that I don't have that feels new

165
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:58,280
novel to me and it's a delight to to become the

166
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:05,838
student you might not even know when it's happening for me but it

167
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:13,560
is there is this Noble truth about the cessation of suffering the complete

168
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:19,280
fading away and cessation of this craving to abandonment and

169
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:27,599
relinquishment getting free and becoming independent of of it

170
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:33,800
and we notice that the uh the budha speaks much more about what we're freed

171
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:38,200
from than how Freedom

172
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:46,400
manifests right the Buddha speaks much more about being freed from greed ha and delusion but what does that look like

173
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:53,079
would that be like a super chill unemotional person would

174
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:58,520
what what would that what would one's ethical life look like that's freed from

175
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:04,200
greet and delusion would they be awkward or funny

176
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:11,720
or what what what would you look like

177
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:20,400
freed some of these species of pain freed up of some of your

178
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:28,560
Neurosis we talk about no self and not uh but um other Traditions talk about

179
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:35,520
true self and I don't know if this is reasonable

180
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:40,880
but um maybe we can say that

181
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:46,400
um suffering involves the false self in some

182
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,599
way the alienation and

183
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,960
performative negotiation of a role the melodrama

184
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,880
of suffering me as the protagonist center of it

185
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:13,920
all the psychoanalyst um winot uh Associates the the true self

186
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,960
with the spontaneous

187
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:28,720
gesture and it's our spontaneous gesture that feels distinctive

188
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:37,880
that feels um uniquely ours everything else somehow feels like some weird dress

189
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:45,040
rehearsal our suffering feels um

190
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:51,960
performative and it's only in our freedom that we actually express ourself

191
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:59,280
at a deeper level a freedom in other words frees you

192
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:09,200
up to be yourself to express your particularity your aliveness the

193
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:16,000
spontaneousness spontaneity right and so as we become more free as

194
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:23,319
we begin to shed at least in moments some of the greed ha

195
00:40:23,319 --> 00:40:28,560
delusion um our personality

196
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:35,440
uh is does not undergo some radical transformation but it's freed up of some

197
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:42,359
of its compulsivity the personality can

198
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:50,440
can be a kind of um yeah an appendage of the the Neurosis

199
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:57,599
it's like performative leakiness

200
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:07,800
and we start to let go and what's left in the let the kind of wake of letting

201
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:14,240
go is um is your own spontaneity your

202
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,000
particular goodness your quirkiness your

203
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:27,760
unselfconscious particularity and that

204
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:30,160
what's

205
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:39,319
distinctive the uh Buddhist

206
00:41:39,319 --> 00:41:44,880
um teacher therapist um Bruce Tiff

207
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,520
um said something like um I treat every

208
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:59,800
patient as if they're already enlightened just pretending not to

209
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:06,760
be it's very um sort of touched by that

210
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:14,440
and reflecting on that treat all PE patients you know as if

211
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:22,440
they're already enlightened just pretending not to be you know and

212
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:31,359
um yeah how do we attune to the dimensions of freedom in

213
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:37,800
ourselves in others how do we actually sense the the particularity the

214
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:45,520
uniqueness of the other that is offered by the portal of their own

215
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:51,000
freedom and um and how do we as we practice as

216
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,640
we uh Grow Let Go how how is it that we

217
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:02,680
become more uh uniquely

218
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:08,920
ourselves so I offer this for your consideration and

219
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:16,200
