1
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,919
so um let's begin hi hi formerly hi welcome

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:13,360
hello hello everyone it's good to be with you in uh

3
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:21,680
[Music] if not space but at least time to see you to feel your presence

4
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:29,279
so for today's practice what i'd like to invite us to engage with today

5
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:36,559
is the practice of forgiveness practice of forgiveness i've mentioned

6
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,239
it before here we've practiced with it before but there's a particular type of

7
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:48,640
forgiveness i'd like to invite us to engage with today practice with

8
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:54,079
and and um often

9
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,160
the practice of forgiveness is um [Music] there are different aspects dimensions

10
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:06,080
to it one is forgiving ourselves

11
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:11,520
the other aspect the other dimension is forgiving others

12
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:17,840
the third is forget asking forgiveness from others

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:24,799
and the fourth one which is a very interesting and perhaps in a way

14
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:33,118
symbolic or or maybe i would say it's a wisdom practice it's a wisdom practice

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,840
is offering forgiveness to causes and conditions to

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,399
circumstances for the way they are for

17
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:52,640
our not being able to meet the suffering of the world forgiving the world for giving

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:59,040
just the sense of general forgiveness it's it's quite a deep and beautiful

19
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:05,200
beautiful practice let me um read the the phrase actually we're going

20
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,160
to focus on this one and this actually this way of putting it is due to larry yang to give him credit

21
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,840
so the phrase is in any way that i have been unable to be with

22
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,120
and respond skillfully to the pain and suffering of our world

23
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:30,480
my own pain and that of others may i come to accept suffering confusion

24
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,040
pain ignorance to be part of the journey my own journey and the journey of others

25
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,319
i offer forgiveness for the way that things are and have been

26
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,000
as much as possible in this moment it's quite

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,160
a radical way to do forgiveness practice it's not

28
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,920
it's you know it's beautiful of course to to ask for forgiveness say in any way

29
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,200
that i've harmed you knowingly unknowingly by thought actions words i

30
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:12,159
ask for your forgiveness this is a phrase when we ask for forgiveness or offering forgiveness to ourselves or

31
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,440
offering it to others but this fourth way which is such a

32
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,599
radical way of offering forgiveness to the causes and conditions

33
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:29,840
in the world that this is the way things are

34
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,400
giving rise to my pain my suffering and the pain and suffering and of others to

35
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,000
offer forgiveness acceptance release

36
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,000
judgment for the cause and conditions as they are

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,040
especially as these days there is

38
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,879
global turmoil and there is global pain so many of our

39
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:06,239
siblings in this world are living now in a war zone um of course

40
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,280
there are many wars at any time going on and people

41
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,759
living under oppression especially now especially now [Music]

42
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:24,000
in the world stage so can we can we bring can we relate

43
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,360
practice of compassion is one way to relate to what is happening and we've done that the past

44
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:34,720
few days past few times and happier and this

45
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:43,280
radical radical practice of forgiveness is another way it's radical forgiveness

46
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,000
might be completely new to you you might have practiced in this way all good

47
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:57,040
let's explore together let's see what arises again forgiving the cause and conditions

48
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:04,960
responsible that have come to co-create the conditions of the world

49
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:11,919
for our own suffering our inability to engage and other people's suffering so it's a

50
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:17,360
radical practice of of forgiveness

51
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,000
there is both the wisdom practice coming together with compassion practice

52
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:31,120
the marriage of both so so without further ado i'd like to

53
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:39,120
invite us to engage with this practice together as always we start

54
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,880
ah we start by landing by arriving

55
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:51,039

awareness diffused with kindness with compassion

92

00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,400
i offer forgiveness for the way that things are

112
00:20:54,400 --> 00:21:03,080
and have been as much as is possible in this moment

113
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:10,240
i offer forgiveness for the way that things are

114
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:18,400
and have been as much as is possible in this moment

115
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:25,320
offering as much as is possible not forcing

116
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,640
me

117
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:26,600
in any way that i've been unable to be with and respond skillfully

118
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,240
to the pain and suffering of our world my own pain and that of others

119
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,000
may i come to accept it to be part of the journey my own

120
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,880
journey and the journey of others i offer forgiveness for the way that

121
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:52,919
things are and have been as much as is possible in this moment

122
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:46,360
offering forgiveness to the causes and conditions

123
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:51,200
for the way that things aren't have been

124
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,240
not within my control not me and mine

125
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:11,759
as much as i would like control

126
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,520
or have the illusion of it

127
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:25,760
sometimes offering forgiveness

128
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:33,679
everything that has led to this

129
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,799
as much as possible

130
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,919
and know that it takes courage and strength to forgive

131
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:52,480
it's not out of weakness that we forgive we engage with forgiveness

132
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:58,480
it's from a place of strength courage letting go

133
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:06,120
wisdom and compassion that we engage with forgiveness

134
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,240
and if there are challenging states in the mind right now

135
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:45,840
in the body pain boredom distraction can you offer

136
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:52,120
forgiveness to the causes and conditions for that

137
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:57,520
and if there are an army of self-judgment such men says self-judgmental thoughts

138
00:29:57,520 --> 00:30:04,278
arising can you offer forgiveness to that

139
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:11,039
even though i may wish for things to be different this is how they are

140
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:17,440
right now i offer forgiveness

141
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:24,120
to how things are as much as possible in this moment

142
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:57,600
notice if there's a sense of release freedom letting go

143
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,880
not hanging on that feels lighter

144
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:08,679
more ease arises

145
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,840
this

146
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:20,679
do

147
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:39,760
as we bring this practice period

148
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,480
to a close notice notice if there has been any moment of

149
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:54,079
release of letting go of holding on resentment

150
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:58,720
or a sense of strength wisdom

151
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:05,200
feeling empowered ah

152
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:08,078
in letting go

153
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:20,800
and offering together we offer all these moments of release goodness

154
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:27,200
personal entrance and transcendent freedom

155
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:34,640
collectively for the benefit of all beings everywhere including ourselves

156
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,160
may all beings be free

157
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:51,000
may all beings including ourselves be free

158
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,838
thank you for your practice friends

159
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:23,839
so so much can come up in this practice it's a bit

160
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:30,160
of a perhaps complicated practice i see richard's hand shut up what's up

161
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:36,320
richard how you doing

162
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:43,920
um i don't see how you can blame nature and since you can't blame nature

163
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,640
i don't seems irrational to forgive nature

164
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:56,480
yeah yeah it's it's not so much

165
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,599
nature in this way it's yeah this feels like a paradoxical

166
00:37:01,599 --> 00:37:10,000
practice in a way it's let me put it this way many times

167
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:16,560
when we are in a state of ignorance we're angry at the causes and conditions

168
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:23,280
in the world like we take them personally right we take causes and conditions

169
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:28,720
personally so it's not nature i would shift your that word with causes and

170
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:34,480
conditions we take it personally and we're angry

171
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:41,280
and this way of relating to this practice opens up the possibility of wisdom actually

172
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,680
seeing the codependent arising of the causes and conditions and not take it

173
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:53,839
personally it's really a way to enter into that practice through

174
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:59,200
the forgiveness practice there's so many ways to practice for to enter into this

175
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:05,599
wisdom of seeing causes and conditions as impersonal they just are

176
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:12,800
and this is one way it might work for you it may not work for you but it's a way to enter into this practice in this

177
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:19,838
way thanks richard

178
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,680
and let's see a request to paste larry's phrase in the chat

179
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:38,240
let's see sometimes chat has a limited size i'm gonna try that and if it

180
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:44,279
doesn't come through here we go let's try uh

181
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:52,480
i think it all came through look at that and then uh bill says i'm aware that

182
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:57,760
resentment is unhealthy but part of me still wants to cling to it to not

183
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:03,359
forgive it's difficult to let go yeah yes i so appreciate

184
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:09,040
bill you sharing that and the authenticity and vulnerability and

185
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:15,040
saying that because that is part of the process of letting go it's part of

186
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:22,400
the process of forgiveness it doesn't happen overnight often first we realize like okay i'm not

187
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,240
ready to let go i want to hang on to this even though i know it hurts me i don't i'm not quite

188
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:35,200
ready it's okay the fact that you're observing and realizing that

189
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,320
see it clearly have kindness towards yourself that part of you that is very

190
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:45,599
hurt or upset and can you have kind can you have

191
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,280
kindness can you have kindness towards that part that is health that is

192
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:57,040
hurting it's like you're um [Music] it's it's likened

193
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:02,880
um to um the story of in asia

194
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:10,400
in order to catch a monkey it is said that that a catcher's poachers take an empty

195
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,319
coconut they put a hole in it and they put something yummy inside

196
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:22,640
and as the the poor animal reaches inside and grabs something yummy

197
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,079
the fist you know can't set itself free anymore that's that's the trap

198
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:34,720
if if the animal lets go opens its hand then it can open the hand and be set

199
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:42,240
free but the fist the fist so get to see get to see that the fist is keeping you

200
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,599
trapped and just have kindness have kindness towards not being able to let go

201
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:52,200
slowly slowly slowly

202
00:40:55,040 --> 00:41:01,680
let's see hilda says i noticed that when i focused on forgiving gratitude followed soon

203
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,280
after gratitude for the learning opportunity through difficulty oh beautiful thank

204
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:14,640
you for sharing that hilda so connected yeah these these practices so connected

205
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:20,720
uh private question [Music] thank you can you point to more

206
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,079
teachings about how not to take things personally oh

207
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,440
that is a bigger container that's basically pointing to the

208
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:37,200
teachings so many teachings but but that's really um

209
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:44,079
the teachings on impersonality or not self or anata it's

210
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:49,400
impersonal things are so impersonal and the way to see

211
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:56,079
impersonality there's so many different ways but one way as i was talking about it this morning

212
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:02,160
at 7 00 am subbing for gail this week is through the practice of seeing impermanence

213
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:07,200
through saying arising and passing away all things are impermanent internally

214
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:14,480
externally and that's one way through seeing uh impersonality and not taking things

215
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,240
personally and there are many many other teachings so that's what i point you to it's it's

216
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:26,319
uh it's a whole canon of teachings on that but that's a little pointer here

217
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,280
yeah and uh one more reflection i share before we turn

218
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:38,560
richard on youtube says thank you for sharing the light of this practice it was very

219
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,760
healing to me as i sat in the space and stillness at the end of the day i

220
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:50,160
found i had been avoiding pain both my own my own and

221
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:55,440
and of the world and yet in this forgiveness able to hold it hold in

222
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,200
kindness all of it the fullness of being beautiful thank you for that

223
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:08,000
reflection beautiful at the end of the day sitting in the stillness turning towards the pain and seeing that

224
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,440
it's possible to hold it in the fullness of being and kindness

225
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:19,119
beautiful so

226
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,800
so holding it all with kindness

227
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:31,119
holding our pain those of others and um

228
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:38,400
and before we turn to small groups uh kristin messaged me personally that

229
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:43,599
her grandma secret uh passed away last weekend so

230
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:49,440
so holding holding with meta and compassion all beings

231
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,960
ourselves and others are suffering they're suffering

232
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:03,040
people who are near dear to us people who we don't know in war zones and sending compassion and meta to all

233
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,720
beings and their suffering including

234
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:14,640
kristen her family and her grandma who's passed away so

235
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,839
so with that let us turn to each other to small

236
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:27,520
groups a small sangha to hold each other with with care with compassion

237
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:35,520
and i'd like to um invite us today to start with 15 seconds

238
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,119
of silent uh silent compassion for ourselves for each other

239
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:47,280
and then you can share as much as you wish as little as you wish maybe holding

240
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:52,560
witness is what's appropriate for you and please take care

241
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:59,920
of yourself take care of others in the small groups it's a very tender space

242
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:05,520
what is shared is always private is always confidential

243
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,960
it's actually double confidentiality not only do you not speak out or blurt out

244
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:17,280
what someone has shared even speaking back in the group saying oh you

245
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:25,200
said blah blah blah like no no no no just be with your own experience speak from your own experience please

246
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,440
not about other people's experience and if if you notice if there's any

247
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:38,240
feeling of lack of safety and that's happening please kindly remind each other that yeah just please stay with

248
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:44,880
let's let's stay with our own experience take care of yourself take care of each other stay with your

249
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,560
own experience confidentiality is important in fact double confidentiality

250
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:57,680
not only do not say it to even to them in the group but of course outside you

251
00:45:57,680 --> 00:46:04,560
never speak share anything that you spoke with you know things that people spoke to you and you

252
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:12,480
don't even bring it out outside with them oh you said that thing that day no it's just speak from your own experience

253
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,680
i feel the need to remind all of our us of these ways of taking care of

254
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:24,000
ourselves each other as community agreements as we enter the tender space

255
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,200
of the small groups okay so please take care of yourselves

256
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,480

nikki for tonight i just wanted to share that in my experience of

265
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:44,559
forgiving the causes and conditions i felt that perhaps i'm worthy of forgiveness too

266
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:49,920
and the sort of universal nature of that

267
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:56,160
forgiveness and compassion uh kind of let me in the gate

268

good evening as i shared with um in my group i

274
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,880
took the eight precepts today as i usually do on the

275
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:46,960
new moon and [Music] i was wound up killing a gnat

276
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,559
and it really kind of bothered me and has bothered me all day long

277
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:57,760
and um i think

278
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:03,200
this particular meditation really help settle me down

279
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:09,040
about that experience um so thank you

280
00:49:10,240 --> 00:49:18,720
thank you sheila i am so touched i am moved the just the tender the tender beauty

281
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:26,640
and sensitivity of your sila of your ethics of taking the eight precepts of vow today on the

282
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:32,160
new moon and just it's it's beautiful to be

283
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:38,800
to be bothered right there's a beauty to that and as as of course there is

284
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:45,119
there is the what's called hirian or tapa there's this beauty of oh gosh i don't want to harm i don't want to harm

285
00:49:45,119 --> 00:49:51,920
and yet it can go too far to become self-harm and that's what i'm hearing you so i both honor the beauty of that

286
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,599
intention and i also see and appreciate you naming oh yeah well actually it was

287
00:49:57,599 --> 00:50:05,599
a little self-painful and ah it's it's wonderful to afford forgiveness to myself too as well

288
00:50:05,599 --> 00:50:10,800
as all beings and the cause and conditions to that led to this accidental

289
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:17,839
harm so thank you that was so beautiful thank you and last word we gave to catherine i

290
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:22,960
realized i actually don't fully know how forgiveness feels or function

291
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:29,760
functions in me so grateful to have that shown to me i feel there will be healing in that exploration oh that is beautiful

292
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:35,040
thank you catherine such a beautiful insight and and and

293
