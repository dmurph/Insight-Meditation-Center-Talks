1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:06,299
great well hello hello and welcome to happy hour everyone

2
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,400
um I've missed you very much it's so nice to be back in Sangha and practicing

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,279
together so so for today's practice

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,320
um gosh so many different themes what to um

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,519
I think I'd like to explore a theme of simple meta together and maybe not say

6
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,860
so much ahead of time but just practice together take more time to practice and

7
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,960
and explore different themes I have no

8
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,899
doubt different themes from my travel in Southeast Asia especially in the um

9
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:52,559
uh as I was mentioning earlier Thailand is a Buddhist country and many temples

10
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,600
lots of Buddhist statues and just there's a sense of wholeheartedness there's a sense of kindness Good Will

11
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,660
and interactions that just it drenches it feels like it permeates the the

12
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:11,159
culture which is so lovely and nourishing so um so I'm sure some of the warmth uh

13
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,220
will come through in the practice so so let's just sit together let's let's begin

14
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:25,259
foreign arriving in your seat taking your seat

15
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:32,479
on this Earth on this planet of ours

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,799
aching your seat on the Earth here I am

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,400

18
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:57,259
connected to the seat to this earth

19
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:07,880
stable and moving even if we're actually hurtling in space on this Earth

20
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,680
rotating around the Sun rotating around this axis but it feels like we're still

21
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:23,120
ah can we be still here in this moment feel the Stillness

22
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:31,080
together with all the movement in the space movement in our lives all

23
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:37,080
the movement that has been is happening right now will be

24
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:43,379
and in the middle of all the movement open our bodies Our Hearts our minds to

25
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:45,920
Stillness

26
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:59,599
holding the duality of movement and Stillness

27
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:07,879
an opening leaning into the Stillness to the groundedness

28
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:37,519

29

letting the breath move through the body

35
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:06,600

48
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:04,880
so delicious just to be just to Simply Be

49
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:10,400
this being human foreign

50
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,880
foreign

51
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,319
foreign

52
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:31,940
let the breath be nourishing calming

53
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:38,300
soothing to the body to the heart

54
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,160
foreign

55
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,959
what a gift to be able to practice

56
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,779
you have met the Dharma in this life

57
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:17,720
to sit and be breathed by the breath

58
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:29,459
to realize if the mind is thinking to know that

59
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:34,220
and cultivate kindness in that moment

60
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:42,120
I'm not expecting that you will be focused and concentrated and still the

61
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:50,279
whole time if that happens great but Minds wander it's okay can we be kind no

62
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:54,920
matter what can we be kind

63
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,180
and if we can't be kind

64
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,180
and we'd be accepting to be accepting be gentle

65
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:10,519
with lack of kindness that might arise

66
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:18,200
can we be compassionate to that

67
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,480
and the lack of kindness if any

68
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:38,000
knowing that we are doing our best

69
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,220
in every moment and cultivating

70
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,720
as best we're able to

71
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,480
foreign

72
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:47,040
foreign

73
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:52,880
and I like to invite us to explore

74
00:14:53,720 --> 00:15:01,699
receiving kindness and Sharing kindness

75
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:12,480
so I'll invite or experiment it happened to receiving

76
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:19,380
kindness which expands the capacity of our heart

77
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:23,540
not just to receive but to give

78
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:34,100
so feeling yourself feeling yourself sitting

79
00:15:34,579 --> 00:15:40,079
connections to the Earth through your feet sit bones

80
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:49,040
your hands touching each other or your lap breath moving through your body

81
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:55,040
stable now

82
00:15:57,779 --> 00:16:03,680
I'd like to invite you to imagine as you're sitting

83
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,980
you're together with other human circle of people

84
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:16,680
who are kind endowed with mitta you've been practicing mitta for a long

85
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:19,040
time

86
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:29,940
mutiny situation let's say in a foreign country where you don't understand the language

87
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:38,579
so you can't really communicate but but this human beings other humans

88
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:44,360
are trying to help you support you maybe you need help you need directions

89
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:54,740
and you feel you let yourself be supported you feel their meta you let yourself be supported

90
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:10,140
you can imagine maybe a situation like let's say you're in a store and you've spilled

91
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,660
I'd say some fruit and people come with kindness and help you put it back

92
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:22,500
or you fall in and they help you get up or whatever it might be there's a sense of kindness and you let

93
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:29,480
yourself without being embarrassed without any embarrassment

94
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:38,220
human beings with mitta let yourself be supported

95
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:46,080
because receiving kindness receiving kindness allowing yourself to

96
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:53,220
receive kindness it's like receiving a gift graciously

97
00:17:53,220 --> 00:18:00,600
you don't turn the gift around or hurl It to the Ground

98
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:06,200
it's gracious it's a way of

99
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,720
rewarding The Giver to receive the gift so let

100
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:18,500
in your mind let the gift of kindness be received

101
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:37,080
you may be your working with a map and you're confused and somebody unasked comes and supports

102
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:43,860
you ask you if you're lost and tries to help you find your direction just support

103
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:51,980
offered this land of beings who've practiced meta

104
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:58,220
kindness let yourself receive your mind's eye

105
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:12,600
and maybe you're work here is to receive without an

106
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:19,799
embarrassment because receiving is giving

107
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:25,080
so can you give meta by receiving

108
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:32,520
that's the Crux of this invitation can you gratitude your smile of

109
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:39,860
appreciation be your gift not shame or embarrassment

110
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:05,160
we'll come back to the scenario in a moment again but now let's switch

111
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:12,179
now you are a part of this community maybe you don't communicate with words

112
00:20:12,179 --> 00:20:19,919
you don't understand someone's language but they're lost you want to help them you want

113
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:26,460
to support someone as an expression of your kindness of your Humanity

114
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:34,559
it's clear there fumbling with a map they don't know where to go without being asked you ask

115
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:42,440
them can I help you or with sign language try to figure out where they're going and help them

116
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:47,480
the act of matter an act of kindness

117
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:56,840
see yourself giving meta in this way

118
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:05,840
the sense of satisfaction you've helped one person or helping one human being

119
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:16,220
was not so different from you you just want to be happy

120
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,260
nor they have spilled say a bag of apples or something

121
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:30,020
you go and you help them pick them up you comfort them you smile

122
00:21:33,299 --> 00:21:37,158
the random act of kindness

123
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:47,480
you don't judge them they're doing their best

124
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:10,158
or maybe you see someone

125
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:19,440
walking on the street and you're walking too the same direction maybe they have

126
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,740
you can see that they're wearing a splint they have a hand injury and they're trying fumbling with an umbrella

127
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:29,480
and it's just started to rain

128
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:38,159
you stop maybe you stop smilingly in this scenario you get the umbrella from them you open

129
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:44,820
it for them and with a smile you hand it back to them and you keep walking with a smile you're

130
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,340
smiling they're smiling random act of kindness

131
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:08,780
no judgment just make up random act of kindness

132
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:26,760
how easy it is the care to notice what's needed

133
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:34,220
to notice what's needed to take a step to care to share

134
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:46,340
not questioning not judging yourself or others

135
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:55,159
random act of matter

136
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:03,240
maybe in your heart you do say may you be well may you be safe from the elements

137
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:08,960
may you be happy may you be healthy

138
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:12,140
may you have ease

139
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:28,158
how good it feels to give kindness

140
00:24:36,299 --> 00:24:41,539
well now switch again to the other scenario

141
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:50,299
and again it's so impersonal right you can be the person who needs support

142
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:56,899
and people stop and support you help you offer kindness

143
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:02,780
not even needing to speak or exchange words

144
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:08,720
let yourself receive now be in the receiving end

145
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,700
feel supported let your body relax

146
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:34,039
seeing others Humanity letting them see your Humanity

147
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:41,299
maybe imagine the scenario maybe from your own life

148
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:50,000
maybe in your own City or maybe traveling

149
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:05,240
let your heart relax let your body relax

150
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,179
let yourself receive in your mind's eye

151
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:17,059
better random acts of kindness

152
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:38,059
maybe you imagine again yourself holding a map foreign

153
00:26:38,419 --> 00:26:43,500
carrying bags of groceries puts them down

154
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:48,779
and comes to support you where are you going are you lost

155
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,340
random act of kindness

156
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:16,879
now imagine yourself in your hometown or City

157
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:25,260
supporting helping others whether

158
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:31,580
they don't speak their language or they do it's random acts of kindness

159
00:27:33,659 --> 00:27:41,100
maybe letting someone who's in a rush seemingly Rush Nina Rush go ahead of you

160
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:49,700
the line at the grocery store if you're not in a hurry yourself

161
00:27:54,779 --> 00:28:00,840
offering kindness with a smile knowing you've made

162
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:06,500
one person's day a little better just a little brighter

163
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:26,220
or say you're maybe sitting on a plane across the aisle there's

164
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:32,039
a mother with a screaming child she's agitated or embarrassed trying to

165
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:38,880
quiet the child instead of feeling

166
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:46,020
upset rolling your eyes you Comfort the mother yes it's hard it is

167
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:53,000
hard to travel with children it's okay it's all right it's hard

168
00:29:54,080 --> 00:30:00,919
extending kindness so many opportunities

169
00:30:16,679 --> 00:30:21,299
not missing opportunities strangers

170
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,440
colleagues friends family

171
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:43,740
radiating matter may all beings everywhere including

172
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:46,100
myself

173
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:57,080
be safe from inner and outer arm

174
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:05,658
be happy be healthy have ease

175
00:31:09,559 --> 00:31:14,419
radiating kindness internally to yourself

176
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,380
let it radiate out

177
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:26,039
60. knowing that this kindness first touches you

178
00:31:26,039 --> 00:31:31,220
first soothes you these rays of kindness

179
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:45,620
but if we didn't let as business we could

180
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:53,100
the opportunities that we run into to be kind go by and of course we won't capture all of

181
00:31:53,100 --> 00:32:00,360
them we can't it's okay but turning our heart to receive

182
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:06,320
kindness and gave kindness

183
00:32:13,679 --> 00:32:18,919
that soothing calming for the heart

184
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:23,600
enlivening for the mind

185
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:42,480
and for the last couple minutes just breathing breathing again breaking out

186
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:47,539
breathing in kindness breathing out kindness

187
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:56,240
and good will may I be well

188
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:00,740
may all beings be well

189
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:09,679
may I be well breathing in May all beings be well breathing out

190
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:18,980
receiving and giving

191

welcome back Ricky um I thought it was um I thought it was interesting um the way

208
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:11,280
you when you mentioned you know that like accepting thanks and accepting you

209
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,220
know the gifts from the other people is you know kindness in and of itself

210
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:24,260
you know and there certainly have been plenty of times in my life you know where I'm like no you know and

211
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:30,000
frequently I have like thought afterwards you know oh you know maybe you know maybe I shouldn't have said no

212
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:37,079
you know and I you know I think you know I'm hopefully coming up here will you know put me on better footing make me

213
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:43,980
better prepared the next time that happens yeah yeah thanks Neil thanks so much for

214
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:51,660
sharing that and and also thanks for highlighting that aspect of of gracious receiving is a

215
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:57,660
huge gift it's a gift really graciously receiving it gives other people joy to

216
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:04,079
be able to be kind and to be able to help um and maybe comes up sometimes so we

217
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:11,640
don't want to trouble them or whatever it is and sometimes it's just yes thank you it's it can be such a breakthrough

218
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:18,480
moment such a lovely moment of connection and giving and receiving so thanks for highlighting that aspect of

219
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,560
it so important yeah yeah I I'll maybe I'll say one more thing I I've also found myself sometimes

220
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,780
you know somebody wants to offer you know offering a gift some or something whatever it is you're offering something

221
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:38,640
and I'm like oh oh I'm in trouble you and I realize well actually wait pause yes I accept so it's it's okay in that

222
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:44,099
moment to to shift and change too but you know as you said it's the practice

223
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:49,560
that that inclines you to realizing yes what am I doing I'm saying I'm not

224
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:54,900
giving the opportunity to be kind and generous so so the more we practice meta

225
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:02,220
the more it gives us that moment of pause like yes yes this is okay let's expand my heart to receive and allow

226
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:08,040
them to give so yeah it continues to be practice Yeah so

227
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:14,760
thank you for that yeah yeah any other reflections

228
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:19,859
questions comments Eileen

229
00:38:19,859 --> 00:38:26,099
hi Nikki welcome back to YouTube and me I have I've been away from here I've been working a lot but um

230
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:31,800
what what came to my mind is when I'm on a zoom call with people from asanga it's

231
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:39,000
pretty easy for me to do meta for all the little boxes that I see of all the people or in the breakout room too

232
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:47,220
um and also when I'm teaching my classes but in a meeting with staff didn't even occur to me today it was very tense and

233
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:53,460
switching to The Meta practice pivoting like that was really hard because I brought that kind of tense

234
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:58,800
energy to it so maybe with practice so it'll

235
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,940
get easier no matter what the situation I see yes thank you yes thank you and and Eileen

236
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:13,260
thanks so much for bringing that up and I want to make an invitation so the invitation is if you notice you know

237
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:18,440
many times in a stressful situation if you notice right there so so we actually

238
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:24,180
I'm so glad you you uh pinpointed this particular situation the staff meeting

239
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:30,960
you know that it's stressful so so so and I trust that you'll have more meetings with your staff so great

240
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:38,160
perfect this is a great opportunity for practice yay so in the next meeting before you go into you know write your

241
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:45,900
yourself a note today post it and and put it today so that before that you have set this intention of oh this is an

242
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:53,940
opportunity that that gets me stressed and it's okay we we each have different occasions uh that that where this

243
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:59,640
happens and it's and um and and also from the practice you've done you know

244
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:06,119
that meta actually is an antidote to this kind of this this agitation so in

245
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:12,300
fact if you bring in metal just choose one person in the meeting just one person do matter for them and then

246
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:17,880
you'll find yourself oh wow look at this tension shift and change and then the

247
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:25,140
then it will be easier to do it for others but just start with one person on the screen how does that sound

248
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:30,720
yeah great thank you so much for raising raising this and so specific this is a

249
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:38,119
great opportunity for your practice I love it love it yeah uh Paige please

250
00:40:39,079 --> 00:40:45,359
hi thank you for so much for for your for for this evening

251
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:52,200
um and I was thinking as you're talking about traveling and the kindnesses that people do just automatically and just

252
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:58,440
how how grateful and just what a wonderful um approach that is what a wonderful way

253
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:05,700
and um uh and um and I don't know I I guess I can't

254
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:14,160
really express it in my head but um just to keep doing that all the time you

255
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,640
know just everywhere just being so grateful for for just for the kindnesses that come up and

256
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:26,040
then and realizing um you don't have to go in with an informed

257
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:33,180
opinion or knowing anything just being open in trouble it's like everything's fine so it's just actually traveling

258
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:39,599
around um here for a while for three weeks and that same kind of thing where

259
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:44,760
just uh he's struggling with a bag or something and somebody you know picks it

260
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:52,279
up and just realized just how how wonderful it is that there are more people on the planet

261
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:56,539
welcome back

262
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:04,200
yeah so much kindness all around right and and we're a part of it we are part

263
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:12,240
of and we've done that we do that for others but to appreciate to turn our mind to it the more we appreciate it see

264
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,180
it and the more it inclines our mind to see and see it more in others and also

265
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:23,820
cultivated more in ourselves uh and and be that that support

266
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:31,920
um or others so yes thank you for that appreciate you sharing your experience also yeah and also I would say um it

267
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:39,960
would be interesting I I'll take this and say one thing else another point is also to to observe the times that

268
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:47,579
um we we don't stop to to be kind and that's okay too and and to to observe

269
00:42:47,579 --> 00:42:53,700
you know what are the things that get in the way uh often for many people when they're in their studies when people are

270
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:59,160
in a hurry when they're in a rush to get somewhere they they they don't stop to

271
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:06,660
help and support so see that observe that not judge but I get to know really have clear mind ones oh yeah I see that

272
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:12,780
happening okay so um or if if you don't feel safe or or or

273
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:20,220
if there's judgment or Rising like and those are things that one can become aware of little by little or maybe this

274
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:27,180
person doesn't need it or maybe you feel shy about help you know all those things you know those we can study we can have

275
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:34,380
mindfulness awareness and support them but um it's also I think what I'm trying to say is it's interesting to be aware of

276
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:40,980
not just when we uh help when we extend our metan and

277
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:47,339
also the times that we don't and what gets in the way again without judging ourselves but studying it what gets in

278
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:53,819
the way it's important too so dear ones I'd like to

279
00:43:53,819 --> 00:44:00,599
um invite us all now to engage with each other maybe maybe for tonight the little

280
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:05,880
conversation we'll have is uh stories stories of random acts of kindness maybe

281
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:11,760
travel stories if you have any where you've been supported in in the foreign

282
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:17,220
country or or maybe when you have supported others

283
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:22,319
um so um and and if not travel stories could

284
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:27,960
be uh just stories in your own town city just random acts of kindness It's So

285
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:35,099
uplifting to share these stories so what I'd like to invite in in the breakout groups tonight is on

286
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:40,920
let's let's go alphabetically and the first person will share you know one

287
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:46,920
story and the next person will share another little story just not a long 10 minutes but just like a minute or two

288
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:52,560
it's like this is what happened or maybe 30 seconds depending on how long your story is I I've already shared many

289
00:44:52,560 --> 00:45:00,180
stories tonight weaved them into the the um uh into the guided meditation and

290
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,220
