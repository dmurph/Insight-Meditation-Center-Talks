00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:08,960
so hello my friends and welcome i've posted near the top of the

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,040
chat the zoom link for today at 7 45 when we end and i'll post it again at the end

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,720
and it's i'll talk more about it at the end as well

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:27,599
so imagine that

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,640
you're going for a walk in the woods on a road that you've never been on

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,079
maybe a place you've never been and [Music]

7
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:43,760
someone gives you instructions of how to walk through this woods the instructions are

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:51,199
in this large wilderness area there is only one six foot dirt

9
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,399
path for you to walk on however there are lots of small little

10
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:04,239
paths that leave this large six foot wide path

11
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,960
stay on the wide path don't go off only walk on the white path

12
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:19,360
as you walk on this white path there might be all kinds of signs saying go this way

13
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:27,360
or that way pointing down some of the small side shoots side paths some of them will

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:33,520
say things like

15
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,560
easy way or you're going the wrong way go this way

16
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,759
or some signs will say you're not able to walk this path go

17
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:53,119
this way instead or some will say why don't you stop here

18
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:59,119
and debate what you're doing take this path to debate what you're doing

19
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,159
take this path to have doubt about what's in the world you're doing in the

20
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:10,239
forest take this path for questioning the authority

21
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,840
of anybody who knows what path you should be on and there's all these signposts that are

22
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,000
pointing you off and mostly these side paths take you to little spirals where you kind of go

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,800
right around and around in circles and and you're lucky if you manage to get out on the main road again

24
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,920
but the main road the six foot wide path just goes straight and as long as you

25
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,120
stay on that you're fine so the same thing happens in meditation

26
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,760
there is a wide road to walk and then there's all these other ideas and thoughts that

27
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:51,680
are pointing us in different directions take us a different direction and the instructions and mindfulness

28
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:59,840
practices stay on the main road don't get off and what is the main road

29
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,640
the main road is not uh erode literally

30
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,000
but the the way that we walk in mindfulness is we

31
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:17,440
acknowledge the primary thing we do is we

32
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,200
recognize the obvious thing that's happening in the moment

33
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,360
without believing it without pushing it away without being for it

34
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:35,280
without being against it just recognize there's a loud sound

35
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,200
just recognize the sound instead of well that's an interesting scratching on the wall maybe i should go

36
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,640
investigate that neighbor is having nice music i'll go over there and

37
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:53,200
listen with him it's just scratching sound music that's what's happening now

38
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,640
breathing that's what's happening now don't take the path that says maybe

39
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,040
there's a better way of breathing i'm a maybe my breathing is not the right kind of breathing and maybe i should

40
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,319
hyperventilate then i'll get concentrated these are all side tracks

41
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:16,000
off the main road which is simply to recognize i'm breathing my breathing is this way

42
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,919
there'll be thoughts that arise about am i doing the right thing if you take those road then you're off

43
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,720
the main track if you simply recognize

44
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,560
what's happening now is i'm questioning whether i'm doing the right thing then you're on the main road don't get

45
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,880
involved in those thoughts just recognize them so just recognize what's happening

46
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:46,960
that's the that's the main road stay on the main road one of the side roads is thinking about

47
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,080
what just happened a few seconds before that's a side

48
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:57,360
road thinking about what's going to happen oh if i just do this meditation practice

49
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,840
for another few minutes i'll get concentrated that's a side road just be present if you're not

50
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,960
concentrated then oh this is not being concentrated this is beginning to get some signs of

51
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,960
being settled no need to go down the road that says i wonder how long it will take until i get

52
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,199
concentrated so um thank you debbie stay on the main path

53
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:28,479
so that's the plan so if you could somehow uh

54
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,759
track for yourself the seven the you know then 20 minutes will stop um in case it goes on and off again

55
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:41,680
and then we will uh i'll try to fix it in between

56
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,720
okay thank you let's just sit quietly now

57
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:50,520
on the main road

58
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:52,400
so then as we come to the end of the sitting

59
00:23:54,799 --> 00:24:00,559
the things that we learn what we learn from staying on the main road

60
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:06,960
is how to just stay present for what's in front of us what's here

61
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,240
and now and obvious

62
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:17,840
and sometimes there are other people who are standing in front of us we're with

63
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:24,880
and the ability to have them be the road or meeting them being present for them

64
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:33,200
where we take them in we see them clearly in their humanity

65
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:40,399
see them clearly in their capacities for suffering and for happiness

66
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,640
we see them with our hearts

67
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:52,799
and the main road is just to see and allow that to gently affect us

68
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:58,400
independent of the side roads of i need to take care of them i need to

69
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,679
get away this is too much

70
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:11,039
what can i get from this person will the person accept me or reject me

71
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:20,000
to be able to be present on the main road with others is one of the great gifts we give them and give the world

72
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:26,480
and give ourselves to be present

73
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:32,400
to see what's here in front of us clearly is there a

74
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:38,520
stirring of care of love of kindness

75
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,600
may all beings be happy

76
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,840
may all beings

77
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:59,679
be safe may all beings

78
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:07,640
be peaceful and may all beings be free

79
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:19,000
[Music] so

80
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:32,240
[Music] the last of these

81
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:39,600
hindrances is usually called doubt but it involves a world of uh

82
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,919
uncertainty uh indus indecisiveness um

83
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:51,440
and confusion about things and uh

84
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:58,559
and the opposite of this kind of doubt confusion and certainty is i think of it as trust

85
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:03,600
and for practice of meditation um it's trusting the main road

86
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,720
that uh the main road is this wide road that if you stay on

87
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:16,400
the wide road you're on the track but when you take a lot of those short little side paths that go off the little

88
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:23,919
thin narrow side paths that go off from the big wide road then you go off into the thickets of the

89
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:30,080
jungles the woods and the wilderness where you may not come back so quickly or

90
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:36,320
takes you back you know just just put you in circles or

91
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:42,080
as you're wandering around for a long time before you can come back to the main road

92
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:47,120
but trusting the main road of practice that uh just show up just be present for

93
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:53,919
this be present for this be present for this and um and uh when

94
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:01,120
the mind starts going down the side path uh remembering oh that's a side path just to hear and one of the side paths

95
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,840
is um doubt confusion it's wondering what to do and what am i

96
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:14,960
supposed to put where am i going and am i able to do this is the right teaching what about this teaching of

97
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:20,159
of not-self and it doesn't make any sense the buddhists teach it and what do they mean by it and i have doubts about

98
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:27,039
it and so all these are kind of side paths the path to trust

99
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:32,240
is the path of just being present for this as as

100
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:39,760
it's kind of like the path arises as we step on it and so if we are looking beyond our next

101
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:46,240
step for the path then it's easy to get into a world of confusion and doubt

102
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,840
but if we trust that next step then the path arises the path appears

103
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:57,200
in the step with the step so and the steps are in mindfulness

104
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:03,679
practice is the simple being present for the obvious experience of the moment

105
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:09,440
the the recognition of it and so if there's a

106
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:14,480
anything that happens that okay this is happening this is happening this is

107
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:21,200
happening um and that uh and one of the forms of doubt and one of the side paths people

108
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:27,120
might take is well how then will i take care of myself how will i take care of the world if i'm just

109
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,039
so simplistically taking this moment this moment two answers to this

110
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:39,600
one is that the primary reference point where we're talking about right now is meditation

111
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,679
and how we are in meditation might be different how we are in daily life we're mindful in both

112
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:51,840
but in meditation that's where we can have this radical simplicity of just being with the obvious being

113
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,880
present for this this we don't have to solve the world's problems while we're in meditation we

114
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:03,520
want to solve our problems what we're doing in meditation how we're present for our experience

115
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:10,320
doesn't have to be directly connected to solving all the problems around us

116
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:16,240
but being present in meditation prepares us to be able to be wise

117
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:21,279
and considerate and kind in how we respond to things outside of

118
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:29,039
meditation so this ability to just keep it simple it also teaches us how much we

119
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:35,279
complicate things unnecessarily because the radical simplicity of meditation

120
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,799
it kind of highlights the complications highlights how we bear away

121
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:46,320
and so uh in when we go back into our daily life we're wiser about that we'll

122
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:51,840
notice the kinds of getting preoccupied in thoughts which are not useful and be

123
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:58,000
able to recognize the way to be in thought in a way to be that is useful and how we can engage in problem solving

124
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:04,080
if we need to and so um to have this deep trust just

125
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:10,320
be present just be present and certainly doubts uncertainties

126
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:16,559
hesitations confusions will arise and the path of mindfulness is in the

127
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:23,120
sati patana is simply to know oh this is confusion this is doubt this is uncertainty this

128
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:28,159
is vacillation this is a lack of commitment but this is

129
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:34,559
what it looks like this is what it is to see it arise to see it be present see it's absent

130
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:40,240
to see it as a hindrance or to um in meditation

131
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:47,840
it's a hindrance for continuing to walk on that main road um there could be

132
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,158
there could be all kinds of healthy doubts that we have in our life

133
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,398
discovery and there's doubts in daily life

134
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,919
there's the blinking and and there's doubts in daily life

135
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,080
now we have we have one uh this happens

136
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,519
quickly quickly then we'll switch over to zoom

137
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:36,240
so i'm back so i'll try to finish quickly and uh now and uh it's just um

138
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:42,559
um you know i just this is what's happening this is what we're present for and in a sense we're kind of in this

139
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:49,120
dharma mode here i am talking and meditating after the meditation but this is a time

140
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:54,480
to not make anything a problem and um we can have problems later we have to

141
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:59,519
address and certainly this will be an issue we'll look at and and um

142
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:06,480
and all that so um um there's uh

143
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,480
there's all kinds of um healthy doubts that we can have and healthy doubts are ones that uh

144
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:18,559
encourage us to look more deeply consider more deeply a question in an appropriate way

145
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:24,080
unhealthy doubts are the ones that keep us indecisive or confused or or

146
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,880
hesitant in a way that without the kind of forward leaning or forward going questioning and wondering

147
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,320
uh what's going on and is

148
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:43,039
so to be able to distinguish healthy and unhealthy but in in but in this kind of meditative way of

149
00:33:43,039 --> 00:33:48,640
satipatana is gives us an opportunity to see

150
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:53,760
the arising of it uh we can see it when it's not there we

151
00:33:53,760 --> 00:34:00,880
get it what it feel for the sense of trust and clarity when we're just staying on the on the main road

152
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:08,079
and also we can see um um uh how we can let go of it when it

153
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:14,079
comes because we don't have to debate it or justify it when we're meditating

154
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:19,200
uh we can trust the main path just be present just be

155
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:24,638
present just be present and uh and then we uh things like doubt

156
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:30,720
arise and pass and they're not our business they're just kind of we pause for them briefly maybe like with like

157
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:38,398
with the blinking of the video we have today and and then we continue on the path

158
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:44,158
so um thank you for this and uh thank you for hanging in

159
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:50,320
there with us and i think it's you know kind of wonderful that we have an issue like this that is

160
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:57,040
kind of doesn't we don't lose the connection more than a few moments and then we can just practice

161
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,640
the main path with it and continue
