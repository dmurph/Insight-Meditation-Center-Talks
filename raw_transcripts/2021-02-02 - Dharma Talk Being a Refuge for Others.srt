00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,920
chenzing han

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,120
and i know trenzying and i know

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,320
a lot of work went into writing this

18
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,000
book and pulling it all together

19
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:59,920
and on sunday afternoon february 28th

20
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,640
imc is sponsoring an event to discuss

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,520
the book

22
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,960
so everybody's invited to that and this

23
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,080
book is a part

24
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,600
memoir from chenzing

25
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,720
as well as it's a result of her research

26
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,040
and to the experience of asian american

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,200
buddhists and it's

28
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,960
quite touching so i can recommend this

29
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,200
book

30
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,439
and of course with the title of be the

31
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,040
refuge

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,759
um she discusses this or you know in

33
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:32,720
this

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,320
in the book and without giving away the

35
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,320
details of the book i'll say that

36
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,680
a person in the book

37
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,560
describes how they were to turn their

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,360
practice

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,680
toward being a refuge for others

40
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,159
there such a beautiful idea i think this

41
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,719
this kind of this act of generosity this

42
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,920
act of

43
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,040
recognizing the impact that we have on

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,320
others and this wish

45
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,759
to be a refuge for others

46
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,640
in some ways maybe that kind of

47
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,080
summarizes the buddhist practice

48
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,920
is to find a way in which we can be a

49
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,400
support for everybody

50
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,480
in some kind of way but in the book this

51
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,680
individual talks about creating a

52
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:31,280
space where people feel calm and

53
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,959
positive in a way that they are

54
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,599
taking care of each other rather than

55
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,400
creating

56
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,400
agitation sometimes

57
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,840
there's this um bonding through

58
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,800
mutual outrage i think uh kim allen i

59
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,239
heard her say that

60
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,080
and i recognized that there certainly

61
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,599
have been times in my life

62
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,800
when you know my friends were like yeah

63
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,319
and can you believe this

64
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,280
also and that oh my gosh and not only

65
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,800
that this and then we just kind of

66
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,080
rattle ourselves up more and more

67
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,360
but what is it to create a space where

68
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,560
people feel calm

69
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,840
and positive not by being pollyanna and

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,239
not

71
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:19,680
by denying what's happening

72
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,200
but to recognize that tremendous value

73
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,560
is there by

74
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,959
not creating conditions that makes

75
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:27,760
people more

76
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,040
agitated or more feeling

77
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,159
ill at ease or more worried or

78
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,120
anxious or whatever it might be

79
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,360
but to be a refuge in a way that to

80
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,440
create a space either

81
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,959
literal or metaphorically create a space

82
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:48,239
where people can feel

83
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,280
some well-being some calm and

84
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,080
positivity

85
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,560
and then in chenzine's book

86
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,200
this individual also talks about one way

87
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:01,840
to

88
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,959
be a refuge is to create communities

89
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,560
that are refuges for others

90
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,439
where people can find comfort and

91
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,239
well-being

92
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,799
and sometimes that's through affinity

93
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,799
groups

94
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:19,359
people coming together that maybe look

95
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,000
similar

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,600
or have similar beliefs or have

97
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:27,680
similar backgrounds similar ethnicities

98
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,039
similar experiences

99
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,960
similar preferences whatever it might be

100
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,199
similar ages so affinity groups

101
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,720
is one way we can help create a refuge

102
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,000
to help be a refuge is to either

103
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,560
create communities that perhaps don't

104
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,639
exist or if they do exist to show up in

105
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:51,680
a way

106
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,919
and that we can convert them into a

107
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,440
place that is a refuge

108
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,120
and of course it's not only affinity

109
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,800
groups there's all kinds of

110
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,400
kalianamita groups good spiritual

111
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,120
friends

112
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,479
and people that live in this similar

113
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,080
geographical area that before covid

114
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,759
would meet in person

115
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:18,720
to talk about the drama i'm imagining

116
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,600
many of them

117
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,039
are meeting online now

118
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,960
and for some of these programs we have

119
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:29,360
at imc we

120
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,240
kind of try to facilitate a little bit

121
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,600
uh the creation of home

122
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,120
groups which are kind of like this

123
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,680
kaliana meta groups these ideas

124
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,560
small community where people can

125
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,160
practice together and

126
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,800
discuss and explore different topics

127
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,479
and of course there's even these when

128
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:51,199
we're on the

129
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,639
zoom meetings i know for some teachings

130
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,720
that we do here at imc

131
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,960
with some of the programs that are on

132
00:05:58,960 --> 00:05:59,759
zoom

133
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:02,720
we break people up into breakout groups

134
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,520
you know maybe

135
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:06,639
two three four five six people and those

136
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,600
of course are also

137
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:11,199
kind of a little bit of a community

138
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,600
and what would it be like if we had this

139
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,960
idea that

140
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,080
kind of to be a refuge is to help

141
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:20,560
create a community wherever we might

142
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,080
find ourselves

143
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,360
where people can feel safe they can feel

144
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,960
some comfort and some ease

145
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,199
for us to have this movement of the

146
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,800
heart

147
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,039
to be inclusive and to be generous

148
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:41,600
with our attention and our time

149
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,600
so chenzinghan she describes this in her

150
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,240
book

151
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,639
be the refuge raising the voices of

152
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,000
asian american buddhists

153
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,680
there's all kinds of great stuff in that

154
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,199
book that's

155
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,280
but also we can look to see what do the

156
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:56,800
suit does have to say

157
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,560
what does it mean to be a refuge

158
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,599
for others we often associate this word

159
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,639
refuge with taking refuge

160
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,639
take refuge in the buddha dharma and the

161
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,240
sangha

162
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,479
not so much this idea of be a refuge

163
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,520
and there's a suta that's uh in the poly

164
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,639
canon

165
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,919
and it has a parallel that was also

166
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,080
preserved in chinese

167
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,280
and it talks about this idea of being a

168
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,960
refuge and

169
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,360
as is often the case or maybe even

170
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,800
always the case

171
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,319
that when there's a suta that's in the

172
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:38,240
poly canon and there's a parallel that's

173
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,080
got preserved in chinese

174
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,360
that there's differences between them

175
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,800
and so i'll be focusing on what

176
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,440
the part that's the same uh between

177
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,560
these two sutas

178
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,000
so in this suta the buddha says

179
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,520
to a brahmana it is

180
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,680
here brahman that you should bathe

181
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,879
to make yourself a refuge for all

182
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,240
beings it is here brahman that you

183
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,840
should bathe

184
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:18,720
to make yourself a refuge for all beings

185
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,680
so maybe we can unpack this a little bit

186
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:23,919
what is the buddha talking about

187
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:26,080
about bathing and making oneself a

188
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,638
refuge

189
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:31,120
so maybe i'll i'm start by saying this

190
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,839
expression make yourself a refuge

191
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,640
if um we look at the poly i can't read

192
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,719
chinese so i'm not sure exactly what it

193
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:40,640
says in the chinese but

194
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,159
for a look at the pali the translation

195
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:47,279
maybe more literally would be make

196
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:48,080
yourself

197
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,519
a place of safety or

198
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,640
make yourself make a sanctuary or

199
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:55,760
something like that

200
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,200
it's not the same word refuge

201
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,720
saurona that we um when we take refuge

202
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,800
in the buddha dharma sangha

203
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,360
but a number of english translators have

204
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,000
used this word

205
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,320
refuge and i rather like it so

206
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,680
this idea of

207
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:21,200
making yourself a refuge for all beings

208
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,480
so this idea of bathing comes

209
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
from the context of the suta as you

210
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:27,680
might imagine

211
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,560
so in the suta the buddha is with some

212
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,800
monastics and he sees in the distance

213
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,880
that there's a brahman

214
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,839
so a brahmin at this time and in this

215
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:38,880
setting

216
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:42,000
and this is um we could think of as a

217
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:42,800
priest

218
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,839
for the dominant religious tradition

219
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:48,320
at that time in ancient india so

220
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
somebody who was a

221
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,480
not only a practitioner but somebody who

222
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:53,680
was

223
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,200
um an upholder maybe we could say of the

224
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,040
tradition of the dominant religious

225
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,120
tradition at that time

226
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,160
which we might call brahmanism

227
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,200
and so the buddha

228
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,079
is with some monastics and he sees this

229
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:11,279
brahman

230
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,399
in the distance that's approaching him

231
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,360
and knowing that the brahman will

232
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,079
overhear

233
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,399
what the buddha is about to say the

234
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,360
buddha begins his talk

235
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,160
directed to his monastics but also kind

236
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,040
of directed towards this brahman

237
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:33,240
and he says that there are these

238
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,920
16 different types of impurities or

239
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,800
defilements in the mind

240
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,800
we can think of this impurities or

241
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,360
defilements we could think of this as

242
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,560
um one way that i is uh

243
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,079
i find helpful to think about that or

244
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,200
things that are extra like we don't need

245
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:55,760
them

246
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,399
they're not helpful and so for me that's

247
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:00,160
one way i like to think about it

248
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,200
defilement and impurity sometimes has

249
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:03,760
this

250
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,240
feeling of this puritanical

251
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,120
way of tightness or something like that

252
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,079
to some of the

253
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,000
associations we might have with these

254
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,839
words

255
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,360
i don't know if that was the

256
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,440
associations that were

257
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,480
um with these words in ancient india

258
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,519
but i like this idea of things that are

259
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,600
extra and that we don't need them

260
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,120
and that gives these 16

261
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,360
i'll go through this list don't worry

262
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,120
i'm not going to unpack them all or

263
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,560
anything like this but just to give you

264
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,920
a sense

265
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,760
what are these uh this list

266
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,200
covetousness and unrighteous greed

267
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,720
it will anger resentment

268
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:53,920
offensiveness contempt envy

269
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:57,200
stinginess deceit fraud

270
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,200
obstinacy aggression conceit

271
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:05,839
arrogance vanity and negligence

272
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,320
so we might um

273
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,760
summarize perhaps this uh list of 16

274
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,600
as maybe greediness of self selfishness

275
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,079
or

276
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,200
i want more or i need more

277
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,240
or maybe it's aversion a will

278
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,360
hostility kind of like get away from me

279
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,920
or get this away from me

280
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:33,920
or maybe also um this self-assertion or

281
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,279
a conceit

282
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:36,880
you might also think of it like don't

283
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,399
you know who i am

284
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,959
kind of thinking and i would say with

285
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,720
the exception maybe that last one

286
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,079
negligence

287
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,360
negligence is just maybe not

288
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,639
applying ourselves or not being

289
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,160
careful or attentive or something like

290
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,760
this so maybe the first

291
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:58,959
15 we might summarize

292
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,760
and you might recognize this idea of i

293
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,079
want more i need more

294
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,760
or get this away from me or

295
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,959
don't you know who i am

296
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,519
and these are manifestations of greed

297
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,959
hatred and delusion

298
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:18,839
some of the core foundational

299
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,480
defilements

300
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,600
but the way that um the buddha is using

301
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,079
these

302
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:25,680
the words that he's using right he's not

303
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,920
talking about you know just the core

304
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,360
fundamental ones

305
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,600
with uh some of these words of

306
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,560
aggression

307
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,680
or stinginess or envy or

308
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,800
arrogance vanity using some of these

309
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:39,600
words

310
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,040
there are some of the ones that are um

311
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:45,199
maybe we might think well these are just

312
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:48,160
minor manifestations

313
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,279
of some of these deeper

314
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,680
things that are extra defilements

315
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,560
impurities

316
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,199
but um i appreciate what niapanica tara

317
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,959
who is a who was

318
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,240
a an elder in this tradition like his

319
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,160
book the heart of buddhist meditation

320
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,680
was one of the first and pretty

321
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,360
foundational books

322
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,120
written in english came out in the mid

323
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,399
60s

324
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:20,480
about vapasana practice

325
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,800
and he writes how much more pleasant

326
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,160
and harmonious will be human

327
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,199
relations individual and communal

328
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:34,399
if there is less pettiness and

329
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,360
peevishness and fewer vanities and

330
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,720
jealousies and

331
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,440
less self-assertiveness and words and

332
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:42,480
deeds

333
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,399
so that was kind of one his way when

334
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,480
he's looked at this list of 16 thinking

335
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,199
like

336
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,440
it would just be so much easier to get

337
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:52,320
along with other people

338
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,079
whether it's just one other people or

339
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:55,920
whether we're in a group

340
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,680
if there's less of these things these um

341
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:03,519
16 different qualities and we also might

342
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,079
consider

343
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,360
that there is a connection between these

344
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,639
qualities and

345
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,839
the deeper roots of greed hatred and

346
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,519
delusion

347
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,600
and so to work with where they show up

348
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,720
and maybe what we might consider

349
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,000
minor or we might consider surface level

350
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,120
to work with them and how they

351
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,600
get expressed in our daily lives is

352
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,040
really a way

353
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:32,000
in which to work with the the deeper

354
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,560
ones

355
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,360
the the foundational the root

356
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,160
defilements

357
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,120
so in the buddha in the suta he can he

358
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:41,600
can

359
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,120
um he continues after talking about this

360
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,399
list of 16 defilements he says if you

361
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:54,480
know it's a defilement abandon it

362
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,839
seems so straightforward right makes it

363
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:58,560
sound easy

364
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,759
of course it's not easy but this is why

365
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:04,160
we have a meditation practice

366
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,920
and why we have a buddhist practice not

367
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,680
just meditation but all of them

368
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,440
all of the elements of the eightfold

369
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,639
path or the gradual training

370
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,480
that is to recognize if you know it's a

371
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,000
defilement if you know

372
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,800
that this is something that's extra

373
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:21,519
that's not

374
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,160
helpful that doesn't lead to greater

375
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,360
freedom but instead

376
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:27,440
leads to less freedom and to some

377
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,480
suffering

378
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:32,160
abandon it so what are some ways in

379
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,680
which we can

380
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,519
lessen the attachment the clinging the

381
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,040
stickiness

382
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,720
of some of these expressions

383
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,199
of these of greed hatred and delusion

384
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:49,279
so if you know it's a defilement

385
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,920
sometimes we don't know

386
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,839
sometimes these are habits of mine

387
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,959
sometimes we're so used to thinking

388
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:00,399
well of course i'm

389
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:03,199
filled with arrogance because everybody

390
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:04,959
else is

391
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:07,600
an idiot what do they know or i don't

392
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,079
know maybe that's an exaggeration but

393
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,079
are there some ways that maybe we

394
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:14,640
weren't quite considering that

395
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:19,360
they were impediments to greater freedom

396
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,400
and greater ease

397
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,678
and then the buddha in the suta

398
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,918
continues and

399
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:30,880
he goes with a describing brahma vahreh

400
00:17:30,880 --> 00:17:33,280
practice

401
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,799
probably many of you if not all of you

402
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:39,520
are familiar with this practice it

403
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,400
begins with

404
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,640
imbuing the mind with loving kindness

405
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,679
this is good will respect

406
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,600
benevolence care friendliness

407
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,440
love for others

408
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:58,400
and oneself not just others and oneself

409
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,039
and the way

410
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,039
love and kindness practice is described

411
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:02,960
in the suit does which is a little bit

412
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,919
different than

413
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:06,480
how we practice it like when i do happy

414
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,120
hour

415
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,559
i'm relying more on the way

416
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,559
living kindness practice is described in

417
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:15,679
the commentaries so a little bit

418
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,880
after the time of the suit does but in

419
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,240
the suit does is to

420
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:23,200
imbue the mind with loving kindness this

421
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,160
warm-heartedness if you will

422
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,720
and then to pervade it in ten directions

423
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,640
four directions we can think of as the

424
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:36,000
cardinal north south east west

425
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,480
and then four directions are the

426
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,240
intermediate

427
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,840
northwest southwest northeast southeast

428
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,679
and then the two directions above and

429
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:47,440
below

430
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:50,399
all directions

431
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,360
so to imbue the mind with loving

432
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,039
kindness

433
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:58,640
and then pervade ten directions

434
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:01,919
with this warm-heartedness

435
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,400
and then with a mind that is boundless

436
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,840
exalted

437
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,559
immeasurable and well-developed

438
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,799
i find myself smiling when i'm talking

439
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,039
about this because

440
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,039
sometimes right if we have this loving

441
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,799
kindness practice and

442
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,080
we're able to really

443
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,880
feel fill the heart and mind with this

444
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:27,440
good will

445
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:31,120
and to be sending it out and

446
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,559
including ourselves with it

447
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:37,280
that is such a way in which we can have

448
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,960
in which we are not expressing

449
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,559
aggression or stinginess or deceit or

450
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,880
contempt or resentment

451
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,720
all these other things that are lit in

452
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,840
this list of 16.

453
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,200
so in the suit that's not clear if the

454
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,480
buddha is saying first

455
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,720
abandon these 16 defilements and then

456
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,720
practice the brahma vaharas

457
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,919
or its and practice the brahma viharas

458
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,840
or maybe we might even understand it

459
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,960
that practicing the brahma vaharas

460
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,919
is a way in which we can help us to

461
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:12,799
abandon

462
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,799
some of these sixteen qualities

463
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:20,480
so many of you know the brahma vahrehs i

464
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,600
first started talking about

465
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,240
loving-kindness

466
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,440
but it also includes compassion

467
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,799
sympathetic joy and equanimity

468
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,679
there's those four movements of the

469
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:34,880
heart

470
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,679
we might say i won't go into detail

471
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,799
about what that is

472
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:43,120
but this just a recognition that

473
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:46,320
it's a sense in which there's

474
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,600
um maybe a sense of fullness

475
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,520
or a sense of um maybe some safety and

476
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,080
some

477
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,760
that itself can be a refuge

478
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,080
so then this uh then the

479
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,200
buddha and the brahmana start discussing

480
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:08,799
bathing and purification

481
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:12,240
so the buddha says

482
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:15,360
brahman so now he's directing his

483
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,280
attention to the brahm and maybe by this

484
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,080
time the

485
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:20,320
brahmana has walked there and has sat

486
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,240
down that's not explicit but that's

487
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,600
what's happening in my mind

488
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,640
is that now the brahmana is

489
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
sitting with the monastics and is

490
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,120
listening to what the buddha has to say

491
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,840
and the buddha says brahman this is what

492
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,640
is called

493
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,080
bathing the inner mind instead of

494
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:41,840
bathing the outer body so the

495
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,880
buddha is making a real distinction to

496
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:49,679
purify cleanse remove what's extra

497
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,200
from the mind making that's really

498
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,000
different

499
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,440
than purifying cleansing removing what's

500
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,799
extra on the body

501
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,000
the external body and the bon

502
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,080
the brahman replies by saying go to mam

503
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,720
you should go to the bahuka river to

504
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:09,600
bathe

505
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,520
because one who bathes in the bahuka

506
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,679
river becomes purified

507
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,360
and eliminates all evil

508
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,280
so we can we learn that this brahmana

509
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,720
was a person who

510
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,120
their practice their spiritual practice

511
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,320
was to bathe

512
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,559
in particular rivers and sacred rivers

513
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:28,960
with the belief

514
00:22:28,960 --> 00:22:31,200
that that didn't matter so much what

515
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,400
actions you did

516
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,760
as long as you included the action of

517
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,039
bathing in the river and then

518
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:42,400
all the all the bad

519
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,520
or inappropriate unskillful unwholesome

520
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,039
everything that you had done

521
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:50,559
would just be washed away

522
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:53,679
that may be as a as a little aside i'll

523
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:54,559
say

524
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:58,000
there's a nether suta it's um

525
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,559
from the terry gata some of you might be

526
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:01,360
familiar this

527
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,960
is the verses from the nuns

528
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:09,600
and there's um some there's a nun

529
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,760
right now her name escapes me i think

530
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,520
it's puneka

531
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:16,240
who um also encounters a brahman who has

532
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,039
this

533
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:21,280
practice that just um

534
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,120
as long as you bathe in the right rivers

535
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:26,159
you can do whatever you want

536
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,799
and i'm i'm chuckling because uh the nun

537
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,400
says to the brahmin

538
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,320
something like this i'm paraphrasing

539
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,679
well if that were true

540
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,679
then wouldn't all the turtles and the

541
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,080
fish and

542
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,960
the crocodiles and serpents wouldn't

543
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:41,360
they

544
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:44,640
all be perfectly pure and if that were

545
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,039
true

546
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,480
wouldn't all your good deeds also be

547
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,080
washed away so i appreciate very much

548
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:52,799
that this

549
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:56,640
nun wasn't speaking truth to power here

550
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,600
this brahman but getting back to this

551
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:00,159
suta

552
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,279
where um the buddha is speaking to this

553
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:05,200
brahmana about

554
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,600
there's to do with this inner cleansing

555
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,200
this inner

556
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,720
bathing if you will rather than outer

557
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,840
and then the buddha says to

558
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,799
inverse

559
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,159
for the pure in heart and i looked at

560
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,039
the poly it's

561
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:25,360
it's this word is heart as opposed to

562
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:27,679
mind

563
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:30,400
which is um i don't know it's a

564
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,799
beautiful thing actually

565
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,200
to think about having this pure of heart

566
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,080
maybe with the

567
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,799
loving-kindness practice as a way that

568
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:40,400
helps us to have this

569
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:43,039
purity of heart or the brahma of our

570
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:44,080
practice

571
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,720
for the pure in heart it's always the

572
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,279
spring

573
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,880
festival or the sabbath so the buddha is

574
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,440
saying

575
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,480
we don't have to wait for special days

576
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,279
that we go bathe in the river to be

577
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,559
cleansed of

578
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,679
things that wrong doing if we are

579
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:04,000
pure of heart then every day is a

580
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,240
special day

581
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,039
for the pure in heart and clean of deed

582
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:10,400
their vows will

583
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,240
always be fulfilled we don't have to go

584
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:17,840
bathe in the river and then

585
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,880
that buddha says it is here brahman

586
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,200
that you should bathe to make yourself a

587
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,000
refuge

588
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:28,000
for all beings it is here

589
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,360
that is abandoning those defilements and

590
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,000
practicing loving-kindness

591
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,240
which maybe isn't a surprise for any of

592
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,120
us

593
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,840
the part of the buddhist practice is

594
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
these two

595
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,360
movements of the heart to movements of

596
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,960
the mind

597
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,799
that allow us to show up for others

598
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:52,240
to create safety for others to be a

599
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,000
sanctuary for others

600
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,559
also points to this idea that behaving

601
00:25:58,559 --> 00:25:59,520
ethically is

602
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,919
much more than just following the

603
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,520
precepts

604
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:07,039
but also to notice any contempt or

605
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:09,600
domineering or arrogance that we might

606
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,360
have

607
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:13,760
and for us to think about that what are

608
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:15,120
some ways we might create

609
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:18,320
safe spaces for others

610
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:21,440
create safe communities or if we find

611
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,400
ourselves

612
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,720
as part of a community how can we

613
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:25,440
support

614
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:28,080
the that community to be a place that's

615
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,919
inclusive

616
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,520
that honors and recognizes and respects

617
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:36,960
everybody from whatever background

618
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,760
they have however they're showing up

619
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,919
and then maybe i'll close with this

620
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:49,840
um last

621
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:53,840
an excerpt from yet one more suta

622
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:57,840
that's this verse where the buddha says

623
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,960
one whose mind all day and night takes

624
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,240
delight in harmlessness who has loving

625
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,559
kindness for all beings

626
00:27:06,559 --> 00:27:10,760
for them there is no there is antigone

627
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,080
antagonism with none

628
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,679
i'll say that again one whose mind all

629
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,520
day and night takes delight

630
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,440
in harmlessness who has loving kindness

631
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,279
for all beings

632
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,559
for them there is antagonism

633
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,240
with none that is

634
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:36,480
we can be a refuge for others

635
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,360
thank you
