1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,240
so so hello and welcome everyone [Music]

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,559
so happy to be with you to see you and to practice together in this day

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:17,760
observing independence in the u.s

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,039
and the topic of independence

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,880
can have many different connotations many different connotations of course in

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:38,960
this context celebrated here as independents um having um autonomy

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:46,719
being able to have autonomy to make one's own choices etc so so one way we can

8
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,760
in the dharma in the practice in our practice [Music]

9
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:59,440
the theme of independence can show up in many ways one is to have independence to have autonomy through

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:06,000
practice from what's called the three poisonous roots from greed hatred and

11
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,920
confusion so that we have autonomy from them we're not um bound by them

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,240
something arises some thought arises in the mind all of a sudden greed arises we need to have it we want to have it or we

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,200
hate it make it go away so as if we're in bondage as if we are in bondage we don't have control

14
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:33,840
we don't when we don't have autonomy that's the word i want to use we don't have autonomy it seems like we

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:40,360
are on a leash like greed and hatred and delusion so that's one way i like to think of

16
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:50,159
independence in the dharma independent in the dharma and there's other senses of independence

17
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:57,040
in the dharma when one actually practices for a while the practice becomes the

18
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:02,240
path the path become life becomes um practice

19
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:09,200
practice becomes life interchangeably and there's a sense of trust there's a sense of trust in the

20
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,879
practice that arises there's a sense of autonomy that arises actually

21
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:20,480
one has this complete faith and trust that no these practices

22
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:27,680
actually work i'm freer i have more freedom again freedom in this sense in the sense of dharmic senses and

23
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,200
freedom to go and wreak havoc and do whatever but it's freedom from again

24
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,040
these um these bondages greed hatred delusion

25
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,560
these um bondages in the mind and heart that come

26
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:52,959
up and we are reactive we we act reactively so so there's a lot of and and also to

27
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,000
say kim allen who's one of the teachers at imc gave a lovely talk about

28
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,640
other nuances of independence in the dharma independent in the dharma on sunday yesterday and so

29
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,760
that's an audio dharma for any of you would like to listen to that

30
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:17,040
but for tonight for so having acknowledged this idea of independence in the dharma it depends on great hatred

31
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,200
and delusion one way one way of practicing which is what we cultivate here

32
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,040
and happy hour are the practices of the heart which support which are liberating

33
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,120
practices which they attenuate greed hatred and delusion they also attenuate

34
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,959
especially hatred self-hatred hatred of others self-judgement type

35
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:47,519
judgment criticism all these bondages of the mind all these habitual patterns

36
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,760
um that can become a lot bring up a lot of sadness bring up a lot of

37
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:59,840
depression bring up anxiety bring up a sense that you're imprisoned you're imprisoned in your own mind you're

38
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,840
imprisoned in your own life because of these prisons that we create

39
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,200
in your in our own hearts and mind habitually

40
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:19,199
and sometimes we can step out and look at our way of thinking and go huh that wasn't very helpful what was i

41
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:25,840
thinking you can ah the sense of freedom sense of freedom when you step out of yourself

42
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:33,919
when you step out of some habitual ways of thinking that may not be supportive may not be helpful

43
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,600
so so with that another thing i want to bring in in our

44
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:45,520
practice which we'll start in just a few seconds is the theme of interdependence

45
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,880
independence always brings up a sense of interdependence the more we become

46
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:56,639
independent in the dharma the more we

47
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:03,639
feel the more we become fully aware of our

48
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:10,080
interdependence with other beings our interdependence with others

49
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,840
people we love people we don't like we see our independence interdependence

50
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,720
with all beings so independence in the dharma brings up the sense of interdependence

51
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:31,440
with all beings everywhere i am because you are you are because i am

52
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,000
our happiness our goodness our freedom is dependent on each other which

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,720
is also similar to the concept of ubuntu

54
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,840
in south african culture open to i am because you are so all right i've

55
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,520
said plenty so that's setting that is the setting for our practice tonight

56
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,919
and i'll weave some of these themes together and allow silence

57
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,479
silent space stretches for us to explore so without further ado dear ones

58
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:13,280
let's let's get into our practice together

59
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:20,960
ah landing landing

60
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:35,840
landing into our body

61
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,280
landing with a sense of

62
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,360
recognition of this moment the recognition of this body

63
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
turning our gaze inward

64
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:25,840
allowing the breath the entirety of the in-breath

65
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:33,440
especially the entirety of the out breath making space for the next in-breath

66
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:45,840
to be soothing calming to connect

67
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:59,840
to arrive and land in this body

68
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:13,840
with age and breath and abra on their own breathing

69
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:27,840
being breathed

70
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:25,440
noticing that your mind can have malleability in this moment

71
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:32,079
as you invite it invited to connect with the breath

72
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:39,279
being calm besettled soothed

73
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,399
to have a sense of independence

74
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:56,160
even if we're a moment from habitual thoughts patterns of mind

75
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:02,640
sense of freedom freed for a moment

76
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:18,880
ah releasing letting go

77
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:26,480
as if thoughts are the fireworks of the mind letting them go ah burst

78
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,480
and in between there's stillness silence

79
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:37,600
hmm freedom

80
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:46,640
independence from habitual patterns of the mind

81
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:50,800
even for just a moment

82
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:56,079
and then tying these little moments

83
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
together

84
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:07,839
letting go ah releasing releasing

85
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:14,399

87
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:29,040

90
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:50,399
with kindness claiming our autonomy our independence

91

109
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,360
so many processes that work

110
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:35,200
even if there may not be full health at this moment or some pain but so many processes

111
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,720
work interdependently

112
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,399

oxygen the heart pumping blood etc etc so many systems

117
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,840
interdependently working

118
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:49,840

even if we feel disconnected

150

uh

151
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:51,039
as a physicist once said in order to make apple pie

152
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:57,840
you need to create the whole universe first

00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,749
all the plankton and the sea [Music]

168
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:38,399
serves as food sustenance

169
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,399
for other organism all the fish

170
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:54,480
all the little critters that crawl and hop and slither

171
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:01,360
all the mammals

172
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:10,638
all four-legged creatures all

173
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:20,398
two-legged creatures

174
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:35,838
all creatures that fly

175
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,200
you can choose particular creatures if you wish

176
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,839
to wish well for

177
00:34:51,280 --> 00:35:03,839
may you be safe happy healthy and have ease

178
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:49,680
your interdependence with your family of origin

179
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:56,880
your interdependence with so many chosen families

180
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:00,640
communities sanghas

181
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:13,838
may all be well

182
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:54,640
for the last moment of this practice let's step out of outside of ourselves

183
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,839
for a moment again as if we're looking at ourselves

184
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:07,040
our life is at our interconnection interdependence

185
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:21,520
we're not an island letting that interdependence fill our

186
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:27,119
heart with all appreciation

187
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:32,880
for all the ways we receive and all the ways we give

188
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:36,640
acknowledging the giving too

189
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:48,240
the way this person you're watching was yourself is a good friend to someone

190
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:52,800
perhaps a sibling of someone

191
00:38:54,480 --> 00:39:02,640
a colleague of someone so many other functions

192
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:14,079
bowing to the inner goodness of this sharing giving and receiving

193
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:20,560
and stepping back into yourself may all beings everywhere may all beings

194
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:28,880
everywhere be well may all beings everywhere

195
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:41,940
be free

196
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:45,308
[Music]

197
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:01,599
thank you all thank you for your practice

198
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:12,000
so explored a couple of themes today well thoughts and themes but in

199
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:19,200
the guided meditation we started with the theme of independence independence

200
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:26,599
independence freedom from habitual tendencies of thoughts

201
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:34,000
reactivities putting them down releasing them ah landing in the sense of freedom

202
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:39,280
independence from those thoughts habitual patterns

203
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,880
even for a split second feeling that sense of freedom and peace

204
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:53,200
and then we turned to feeling interdependence the interdependence of this body

205
00:40:53,200 --> 00:41:00,640
on gravity and breath all the interdependence says inside this body all these

206
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:06,000
intricate processes and the interdependence of this being on

207
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:14,240
so many processes externally so many beings inter externally

208
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,920
and from that place of awe

209
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:24,960
allowing meta loving-kindness good will to shine for all these beings who are

210
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:34,079
just like us they want to be well acknowledging our interdependence

211
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:42,319
so so many things and i'd love to hear i'd love to invite

212
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:47,359
your reflections what you've noticed in this practice today

213
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:52,560
for both your own benefit to be witnessed and for the benefit of the sangha when

214
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:58,079
you share your practice whether it's something that you discovered

215
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:05,839
it's a gift to others or it could be a question a challenge this didn't quite work how this was hard

216
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:13,119
that is also a gift definitely a gift because you can trust that other people other practitioners

217
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:18,319
will either have a similar question or have had it etc

218
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:25,039
so you're welcome to raise your zoom hand especially if you haven't shared in a while

219
00:42:25,119 --> 00:42:30,400

222
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:52,160

223
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:58,480
what did you notice how was this practice for you

224
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,000
practice of independence in the dharma

225
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:11,680
as well as interdependence sense of all perhaps arising or overwhelming rising

226
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:26,560
that can come up too in this practice a sense of goodness

227
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:33,920
jerry says the interdependence seemed amazing jerry i'd love to invite you to say more

228
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:40,079
if you would what you mean by amazing um if you would hear uh if you could

229
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:46,880
unmute yourself now you should be able to please tell me what arose for you um

230
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:53,280
well it was uh the dependence part i got about the

231
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:59,359
independent interdependence when you started thinking to the plankton and everything else in the universe

232
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:05,200
it made it made me think of the earth as a sort

233
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:13,280
of organism and we're just part of that organism or maybe the whole universe and um so it really became

234
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:19,359
quite powerful to think uh you talked about you know all the biochemical reactions

235
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:27,119
that happened in the last second probably in the millions in her body and then thinking you know more that's at the

236
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:35,680
granular level and then you look interdependently and you think wow it's quite a uh uh and they were not an island

237
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:41,760
we're all and of course with things facing the world nowadays covet

238
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,800
into you know climate change it makes it seem so even more real so it seemed uh a whale a way

239
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:52,480
amazing in terms of its um

240
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,119
breath and and and and hand also in terms of its

241
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:07,839
um it almost seemed amazing in terms of its uh like

242
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:13,040
the patterns you know like in nature you see fractals here like all of these things that you just

243
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:19,839
go like how does this all happen just happens so i was in awe

279
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:31,119
after happy hour yes i see a few thumbs up yeah that's great yeah richard please

280
00:49:31,119 --> 00:49:37,119
you hear me yeah um my morning out of berry with bill

281
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:42,839
and sue morgan they've been discussing um the contrast between dukkha and

282
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:50,000
sukkah the last few days and this sid reminded me of the suka side of that

283
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:57,119
equation nice nice so what i'm hearing is that you've been exploring

284
00:49:57,119 --> 00:50:03,599
so for those who don't know those words uh dukkha is suffering his challenges pain is is

285
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:11,280
is what's difficult and sukkah is the opposite of dukkha is is you can think of it as

286
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:16,559
sugar sukkah you know they have similar um

287
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:24,240
i think similar to etymological attempt same background verbally in any way in

288
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,839
words so sukkah is what's pleasant in the mind what's pleasant in the mind what's

289
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:35,599
pleasant in the body so sukkah and dukkha they play the opposite of each other and

290
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:40,800
richard you're saying that this sid reminded you or or was more filled with

291
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:47,280
sukkah for you of pleasantness in the mind and the body anything particularly that brought that

292
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:54,319
about that brought that up your presence always brings me

293
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:59,280
