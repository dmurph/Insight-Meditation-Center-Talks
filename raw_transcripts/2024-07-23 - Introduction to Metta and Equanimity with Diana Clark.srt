1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:07,719
so good evening welcome welcome nice to see you

2
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:14,679
all many of you know that I've uh did a series of four um classes on introduction to mindfulness

3
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:23,760
meditation and now I'm going to do two I was thinking like what should I call these like ancillary or extra credit

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:32,160
or I don't know but uh two um two two more weeks and each week will

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,079
be a different practice that is a support for mindfulness practice or it can even just be a instead of

6
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:47,920
mindfulness practice and tonight I'm talking about Brahma vajar more specifically meta and yeah so the the

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,520
word in uh poly is Brahma vajar you don't need to know that word it's uh

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:00,079
like warm-heartedness loving kindness compassion these types of things

9
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:07,640
maybe I'll just start by saying I appreciate this so much that in this practice there is this recognition and I

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:14,720
can say that I have this from my own experience as well this recognition that we don't have to wait you know just for

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,680
the perfect conditions to arise you know where we've had enough sleep and we're

12
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:25,920
not hungry and the people that we're with are perfectly behaved until we have

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,400
all this feeling of warm-heartedness or Compassion or care for others instead

14
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:39,320
it's something that we can actively cultivate at a particular like in a meditation practice and then it just

15
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:46,640
starts spilling out just starts spilling out at the grocery store with the family while

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:53,600
driving these types of things and it's quite something it's quite something that we can intentionally cultivate this

17
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:00,640
uh warm-heartedness so some of you might know this is called a meta practice I

18
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:06,880
did think it was kind of interesting that when Facebook renamed themselves so we pronounce it meta and we use that

19
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,160
same pronunciation for this polyd meta so loving kindness Facebook I don't know

20
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:19,280
well I'll let you decide maybe Facebook have a little bit more meta maybe that's their aspiration

21
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,720
so they renamed themselves that so I'll maybe I'll start a little

22
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:31,640
bit with a with a confession that uh I was on a long

23
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:38,200
retreat and actually this was a short Retreat and uh all this like rage just

24
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:44,800
showed up I had like no idea like it wasn't for any individual in particular

25
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,800
it was just so much anger just about everything it was really really striking

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,000
I was like just like consumed with this rage and anger and when I spoke with the

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,159
teacher about it the teacher recognized this like yes this does happen and I I

28
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,840
have seen this also now when I'm a retreat teacher I do see this uh this sometimes happens in practice we might

29
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:16,080
even say it's a particular stage of practice but uh the recommendation that

30
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,680
this teacher gave to me is like oh you should do meta practice I like I'm not

31
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:29,319
going to do meta practice I had this idea like oh that's too sentimental or that's I don't need

32
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:38,040
warm heart I just need the world to be different or you know something like this but now I wish I had a different view

33
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:44,599
from way back then I have a completely different view now but I just wanted to share that sometimes when we first

34
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:51,400
encounter this we might feel um I don't know it's a it can be a

35
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:59,959
little bit awkward in the beginning not for everybody for some people they take to it like fish to water but for me I it

36
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:07,879
wasn't initially wasn't uh something that I uh initially took to but I did um

37
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:13,599
subsequently I finished I guess I spent five years teaching loving kindness few

38
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,199
times a week for years and years and I can just say wow my life just really changed not only doing it for myself but

39
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:26,960
teaching it and really really uh had an impact on my life so I'm just offering

40
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,360
that as uh something to consider so what is

41
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:39,600
meta and what is meta practice what is it that Diana is talking about

42
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,759
here well I uh maybe I'll introduce it by saying that Jack cornfield who many

43
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:53,039
of you might be familiar with he has a number of well-known books he's uh one of the senior most

44
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:58,520
senior teachers in this particular tradition and when he talks about

45
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:05,400
mindfulness he's no longer using this word mindfulness he's using loving

46
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:12,080
awareness loving awareness this way of being aware but

47
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:20,000
that also includes the heart that also includes some um care or maybe this

48
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:26,400
loving awareness is a way that noticing whatever there is to be noticed but with

49
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:34,199
an attitude of it's okay it can be here it's all right this is how it is

50
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:40,680
right now as opposed to so often when we're doing mindfulness practice we might not

51
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:46,039
even notice it but there's this um maybe a little this quiet little voice in the

52
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:52,080
back of the mind like I'm doing mindfulness so that I can get rid of

53
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,919
some feeling I'm doing mindfulness so that I can manufacture or create or

54
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:05,759
engineer or somehow have some particular experience arise and this loving awareness instead

55
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:12,440
is a whole different way it's like no we're just noticing to uh to notice and

56
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,680
to care and show respect and honor for what's actually

57
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:25,560
happening So Meta meditation is the loving part of uh loving awareness it's

58
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:31,000
a distinct practice from uh mindfulness meditation I brought in that anecdote

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:36,199
about Jack cornfield just to show how it's an integral part of mindfulness but

60
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:41,400
the practice is distinct and uh I'll talk about that today and we'll do a

61
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,720
little bit of that today So Meta can be translated in many

62
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:56,240
different ways including benevolence good will care

63
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:02,199
warmth maybe even a certain amount of respect loving kindness I how I learned

64
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:08,639
it was as loving kindness or loving friendliness or something like this you

65
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:17,720
know it's just maybe I like kind of the expression warm-heartedness it's a way of uh you know not being cold or not

66
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:24,919
being disconnected or somehow but instead uh not disconnecting with our

67
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:31,240
head but bringing our hearts to whatever it is that we're doing

68
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:39,080
we all know what it is to love we can't say that it's to care for

69
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:46,680
and we could say that it's um to have some um some intimacy with or to have

70
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,800
warmth towards and we often you know have love for our family members and

71
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:57,680
those people that are close for us and different types of love for different uh

72
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:05,360
individuals and so is kind of what we might say is a maybe

73
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:13,599
expansion or a maturation of love so it's has love but it's not

74
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:19,479
exactly the same as what we would say in um English like today for

75
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:25,919
love and what do I mean by that that expression like expansion and

76
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,479
maturation meta has it's a quality of the

77
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:37,959
heart that um is the way the direction we're going is

78
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:47,120
that it's just towards this warmth this care is for whomever and whatever comes

79
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,160
in the mind or crosses our path it's not reserved just for those specific

80
00:08:52,160 --> 00:09:00,680
individuals that we know and have relationships with it's just this sense of warmth and care right for

81
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:08,360
everybody it's quite something it's quite something to feel care for

82
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:14,000
people even though you don't know them so instead it's it's a different type of

83
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:21,800
love so it's not based on um necessarily intimacy but it's based

84
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:29,720
on what was the word unconditional yeah it's unconditional love thank you yes

85
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:36,360
and it's based on but it's more like this uh I'm going I'm holding my hands there in front of

86
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:42,519
my chest here cuz it's like the heart gets soft and warm

87
00:09:42,519 --> 00:09:50,480
and it uh kind of like a uh offers just this warmth to everybody and anybody so

88
00:09:50,480 --> 00:10:00,480
it's this we might say this basic wish for Goodwill maybe that's a good way to put it goodwi for all beings

89
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:06,920
and maybe I should say also uh meta like it persists despite you know

90
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:12,320
difficulties or despite uh whatever might be

91
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:20,480
arising you know even though like it might we might feel irritated it doesn't mean that meta isn't there

92
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:26,120
also So Meta is one of the Brahma viharas this is a word that I said

93
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,600
Brahma vihara uh vihara we we can translate it

94
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,920
as a abide in and Brahma there's a number of different ways we can uh

95
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:42,399
translate that for this purpose we'll do like Divine and so it could and vihara could

96
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,440
be uh an abode so sometimes it's like the Divine abodes like the Heavenly

97
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:52,839
Realms almost like so when there's this when your heart has this meta in it it's

98
00:10:52,839 --> 00:11:02,079
a like a Heavenly experience is what's being pointed to so there's four different

99
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:08,360
um flavors types of the Brahma vajar

100
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:15,040
the I'm trying to think do we have a I guess the Divine abodes a good English

101
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:21,200
translation So Meta as I just described is like this good will for whomever and

102
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,160
then as meta as it grows and proliferates it just starts going out to

103
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:32,600
more and more and more beings and it's natural that it'll meet beings that are

104
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:39,079
suffering that are having difficulties there's plenty of beings in the world and S ourselves included that are

105
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:45,760
suffering so when this loving kindness meets suffering it turns into

106
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,000
compassion it turns into this wish for the suffering to end this compassion is

107
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:58,800
this this recognizing the suffering and this desire for it to end and then when this loving kindness

108
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,760
goes out and it meets the opposite somebody who's uh having great fortune

109
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:10,079
and the good things are happening or maybe they just you know graduated or

110
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:17,920
got a promotion or have a new baby or getting married or you know any of these things there's so many things then um it

111
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:25,760
turns into we could call it um sometimes we say sympathetic Joy or could be I

112
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:33,279
I'll use sympathetic Joy so this means I'm happy that you're happy just to see them happy makes you happy like it's

113
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:42,199
just great to see their happiness so it's a little it's contagious like our joy grows so when this meta meets a joy

114
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:48,600
it grows in us and then the fourth one is

115
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:54,519
equinity equinity shows up in a number of different uh ways in this tradition

116
00:12:54,519 --> 00:13:01,800
and in this uh way in this setting with the Brahma of is with these heart

117
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:07,199
practices it's this recognition equinity is this recognition

118
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:14,279
of feeling connected and warmhearted with others and recognizing that we

119
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:20,519
can't control their lives we can't control what's going to

120
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:26,480
happen to them or what they're going to do so even though we might be able to see you know you'd have less suffering

121
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,360
if you did X Y or Z and there's often a temptation to want

122
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:38,639
to tell them or somehow uh make them control them to do X Y or Z

123
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:46,760
or something equinity is this recognition that we don't control others

124
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:54,600
we care for them we love them and we wish the best for them but we ourselves

125
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,800
can be connected and warmhearted and not at

126
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,639
agitated when they are agitated or something wanting something that they

127
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:13,120
can't have or what whatever for whatever reason and I'll talk a little bit more about equinity uh in a moment I'll guide

128
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,440
us in some meditation um with

129
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:27,560
equinity but first I just want to say a few words about cultivating uh loving

130
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:35,120
kindness there's two primary ways to do this and one is uh which I'll be leading

131
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:40,639
Us in this evening is we bring to mind a

132
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:47,560
lovable being this is a uh somebody you know and is part of your life or it can

133
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:53,000
even be an imaginary some people do kittens puppies babies this type of

134
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:59,120
thing so a lovable being something that just causes the heart to smile and some

135
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:06,320
kind of way like there's a little bit of a uplift so we connect with

136
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:12,320
that and if it's available to us feel that in our bodies feel the this little

137
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:18,920
bit of uplift and warm-heartedness and then we will repeat

138
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,560
phrases just as a way to kind of help the Mind keep on coming back to that

139
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:32,160
loving feeling because if mindfulness practice tells us anything it's how the mind likes to wander and so instead of

140
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:38,040
coming back to the breath we're coming back to a phrase that expresses a

141
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:47,360
goodwi so these phrases are not meant to uh um create something out of thin air

142
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:55,160
necessarily but it's just uh a reminder of Our intention of connecting with this

143
00:15:55,160 --> 00:16:02,000
warm-heartedness so that's the first way that we can uh

144
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:08,720
cultivate meta and what all be leading us in a second way is to just

145
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,360
visualize there's can be like elaborate visualizations I'm less familiar with

146
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:23,560
that um visualize something or someone or imagine something or someone that uh

147
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:29,319
brings this warmhearted feeling and then like tune into it and

148
00:16:29,319 --> 00:16:34,560
then just practice pervading it so the sense of like it baming out of one's

149
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:40,440
heart out there so it's a less words and more of

150
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:46,199
a I don't know maybe it's more of a feeling thing of just pushing or sending

151
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:51,240
meta out

152
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:57,040
so I'd like to um guide us in a meditation here but before I do I'd like

153
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:03,720
to say that um it's help to be comfortable when you're doing meta in particular so you're welcome to get any

154
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:10,480
extra cushions or to move or to do anything that you would like that uh if you think it would be helpful to be

155
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:15,918
comfortable it's hard to be warm-hearted if you're when you're

156
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:32,279
uncomfortable Okay so taking a meditation

157
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:45,120
posture and we'll begin with just

158
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:50,039
connecting to the surface on which we're

159
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:56,159
sitting the chair or the cushion feeling the pressure against the

160
00:17:56,159 --> 00:17:59,159
body

161
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:08,039
feeling the feet on the

162
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:26,159
ground and to start us off we'll do a little bit of mindfulness of

163
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:32,280
breathing to help the mind and body settle so

164
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:38,799
bringing attention to the experience of breathing

165
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:12,240
just tuning into what it feels

166
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:18,440
like to have in breaths and out breaths

167
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:03,760
when the mind wanders we just very simply gently begin again with the sensations

168
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,000
of

169
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:29,159
breathing and now to begin the loving kindness practice

170
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:34,320
practice bring to mind a lovable

171
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,440
being someone with whom you have an uncomplicated

172
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:45,880
relationship for some people this means it might be somebody they don't know

173
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:52,000
very well might be a teacher coach

174
00:20:53,480 --> 00:21:00,600
Mentor could even be somebody you've never met maybe an author

175
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:10,000
or it can be somebody in your life or you can imagine a kitten or

176
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,200
puppies or a

177
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:22,520
baby and bring this lovable being to mind

178
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:39,039
and can you connect with the care that you have for

179
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:46,278
this lovable being the warmth the

180
00:21:50,919 --> 00:21:59,000
love for some people that connection will be felt in the chest in the heart

181
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:06,640
for some people it'll be more just a general sense of warmth and

182
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:12,600
relaxation and for some people it's not quite so

183
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:17,158
obvious it's all perfectly

184
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,520
fine so staying connected to this lovable being

185
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:37,559
you can repeat these phrases in your mind after

186
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:42,440
me may you be

187
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:52,600
safe may you be happy

188
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,399
may you be

189
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,799
healthy may you live with

190
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,679
ease may you be safe

191
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:34,158

192
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,399
happy may you be

193
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:55,559
healthy may you live with ease

194
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,840
may you be

195
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:15,158
safe may you be

196
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:26,559
happy may you be healthy

197
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:34,398
may you live with

198
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:44,480
ease connecting with the lovable

199
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:53,120
being connecting to your intentions of sending this Good Will well

200
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:58,880
wishes this care warmth respect

201
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,919
to this lovable

202
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:15,440
being may you be

203
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,640
safe may you be happy

204
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,840
may you be

205
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:40,679
healthy may you live with

206
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:57,840
ease you're welcome to modify the phrases if those words feel clunky or

207
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:07,398
awkward just a recommendation to keep it simple

208
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:35,559
connecting with the lovable [Music] being and

209
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:41,240
maybe checking in with oneself in the

210
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:52,760
body is there a sense of warmth or care or softness

211
00:26:53,840 --> 00:27:03,799
or and if so allowing that to get as big as it would

212
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:07,440
like key word is

213
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:16,799
allow if you don't feel anything in particular that's perfectly fine too

214
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,559
may you be

215
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,760
safe may you be

216
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:56,039
happy may you be healthy

217
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:03,679
may you live with

218
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:31,080
ease for

219
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:10,320
and in the same way that we're extending this warm-heartedness and Good Will to The

220
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:18,880
Lovable being let's extend it to

221
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:25,159
ourselves of course we deserve loving

222
00:29:25,159 --> 00:29:29,799
kindness of course we do

223
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,799
may I be

224
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:47,039
safe may I be

225
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:58,720
happy may I be healthy

226
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:04,919
may I live with

227
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,440
ease wishing ourselves

228
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:29,360
goodwi may I be safe

229
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,760
may I be

230
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:46,039
happy may I be as healthy as I can given

231
00:30:46,039 --> 00:30:49,480
the circumstances I'm

232
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:56,279
in May I live with

233
00:30:56,919 --> 00:30:59,919
ease

234
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,880
for for

235
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:02,080
may I be

236
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:08,440
safe may I be

237
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:17,398
happy may I be as healthy as I

238
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:24,518
can may I live with ease

239
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:38,720
and then to end this meditation connecting again with the

240
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:44,679
sitting surface you're

241
00:32:44,919 --> 00:32:49,360
here feeling your feet on the

242
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:59,840
ground and when you're ready you can gently open your eyes

243
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:07,299
[Music]

244
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:24,080
so with that meditation I started with us just connecting to hear sometimes can

245
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:29,799
help you know the body and the mind to settle down often they're you know off doing whatever they're

246
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:36,639
doing and then I usually start with just a minute or two maybe even three of Just

247
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:43,760
Breath meditation just as a way to kind of like allow some settling and then bringing to mind a

248
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:51,760
lovable being sometimes it can we can feel like oh no which lovable being should I choose and not sure who it

249
00:33:51,760 --> 00:34:00,120
should be but the recommendation is an uncomplicated relationship cuz often what happens is

250
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:06,120
somebody in our family we love them of course we love them and then we're doing this practice

251
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:13,480
then we start to remember that thing that they did that time and then it starts to get a little bit it's less uh

252
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,720
unconditional love and more we starting to little bit of a something else uh

253
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:24,679
coming in so that's why often people uh choose individuals that they don't know

254
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:30,638
so well it's easier to just uh have this uncomplicated relationship with don't

255
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:35,800
worry there's uh definitely time to do uh meta medit meditation loving kindness

256
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:44,000
for everybody in our family but just to start here I did with the lovable being because in theory that's the

257
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,878
easiest and the uh encouragement is to really start where it's easy and stay

258
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:56,079
where it's easy a lot of times people want to jump and run and do all kinds of

259
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:01,480
things with love and kindness meditation for example work with one's anger and

260
00:35:01,480 --> 00:35:07,560
you know that would be great if it worked but it doesn't the human mind and heart can't just flip around to go from

261
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:14,079
anger to love that fast in the way that we're wanting to cultivate here so in

262
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:19,920
that meditation we start with the lovable being with the idea of kind of like you know priming the pump or

263
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:27,839
lighting the Kindle under the fire kind of thing so that there could be some warmth that's starting to be generated

264
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:34,040
and for many people that's all they do is just stay with the lovable being and

265
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:40,720
there's something about just repeatedly you know directing the Mind towards that

266
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,040
uh well-wishing it just makes it easier and easier to come to that uh place in the

267
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,160
heart and mind and it just starts showing up in people in one's

268
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:59,119
life often when you least expect it when you're kind of relaxed and you make a mistake and uh or for example you might

269
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:06,560
say like oh it's okay sweetheart whereas before you would have chastised yourself or something or you might uh find

270
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:13,680
yourself uh being okay the person that's driving erratically or maybe even unsafely just backing off and like oh I

271
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:19,400
guess that case person's having a bad day or something's going on with them whereas before maybe there would have

272
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:24,480
been anger so there's these subtle ways in which it starts to show up and then

273
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:32,160
it just starts to show up just more and more that's the more we practice the more uh scenarios in which it

274
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:38,800
arises and then on that meditation I also kind of like ended doing a little bit for

275
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:44,520
ourselves it turns out that this often is not so easy to have loving kindness

276
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:51,599
for ourselves there's a inner critic that's often alive and well and is

277
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,040
um trying to you know tell us that we have to do better

278
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:04,599
and that we're inadequate and in some kind of awful way but I'd like I'd love to hear from

279
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:11,480
all of you how was it to um do that guided meditation and or do you have any

280
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:19,400
questions about uh the teaching that I've done so far about uh loving

281
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:31,040
kindness maybe I'll ask a specific question how was it to go from from The Lovable being to yourself that's one

282
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:36,480
question was it like easy peasy or was it like wait what did it feel

283
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:45,880
awkward there's a nodding of the head yes anybody want to say anything about

284
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:55,560
that was it easy to determine like okay who The Lovable being is going to be did

285
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:01,160
you try out a few like okay this level NOP okay I'm going to try this one nope not going to do that I'm going to try

286
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:07,560
another one anybody do chose my cat first but quickly decided against that

287
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:13,960
just for the purpose of the recording I'll say that you chose your cat first but then decide to change your mind is

288
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:20,319
your cat like a Mischief maker sometimes oh yeah a feral cat

289
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:26,200
yes and then did you uh did you have to go through a lot of uh beans or was the

290
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:32,400
next one that you did picked my knce next okay okay kind of bad that I picked my

291
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:38,520
cou no no no so I just for the purpose ofra will say that she chose her niece

292
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:44,800
uh after that I think that's actually great like like nieces and nephews are perfect and grandkids like these are the

293
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,160
perfect uh like ones to to

294
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:58,480
do what about the phrases did they feel awkward and clunky or was it like or did

295
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,760
it feel like a support for tuning into

296
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:08,640
and wanting to send well

297
00:39:12,319 --> 00:39:16,960
wishes where you put that microphone back there thank

298
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:25,200
you um I I think the phrases were fine for me but um I've also practiced this

299
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:31,560
before I was actually um curious about the interplay between mindfulness and

300
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:39,960
meta is it is it sort of akin to like mindfulness is for the brain uh whereas

301
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:46,160
meta is more for the heart is that sort of the how they compliment each

302
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:52,520
other um I think in the beginning it's that way and then they they kind of like the

303
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:57,800
difference uh starts to not be so clear because the difference between mind and

304
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:06,280
heart starts to not be so clear also but uh I think that's one way we can consider it but it's uh yeah just have

305
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:12,760
warm-heartedness in our life is just like such a great thing it just makes everything better

306
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,880
and yeah and this is just a way to connect with that but I I find that uh I

307
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:24,280
think probably most of us find that doing like mindfulness meditation which is just being aware of whatever is

308
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:32,560
arising um won't necessarily bring warm-heartedness or cultivate that but

309
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:38,240
yeah I I actually find The Meta like way easier than mindfulness I don't know why

310
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:45,560
it's just like easier to concentrate on or something yeah and so I often if people find uh meta easier than like

311
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:51,800
mindfulness I encourage them to do a lot of meta there's no reason not to this uh

312
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:57,880
they will like when we really cultivate these they end up going to really similar if not the same place

313
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:03,560
takes a little while to before they get there but uh I would always start where

314
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:09,520
it's easy it's start where it feels good and it's fun we're not always chasing our

315
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:16,200
preferences but if mindfulness feels like something that's hard to do then then we're just not going to do it

316
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:23,599
whereas uh if meta is easier I would say stay with that thank you

317
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:34,880
I asked in the chat if there were any questions online would you may want to just are there any questions for the

318
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:41,680
people that are on the other side of that camera that would like to type in a a

319
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:49,480
question CU they're nobody typed in anything but you you typed in something yeah I just you just typed it

320
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:52,880
in

321
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:01,800
okay what about when I said uh see if there's any like feeling in the body

322
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:07,720
that's associated with L kind was that like obvious or was it like I don't know

323
00:42:07,720 --> 00:42:13,920
or you're not in your head was it for obvious or for you or I don't

324
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:21,480
know actually can we yeah the microphone's right behind you right here there we

325
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:28,119
go um I I focused on my

326
00:42:28,119 --> 00:42:36,359
older grandson who when he walks in the room my heart swells and

327
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:42,640
um this this was really hard for me because I have a very good friend he's

328
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:49,839
20 whose grandson just was killed in a motorcycle accident so it was really

329
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:56,720
really sad yeah and as much as I tried to focus on the good things about my

330
00:42:56,720 --> 00:43:05,720
grand son I turned it into loving kindness for my friend but really hard

331
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:13,359
beautiful and you know what you're describing is exactly what happens I'll just say this that of course when we

332
00:43:13,359 --> 00:43:19,680
like set the direction that we're going to cultivate this warm-heartedness it's just natural that everything that isn't

333
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:26,640
warm-heartedness shows up including grief with loss and this it's just Perfectly Natural that it comes up and

334
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:32,599
it's perfectly natural to do what you did just to like turn towards uh your friend or something like this we don't

335
00:43:32,599 --> 00:43:40,960
have to you know bulldoze our way through uh doing what we initially intended but yeah I'm I'm sorry about

336
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,319
that loss that's that's hard [Applause]

337
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:51,680
yeah anybody else have a comment or there is one question

338
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:58,330
online um would someone who practices the Brahma Bahar is ever get

339
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:03,440
[Laughter] divorced I don't

340
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:11,480
know I mean how would I know that right so I'll say that

341
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:17,520
um Rara practice is conditions our

342
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:22,640
hearts so that warmth and this uh care

343
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:29,319
just SCE to just be a part of our life and then your life unfolds differently if you have a lot of warmth and

344
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:34,599
care it is not magic and that the person that you are imagining is all of a

345
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:40,119
sudden going to feel love and behave differently it's something that we're

346
00:44:40,119 --> 00:44:45,480
cultivating for ourselves so it's not going to necessarily you know make other

347
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:50,760
people behave differently that being said you know when we behave differently people we

348
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:56,720
have relationships with you know often behave differently too but it would be a

349
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:02,680
an I think it's it would be a misunderstanding to think that uh because we send loving kindness to

350
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:07,760
individuals that those individuals are going to change it's we are going to

351
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:15,760
change and the loving kindness just becomes easier and easier and more and more uh settings so I guess that's my

352
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,119
answer if they would ever get

353
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:29,359
divorced so now I'd like to talk a little bit about um well maybe I'll say just a few more

354
00:45:29,359 --> 00:45:36,559
words about loving kindness or maybe um yeah I'll just say that often there's

355
00:45:36,559 --> 00:45:43,119
a a progression start where it's easy lovable

356
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:48,400
being and then sometimes it can be a good friend it's still easy but you know

357
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,599
you know them well and there's that time they were late and they or whatever you know there's this it's not as clean

358
00:45:54,599 --> 00:46:00,280
necessarily but you still you know love them of course and then it can be

359
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:07,520
there's you can do it in a number of different order orders including um do it for a neutral oh

360
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:13,839
sorry do it for oneself and then a neutral person that

361
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:18,880
is somebody you don't know somebody ideally it would be somebody an

362
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:24,359
individual that you recognize maybe somebody that you see in the

363
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:29,480
neighborhood maybe it's the person that works at the grocery store that you see

364
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:35,000
you know regularly or something like this so an individual but you don't know them you've never spoken with them you

365
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:40,440
don't know their names but just to uh have well- wishing for somebody that we don't

366
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:46,839
know this is such a powerful practice because right the majority of people we don't know we don't have relationships

367
00:46:46,839 --> 00:46:53,000
with and this actually can be a little bit difficult to do the neutral person there's a way in which the Mind wants to

368
00:46:53,000 --> 00:47:01,079
be like oh it doesn't matter or the Mind tends to be a little bit dismissive but it's the neutral person often can be the

369
00:47:01,079 --> 00:47:06,920
most powerful to spend time there and then a difficult person a person with

370
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:13,079
whom we have tension in our relationship or we dislike or something like this so

371
00:47:13,079 --> 00:47:18,440
the way that I often Envision it how it works is and this maybe based on my

372
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:27,440
experience too is that um there's like a um like a fountain that um the we'll say

373
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:33,079
love and kindness comes out the top and then it goes to another Pool and then it overflows that pool and then it goes

374
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:38,160
down to another Pool and then it overflows then it goes down to another Pool and then it fills up and overflows

375
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:43,720
and goes down to another so it's kind of like important to fill up each pool as

376
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:50,640
we're going so to fill up with The Lovable being to start there and this

377
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:56,280
takes time there's absolutely no need to be in hurry with this there are plenty

378
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:02,640
of benefit benefits there's you'll see a change with just doing that simple practice is doing loving kindness for

379
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:07,800
The Lovable being I know people have spent a year doing just with the lovable

380
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:14,800
being so then maybe like to a good friend or a family member and then to

381
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,200
oneself and a neutral person and then a difficult person but each time uh

382
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:27,760
spending each time you shift to spend uh time there I know that um some times I

383
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:33,160
know a number of people have done like 3mon Retreats and they'll spend like the first month you know 10 hours a day

384
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:39,280
meditating just with the The Lovable being and then it's just starts to ooze

385
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:44,559
out of them and then everything else just happens easier I'll also acknowledge you know

386
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:51,599
that some meditation teachers will run through all those categories in one you know sit 30 minute or 45 minutes sit or

387
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:57,000
something if you can do that that's great but uh if you can't that's perfect

388
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:03,440
fine too just stay where it's easy stay where it's easy and allow it to just fill up and

389
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:09,160
overflow as is what I would say and then I'm I could talk a lot about this I do

390
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:14,680
want to maybe reiterate what I said earlier don't be alarmed if things other

391
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:20,000
than loving kindness arise there's something about when we touch into the heart you know the heart is filled with

392
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:27,400
all kinds of things including grief and anger and you know hurt and there's a

393
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:33,680
way in which loving kindness practice is a purification practice that we're creating the conditions in which some of

394
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:39,760
these things that we maybe aren't in touch with come up and if you feel like

395
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:45,359
oh there's a lot of anger or rage then I would say switch to mindfulness practice

396
00:49:45,359 --> 00:49:51,079
and just be with the anger and be with the rage feel it in the

397
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:56,760
body and make space for it so you can like just switch over to mindfulness

398
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:05,400
practice if that arises yeah what are some of the other

399
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:12,680
maybe yeah we we'll use the um so what are some of the other

400
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:20,040
mantras or phrases that you might use if you do feel like these ones maybe are a bit more they don't quite resonate as

401
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:28,640
well for you yeah so these are based on like you know classic teachings um

402
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:35,880
so may you know peace well I'm using may you and for some people that that alone

403
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:41,000
feels clunky but um the reason to use

404
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:48,119
kind of language like that is to support an intention of sending or you know like

405
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:53,799
we want them to have good experiences so we're not like trying to

406
00:50:53,799 --> 00:51:01,799
evoke some power that's going to um uh zap them into having whatever

407
00:51:01,799 --> 00:51:08,640
experience so is is that the clunky part the Mayu or is the clunky part the safe happy healthy

408
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:12,279
ease or all of

409
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:21,480
it I like the piece one more yeah I think it's the

410
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:27,280
yeah yeah so so rather than may you maybe there's

411
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:34,799
uh something like uh wishing you peace wishing you

412
00:51:34,799 --> 00:51:41,839
wellbeing the the little bit problem with saying like wishing you is because then it makes it clear that there's a me

413
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:47,839
here that's wishing you out there

414
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:53,599
um you know if you were to Google like phrases for Brahma varara you'll find

415
00:51:53,599 --> 00:51:58,760
all kinds of things but I guess the idea is like you don't

416
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:04,240
want to have that distinction between I and you you're just it's sort of all

417
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:10,000
Universal yeah it's um yeah we don't want to emphasize yeah that that yeah

418
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:17,240
I'll say that I wish you ease or you know

419
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:23,480
that even I mean that is what's happening but there's a way in which uh

420
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:28,880
when we are emphasizing like I and you then yeah it's the separation that gets

421
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:35,359
emphasized I'm here wishing you something else so without going so far as like we're all connected but just not

422
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:41,440
emphasizing separation okay any any other questions

423
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:46,880
before I move on I want to say a little bit about equinity because I think this is like such a good practice to do

424
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:55,520
sometimes with loving kindness practice and Diana there's another one it's a little long um do we need

425
00:52:55,520 --> 00:53:03,200
mindfulness while practicing loving kindness towards the world uh so that we can exercise a

426
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,640
little bit of discernment in potentially dangerous

427
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:16,720
situations so to exercise discernment so I would say that

428
00:53:16,720 --> 00:53:24,680
warm-heartedness is not passivity it is not being a doormat it is not uh not

429
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:31,640
having boundaries uh I would say the opposite actually if we're doing loving kindness for ourselves if we really care

430
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:37,319
and respect ourselves then we set clear boundaries like okay this is acceptable

431
00:53:37,319 --> 00:53:42,400
for people to treat me this way but not that way um this is tolerable in the

432
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:50,240
world and not but um when you say it's not tolerable in the world then you uh

433
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:56,480
you're able to go out in the world and do things from a place of care as a

434
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:04,760
opposed to a place of anger which is you know a world of difference so to come from a place of love like this is the

435
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:11,000
because I care for these people this is what I want to do instead of maybe a mind thing that uh says that this is

436
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:17,359
what should be done so I would say that loving kindness for like the whole

437
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:22,640
world um I gave that an of like you know filling up the pool then spilling out

438
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:29,119
spilling out I would have the all the whole world only do that after we have all these other categories there's a

439
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:34,200
there's a just warm-heartedness for all beings

440
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:40,440
and just allowing that to happen otherwise it starts it ends up becoming something in the mind right the if we're

441
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:46,599
saying to the whole world then that's just a concept and it's not something that we can be really connected to so

442
00:54:46,599 --> 00:54:54,400
that's uh that would be my something I'd offer [Applause] there okay so just to say a little bit

443
00:54:54,400 --> 00:55:00,440
about equinity here is that um equinity gets spoken about in

444
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:05,559
a few different ways in this tradition and in this type in this uh setting I

445
00:55:05,559 --> 00:55:14,040
want to talk about it in terms of this heart practices this uh warmth practices so

446
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:24,160
equinity it um it's this type of love but it's a love of we might say of

447
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:29,520
Truth so it's we can use that as an antidote to feeling out of balance but

448
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:36,240
it's a it's a truth or it's a recognition of what is actually happening it's a recognition of what's

449
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:41,480
like the big picture and seeing it within a balanced

450
00:55:41,480 --> 00:55:47,520
way and here's what's so important about recognizing equinity in this setting is

451
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:54,920
that it's um it's definitely connected just like meta is we're really connected

452
00:55:54,920 --> 00:56:01,680
equinity is re connected cuz sometimes people when they hear this word equinity they think

453
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:06,839
aloofness this is not aloofness they think a disconnection this is not

454
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:13,760
disconnection or they think there's a passivity or like I don't care apathy or

455
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:21,240
something like that no this is connected caring and

456
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:26,680
stable not being pushed around or not getting agitated

457
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:32,799
and sometimes why we need equinity is because when we're doing loving kindness

458
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:38,720
as I said earlier for individuals that are you know we could see that they're

459
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:43,799
making decisions that in our view is not in their best interest and we really

460
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:50,480
want to essentially control them we don't think that in our minds we're not using

461
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:57,160
that language but we want to we know we really want them to behave differently and and then we

462
00:56:57,160 --> 00:57:02,280
there's an agitation that arises like oh dang it if you would only do this or if

463
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:07,599
you could only see that that there's a way that this or if you would only stop

464
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:13,720
doing this or you should start doing that and there's that that shows up as

465
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:21,400
an agitation an equinity is this recognition that everybody is in control

466
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:27,839
of their own life they make decisions for

467
00:57:27,839 --> 00:57:34,839
themselves they might know how much we love them but they are still making their own decisions and sometimes we

468
00:57:34,839 --> 00:57:41,319
just need to remind ourselves that and it allows us to maybe get a little bit

469
00:57:41,319 --> 00:57:49,000
less entangled connected but not Tangled and connected in such a way that

470
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:54,960
because we love them we respect that they can live their life in the way that

471
00:57:54,960 --> 00:58:01,640
they can of course right I'm talking about adults you know children we need to guide them and things like this but

472
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:07,920
there's a way in which equinity can really support

473
00:58:08,599 --> 00:58:13,359
um sometimes the disappointment

474
00:58:14,039 --> 00:58:21,079
or yeah this feeling that sometimes uh that arises when we really really want

475
00:58:21,079 --> 00:58:27,160
somebody to be happy and they're not happy and then that's you know it's a

476
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:33,559
little bit of a heartbreak that happens so how can we you know sincere and

477
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:40,440
continually sending them a meta Goodwill even though that they're just

478
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:46,240
behaving the way that maybe they they won't be happy maybe they won't

479
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:53,760
be it doesn't you know it doesn't stop us from wishing it

480
00:58:54,720 --> 00:59:02,680
so there's different types of uh phrases that we can use with

481
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:08,200
equinity these phrases are something like I wish you

482
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:14,079
happiness and I cannot make your decisions for

483
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:21,960
you you can feel that right there's this warmth but also this recognition that you know people make their own

484
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:29,720
decisions or another phrase is I care about you and I cannot keep you from

485
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:34,799
difficulties this is the nature of the Human Experience humans have

486
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:41,720
difficulties and even though we love somebody dearly it's not enough to protect them you know from all the

487
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:47,799
difficulties that can arise in one's life the third

488
00:59:47,799 --> 00:59:54,559
phrase your happiness and unhappiness depend upon your

489
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:59,720
actions not upon my wishes for

490
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:08,280
you and then the last one is no matter how I might wish things to

491
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:13,559
be otherwise things are as they

492
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:22,280
are just wishing something was different doesn't make it different and sometimes we're funny I've

493
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:28,079
noticed this like the ways that we think or maybe I should speak for myself sometimes I would have this idea like

494
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:35,039
okay if I wished for something hard enough then it would happen but just wishing doesn't make things happen I

495
01:00:35,039 --> 01:00:41,640
mean to say that out loud sounds silly but there's a way in which we find ourselves kind of like doing this in the

496
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:46,520
back of our minds kind like pushing really wanting

497
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:55,760
something so why don't we do just a short little meditation practice here with uh equinity

498
01:01:06,839 --> 01:01:13,960
so [Music] again feeling connected to our sitting

499
01:01:13,960 --> 01:01:17,559
surface we're

500
01:01:20,119 --> 01:01:27,119
here and just tuning into just a few breaths here

501
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:45,520
feeling the body

502
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:59,760
breathing and then we'll do a little bit of loving kindness for The Lovable being

503
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:04,760
again just connecting with the lovable

504
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:18,720
being may you be

505
01:02:22,160 --> 01:02:27,480
safe may you be happy

506
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:36,799
may you be

507
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:47,720
healthy may you live with ease

508
01:02:56,039 --> 01:02:59,160
may you be

509
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:12,318
safe connecting with the lovable being may you be

510
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:25,318
happy may you be as healthy as you can

511
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:33,240
may you live with

512
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:48,400
ease stay here for just a few more moments with the lovable

513
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:54,760
being connecting with a sense any sense of warm-heartedness

514
01:04:08,160 --> 01:04:15,960
allow yourself to feel the care you have for this lovable being

515
01:04:36,599 --> 01:04:44,960
and now bring to mind somebody you have a relationship with somebody you care

516
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:51,880
about and somebody who sometimes is a little

517
01:04:51,880 --> 01:04:57,880
irritating not the most difficult person in your life somebody you care about but

518
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:05,838
sometimes is a little [Music] Annoying bring this person to

519
01:05:08,039 --> 01:05:14,559
mind connect with them visualize

520
01:05:21,440 --> 01:05:27,520
them and for this person we'll do equinity phrases

521
01:05:27,799 --> 01:05:35,680
I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices

522
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:38,119
for

523
01:05:53,839 --> 01:06:02,520
you I care about about you and I cannot keep you from

524
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:28,000
suffering your happiness and unhappiness depend upon your

525
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:34,279
actions not upon my wishes for you

526
01:06:56,319 --> 01:07:05,559
no matter how I might wish things to be otherwise things are as they

527
01:07:13,599 --> 01:07:19,279
are and I would recommend choosing one of those sentences and just using a

528
01:07:19,279 --> 01:07:27,520
single one we'll go through them again

529
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:35,079
see which one of these resonates with

530
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:45,520
you I wish you happiness and I cannot make your choices

531
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,920
for you

532
01:08:04,760 --> 01:08:12,880
I care about you and I cannot keep you from suffering

533
01:08:34,679 --> 01:08:40,238
your happiness and unhappiness depend upon your

534
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:46,838
actions not upon my wishes for you

535
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:13,719
no matter how I might wish things to be otherwise things are as they are

536
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:39,520
and then to end this meditation feel your feet on the

537
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:46,559
ground the pressure of the seat against your

538
01:09:48,960 --> 01:09:55,880
body and when you're ready you can gently open your eyes

539
01:09:57,340 --> 01:10:06,399
[Music]

540
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:20,239
so with that meditation I started with you know being

541
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:26,880
present here few with the breath and then some loving kindness with the lovable being and I think that's a key

542
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:33,760
aspect because we want these phrases to come from care not from a you're

543
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:39,920
responsible for yourself you know it's uh we want it to be a way you know to express how much we

544
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:46,800
care for others and respect others and while maintaining

545
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:52,800
um while not getting out of balance ourselves sometimes we're leaning so far

546
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:59,280
in and trying to fix and make things happen and sometimes it's really appropriate I'm not saying to not to

547
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:04,400
help others that would of course not but it's the way that sometimes like our

548
01:11:04,400 --> 01:11:10,400
sense of well-being gets uh compromised if we are insisting that things go a

549
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:17,199
certain way without recognizing the autonomy of other people of

550
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:23,120
course so I offered four phrases it's a lot of words I would just choose one

551
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:29,960
phrase and just use that one repeat l or maybe there's two that uh Mak sense

552
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:38,440
to you um I'll also say that uh at IMC we have

553
01:11:38,440 --> 01:11:46,679
what we call happy hour so it's from 6 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. Monday through Friday so 5 days a week There's a guided

554
01:11:46,679 --> 01:11:51,880
meditation on loving kindness acronymity all four of the Brahma vajas

555
01:11:51,880 --> 01:11:58,600
and so this I taught for a number of years and now there's like a a collection of uh teachers who are doing

556
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:03,960
this so it's it's a great practice and there have been people it's quite

557
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:11,199
something that have been going there every day for years and they're talking about how their lives are just different

558
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:18,719
you know just having tuning in on Zoom it's a zoom thing you can get the link on the IMC calendar so I recommend this

559
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:25,920
if you're interested in exploring this to you maybe some guided meditation you're welcome to do that or um all the

560
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:31,600
recordings for that happy era gets posted on Audio Dharma so hundreds and

561
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:36,920
hundreds of recordings so uh you'll be able to hear some of

562
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:42,239
those also uh Sharon salzburg's book loving kindness if you don't know about

563
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:48,080
it it's kind of the classic here and I think it's a wonderful book so if you feel like you want to learn some more or

564
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:55,440
dig some more into it and I didn't manage the time so well

565
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:01,239
this evening so we're at the end of our time together but um I'd be happy to answer any questions or if anybody has

566
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:06,760
some comments about uh equinity or loving kindness practice or Brahman

567
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:11,840
vajar practice if anybody has something they'd like to say or or you're welcome

568
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:19,280
to come up here afterwards too okay so next week we'll do something

569
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:28,760
a little bit different uh but also uh to kind of build on our mindfulness practice so thank you
