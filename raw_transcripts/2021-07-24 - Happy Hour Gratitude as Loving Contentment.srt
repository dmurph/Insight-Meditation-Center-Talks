1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:07,200
so so formal hello and warm welcome to all of you

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:14,960
ah dear friends so for today's practice theme

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:21,439
this past week we've been exploring um gratitude and

4
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:28,160
and meta and gratitude so to wrap up this week and continuing with

5
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,160
this theme a couple of insights came up on wednesday that i

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,920
wanted to follow up on insights from your practice that came up

7
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:47,760
and to dedicate this hour to exploring them further formally

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,360
and that is the insight of how meta and

9
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:02,079
gratitude can support each other how they can support each other and and

10
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:07,280
perhaps maybe a unified way of seeing the two practices

11
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:13,920
so for some meta might be an easier way to get into

12
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:20,320
gratitude for some it might be gratitude actually greases the wheels and to get for

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,680
getting into meta so and both are good and now what we'll

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,240
explore is actually setting the frame starting with some practice of gratitude

15
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,600
to to um grease the wheels as a precursor to meta to see what that

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,799
feels like if we enter that way if we enter into meta

17
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,560
from priming the heart with gratitude to experiment that way and see how that

18
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,079
works that's one thing to keep in mind for tonight and then there is another frame

19
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:05,360
also that i like to bring in and that is actually gratitude

20
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,039
as love huh what does that even mean gratitude as

21
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:18,000
love maybe we can think about it as the unified theory you know how in physics

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,640
the holy grail is to come up with the unified theory theory of everything so here the unified

23
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,680
theory of everything is unified theory of love so what how what if we consider

24
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,800
gratitude as loving loving everything

25
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:44,800
loving whatever is arising the sense of love as appreciation loving everything

26
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:51,680
loving even dukkha loving even difficulty loving it all

27
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:58,159
loving it all so gratitude as love and that's something that i'll

28
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:05,840
bring in for us to explore a little bit experiment with

29
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:12,879
so i think that's enough for setting the frame let's just

30
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:20,159
explore and as i'll always we'll start with settling the mind the body

31
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:27,440
the breath so let's begin let's begin our formal practice together

32
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,560
landing landing in our bodies

33
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,920
landing

34
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,480
in this moment in time with this breath

35
00:03:54,720 --> 00:04:01,840
can we let go can we let go of everything else

36
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:06,000
can we let go of expectations

37
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:15,840
can we let go of needs and wants

38
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:26,840
is it possible to just put down everything that is not necessary in this

39
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
moment

40
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,479
and turn turn inward

41
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,040
turn to the sacred space

42
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:03,120
within this universe within there is a universe with it

43
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:09,440
as complex as amazing a reflection [Music]

44
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,560
of the universe without outside

45
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,720
to turn to this holy universe within

46
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:32,240
where the breath moves

47
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:41,360
where there are sensations in this miraculous body

48
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:57,520
where there are feeling tones of pleasant

49
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,280
floating around unpleasant floating around just the same

50
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:21,840
neutral floating around and to open up to it all

51
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:03,840
coming home coming home to this universe

52
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,720
connecting with the breath

53
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,240
entirety of the in-breath

54
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:31,840
entirety of the opera

55
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,639
giving our heart completely to just this

56
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:03,599
to just this breath in this body in this

57
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
moment

58
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:26,720
putting down whatever is necessary thoughts plans memories

59
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:37,839
not needed right now thank you thoughts please come back later

60
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,720
just this in-breath just a sack breath

61
00:09:49,920 --> 00:10:05,839
while we are alive in this moment

62
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:18,480
can there be gratitude appreciation for just this breath

63
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:28,640
in this moment of being breathed in this life in this form

64
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,839
this body

65
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:11,839
can there be a sense of appreciation

66
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,680
for this body sitting

67
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:28,079
breathing the heart pumping

68
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,959
all these complex

69
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:41,360
chemical reactions happening every millisecond in this body this universe within

70
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:52,880
the blood the brain synapses the complex

71
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,519
chemistry physiology

72
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,839
which leads to hearing

73
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:17,360
sensing feeling cognizing

74
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,600
being aware that we don't quite understand but it's

75
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,480
always on

76
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:35,839

77
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:49,120
can we love

78
00:13:49,120 --> 00:14:03,839
be in awe of what is

79
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,360
even if there is discomfort in the body

80
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:18,560
when we label pain challenges

81
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,120
can there be appreciation

82
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:35,519
oh love for the process of this body

83
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:45,839
even as it is challenged

84
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,560
whether physical sensations or emotions

85
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:13,839

possible

89
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:53,680
and opening up this sphere sphere of awareness

90
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,120
of gratitude

91

00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:01,039
if these blessings even if they're inanimate objects

112
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:09,120
or concepts like health they're loving us they're giving us love giving us mental

113
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:15,679
giving us goodness wrapped wrapped in the blessings wrapped in the

114
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:23,840
love in the meta of all that we are grateful for

115
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:37,840
just receiving just receiving

116
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,639
receiving the goodness the love from our dwelling the roof over her head

117
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:15,440
as if it's wrapping us in meta in goodwill safety from the elements

118
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:22,080
the food we eat we have eaten that we're grateful for

119
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:27,760
loving us serving us

120
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:36,559
lovingly giving us energy feeling the love in our bodies

121
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:52,080
as much a health as we have feeling the love the goodness of

122
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:01,840
it

123
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:12,400
if we are engaged in the world nor work or volunteering if we're

124
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,520
grateful for that feeling that it loves us too

125
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:43,679
to bi-directional relationship

126
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:47,360
the people were grateful for

127
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:56,880
their blessings feeling that

128
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:11,840
they give us love meta goodwill

129
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,679
letting ourselves receive like a sponge

130
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:38,559
the goodness the blessings the love from everything we're grateful for

131
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:46,400
held held up lovingly

132
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,840
as if a blanket

133
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:31,840
and now as we receive this love this care this is a blanket we're wrapped in

134
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:36,000
receiving the goodness

135
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:45,840
nourished by this love now shining it outward

136
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:59,840
or letting it be shown outward not so much at doing but witnessing

137
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
appreciating

138
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:22,720

with each breath

147

in your own time either receiving more or giving more or receiving and giving

148
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:19,360
unclear who's giving what's receiving

sitting in gratitude and appreciation and love

150
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:35,840
for the expression of the universe within universe without

151
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:45,760

given all the causes and conditions if could have been different they would have been trust you're doing the best you can

158
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,200
and appreciating this being with you or hanging in here with practice with

00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:15,280
and you can share them in chat to me privately i won't say your name

173
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,520
and if public i will say your name and the reflection and

174
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:28,720
um can also raise your hand so question comes in chat

175
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:36,000
is the universe grateful for us even when we cause harm yeah

176
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:47,440
that's a very good question so it's an interesting perspective

177
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:53,920
so [Music] there are many different ways to see

178
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,560
this so has the do we cause harm intentionally

179
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:06,400
unintentionally the chances are we do not cause harm intentionally

180
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:12,800
it's very high it's i don't think even you know people who commit

181
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:19,440
say crimes etc if we know their background if we know

182
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:25,839
the way they see they see themselves they see and everything they see

183
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:32,320
they don't think they don't feel as if they're causing harm so so i want to make a distinction between

184
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:39,839
that so if we are not knowingly intentionally causing harm is the universe still loving us so

185
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:45,359
that's the way i like to to frame that question and i like to make it a little

186
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:51,119
larger so if i say something and unintentionally so now i make it more personal i

187
00:39:51,119 --> 00:39:56,400
intentionally harm you so i've caused harm is the universe

188
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,720
still loving me i think so i think so in this in this view

189
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:08,480
and the the the with the trust in the goodness in

190
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:16,480
each of us in the goodness in me that i do want to wake up i do want to do the best i can and

191
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:22,640
the causing harm is on the path of again it's not intentional it never seems to

192
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:28,800
be intentional it's along the ways of learning growing

193
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:34,640
so i think this can be a much longer conversation there are a lot of

194
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:41,280
different things that are coming in so i hope this gives it just a little bit of taste of

195
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:50,640
the way to frame the question um [Music] that the universe if you want to call it

196
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:57,359
but the nature if you want to call it the universe if you if you like god if you like uh

197
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:03,920
the divine there is a sense of goodness and love in in in and trust that

198
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,359
we in the goodness that we are trying to contribute even in the short term what we do is

199
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:14,960
causing harm uh without us intending to anyway i'm gonna pause there

200
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:22,640
and maybe be another chance to talk about that so

201
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:29,599
other reflections other questions feel free to raise your hand sarah says i like the idea of embracing

202
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:36,160
everything with love and gratitude even the so-called negative states like anger it opens up more space

203
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,520
acceptance and compassion than pushing them away does thank you sarah that's a great

204
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,720
observation wonderful insight on youtube yeah reflection

205
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,400
um i was moved by the invitation to trust in doing the best we can

206
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:59,680
at the tail end of the meditation it was something i could hold with kindness

207
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,440
uh to trust that we're doing the best we can beautiful invitation yeah thank you

208
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:11,200
thank you for that reflection yes trusting that trusting that that we

209
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,640
are doing the best we can and we all screw up every single one of us we are not

210
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:23,599
perfect of course we make mistakes of course we cause harm of course we do and let's

211
00:42:23,599 --> 00:42:30,079
trust that we're still loved we're still love worthy as we in this

212
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:35,520
difficult life of being human filled with dukkha and joys and sorrows and we're all we're

213
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:41,680
still doing our best we're still loved the universe doesn't turn away just because we screw up and

214
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:47,359
we cause harm um so yeah thank you for that

215
00:42:47,359 --> 00:42:55,040

216
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:03,839
this is claire please

217
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:13,280
i just wanted to add a note with something you touched on but i just wanted to expand on it i've you had a gratitude practice for a

218
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,440
number of years and it's really enriched my life and it's i i was able to finally

219
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:24,880
work work with it when somebody told me that or taught me that gratitude is

220
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:30,000
wanting what you have yeah yeah and uh it

221
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,880
turned my whole perception of my life around yeah yeah beautiful yeah

222
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,440
it's very important yeah exactly it's one gratitude is wanting what you have

223
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:49,920
and it's it's a contented love you know when there's a sense of love as i was bringing in the meditation

224
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:56,480
the same concept when you love what is without wanting more of it it's

225
00:43:56,480 --> 00:44:01,760
