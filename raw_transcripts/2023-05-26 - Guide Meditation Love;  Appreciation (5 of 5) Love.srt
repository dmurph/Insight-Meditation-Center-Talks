1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,500
so hello everyone

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:13,320
so for those of you who didn't hear earlier

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:20,960
the week that when this finishes at around 7 45 we'll switch over to a zoom room

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:27,000
and those of you who can stay will have a community meeting just a gathering and

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,920
maybe talk a little bit about the Dharma or

6
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:40,800
our community and I can answer some questions maybe do a breakout group we

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,739
meet each other a little bit and um hopefully uh somewhat simple and

8
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:55,620
friendly time together that's a little different than being on YouTube I'll post the link later here in the

9
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,620
chat and also it's posted on the IMC homepage you'll find it two places there

10
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:09,560
one is under the bottom right where there's what's new and then on the calendar

11
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:13,280
IMC calendar for today

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,220
so excuse me

13
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:27,920
so in some conventional way

14
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,360
meditation involves an inward looking

15
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:39,240
being really present here for oneself and uh there are variations of

16
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:47,040
meditation that operates somewhat differently but it still involves a heightened development

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:54,119
of of the development of heightened development of personal qualities

18
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,060
nothing else of our capacity for awareness

19
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,219
and so there is a kind of focus on this apparatus we are as a human being that

20
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:10,319
or and I'd like to propose that in the

21
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:17,459
field for the for the practice of compassion that it's invaluable

22
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:22,500
for us to be deeply connected to ourselves in a positive way

23
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:28,020
that the rush to be compassionate without having first established a

24
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,860
healthy relatedness to this being that we are can lead to misdirected compassion and

25
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:42,420
lead to compassion which can even be harmful for oneself and our compassion for others so much

26
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:48,980
richer if we have established a healthy relatedness to ourselves

27
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,620
and so um we sit and meditate and so some of these things about appreciation we've talked

28
00:02:55,620 --> 00:03:01,700
about this week can apply to oneself to so to appreciate oneself

29
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:06,900
to um understand oneself understand all the

30
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,140
aspects of Who We Are and not be limited by any understanding

31
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:19,080
so that the appreciation is not limited by self-criticism or

32
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:24,540
shame that we carry or regrets or resentments we carry

33
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,720
and then to to understand ourselves so depreciate ourselves understand

34
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:37,560
ourselves to respect ourselves to to view ourselves as a valuable human

35
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:44,220
being maybe not because what we have done or not done in our lives but because

36
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:51,080
inherently being a human being is a precious and valuable event

37
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:57,360
and to Value ourselves to treat ourselves worthy of Love of care of

38
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,420
respect and to respect ourselves to respect our potential

39
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:10,140
and then to have some deeper acceptance of ourselves and a kind of acceptance

40
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:16,500
that we're willing to accept and to be open to be present to allow for all of

41
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,040
who we are to exist here and to allow for it all with non-harming

42
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:29,280
we're not going to harm any of it we're going to see it and know it and in

43
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,840
this deeper appreciation for ourselves then be able to hold it all

44
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,620
and um and uh and do all those things then when

45
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:50,220
we're ready for compassion we are ready for something more and there's one more step in

46
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:56,520
appreciation which I'll talk about later but for now I'd like to kind of offer a

47
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:01,860
summary for all this when we sit to meditate and

48
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:09,900
that is to sit and meditate with gratitude gratitude is often closely connected to

49
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:16,380
appreciation and we appreciate and then we're grateful for what we appreciate

50
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:23,880
and to be sit and meditate in gratitude in a thanks Thanksgiving to ourselves to

51
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,820
this life to be born to our situation and of course it's hard sometimes to

52
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:35,759
feel gratitude for a situation for ourselves a situation we found ourselves in

53
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,419
but to sit down to meditate to have the ability the capacity to sit meditate to

54
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:47,759
lie down to meditate to be able to sit quietly

55
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:53,699
and have the ability to turn the attention inward is a

56
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:59,820
phenomenal gift it's a rare gift in this world that people actually take this kind of time

57
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:06,419
to connect to something deep inside it's uh we're entering into a world that

58
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:13,080
few were few people actually spend much time in the world of care the world of

59
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:19,680
of the Dharma the world of the non-harming the world of waking up and

60
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:25,800
being present wow this is phenomenal very few people have this take the time

61
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,180
have this opportunity for this so even if you feel like you things are difficult and challenging here for you

62
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:37,500
yes they probably are and what a gift to

63
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:43,500
sit down a few people have this thing that we're doing now for the next few minutes you

64
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:49,740
might know a lot of meditators so it doesn't seem like it's a rare gift boy is it rare

65
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:56,100
that you enter into this kind of inner world for liberated world that we're pointing to

66
00:06:56,100 --> 00:07:02,000
in the Dharma so to take a meditation posture

67
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,020
that's a suitable for you

68
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:14,660
and gently close your eyes

69
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:22,860
and adjust your posture posture suitable for you

70
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:30,120
to do this sacred work of waking up to what's here even if

71
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,199
what's here is difficult

72
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:47,039
and to begin offering a kind of self-care begin offering yourself a willingness to

73
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:54,479
enter the sacred world of attention by gently tenderly taking a few deeper

74
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:00,560
breaths and relaxing on the exhale

75
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:15,380
taking a few long deep breaths

76
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:27,020
in really relaxing more on the end of the exhale letting go or releasing of all things

77
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:41,659
and then letting your breathing return to normal

78
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:49,459
and consider that the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

79
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:58,680
is is a thread Through Time

80
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,480
through all our experiences

81
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:10,459
which provide us a grounding and in being aware

82
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,220
being aware of the breathing

83
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:27,120
is a way to not be caught in the thoughts the mind

84
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:34,220
the feelings we have but to gently

85
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,540
stay grounded in continuous

86
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,480
to move through time with time

87
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:54,800
without stepping out of the flow of time into our thoughts and feelings

88
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,420
this gentle massage

89
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,180
that supports Us in being aware

90
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:02,640
his time the mind wanders away in thought each time you remember

91
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:10,740
to reconnect to the here to be aware each moment of mindfulness

92
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:17,220
each breath you breathe a time for gratitude

93
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:20,420
for appreciation

94
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:26,540
for a kind of inspiration

95
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:33,079
of gratitude

96
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:44,639
for this precious opportunity to be alive

97
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:51,320
to be breathing to be practicing

98
00:12:52,440 --> 00:13:01,260
waking up waking up from suffering

99
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,040
to meditate in gratitude

100
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:09,380
regardless of the difficulties you have

101
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:15,260
can you establish your awareness practice

102
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:22,039
with gray with an element of gratitude

103
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:31,460
is there something about Here and Now that you can be grateful for

104
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:40,740
that supports encourages you invites you

105
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:48,500
to stay present for breathing your body

106
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,820
to your capacity to be aware and present

107
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,000
foreign

108
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:10,580
and then to end this sitting

109
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:16,700
with a question

110
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,240
what are you grateful for

111
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:37,580
that in recognizing and acknowledging your breathing becomes easier

112
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:49,760
a gratitude that allows something to relax

113
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:02,100
at gratitude about some fundamental way in which

114
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,299
you are alive

115
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,480
and then being grateful

116
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:33,900
perhaps finding an inspiration inside to share your good fortune

117
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:41,778
with others maybe and wishing them well

118
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:47,600
wishing them to share some of

119
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:55,399
what you're grateful for your benefits or your fortune

120
00:27:55,500 --> 00:28:03,799
your good fortune to practice a path to the freedom of from suffering

121
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:12,980
May others also find a way to that freedom

122
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:21,440
may all beings be happy may all beings

123
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:28,799
be safe may all beings be peaceful

124
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:36,480
may all beings be free and may each of us in our own way

125
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:43,620
contribute to that in the world May the goodness and Fortune of Our

126
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:49,340
Lives serve for the welfare and happiness of all

127
00:28:57,620 --> 00:29:01,600
[Music]

128
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:12,860
thank you very much and um

129
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:16,980
so good morning everyone and

130
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:24,919
or hello wherever you are in the time zones and uh

131
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:33,179
so um at the end of this um

132
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:39,059
our teaching here I'm going to post a zoom link for our community meeting

133
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:44,760
those of you would like to stay and it's also found on the imc's homepage under

134
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:50,399
what's new and a calendar and it has a password and the password

135
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:57,659
is a theme of this week which is appreciate so um please remember to appreciate when you

136
00:31:57,659 --> 00:32:03,360
when I enter the zoom room s

137
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:08,760
so we come to the end of the week focusing

138
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:15,620
on appreciation as a foundation for compassion and there's one a more element that I

139
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:22,260
associate with appreciation that is inevitable as invaluable

140
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:28,039
and I'll introduce it this way that um

141
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:41,159
without there being love first I worry that compassion is not really

142
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:47,700
compassion that love is a

143
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:55,200
yeah I is a necessary component of compassion

144
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:01,860
and I say that because of sometimes people feel an obligation to care for

145
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:06,960
others they feel alarmed they feel worried they feel upset about suffering

146
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,000
in the world suffering in others they feel fear and relationship to it

147
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,100
and they carry with them a strong sense of obligation like I'm supposed to I

148
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:23,340
need to or a strong sense that I have to address this and deal with this because I'm so

149
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:30,480
uncomfortable and they're addressing suffering they're trying to uh

150
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,880
bring that suffering to an end and so the actions can look like

151
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,399
compassionate actions but they're not informed by love they're

152
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:48,779
not informed by a deep appreciation valuing understanding of others

153
00:33:48,779 --> 00:33:54,720
and these first four themes of this week I'd like to suggest are also in really

154
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:01,100
necessary for healthy love that there's an appreciation of others

155
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:06,899
there is an understanding of them there is a respect for them

156
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:14,220
and there is a certain kind of acceptance of them in in Love Without a healthy dosage of

157
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:19,858
each of these can easily become skewed it can easily become problematic

158
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:26,220
and there might be other important elements of love but uh those four I

159
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:32,398
think are really invaluable and um and leads us to a kind of a

160
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:40,858
healthy love a healthier almost like love is almost like appreciating the beauty of others it's appreciating and

161
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:47,099
valuing the wonderfulness of a connection of a of a feeling of warmth

162
00:34:47,099 --> 00:34:53,520
the feeling of closeness a feeling of delight the feeling of

163
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:03,980
of real appreciation for the the wonderfulness of people

164
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:09,000
the sense of gratitude for them and grateful to be in their presence and

165
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:16,260
happy to be in their presence love is many different things and uh and for each person maybe what

166
00:35:16,260 --> 00:35:25,079
love is is is different and love is different in different situations so I offer it to you as a as a reference

167
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:31,680
point for your investigation for your uh you're really grappling with compassion

168
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:38,700
considering it deeply and that is without love there can't be compassion

169
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:46,380
so that's the the last uh element of appreciation is love and we know that

170
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:52,500
love has a big range of what people mean by that and maybe I'd suggest that there's uh

171
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:57,540
not only a wide range but also a different degrees of strength than

172
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:04,619
different forms of love and but still some form of love needs to

173
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:11,460
be there for uh for compassion and so how do we love people

174
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:18,720
can we have love for others without some love for ourselves if we don't have something like love for

175
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:26,040
ourselves then um can we do we does our love arise from

176
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:31,820
a healthy place there's our love for others arrived from some place that

177
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:39,240
people Delight in our love and our appreciation of them if love comes from Fear if love comes

178
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:46,079
from a sense of loneliness or love comes from the desire for the other person to

179
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,420
provide something for me then love is maybe not really suitable

180
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:58,520
that love is not suitable for compassion which is a genuine respectful care for the suffering of others

181
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,560
I've known people for whom um uh the source the reason they loved

182
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:10,680
others what they called love the reason why there was a strong attraction strong orientation towards a

183
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,720
strong desire to be with him was uh was because the other person

184
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:20,940
provided love the other person loved them and valued them and delighted them

185
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:27,660
and it wasn't exactly the other person they loved what they loved was how the person treated them what they got from

186
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:33,359
the person made them feel good and happy felt needed or something

187
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:39,480
and maybe that's a form of love but is the love that is not coming from need

188
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:46,020
the love is it that's in a pure appreciation of the other person independent of what we receive and

189
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:51,240
return from them and so with compassion the care the

190
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:57,740
loving that come loving care for others suffering that brings that brings

191
00:37:57,740 --> 00:38:03,540
appreciation of them and understanding of them and respect for them and an

192
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:10,500
acceptance of them um that uh all those take precedence in

193
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:15,599
where the source of Love is in us that yes we appreciate them there's a

194
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:22,079
gratitude there's Delight there's seeing the preciousness and the inherent value

195
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,119
of others the worth of others and that is what we Delight in that is what we

196
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:33,480
love and appreciate one of the teachings of Buddhism is that

197
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:39,480
as we develop a greater appreciation for our own Beauty in capacity for Dharma

198
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:44,940
beauty within that we have eyes to see the beauty in other people

199
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:51,960
and if if no matter who we see even our Nemesis that do we have the capacity to

200
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:58,440
see something in there that's beautiful in their hearts and their minds and can there be some kind of love for

201
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,099
that that's not naive love for that that we still protect ourselves so still find

202
00:39:05,099 --> 00:39:10,859
some way to to care for ourselves and to not Overlook the fact that their

203
00:39:10,859 --> 00:39:16,980
behavior is unacceptable but to see the beauty to love

204
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:22,980
so the the uh these four these five qualities of this week

205
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:28,680
um acceptance understanding respect acceptance and now

206
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,980
love is the acronym for oral the uh that means to to listen or having

207
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:40,800
to do with listening and uh I chose this acronym because

208
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:48,180
um uh can there be appreciation with how they they kind of uh receptivity of

209
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:54,240
really listening deeply to someone they're kind of listening that happens before we speak

210
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:01,200
the kind of receptivity and taking in people and their situation that that

211
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:07,980
happens prior to judgments and ideas and solutions and all this to really just

212
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:13,260
listen deeply so that we can appreciate them

213
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:18,140
Delight in them respect them in deep ways

214
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:24,780
so uh so love what form of Love Can you have

215
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:30,180
that is realistic that doesn't have such a high bar

216
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:35,220
that uh your gosh you need to gush over them or do you need to somehow forgive

217
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:41,420
them or you need to somehow um uh

218
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:48,839
like them even is there some kind of deep fundamental love that's possible

219
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:55,320
when there is some degree with you when you find something to appreciate in others

220
00:40:55,320 --> 00:41:02,700
you find understanding of them in a deeper way that you find respect for them

221
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:09,720
you find acceptance of something there what is that for you

222
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,540
so I would like this last talk to be more of a challenge to you than offering

223
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:21,680
you finished complete ideas and the challenge is

224
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:28,560
what form of love is needed if you want to have compassion for the

225
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:34,320
world and what form of love is in that form of love is needed for

226
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,260
compassion what form does that take that's appropriate for you that's right

227
00:41:40,260 --> 00:41:47,400
for you and and so rather than agreeing or

228
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:52,740
disagreeing with what I said what I'd challenge you to do is to find a find

229
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:58,279
how it's this can be true in your terms in your way

230
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:04,020
how is it true for you that something called love is the important precursor for

231
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:12,540
compassion and what is the nature of that love so that's the challenge and uh I'd like

232
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:17,599
to leave you with and maybe you'll have something to say about that in our community meeting

233
00:42:17,599 --> 00:42:23,160
and so I'll post now the zoom link it'll take me a couple of minutes myself to

234
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:32,000
get into the room so some of you probably get in and just have to wait for me and so let's say so here is the

235
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:39,920
there's a link there it is oops

236
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:48,260
so did it come through

237
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:52,700
I don't know if it came through

238
00:42:55,740 --> 00:43:00,079
why is not do the return

239
00:43:03,839 --> 00:43:10,859
there we go no I said I don't know if it can't didn't come through did it

240
00:43:10,859 --> 00:43:16,079
also uh not yet well I'm going to do it over in the other computer as well so as

241
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:22,380
I said it's on the IMC home page under what's new uh the first item there

242
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:28,440
and also um and maybe for some reason I'm not able

243
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,599
to send Chats on this computer that I have here so I'll do it over the other computer

244
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:39,480
