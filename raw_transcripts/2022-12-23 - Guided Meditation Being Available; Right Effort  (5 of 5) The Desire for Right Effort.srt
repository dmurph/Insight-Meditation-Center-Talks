00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:03,679
hello everyone

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,840
and I'm happy to be able to share this week on right effort

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:19,039
I think it's a really an essential area of practice

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,340
and easy to overlook even easy to think of effort as being somehow

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,859
effortful in a stressful way but there's also effortless effort

6
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:39,719
effort and uh so for uh today for the meditation

7
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,378
I would like to um emphasize

8
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:51,059
um that when we're going to do something

9
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,579
encounter something engage in something make some effort perhaps to do something important

10
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,420
if it's important enough we prepare ourselves for the event and um

11
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,640
someone who is playing a sport might

12
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:17,240
warm up first and prepare themselves for it a musician might do the same thing prepare themselves for performance

13
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:24,960
someone might going to give an important speech they might breathe deeply or calm

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:31,580
or be quiet for themselves for a while to gather themselves together to prepare themselves for what they're going to do

15
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:39,420
so this idea that we prepare ourselves is a common part of human life

16
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:47,460
and maybe in part a big part of meditation is uh especially when we start

17
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:54,140
but is preparing ourselves so that we are available

18
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,640
for what available for life

19
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:06,180
the alternative to being available is to go ahead log into our desires or wanting

20
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:14,459
trying to make something happen trying to assert ourselves and but to be available is a little bit

21
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:19,520
to get out of Our Own Way little it make room beyond our

22
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,560
opinions or ideas what should be how things are supposed to happen

23
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,260
to be available it's a very different stance or a way than to assert ourselves

24
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:37,760
and one of the things we can become available for is um

25
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:45,120
we can become available to um what wants to emerge

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:50,420
what is arising here and in particular

27
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,500
be attuned to what feels healthy what

28
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,840
feels good what feels wholesome what feels beneficial

29
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:07,800
what is it that arises if what Rises when we're available are difficult things difficult emotions

30
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:15,060
that might need to arise there can sometimes be a sense of goodness or rightness in allowing them

31
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:22,260
space and that availability the wholesomeness is the receptivity The Compassion the

32
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:27,840
care in which we open to receive what's difficult Within

33
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,739
but also what can arise is something really good and maybe the goodness the rightness of

34
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,900
just being available is so wonderful the energy of availability

35
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:46,879
so this being available is the theme of The Meditation today

36
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,280
so assuming a upright meditation posture

37
00:03:52,280 --> 00:04:01,040
and gently closing your eyes and to prepare yourself

38
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:11,459
for this meditation or to prepare yourself for an encounter

39
00:04:11,459 --> 00:04:17,780
a meeting with a phenomenally important person

40
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,900
and that person is yourself but to prepare yourself as if you're an

41
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,180
important and valuable and someone that you care for and love

42
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:35,699
how would you make yourself available to sit and be present with this

43
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:38,419
important person

44
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:48,419
so maybe you would take a posture that's not collapse not receding too

45
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:54,780
much but really showing that you're here and present

46
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,540
that your posture of being available

47
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:10,860
and with the eyes closed to take some long slow deep breaths

48
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,199
and as you exhale see if you can let go of other thoughts

49
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:23,120
and concerns that might get in the way of being available

50
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,680
for what's here

51
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,780
letting your breathing return to normal

52
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:52,919
taking a few breaths to continue the preparations

53
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,840
by relaxing your body

54
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:08,900
the more the body is at ease

55
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,639
the the more we have to be available with

56
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,539
greater sensitivity attentiveness more space to feel

57
00:06:21,539 --> 00:06:25,880
the fullness of our life

58
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:46,139
and then rather than focusing on breathing how would it be different

59
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:54,440
if you your awareness was available to the experience of breathing

60
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,160
to be available

61
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:33,919
and when the mind wanders off in thought in that wandering off

62
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:44,000
we're no longer available for our immediate experience of breathing a body of Here and Now

63
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:56,160
when you notice you're wondered off in thought re-establish

64
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:07,400
a sense of being available with your awareness with attention

65
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:13,039
not to assert yourself or require something to happen

66
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:20,360
but to see what emerges what wants to come what's here

67
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,639
allow things that are good to come into full awareness

68
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,080
but don't get lost by them don't get caught by them

69
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:42,300
so that the sense of availability to what's next

70
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:49,879
is eclipsed keep staying open available

71
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,139
with awareness available

72
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:20,819
might there be some feeling of wholesomeness goodness pleasure

73
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:25,940
in the sense of availability itself

74
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,079
available attention which is available

75
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:37,220
for the present moment

76
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:55,320
a sense of awareness available to experience

77
00:18:55,320 --> 00:19:01,080
can be supported by imagining there's lots of space

78
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:04,519
here in awareness

79
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:13,400
for things to arise where the difficult things

80
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:19,220
are easier with all the space around them

81
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:26,600
and the beneficial things have space to grow

82
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:35,419
allow the wholesome to spread out wide and fully

83
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:28,159
and then as we come to the end of the sitting take some gentle deeper breaths

84
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:35,159
is a way of expanding or returning

85
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:41,520
to a sense of being available to our present moment experience

86
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,020
whatever it might be

87
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:56,779
in the availability sense of availability that does take some kind of effort

88
00:24:56,940 --> 00:25:02,179
but maybe it's closer to an effortless effort

89
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:07,280
that an effort effortful one

90
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:40,100
and then to bring this meditation to an end

91
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:48,139
if you're care and connection to others

92
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,120
arose out of the sense of availability

93
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,179
where there's no resistance or no assertion

94
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:07,100
no obligation no protection

95
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:17,659
just available for oneself and for others

96
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:24,600
what would the nature of your kindness your care Your Love be

97
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,220
in such a circumstance

98
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:44,460
and perhaps with that as a reference point to give some thoughts

99
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:50,039
think about it in your own way of Goodwill

100
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:57,120
well wishing for others who do you have good will and well

101
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,840
wishing for

102
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:11,240
how do you want your Good Will and well wishing go out into the world

103
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:25,340
may all beings be happy

104
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:31,580
may all beings be safe

105
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,460
may all beings be peaceful

106
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:42,440
may all beings be free

107
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:53,120
and may my good will be available for all beings

108
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,299
thank you

109
00:28:56,279 --> 00:29:04,320
up so for this last talk on right effort

110
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,960
I would like to emphasize how incredibly important this topic is for anyone doing

111
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,840
Buddhist practice all the Buddhist practice could be summarized

112
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:21,740
as the practice of discovering what right effort is

113
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:27,299
and and kind of refining and maybe purifying

114
00:29:27,299 --> 00:29:32,640
effort so the effort is completely wholesome

115
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:38,460
and has no attachments no pressure no resistance in it there's a

116
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:45,840
freedom there's a ease there's a peacefulness in the efforts we make

117
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,980
and finding that uh you know the right effort the right way is in some ways a constant

118
00:29:52,980 --> 00:29:58,620
adjustment that we're making finding our way and over time it becomes second nature

119
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:05,460
just like riding a bicycle after a while becomes second nature even though you have to swerve around this way in that

120
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:10,580
way and make different kinds of effort depending on the grade you're driving on

121
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:16,740
or driving on a freeway in a car um we might you know kind of

122
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:23,100
conventionally say we're going straight down a lane but there's ever so small little movements left and right to the

123
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:28,380
car that we're constantly making uh adjustments for but doing it almost an

124
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:35,880
automatic so it's so it's second nature so the same way with the effort

125
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:43,500
but as we understand the difference between a wholesome effort and unwholesome effort wholesome mental

126
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:48,539
States and unwholesome mental States uh to really be able to see those and

127
00:30:48,539 --> 00:30:56,700
see them for what they are that the unwholesome drain us the unwholesome diminish us or stress us or are painful

128
00:30:56,700 --> 00:31:03,059
and the wholesome ones do the opposite that's a powerful Insight powerful

129
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:08,520
really to see that and then to have confidence and this is

130
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:14,700
an important thing real confidence that it's not worthwhile

131
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:21,000
to engage in things which are unwholesome to engage in unwholesome ways

132
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:27,899
if we want to live our lives don't make the effort that's unwholesome that's debilitating that's stressful

133
00:31:27,899 --> 00:31:34,740
to have confidence in the wholesome and it's hard to find that confidence in this kind of funny way many of us have

134
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:39,840
confidence in the unwholesome like that's how we'll be saved That's How we'll take care of ourselves that's how

135
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:45,960
we fulfill our responsibilities but in fact it does the opposite

136
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,260
and to as practice develops we have more confidence in the wholesome or to say it

137
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:59,220
may be more more kind of to the heart of it and the confidence and the unwholesome withers away

138
00:31:59,220 --> 00:32:05,520
and so we're not prioritizing it anymore and we're left more with the wholesome

139
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:12,600
but also we can prioritize it as we value the wholesome that we make space for we allow for it

140
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:20,399
we um not willing to sacrifice it we don't give it up for the unwholesome

141
00:32:20,399 --> 00:32:26,820
for the stressful uh so this idea that it's important to stay close to what's wholesome and

142
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:33,299
beneficial uh is part of with this Buddhist practice and what are some of these wholesome

143
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:38,640
states that we stay close to some of it is just being mindful staying present

144
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,360
some of it is as simple as being Mindful and Discerning and really

145
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:52,559
connected to have wisdom operate some of it is to be non-reactive

146
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:59,220
to have a certain degree of calm to be kind to have compassion

147
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:06,539
some of it might be to have a sense of uh pleasure or Delight or joy

148
00:33:06,539 --> 00:33:11,820
in all the different 32 Flavors of joy that can happen in practice that we

149
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:17,220
begin making room more available for this kind of sense of well-being that

150
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:24,720
can begin to be here and as we feel the well-being that's a reference point a support to

151
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:31,140
highlight when we lose it because of the unwholesome it's kind of a gives us the early

152
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:37,799
warning sign oh I'm going to lose this don't hold on to the wholesome

153
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:45,080
then we're doing something unwholesome the holding on so we're always looking always kind of

154
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:51,120
you know the Wholesome Way of investigating is this very simple thing what's is it

155
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:57,179
wholesome it is it stressful or is it uh unstressful is it beneficial is it

156
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:03,840
useful and any effort at all including the effort to investigate that

157
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,658
the effort to be mindful the effort to let go the effort to stay with the wholesome

158
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:17,940
effort has to be under the lens the frame of reference of this right effort

159
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:23,040
it's a powerful protection for us that the very way in which we practice

160
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:29,158
Buddhism is not going to be stressful for us that's not going to be detrimental to us

161
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:34,200
it's also a powerful way of of

162
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:39,240
discovering what freedom is because in the end to be able to live

163
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:45,780
the right effort with ease and choice and really stay close to that place where the effort

164
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:52,858
itself is almost effortless so easy or it doesn't carry the weight in this the

165
00:34:52,859 --> 00:35:00,599
stress of conceit and self that is a kind of Freedom that we have

166
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:06,180
so the in the Eightfold Path right effort is the sixth Vector the

167
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:11,520
seventh is mindfulness and the the how they're related is very

168
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,180
important here in the in the list that uh once we understand right effort

169
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:23,280
then the mindfulness we develop and gets to get stronger

170
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:29,280
um then can gives us more information in order to practice right effort

171
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:34,980
so the heightened awareness of attention that we develop we're more attentive to

172
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:40,500
the subtleties in which right effort wrong effort to operate within us

173
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:46,980
also but mindfulness itself then is protected by right effort if we're

174
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:53,640
usually we teach people mindfulness without teaching them right effort first and then for some people and then the

175
00:35:53,640 --> 00:36:00,720
first long period of time in my doing practice is discovering how to be mindful in a useful way in a healthy way

176
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:06,180
in a Wholesome Way but if we remember if we taught right

177
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:13,140
effort first and we really know what that is then when we start doing mindfulness practice we're looking at

178
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:19,440
the mindfulness efforts through the lens of right effort is how

179
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:26,720
I'm practicing mindfulness right effort am I practicing with greed or with

180
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:32,339
aversion that my straining am I pushing am I being assertive in a way that's not

181
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:39,180
wholesome or am I engaged in a nice way the way that brings ease and peace and

182
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:47,339
dedication do what I'm doing so in the background of all this is

183
00:36:47,339 --> 00:36:54,300
um that's a part and parcel of what the Buddha talked about when he talked about

184
00:36:54,300 --> 00:37:01,619
each of the four steps four kinds of right effort he talked about the generating desire

185
00:37:01,619 --> 00:37:07,020
and um and here he's talking about wholesome desire

186
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,960
and as we go through and learn about this right effort this is one of the gifts the treasures

187
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:21,180
is to learn how desires can be wholesome it can be beneficial no stress involved

188
00:37:21,180 --> 00:37:27,660
whatsoever in having a desire no compulsion that the desires themselves are

189
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:33,960
beneficial for us human beings constantly have desires some of them are

190
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:39,480
really unconscious and we don't really see we have the desire we don't call it desire

191
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:44,880
you know so you know I'm lifting up my arm to be a

192
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:51,960
little bit more emphatic as I speak there's a kind of desire to be emphatic to make a stronger point to desire to

193
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:58,440
move my arm that kind of is almost second nature so I could do it without thinking about it

194
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:04,440
and even without it consciously intending it but there's a desire there's desires all

195
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:09,720
the time human beings are kind of a stream of desires if you look at it

196
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:15,480
as we become aware of these desires aware that the choices we make

197
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:21,060
letting those desires flow out of the wholesome place

198
00:38:21,060 --> 00:38:26,119
we're cultivating the wholesome we're becoming the wholesome where

199
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:31,800
transforming ourselves into being available to be filled with goodness

200
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:38,579
filled with the wholesome the beneficial and then this miracle happens that the

201
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:45,000
desires we have come out of that wholesome place and the desires no longer seem

202
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:52,260
necessarily that their my desires even because the identification the attribution of self to it gets in the

203
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:57,780
way but at the same time we're tracking the desires to really know that they're

204
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:03,839
wholesome that they're beneficial and we're tracking a little bit the impact they have in the world around us

205
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:09,319
so that it's beneficial for them as other people as well

206
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:17,280
so um to generate desire

207
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:22,440
to prevent the arising of unwholesome

208
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:29,160
to care for ourselves enough to live a careful life to not carelessly live a life that the

209
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,500
unwholesome begins to take over to live a life that when the unwholesome

210
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:40,079
we recognize the unwholesomes in US we have a careful loving way that we try to

211
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,760
put it down or abandon it or at least not believe in it then go along with it

212
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:54,240
that we value the wholesome The Helpful The Beneficial and we make

213
00:39:54,240 --> 00:40:02,099
space for available for it to recognize it and support it and we rise to generate the desire to

214
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:10,040
maintain it to stay close to it to not lose it easily and once it's there

215
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:16,339
all of this generating desire done with ease with non-attachment

216
00:40:16,339 --> 00:40:20,240
non-clinging non-resistance

217
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:28,260
the desires that way the effort is that way and this is a good treasure to find our

218
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:34,200
way to this way so I hope that this has given you

219
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:39,599
something to look at and consider and practice with

220
