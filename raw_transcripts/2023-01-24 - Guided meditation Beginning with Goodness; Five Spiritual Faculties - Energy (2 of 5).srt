1
00:00:00,359 --> 00:00:05,720
so uh so welcome folks um

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:11,719
yeah nice to see her your names over there in the chat um

3
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:16,859
uh question about recordings those will be posted in a

4
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:21,900
couple couple days of volunteers working to uh edit those get those

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:28,340
posted to Audio Dharma but they're of course always available on YouTube

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:37,260
okay um very sweet all right let's uh

7
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:40,218
that's it

8
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,960
maybe we could summarize the Dharma saying

9
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,280
something like

10
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,618
we're becoming more and more sensitive to goodness

11
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,899
the goodness within oneself

12
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,360
goodness of others

13
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:12,720
goodness of Peace Love

14
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,680
wisdom

15
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:25,700
goodness of the path

16
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,959
sensitive to goodness

17
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:56,160
and the goodness that runs through US surrounds us becomes

18
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,239
both very ordinary and very touching

19
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:26,239
and becomes the foundation of our practice

20
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:37,620
kind of Bedrock from which our efforts emerge

21
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,360
to which our efforts return

22
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:03,680
how we live and we die

23
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:36,259
so sensing as we begin no way goodness runs right through you

24
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:52,199
if we get tight contracted

25
00:05:55,860 --> 00:06:02,600
let's touch back in with any uh

26
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,680
reminder goodness

27
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:19,460
ensuring we're not alienated from from it

28
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:02,060
poison that goodness we let the breath come to us

29
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,660
foreign

30
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,600
noticing the relief that comes

31
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:55,940
when oxygen hunger builds and we breathe in

32
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,740
saturating our body with exactly what it needs

33
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:24,019
no pleasure of breathing out

34
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:34,040
when we've been nourished by the in-breath

35
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:42,540
the relief of exhaling what's been

36
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:46,040
let's nourish their body

37
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:07,160
these cycles of giving receiving constitutes a life

38
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:39,500
we can be clear precise result higher resolution

39
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:48,079
in perceiving breath as it comes and goes

40
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:53,820
we're gonna be clear precise resolved

41
00:12:55,620 --> 00:13:00,620
that uh tension

42
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:26,120
kind of devotion that is uh unhurried

43
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:17,600
it's uh so natural to hedge our our bets on this moment

44
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:31,440
to uh try and tie up all the the Loose Ends of

45
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:38,340
Being Human so we allocate

46
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:47,179
some of our love to the Future to worry to the Past

47
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:00,799
but maybe

48
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:09,600
suspended in some some sense of goodness of care

49
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:17,480
we relax our vigilance feel safe enough

50
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:26,059
to [Music] devote ourselves to what's here

51
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,080
to your body breathing

52
00:19:52,500 --> 00:20:00,020
you don't need to manufacture the sacred

53
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,820
foreign

54
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,000
foreign

55
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:52,519
that's good to uh good to sit with you

56
00:30:53,640 --> 00:31:00,539
um so yesterday we started um with uh

57
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:05,880
with faith faith first of the the five faculties

58
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:14,240
and uh today uh um energy energetic Vigor very uh

59
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:20,460
so I I uh just a few days ago finished

60
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:27,659
um teaching a retreat at IRC with Inez Inez Friedman and um

61
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:33,899
the theme was was doing and non-doing and we would

62
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:41,340
sort of alternate Dharma talks and she represented the effortful side the

63
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:49,080
doing and I represented the dimensions of the path where we mostly get out of

64
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:54,600
the way and it really um

65
00:31:54,600 --> 00:32:01,200
it really is a dialectic between the doing and the non-doing

66
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:06,539
but the effortful side is no joke you

67
00:32:06,539 --> 00:32:12,899
know it's this is not this path is not something for nothing

68
00:32:12,899 --> 00:32:19,080
the uh and and guter and Nakaya the Buddha said that uh that he is careful

69
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:27,620
never to rest on contented with his skillful qualities

70
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:36,179
says relentlessly I exerted myself gladly would I let the flesh and blood

71
00:32:36,179 --> 00:32:43,020
in my body dry up leaving just the skin tendons and bones but if I had not attained what can be

72
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:50,279
reached through human firmness human persistence human striving there will be no relaxing

73
00:32:50,279 --> 00:32:57,000
my persistence yeah and uh

74
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,340
you hear that and you can see how it lands in your mind and

75
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:11,840
I think historically I've been quite inspired by kind of images of

76
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:16,398
warrior-like effort and uh

77
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:26,840
yeah they've held a certain place in my heart and mind but we want to interrogate where do we

78
00:33:26,899 --> 00:33:31,399
Source our effort from

79
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:37,140
sometimes it's okay to strive most long

80
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:42,299
term practitioners have periods of striving there's some striving there's

81
00:33:42,299 --> 00:33:47,580
some clinging and just so you know it it's not like we

82
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:54,659
um spontaneously combust if we strive

83
00:33:54,659 --> 00:34:01,200
but but all the the kind of willfulness can

84
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:08,960
actually reinforce a sense of self a sense of me striving to make practice

85
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:14,520
make practice work you know kind of

86
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:22,760
and that um that striving

87
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:30,300
yes solidifies the the kind of wrong view maybe we say

88
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:38,460
I I described a a very kind of willful mode of practice

89
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:43,500
to a teacher and uh with Incredible really just

90
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:49,260
Exquisite kindness the teacher said to me something like

91
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:55,220
Matthew you're running a Dharma race from stupid

92
00:34:55,220 --> 00:34:58,580
to stupid

93
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:07,020
moments you don't you don't forget that it actually filled me with delight you

94
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:12,960
know just to like feel in that moment released

95
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:20,339
yeah released from this willful mode of the area of effort because for me

96
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:26,540
somewhere early in my practice Viria and

97
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:34,740
sakya Didi got yolked together this effort and self-view the

98
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:41,400
contraction and tension of self got yoked together

99
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:47,400
and the sense of of who I was and my place

100
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:55,260
on the spiritual path and progress and my problems my defilements

101
00:35:55,260 --> 00:36:02,820
they're all kind of congealed in this sense of um yeah in a way beginning with

102
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:12,060
wrong View and there's this real um tangle of of dhamma Chanda and

103
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:19,940
conceit of damachanda longing long by heart longing for the Dharma

104
00:36:20,339 --> 00:36:25,980
and the kind of sincerity and and beauty of

105
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:31,859
that longing was mixed in with a whole raft

106
00:36:31,859 --> 00:36:38,339
of self-view and in that in that cell view in that

107
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:44,400
conceit uh there is self-harseness is born idealism

108
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:52,320
and unbalanced striving is born comparing mind competitiveness is born

109
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:57,480
a whole kind of um

110
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:04,380
blood of of pain and so

111
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:11,579
we we make effort we really do make effort

112
00:37:11,579 --> 00:37:17,099
but we must all witness the the limits

113
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:24,060
of our willfulness to witness the limits of our work to

114
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:31,520
actually vividly encounter the willfulness failing us

115
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:39,599
to encounter the ways that that sourcing our effort from that Wells Spring

116
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:47,400
uh leads to some tension and so the the question like what what

117
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:53,579
does effort for you look like on the other side of

118
00:37:53,579 --> 00:37:59,000
your willfulness that's a kind of koan

119
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:07,339
is it possible for us to uh to rest amidst effort

120
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:14,940
I I would love when uh teacher teacher Dal Qigong we would do

121
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:22,140
Chi young in the morning before Rich you know Retreat sitting started and uh

122
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:28,400
and the language he would use it like under do it under do it

123
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:34,680
we're still doing it it was still 6 a.m and we're doing we're

124
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:40,640
awake and moving but under do it

125
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,160
a sad adaptation here says right effort is effort with wisdom wisdom

126
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:53,640
because where there is wisdom there's interest the desire to know something is wisdom at work being mindful is not

127
00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:00,480
difficult but it's difficult to be continuously aware for that you need right effort

128
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:07,800
but it doesn't require a great deal of energy it's a relaxed perseverance and reminding yourself to be aware

129
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:13,980
when you're aware wisdom unfolds naturally and they're still more interest the mind's relaxed the Mind

130
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:20,339
knows something about itself the meaning of effort is to continue try

131
00:39:20,339 --> 00:39:24,500
to be patient try to be relaxed

132
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:33,060
effort is um it's a major major theme in

133
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:39,060
the the suit does my I'm not a scholar but my understanding is it's like uh you

134
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:46,560
kind of numerical count you know effort is is uh is up there in terms of uh

135
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:53,660
frequently mentioned uh themes and

136
00:39:54,060 --> 00:40:00,200
it is in part A major theme in the suit does because

137
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,339
Neurosis is often the path of least resistance

138
00:40:05,339 --> 00:40:11,940
I talked about the the pervasiveness of goodness the sensitivity to goodness that's that's

139
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:16,980
all true too but Neurosis is often

140
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:24,260
the path of least resistance meaning like my bad habits require

141
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:29,300
precisely zero effort

142
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:36,420
the Glide path to Donuts is frictionless

143
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:42,960
yeah whatever yeah nothing wrong with donuts

144
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,300
um William James says uh uh were mere

145
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:56,160
bundles of habit we are imitators and uh copiers of our past selves

146
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:05,000
that kind of psychological karmic neural momentum

147
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:10,440
imitators and copiers of our past cells and

148
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:15,660
not all of our habits are conducive to our happiness

149
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:22,320
and so deep growth deep growth is not always comfortable sometimes it feels

150
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:31,260
like water running down a hill but often takes energy it takes energy to

151
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:40,380
it takes energy to [Music] listen to our own best advice

152
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:46,440
when we know what needs to be done we often have some access to

153
00:41:46,440 --> 00:41:52,700
wisdom but it's hard hard to listen to that

154
00:41:53,940 --> 00:42:01,160
Shanti Davis says we hate suffering I love its causes

155
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:10,460
as a remarkable distillation of so much hate suffering but love its causes

156
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:20,280
one way of of reading that is that um clinging has partially worked

157
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:26,520
it's been reinforced it's been conserved over time certainly over evolutionary

158
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:33,660
time but over the time of our own life clinging's been reinforced

159
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:42,359
and the craving clinging acquisition maybe momentary relief

160
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:48,540
and then disappointment and then

161
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:54,619
a new back to that that disappointment the on

162
00:42:54,619 --> 00:43:01,980
quenchability of Cl of craving that gives rise to a new cycle

163
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:08,460
another round we tried again and

164
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:15,599
Dharma looks at the the ways that suffering has been reinforced

165
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:24,060
the partial satisfaction of clinging anger with its honey tip and poisoned

166
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:29,160
root the mudassan that's just one example

167
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:34,859
but to to put down the poison we have to renounce the honey

168
00:43:34,859 --> 00:43:40,460
and that takes effort energy

169
00:43:41,579 --> 00:43:47,599
I hate suffering but the love its causes energy is often about

170
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:53,119
loving the causes of suffering thus

171
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:01,020
and we do what we can to source that

172
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:09,660
effort from from Wise view from Wise View

173
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:17,119
from relaxation from sensitivity sensitivity to goodness

174
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,960

175
