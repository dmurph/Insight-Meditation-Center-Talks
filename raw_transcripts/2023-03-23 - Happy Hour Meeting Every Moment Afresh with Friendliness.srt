you all thank you for your practice hmm

110
00:31:31,559 --> 00:31:37,799
so tonight we are at this moment in time whatever your

111
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:43,080
time zone is we uh practiced with um

112
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:49,559
a couple of themes one was needing the moment meeting whatever arises in the

113
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:55,080
body in the heart and the mind whatever rises in this fear of

114
00:31:55,080 --> 00:32:00,320
experience with with kindness with friendliness like a friend

115
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:07,440
also in that theme we brought in a sense of freshness sense of inspired by it

116
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,140
being the first couple days of spring as if we're meeting this moment fresh

117
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:19,559
whatever is a rising fresh this childlike interest freshness curiosity

118
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:26,039
because as adults we kind of get um

119
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:31,440
I don't know um board perhaps or we lose our the

120
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,899
freshness we have to rekindle it we have to remind ourselves at this moment has

121
00:32:36,899 --> 00:32:44,580
never been like this before and will never be if you spend some time with with a young person you'll just see the

122
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:49,980
sense of delight anything any little game or any little toy just there's a

123
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:56,580
sense of wonder um so this invitation to meet each moment

124
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:04,260
with beginner's mind as spring has has arisen fresh can be very helpful as we

125
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:12,179
go around in our daily life instead of bah humbug yeah it's Wednesday it's oh wow this moment

126
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:17,820
is fresh it's never been like this it's and it will never be like this again we

127
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:26,419
just take it for granted we think we're going to be alive for so many more Springs who knows who knows

128
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:36,419
I thank you for joining through this practice so so I'd like to invite us not to turn as

129
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:41,580
we meet this moment with internally we have met it with kindness

130
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:47,700
as much as possible as much as possible can we turn can we befriend whatever

131
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:54,059
Rises can we meet others like a friend can we meet can we meet this moment can

132
00:33:54,059 --> 00:34:00,899
we meet a couple of other human beings like friends whether or not you know them you've seen

133
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:07,380
them before or not meet them as if for the first time without the the um the

134
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:14,398
assumptions presumptions that we have oh this person is like that this is what they're going to talk about no just what

135
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:20,520
if you try that out for size it's easier for people you don't know so well to meet

136
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:25,800
them afresh meet them Anew with friendliness and then maybe you can

137
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:33,060
practice in the sandbox and then take it to your family and friends if there are some buttons that you have buttons that

138
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:39,839
that are pushed pushed by some friends family and colleague maybe you can just try on for size for a few minutes what

139
00:34:39,839 --> 00:34:46,500
if you you met them fresh without all the expectations presumptions

140
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:51,599
um with friendliness so that's the invitation

141
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:57,900
or the small groups that will engage with in a moment and the prompt is what

142
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:03,960
what was this practice like for you you can share maybe a sentence or two and the next

143
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:10,020
person will go alphabetical and the next person will share something and the next person or you can just say pass and hold

144
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:15,540
silent presence but those who are receiving those who are hearing hear the

145
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:21,300
person as if it's fresh it's new without presumptions without thinking about what

146
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:28,200
you're gonna say just friendliness friendliness and spring so these two bring them in pla play around

147
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:35,700
see how you can um play with that make it work for you and I'd be interested in your

148
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:43,500
reflections so I'm going to create the breakout rooms

149

164
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:29,339
came to me that the Hindu tradition uh one of those sages said that every moment you open your eyes you create a

165
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:36,480
new world and that is very true and so may that be our case for

166
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,380
this lovely space here you have Nikki and the other teachers and then we're the greatest song on the whole world

167
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,619
May the spring is spring every month yeah thank you Ellie thank you so much

168
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:54,359
sorry about that no that why are you so that was beautiful okay that was that

169
00:37:54,359 --> 00:38:00,599
was absolutely beautiful I so appreciate and and this this is a May the Springs

170
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:06,839
be springing every moment and actually it is and as you said this Hindu uh

171
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:12,480
saying is that actually every moment it is it's just that we we don't pay attention to it in that way we're like

172
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,320
uh humdrum humdrum same thing okay I'm gonna open my eyes again like no actually it's it's we're creating worlds

173
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:25,980
we're creating new worlds every moment so yeah exactly so let's let's have

174
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:32,280
actually that that perspective of freshness newness this show is not going to go on for that long so we might as

175
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:39,240
well it's always bringing new every moment we just don't don't appreciate it so thank

176
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:46,140
you so much for bringing that beautiful thank you and as they say in Persian happy happy New Year happy new rules yes

177
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:53,280
today new day exactly means new day it's all new day thank you

178
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:59,520
thank you so much lovely any other reflections you can

179
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:06,839
also type them in chat either to me uh privately or to everyone if you like

180
00:39:06,839 --> 00:39:13,140
clear thank you I'll be very brief but this

181
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:18,900
was not what I talked about in our group but the last allies share

182
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:24,599
um reminded me to just to mention that and I've talked about this before I I

183
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:30,680
circulated gratitude list with two friends every day uh and uh

184
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:37,020
I've been doing it for years now it really forces one to look at what is

185
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:43,260
working well in the day rather than things that might be going wrong or just

186
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:49,260
to monotony of it it really have to focus and think through the details and

187
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:57,240
it's beautiful I mean it's worked so beautifully for me in terms of seeing the day every day fresh yeah yeah lovely

188
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:03,900
and and you know and also what it becomes Zach after you do this practice for a long time which I think you're

189
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:11,160
alluding to but just to unpack that for everyone is that maybe at first one you only you know one only looks at what is

190
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:18,060
going well and but then later it's not just that you also actually start to appreciate it so many things are going

191
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:24,660
well I mean it's just like oh my goodness the preponderance of fresh and new and wonderful things it's just like

192
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:31,920
wow you start to notice more so so um I think that it it's important how

193
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:37,800
they this practice actually changes our mind instead of I think some people maybe do this practice like well I've

194
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:43,260
already been grateful for this and that and like oh what's new like I actually know it shifts and changes the way you

195
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:48,900
see so so I appreciate you bringing that in thank you yeah what else any any

199
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,180
group with beginner's mind even if maybe you had met them before perhaps you

200
