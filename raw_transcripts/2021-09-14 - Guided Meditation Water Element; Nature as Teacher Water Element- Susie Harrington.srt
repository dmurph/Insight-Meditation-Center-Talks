1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,319
good morning friends welcome once again

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:14,880
and uh this morning we're going to continue with this exploration of the elements

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,080
and yesterday we started with the earth element

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:27,359
and today i want to continue with water element and i have a

5
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,680
quote a sort of transitional quote for us from a native american elder who was

6
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,800
at standing rock and unfortunately i don't know them their name but this is what they said

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:47,920
in the beginning there was first stone then there was water when the two came together they created

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,000
a sacred sound that sound is the life energy

9
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:03,199
so spoke about earth yesterday this being made up of the mineral of the dust

10
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,200
of the substance of the earth but clearly

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,560
if we were just earth we would just be piles of dust piles of dirt

12
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:20,159
nothing nothing uh much could happen with that and it's the water

13
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:27,119
it's like you know you take dirt and you add water and now you've got something malleable something that

14
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,240
can hold together that has cohesion that can has a fluidity

15
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:39,600
potential to it no longer brittle and this is us we're mixed this mix

16
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,159
of the elements and profoundly so the earth and the water

17
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,680
and when we work with the elements as i spoke with about some yesterday we're

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:59,439
using them to break down this story of separation and isolation this story of i

19
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:06,159
me and mine and we do that working with the elements in

20
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:12,400
a number of ways and i just wanted to name those before we move into the guided meditation

21
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:18,800
that part of what we're doing is changing the conceptual story that we carry around

22
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:24,400
we are all we are all living by stories we have stories that we tell ourselves

23
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,280
and we tell each other in our mind and many of these stories are centered around i me and mine and as

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,800
we practice with the elements we are inviting a change in this story

25
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,000
in this conceptual story we're also when we work with the

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:49,680
elements feeling we're bypassing the story all together at times we're

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,400
feeling directly this through the other sense gates besides the thinking one we're feeling

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:04,000
into the body and sensing the element of earth and today the element of water as we feel it

29
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:10,800
and know it through our sensory perception and we've i've added in sound today

30
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:19,360
because i have a little waterfall behind me so we can feel the water element in us directly and

31
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:27,040
this is part of what we do when we are practicing with the water element and then we also play with

32
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,120
the element metaphorically or poetically sort of bridging this gap from the story

33
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,799
into the body into the experience of it so you'll hear in the

34
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:45,040
guided meditations of the elements that we go back and forth at times we do touch

35
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,480
into the conceptual trying to change the story that we're carrying and then at other times we're just feeling directly

36
00:03:52,480 --> 00:04:00,000
in the body and sometimes just touching sort of like sparking a different way of seeing and

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,799
knowing so i wanted to start with the poetic

38
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:14,879
this is a poem from rosemary watula trauma called the great beyond

39
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:22,639
and once again the invitation to see beyond the self the way water knows itself

40
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:29,759
not only as river and lake but also as fern as cloud as cat

41
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:36,320
forgive me for believing i end with this skin these ideas these imaginings

42
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,680
sometimes i forget to choose vastness forget to know the self

43
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:49,120
as cliff as mataki as crum how is it i so often miss the invitation

44
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:56,680
how is it i overlook that i am lemon asteroid ren

45
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,120
so let's do a little remembering so go ahead and find your

46
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,919
meditation posture

47
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,360
settle in feel your contact with the ground sense through the body

48
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,879
relaxing opening

49
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,478
letting your eyes close if you're comfortable with that

50
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,639
and as you relax you might just start to notice that there are places where there might

51
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:00,240
be a kind of rigidity or a frozen-ness and as you relax them

52
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,600
there's a softening in that relaxing you're connecting with

53
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:14,639
the water in that part of the body allowing it to

54
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,400
come into its more fluid nature not holding it

55
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:25,759
freezing it in place but instead opening it

56
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:35,840
feel your legs in contact with the ground

57
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:49,199
notice how they are for that how they're affected by

58
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:57,840
both the pull of gravity and what they have contact with the way that they're formed

59
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,840
pooling soft

60
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,638
you can start to sense the

61
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,160
water the wateriness inside your body

62
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,880
drop letting the water drop towards the ground

63
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:47,919
feel this play of the earth element in the water as you feel the area of the hips and the lower belly

64
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:55,759
letting the lower belly soften you might notice its

65
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:02,960
viscous malleable nature softening towards the earth

66
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:16,240
can feel the earth element in your spine and in the uprightness

67
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:26,759
and then letting the softness of the belly of the shoulders pulling down

68
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,080
this internal lubrication

69
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,839
dropping down towards the ground

70
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:53,200
and yet it stays cohesive nothing's going to turn into just a

71
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:59,279
puddle held together [Music]

72
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,320
and yet soft

73
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:13,600
notice that the movement of breath in your chest and in your belly is made

74
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:19,040
possible by this flexible

75
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:25,120
and yet cohesive combination of water with the earth

76
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:33,320
as you breathe the water element allows the expanding of breath

77
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:58,640
coming up into the area of the mouth and throat and here you can feel the water

78
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:05,839
element directly you get a little taste quite literally of the inside

79
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:14,440
of your body of this wateriness that is all through us

80
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:32,399
coming up to your eyes even if your eyes are closed you can

81
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:38,320
notice that your eyes have very slight movements as your eyeballs rest in their

82
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,959
bath of water

83
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:55,040
and you might even notice in spite of the hardness of our skull

84
00:10:55,040 --> 00:11:01,600
this felt rigidity that inside you might even sense that

85
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:08,399
your brain is resting letting it soften and rest

86
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:13,240
in its fluid bath

87
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:28,079
letting yourself feel this fluidity in the body perhaps you can

88
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:34,560
sense in places the pulse of the blood moving through your

89
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:41,320
veins our internal irrigation system

90
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,959
all this wateriness here in us

91
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,720
coming from the water you have drunk

92
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,200
coming with the juiciness of fruit that you've eaten

93
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:24,720
this water with the heat rises into the sky travels through the

94
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:32,399
sky and clouds rains down flows in streams

95
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:38,480
underground and somewhere comes to surface and comes

96
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,959
to you

97
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:53,720
and as you drink it you're just a temporary location of this water it's passing through you

98
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:02,800
we're like a little eddie in this flow of the river of water

99
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:09,120
whirls in this corner and then it flows back out

100
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:16,519
evaporation through our skin through our breath through our pee

101
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,120
you two are part of the hydrological cycle the water's simply coming

102
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,120
in for a time passing back out

103
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:40,240
you might just let yourself feel hopefully you have some idea where your

104
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,279
water comes from and let yourself sense that water

105
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:52,800
falling down through some reservoir [Music] flowing through you

106
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:57,639
back out again

107
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:14,360
this endless sharing of the water

108
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:26,720
it's so easy when it comes in to think that it's me i mine

109
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,839
but it's simply water passing through

110
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:39,160
no inside no outside just water

111
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:08,320
when we as if as fish first decided to walk on land we brought the ocean with us inside the

112
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:14,639
saltiness of our blood is the saltiness of the ocean

113
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,240
we carry the ocean with us and we rejuvenate it and refresh it each glass

114
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:26,120
of water we drink

115
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:38,600
we like every other creature we're water creatures

116
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,720
let yourself feel in the little micro movements even as you sit still

117
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:53,040
the little micro movements of the body of the breath

118
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:57,320
you can feel the fluidity

119
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:26,800
notice if any part of your body becomes rigid holding

120
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:35,560
if there's some contradiction in that to our natural fluid state

121
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:42,399
and then it softens again in its true nature of water

122
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:48,639
of softness cohesive

123
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,839
and yet fluid

124
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:40,360
so

125
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,720
simply water flowing through

126
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:10,960
no inside no outside

127
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,559
not yours

128
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:23,120
feeling the softness

129
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:31,600
so cohesive yet fluid nature of the body

130
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:37,600
notice the little micro movements the movement of the ribs in the breath

131
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:44,799
and the belly feel your own wateriness

132
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:55,679
you share this wateriness with all the other living beings

133
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,200
with the rivers and the oceans

134
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:09,200
let yourself also feel this blessing of the water

135
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:18,360
this aliveness that it carries

136
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:41,200
every cell in your wat in your body touched by water

137
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:49,320
nourished allowed to move and change

138
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:54,880
allowing allowing it to do its work

139
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:07,120
the pliability of your skin the lubrication in your joints

140
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:13,559
all the blessings of water

141
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,799
so

142
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,720
so

143
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:51,679
feel the softness the fluidity of the body

144
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:59,039
as it continues to soften the micro movements

145
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,200
the breath

146
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:41,080
so

147
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,960
so

148
00:31:06,690 --> 00:31:12,389
[Music]

149
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:18,349
so [Music]

150
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:51,840
the water elements we're made up of 60 to 90

151
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:58,080
water apparently depending on your age when we're younger we have more

152
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:06,799
water in us the more we're juicier and as we get older we're more earth we're more ground

153
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:12,000
but we're still more than half water

154
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:19,120
and hopefully in that meditation you are starting to feel that combination that beautiful combination

155
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:26,559
that the water element offers us this cohesion of holding the earthiness in us together

156
00:32:26,559 --> 00:32:33,600
and yet it does it in this completely pliable flexible way

157
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:39,679
water is such a magical thing the way it takes the shape

158
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:45,120
of everything that it poured touches you know everything it on a river it takes

159
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:50,399
the shape of the river in a cup it takes the shape of the cup

160
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:55,960
in our bodies it takes the shape of our bodies

161
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:04,000
and the buddha i read you part of a quote yesterday about the earth element and i want to

162
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:12,000
read you he talks about the water element he talks about the elements very similarly but here's what he says about

163
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,519
the water element and i want you to notice

164
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:25,200
in particular where he talks about internal and clinging so

165
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:31,519
notice that as well as his list of what the water element is and he's again speaking to his son

166
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:38,640
rahula what rahula is the water element the water element bait may be either

167
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:44,080
internal or external what is the internal wall water element

168
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,000
whatever internally belonging to oneself is water watery and

169
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,960
and clung to that is bile phlegm pus blood sweat fat

170
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:03,919
tears grease spittle snot oil of the joints urine or whatever else internally

171
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,919
belonging to oneself is water watery and clung to

172
00:34:09,919 --> 00:34:17,679
this is called the internal water element now both the internal water element and

173
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:24,158
the external water element are simply water element

174
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:32,720
pointing and that should be seen as it actually is with proper wisdom thus

175
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:38,878
this is not mine this i am not this is not myself

176
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:45,878
when one sees it thus as it actually is with proper wisdom one becomes

177
00:34:45,879 --> 00:34:51,200
disenchanted with the water element particularly as mine

178
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,800
and makes the mind dispassionate towards the water element

179
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:04,320
and he's speaking here very clearly how internal it we name it internal

180
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:10,800
when we cling to it when we're not clinging to it it's neither internal nor external it's

181
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:16,359
simply water water flowing through

182
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,760
and we can feel this

183
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:27,520
identity this me isn't it amazing that we call this sac that we have so much

184
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,200
ownership and so much idea about this sack of water that

185
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,960
is right here more than half water but somehow this water

186
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,640
is mine is me but not the other water

187
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:52,079
clinging it's like we freeze it's like we make the water instead of its natural

188
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:59,280
fluid we freeze it in place and we can feel this in our concepts in

189
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:05,119
our way of moving and acting in the world when we're frozen when we are

190
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:10,880
rigid cut off

191
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:15,200
very much like frozen water

192
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:23,519
clinging to who we are and what we've done our roles our identities our stories

193
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,640
it's so easy to see in a river if we look at a river and we give it a

194
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:36,000
name nearby here is the colorado river and we give the colorado river this name

195
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:41,359
and we can easily see it's not hard to notice that

196
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:49,200
oh the name colorado river is an idea concept that i have but the water in it

197
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:56,320
and how it is and if you live near a river or you've been in it you see that it changes not just the water in it but

198
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:01,680
the banks the the sediment the color the volume it's all

199
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:08,640
constantly changing and it's so easy to see that our name for it the colorado river is just a

200
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:15,760
concept that we overlay on this constant oscillating changing thing and

201
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:20,800
we're like that i'm a river named susie

202
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,520
and you are a river with your own name constantly changing everything flowing

203
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,960
through and when we freeze ourselves or freeze

204
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:38,880
other people into some limited view as if

205
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,040
we were static and the buddha so clearly pointed that

206
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:51,760
it's making this static nature that makes us believing believing in that static

207
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:58,720
nature that causes our suffering so can we recognize our own fluidity our

208
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:06,400
transparency that's coming through us feel this water this sacred water

209
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,320
flowing through us this giver of life

210
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,440
we are vessels of sacred water

211
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:26,079
part of the cycle moving around impermanent let yourself just shift your

212
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:32,000
posture a little bit just sort of move a little bit and feel the fluidity in your

213
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,320
joints feel how you're just kind of like a pool

214
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:47,480
a little stream that's moving a little let yourself sense your body

215
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:56,240
this sacred water we carry it's so lovely to think that

216
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,040
human beings our whole time and animals too organized right where we lived based

217
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:09,119
on water we lived by water we lived where there was streams where there was

218
00:39:09,119 --> 00:39:14,960
water to drink water to move on i was

219
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:22,320
not long ago i was down in um last winter i was down in phoenix and

220
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:28,480
there were these houses that had been built that apparently

221
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:35,040
the people who built them knew there was no water you know they couldn't dig wells there's no city water available

222
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:42,079
and so the water has to get trucked to their house and put into a holding thing

223
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:48,000
and i i could feel in myself a kind of dis-ease in that

224
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,200
like there's a way oh we're we're supposed to be connected

225
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,838
into the cycle and now now we've had to like

226
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:04,079
those people have to have their connection into the hydrological cycle go through a truck

227
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:10,000
and uh and drive down the highway and there's something that when we feel in our

228
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:15,040
bodies and feel the clouds and the water flow through

229
00:40:15,040 --> 00:40:20,960
the sacredness of water robin wall kimmer in a book you may be

230
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:26,319
familiar with braiding sweetcrafts talks about the the error of buying bottled

231
00:40:26,319 --> 00:40:33,520
water like we've interrupted its cycle and we're not letting the whole thing

232
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:38,560
come through and turning it into a commodity this most sacred of elements

233
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:42,880
they're all sacred but this sacred element

234
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:52,720
this this element of water gives us the opportunity

235
00:40:52,720 --> 00:41:00,960
to feel how powerful water is and how pliable water is

236
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:06,160
there's a beautiful story from ajahn chah where he asks

237
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,920
someone he asks a group of people you may know the story he says have you ever

238
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,040
seen moving water everyone's like yeah i've seen moving

239
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:25,839
water and he says have you ever seen still water yeah we've all seen a pool of water

240
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:31,599
and he says have you ever seen still moving water

241
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:40,480
and how can we in our practice be this moving

242
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:47,520
flexible pliable water element and yet

243
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:53,200
there's a stillness of like a still pool that the pool

244
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:58,880
is letting the mud and silt settle out to the bottom water

245
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:03,838
pure water has a clarity to it

246
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,359
letting yourself feel the simplicity and clarity

247
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:15,480
of water as it enters and flows through you

248
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:23,119
and we like the world we live in is full of disruptions of water floods and

249
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:28,880
droughts we've become very aware of the disturbance of water and yet

250
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:34,880
when it sits it stills it calms

251
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:46,800
one last aspect of water that i just want to drop in is water as like the juiciness of

252
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:52,960
aliveness the juiciness of meta really that

253
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,480
is what um we share you know we often say oh my you know

254
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:05,520
that's a juicy person or i need more juice in my practice we're feeling

255
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:10,880
this nourishing abundant quality of the water

256
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:16,720
the way when you water a plant you're giving it love you're giving it

257
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:23,640
appreciation and it has the opportunity to grow

258
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,079
i'll end today with a poem from rilke

259
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:42,319
may what i do flow from me like a river no forcing it and no holding back

260
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:50,079
the way it is with children then in these swelling and ebbing currents these deepening tides moving

261
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:55,359
out returning i will sing you as no one ever has

262
00:43:55,359 --> 00:44:01,280
streaming through widening channels into the open sea

263
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:11,200
so may you be a widening channel or as rosemary said at the beginning a wren

264
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,480
an asteroid or a lemon feel your wateriness

265
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:21,680
so i encourage you today as i suggested yesterday exploring your

266
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:27,760
earthiness as you go through this day feel very much in your own body

267
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:33,680
in your joints as you move around that you are water

268
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:40,319
you're part of the cycle of water in its juiciness moving through their day

269
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:47,119
enjoy that let the drink of water when you drink when you drink it in feel the streams

270
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:54,400
the ocean come into you and i wanted to let you know today we're

271
00:44:54,400 --> 00:45:01,839
going to end at the regular time and tomorrow the next three days i'll end at the regular time like this and then

272
00:45:01,839 --> 00:45:08,720
we'll also continue for those who can for 15 minutes with questions if people would like to bring those

273
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,319
so we'll still end it quarter till and then have the option of continuing

274
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:21,839
for those who would like so may you have a juicy watery filled day

275
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:25,079
be well
