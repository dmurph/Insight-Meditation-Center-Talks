1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:09,040
so hello everyone and welcome and uh this week so far these

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,599
mornings morning meditation I'm introducing

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:22,840
um antidotes to the way Minds can often get

4
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:30,519
preoccupied by all kinds of things but certainly by our stories the Mind makes the belief we

5
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:37,079
have the the um the biases and preferences we have

6
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:44,760
what how attention and what attention focuses on and uh attachments to emotions and

7
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,680
feelings and comfort and discomfort Pleasure and Pain all kinds of things

8
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:58,879
that uh the mind gets locked into and uh an alternative to that is uh

9
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:05,720
to have an awareness that has some sense of of being part of the whole inclusive

10
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:11,000
awareness I talked about on the first day and the second day yesterday uh

11
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,360
talking about peace peaceful uh to be attuned to the peace

12
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:24,960
that's larger or more encompassing than any particular uh Focus or attachment of the

13
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,960
mind and today like the alternative I would like to offer is a primary Char

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:38,119
characteristic of Vasa practice inside practice and that is

15
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:45,479
Clarity uh vasam means uh uh to see clearly the

16
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:52,439
prefix V means kind of an emphatic prefix like really see and so we could

17
00:01:52,439 --> 00:02:00,399
call that clear seeing but to have a sense of clarity and often we do not have clarity

18
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:06,119
uh we're seeing through the clouds of delusion clouds of preoccupations

19
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:13,680
thoughts memories biases preferences all kinds of things which we see through uh

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,599
we also see through our belief systems and our ideas of who I am who you are

21
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:28,519
self another that uh uh it's so deeply uh integral to our whole sense of

22
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:33,920
being that we we don't even see don't don't see that we're seeing through

23
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:40,400
those lenses we don't understand that we see through those lenses and then inside we're trying looking to how to clean

24
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,640
those lenses maybe even take off the glasses so U for those who have good

25
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,480
sight like like I don't to see

26
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,400
clearly and the particular angle I'd like to use for this morning's

27
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,840
meditation is that um rather than

28
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,560
trying to use the windshield wipers of the mind

29
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:12,760
to to clear away and see

30
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:20,080
clearly the task is to discover what you can see

31
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,840
clearly and be content with that so if there's a lot of fog a lot of

32
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:36,920
preoccupation a lot of uh confusion and chaos that um uh we would clearly see chaos

33
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:44,200
confusion if we are seeing if if there's a lot of anger and resentment and uh everything is seen

34
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,480
through that lens what can you see clearly what can you have be clearly

35
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,959
know and maybe what you can know is that there's anger there's resentment that

36
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:01,079
can be clearly known uh if there's uh confusion if

37
00:04:01,079 --> 00:04:06,760
there is not nothing can be clearly seen it just just seems like there's a a

38
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:14,599
broad fog broad stuper or something maybe in a kind of way that can be known

39
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,600
clearly oh today I cannot see clearly it just all it's all

40
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,759
vague and so so no matter what is

41
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:32,400
happening uh what what can you recognize that seems clean and clear and oh that's

42
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:40,080
how it is that um so rather than trying to see clearly what is available what

43
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,960
can be seen clearly and um so if we're following our

44
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:53,120
breath and um and the breath seems vague or distant we can see clearly that the

45
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,360
that that's the that's the case we can see clearly well it's this is vague and distant or

46
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,160
we can see the Mind keep slipping off or um there can be a sense of

47
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:13,840
um of uh slipperiness around trying to stay with the breath and and so we're

48
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:21,280
trying to see the breath clearly but that not that might not be the point the point is to see the slipperiness of

49
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,120
attention that it keeps sliding off it keeps sliding off so what can you see

50
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,639
clearly and then when you recognize what that

51
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:41,560
is spend some time appreciating this I know this is clear

52
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:46,720
clear enough and that Clarity is always a

53
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,880
factor of the present moment that Clarity is always about what's happening

54
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:56,960
now and um and so if you have Clarity by

55
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:02,160
what happened yesterday and some discussion you had had with something that was difficult now you understand

56
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:09,840
the pieces of it that's not the clarity we're looking for we're looking for the clarity that says oh this is

57
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,800
understanding what happened this is what this is what happened this is the I'm clear that the

58
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,319
mind now has understood uh yesterday's conversation so it's always returning to

59
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,720
the present what what can we be clear about now and then kind of taking refuge

60
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:35,000
in that Clarity appreciating it relaxing with it resting in it uh riding in it um

61
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:42,639
stay close to it stay close to finding where it's clear and uh if you're staying primarily

62
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:48,800
with a breath which I recommend have clarity about how it is

63
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:55,039
not not how it should be with a breath um and so whatever your way your

64
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,360
experience of mindfulness of breathing is um now just

65
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,560
uh what can you have be have what can you be clear about that experience about

66
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:11,840
yourself being mindful of breathing and how does that Clarity keep

67
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:20,240
you in the present flow present moment so assuming a meditation

68
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,639
posture gently closing the

69
00:07:25,639 --> 00:07:31,520
eyes and simply sitting here with the eyes closed

70
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,960
in the simplest possible way without analysis or figuring anything

71
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,800
out what comes to awareness easily with some degree of

72
00:07:53,319 --> 00:08:00,199
clarity what experiences of the body are most clear

73
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:02,720
most

74
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:15,319
obvious and the word most can be used with a very low bar just whatever happens to be

75
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:22,599
clearest even if that clearest is not so clear in some other standard

76
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:41,039
and what is and what can you clearly know about your experience of

77
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:03,640
breathing if what you know about breathing is that there are thoughts and

78
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:08,440
preoccupations that are pulling you away from

79
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,600
it what what Clarity of knowing seeing can you

80
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,320
have about the distracted mind

81
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:40,880
and as you continue knowing whatever you can know

82
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,440
clearly at some point you can maybe begin

83
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,839
appreciating that you can know

84
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:04,320
Clarity you can have a feeling a sense that of what it's like for there to be

85
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:10,079
Clarity in the mind about something not Clarity of understanding

86
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:16,480
abstract Concepts about stuff but clarity about the basic

87
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:25,920
simple Sensations experience knowing of what is

88
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:39,880
and stay close to that Clarity and maybe rest with your

89
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:47,200
breathing supported by the [Music] clarity that knows

90
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:51,399
something about the experience of

91
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:01,279
breathing one breath at a time one in

92
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:10,760
breath at a time one out breath at a time just here just

93
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:18,639
now a Clarity that helps quiet the thinking

94
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
mind

95
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
for

96
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
for

97
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
for

98
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
for

99
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
for

100
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

101
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
for

102
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

103
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

104
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

105
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

106
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

107
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,799
e for

108
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:56,799
when you find yourself distracted caught in your thoughts see if you can know

109
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:05,159
clearly that that's the case no c as clear as possible as as

110
00:19:05,159 --> 00:19:11,720
easy that thinking has overridden

111
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:21,400
Clarity that clear attention to the present has been lost or has

112
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,520
been crowded out by

113
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
thinking

114
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

115
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

116
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

117
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

118
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

119
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

120
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

121
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

122
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

123
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

124
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

125
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

126
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

127
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e for

128
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:17,120
and then as we come to the end of this

129
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:24,960
sitting with whatever subtleness or calm

130
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:32,480
or whatever that's has happened in these minutes of

131
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:42,440
meditating do you have a little bit more access to the idea of clear

132
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:51,398
awareness the awareness which is and knowing which is very very

133
00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:01,039
simple the simplest clearest knowing of what is happen happening

134
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:08,840
now that doesn't require abstract understanding

135
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:16,158
analysis preferences being for or against

136
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,799
judgments the simplest thing to be clear about

137
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:31,960
here where the clarity of the knowing

138
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:39,240
feels valuable feels satisfying

139
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:46,799
delightful feels like something valuable in and of itself because for a moment or two in

140
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:52,840
the knowing there is no

141
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:59,240
entanglement it's almost as if we step back of or

142
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,039
two to look at something a

143
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:14,279
new without bias without preconceived ideas just

144
00:29:17,399 --> 00:29:23,760
this and imagine offering that kind of clear knowing clear

145
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:29,240
presence to a friend a stranger a neighbor

146
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:35,360
to others stepping back metaphorically a

147
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:41,960
foot or two to be able to see the person as if you've never met them

148
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,000
before as if each time you meet them it's

149
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:56,200
new where maybe there's a delight or appreciation respect for the person as

150
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,320
they appear in this moment without carrying with

151
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,440
you the baggage of history and

152
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:12,320
memories person doesn't need to know you're doing

153
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:23,000
this to know someone else with whatever capacity of clarity

154
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,480
that you have

155
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:35,480
and where that Clarity is like an open window an Open

156
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:40,519
Door through which your kindness good will

157
00:30:40,519 --> 00:30:44,399
respect care can

158
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:52,200
flow wishing

159
00:30:52,200 --> 00:31:00,960
offering the other your kindness your friendly your

160
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,720
friendship living in this world with care for all

161
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:15,440
beings may all beings be

162
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:22,240
happy may all beings be

163
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:29,399
safe may all beings be peaceful

164
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:33,880
may all beings be

165
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:43,600
free and may how I am present for others with my clarity may it support

166
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:49,039
Others May this practice be a support for benefiting

167
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:52,240
this world

168
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,900
[Music]

169
00:32:08,679 --> 00:32:11,919
thank you

170
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:05,639
so so hello and welcome to this third talk on the eight worldly

171
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:13,120
winds and um the context I'm trying to offer these teachings is that uh there

172
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:18,880
is an alternative to the eight worldly winds that we can discover through

173
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:26,760
doing Buddhist practice through doing maybe many things doesn't have to be pract Buddhism but we can discover an

174
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,120
ability to uh uh feel a deep sense of uh

175
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:39,440
happiness contentment peace a Clarity sense of wholeness we can discover a

176
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:45,600
kind of Simplicity of being uh that comes from not being

177
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:52,840
caught in preoccupations caught in distractions not being caught up in navigating the

178
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:59,679
world through what's uh good and what's bad for me myself in

179
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:06,440
mind that uh there's a wonderful uh softening Letting Go

180
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:13,398
absence of conceit which is possible when we're very deeply settled

181
00:34:13,399 --> 00:34:21,760
here uh when the mind gets involved in all kinds of things of conceit about preoccupations With Me Myself and mind

182
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:27,398
caught up reactive to what we're receiving from

183
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:34,200
the world world the experiences we have from the world when the mind is caught up with sense of me the doer and the one

184
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:40,638
who has to do things and get things and have have things happen all those things can become quiet

185
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:47,599
for a while we can take a a wonderful mental vacation from the usual

186
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:55,320
preoccupations of the mind and that becomes a reference point

187
00:34:55,320 --> 00:35:01,400
for where well-being is found where we get our joy and our happiness and our

188
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:09,240
sense of uh uh feeling satisfaction with being alive so that we have to have some kind

189
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:16,680
of reference point like this so that when uh the world the worldly winds blow

190
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:23,160
our way we don't get pushed around by them we don't get caught by them we don't get

191
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:28,400
reactive to them uh if the worldly winds is how we

192
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:34,040
Define our happiness and well-being or unhappiness and lack of well-being then

193
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:41,440
every wind that blows is going to blow us around we're going to be reacting fixing putting up um wind walls to stop

194
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:49,079
them uh and um uh putting on heavier and heavier uh

195
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:54,440
uh wind breaks just whatever it takes to try to somehow protect or hold on or to

196
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:59,760
keep them going um and um but if we have something

197
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,240
better than them then they come along and we're not tricked by them they're not they don't have a big influence on

198
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:13,800
us so this particularly true for this the the the pair for today the worldly

199
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:21,720
wins of praise and blame and uh many people really uh uh

200
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:27,920
cherish praise PE some people depend on it they want it they're looking for it

201
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,640
some people are uh organizing their life and their conversations so that people

202
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:40,920
are ready to praise them to to uh people boast people explain you know what they

203
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:46,280
did and how great they did and how wonderful things were and um

204
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,680
and people will present opinions political opinions with the idea that

205
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:58,839
people would praise you or if you have the right opinion and um and and some people get

206
00:36:58,839 --> 00:37:04,760
uh that's where their Vitality comes from is uh This Joy of being someone

207
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:11,560
being recognized as someone as as being praised being honored being somehow in

208
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:18,480
Con in the relationship to others stands out as being special and it you know and

209
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,480
people look up to us and some of that's normal and okay

210
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:32,480
enough but uh there's a lot lot of conceit a lot of uh challenges that come

211
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:38,400
from living a life dependent on praise and that is the more the praise there is

212
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:46,599
the more the pendulum can swing to be blamed and uh and uh the more people

213
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:55,480
praise us the more they expect us to hold a certain standard to be a certain way and it's a setup uh for the pendulum

214
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:01,240
to swing it's a setup that we can't always be praised and there are people

215
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:09,079
who are going to criticize us be angry with us be upset with us not share our same opinions um uh be

216
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:15,359
critical and so if our sense of Vitality has come from praise then it can be

217
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:20,400
deflating uh to uh to be uh blamed or be

218
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:28,520
criticized they or maybe not deflating sometimes it's actually energizing to be uh being blamed or

219
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:33,760
criticized because then we're ready to fight we're ready to kind of work on

220
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:40,160
defending ourselves or um you know then we're aroused and we have to kind of be more careful and more

221
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:45,560
attentive and and so there's this arousal that comes with praise and

222
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:53,200
blame and the very sad thing socially is that uh uh when situations and people

223
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:59,240
neither praise us nor blame us then uh that can be boring that can be not

224
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:04,880
interesting for us that there's no orientation or that we're not getting anything from them they're not kind of

225
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:12,240
activating us and so there are times socially where the people who neither praise nor blame are overlooked or

226
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:21,839
ignored because of that's the orientation some people can have so um so praise is not wrong to be

227
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:28,560
praised uh blame isn't necessarily wrong sometimes it's accurate that people are finding false finding some mistakes

228
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:34,920
we've made and um and to have the ability to be open to both in a relaxed

229
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:41,880
open way where are the the the the uh the the quality of our inner life is not

230
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:50,200
dependent on the praise and the blame where we're centered on oursel in a nice peaceful nice way that um we know

231
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:57,680
something better than the the than the than the Joy or praise and the

232
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:03,200
unhappiness of blame uh we're not uh depending on it

233
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:09,079
for a sense of self for a sense of Vitality sense of happiness and well-being for

234
00:40:09,079 --> 00:40:14,680
peace and so we can watch praise and blame we can be present for it in a

235
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:21,040
clear way we can listen for what's true uh what might be accurate and appreciate

236
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:26,720
what's accurate appreciate praise which seems accurate enough and um appreciate

237
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:33,440
that people re recognize it and appreciate when people point out our

238
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:40,400
faults the Buddha talked about anyone who points out our faults should be treated as a treasure we're lucky to

239
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:47,480
have people help us to see ourselves better and I I find it a delight uh to

240
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:53,480
to someone to point out a fault that I've done a mistake I've made or something I've said that was wrong or

241
00:40:53,480 --> 00:41:01,359
maybe uh was even hurtful for someone and um and uh I could feel a little I

242
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:08,960
can feel my Challenge and sometimes I get defensive or sometimes I can feel a little hurt or dis uh dismayed uh but I

243
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,839
also feel as Delight oh my chance to open to this it's my chance to kind of

244
00:41:14,839 --> 00:41:20,520
feel this to be present for it to find a way through it to some other way and so

245
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:28,720
rather than being um uh avoiding uh uh people who want to point

246
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:36,160
out our faults there's a way of if you know within reason there's a way of opening to it and feeling the joy of it

247
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:43,119
and sometimes that's the very thing that disarms people who want to criticize us and uh it surprises them some people who

248
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:48,359
are like but there are people whose way of living is to be critical all the time

249
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:55,319
and maybe there's little hope then but there are people for whom um they're used to people pushing back and fighting

250
00:41:55,319 --> 00:42:01,079
and and arguing and that's kind of where they get their juice but to uh turn

251
00:42:01,079 --> 00:42:07,520
towards them and open say oh you might be right about that oh there might be something there to what you're

252
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,319
saying uh can you tell me more uh can you explain exactly how that works or

253
00:42:13,319 --> 00:42:20,520
something and PE some people are surprised when someone responds to undefensible

254
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:34,240
um um because it also means that maybe you know they're not getting under your

255
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,000
skin so this idea of um knowing an

256
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,680
alternative way of being happy being content being centered on oneself in a

257
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:54,640
nice way an alternative to praise and blame so praise and blame can happen but

258
00:42:54,640 --> 00:43:01,280
we're not caught by it uh we're not pushed around by it we're not um

259
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:11,039
influenced by it and then there's opportunity to be wise about it and uh the praise

260
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:17,839
seems you know neutral okay okay thank you for the

261
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:23,319
praise and and and just let it go right by and um and sometimes there's

262
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:28,400
criticism which we just let it go right by and um

263
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:34,160
and uh we don't have to pick it up or get involved we don't have to have a belief system that every praise and

264
00:43:34,160 --> 00:43:39,880
blame is something that we have to react to because every uh praise and blame

265
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:45,359
somehow defines us we're being defined by someone else and we've given them the

266
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:52,559
power to create that definition for who we are we've somehow forfeited Our Own

267
00:43:52,559 --> 00:44:00,079
Strength our own independence our own capacity just to be because somehow we're allowing ourselves to be defined

268
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:06,240
by the other person and maybe we feel and and uh and either we want to get

269
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:13,880
attached to that or go along with it want more of it and we try to organize our life that way or we try to defend

270
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:20,920
ourselves or criticize or counter it in some way but in both ways um we've given

271
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:28,520
some of our power some of our independence over to other people how about having

272
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:33,640
receiving praise and blame and not giving the other person so

273
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:40,960
much power over you over us so

274
00:44:40,960 --> 00:44:48,920
um so as you go through to the day the next 24 hours you might see are there

275
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:54,839
ways subtle ways strong ways big ways that you do receive praise and blame

276
00:44:54,839 --> 00:45:03,040
from people you know from strangers from different situations and um and uh how what's your

277
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:09,720
common way of reacting to that what's your default when you're not feeling uh

278
00:45:09,720 --> 00:45:15,040
rested when you're hungry when you're a little bit off in your day what is your

279
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,599
gut reaction to praise and blame when you're centered and rested and wellfed

280
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:26,119
and feeling content what wisdom do you have about how to respond to praise and

281
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:32,720
blame what is your relationship to this these very important pair of Act of uh

282
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:38,920
social interactions which are common enough in the human social world how do

283
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:45,119
you relate to praise and blame and so the the the assignment if you're

284
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:51,240
interested is just discover how it is for you and the more you understand your

285
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:57,040
how you react how you respond to praise and blame uh it the wiser you might be

286
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:03,680
come around them and what wisdom grows for you as you see it

287
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:11,760
clearly so thank you very much and um and uh so we'll continue with these

288
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,000
eight worldly winds tomorrow
