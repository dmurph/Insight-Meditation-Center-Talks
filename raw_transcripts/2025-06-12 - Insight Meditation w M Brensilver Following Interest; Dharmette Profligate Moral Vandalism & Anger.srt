1
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:09,200
okay uh welcome uh welcome folks um

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,960
yeah good to uh good to be with you so um

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,199
yeah let's uh let's uh sit together

4
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:19,000
like uh nectar settling to the bottom of a glass of juice tanhan says That's

5
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,920
And there can be some measure of tranquility when we're not trying to

6
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,438
keep all the balls up in the air

7
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:23,040
when we're not trying to suppress as if uh keeping uh 50 pingpong balls

8
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,680
submerged underwater

9
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,440
we let what's in the air come to the surface

10
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:44,360
what subterranean come to the surface

11
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:56,600
how uh radically might we relinquish

12
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:05,400
the attempt to control experience

13
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:37,600
and maybe we think the mind calls out "No no no no i have to control my

14
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:43,600
attention i have to do the meditation i have to do the letting go we have to

15
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,320
make progress

16
00:05:54,800 --> 00:06:00,280
we have to come to trust that

17
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:08,520
you're already enough doing nothing

18
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,199
whatsoever

19
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:47,480
maybe we uh follow wherever the thread of interest takes us

20
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:03,040
what is this what is this moment this life

21
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,279
this suffering

22
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:35,480
When there's a curiosity investigation dhamma vaya

23
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:45,640
doesn't matter where the attention goes animated by interest

24
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,440
interest is for itself

25
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:06,279
but turns out to be a very conducive intention

26
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,079
to the development of our practice

27
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:54,240
so often our attention is a kind of appendage of our

28
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:57,240
wanting

29
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:20,639
can we be awake in such a way that we're not extracting something from the

30
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:23,639
moment

31
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:35,639
but instead offering our attention ion is a kind of

32
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:39,320
blessing

33
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:50,199
settling back kind of receptivity

34
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,518
no more bartering with samsara

35
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:08,919
just put all of your hope into this moment

36
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,359
[Music]

37
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:42,080

44
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:33,039
9th certain Wednesdays so um

45
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,039
okay

46
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:47,200
so uh one of um one of my uh friends fellow

47
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:54,960
dharma teacher and um uh very kind of intuitive body worker

48
00:30:54,960 --> 00:31:00,799
sumatic experiencing practitioner

49
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:06,480
Um he we would um be in like the teachers

50
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:11,760
office at Spare Rock during a a walking period or

51
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:18,480
before a a talk or guided meditation or something it was just a few of us in the in the office and he would just kind

52
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:24,000
we'd be like sitting around talking and he would just like pick up my leg and

53
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:31,840
just start massaging it and manipulating it and um it wasn't weird for him it was

54
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:39,120
like okay yeah and uh he knew that I kind of had uh an old meditation injury

55
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:47,360
that had sort of hardened into um some chronic pain and um whatever he was

56
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:53,919
doing I just let him do it felt very good it felt like uh there was

57
00:31:53,919 --> 00:32:00,399
wisdom in his hands and at some point he would sort of like

58
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:08,720
ask like what what does your leg want to do and I remember one time it was like okay

59
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:14,799
it wants to wants to sort of kick the air it wants to like move out forcefully

60
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:22,320
and it was a movement of some kind of aggression you know is how it felt

61
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:29,120
and he said um uh that's right you know yeah there's

62
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:36,159
there's some movement of fight in the fight flight freeze kind of thing there this is this needs fight there's some

63
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:42,640
fight that hasn't been completed and the energy

64
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:49,440
um needed to be guided into movement to complete something

65
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:56,640
and um that was a very particular context but I

66
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:04,559
begin with that because the question arises for me is like what what does it um look like to

67
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:12,919
channel anger aggression into something useful

68
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:20,159
and anger is kind of a little taboo maybe in

69
00:33:20,159 --> 00:33:28,320
dharma circles is very easy to disavow very clearly belongs to the bouquet of

70
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,600
afflictive emotions you know and um and

71
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:39,360
sometimes it's more comfortable for us to say that anger

72
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:45,440
anger is just the armor or anger just protects us from some more fundamental

73
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,799
feeling that you know sometimes say like oh yeah anger is the the secondary

74
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:59,360
feeling before that fear or grief for shame or something lies under the anger

75
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,960
and our preference is for the less

76
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,440
aggressive spectrum of feeling maybe we have more okayess in a way in the scene

77
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,158
with fear or grief and anger is sort of like no that can't

78
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:23,599
be the primary thing that can't be the bedrock or something so we we can disown

79
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:30,240
that and um we maybe say like well it may be

80
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:37,040
part of our defense that we say anger is just a distorted expression of fear or

81
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:46,560
something like this yeah okay and I I've spoken almost glowingly

82
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:53,358
and without regret about grief but rarely about anger certainly not

83
00:34:53,359 --> 00:35:02,079
glowingly and I've done that for a reason i do think there's less less wisdom in anger

84
00:35:02,079 --> 00:35:12,599
often than there is in grief but even with anger it's not zero wisdom

85
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:22,560
now in in uh kind of opening the door to anger we want to be uh careful

86
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,920
and anger aversion is is literally like

87
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:33,200
you know one of the three pillars one of three well wellsp springsings of

88
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:40,320
suffering you know greed delusion right and um

89
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:46,960
and if we've paid attention to our own minds or to uh others we we know that

90
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:52,880
anger um can can destroy us you know can

91
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,440
destroy those around us can destroy communities and societies

92
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:08,720
and uh from the samuta the the what's the one thing oh godama whose killing

93
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:17,599
you approve the killing of anger is the response with its poisoned root and honeyed tip

94
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:25,160
this is the killing the noble one's praise for having slain that one does not sorrow

95
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:31,280
yeah poisoned root honey tip

96
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:40,079
fair enough and I'm not there but I I can envision uh a

97
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:47,040
mind free from anger as radical as that is I can envision a kind of uprooting of

98
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:53,359
aversion so thorough and an understanding of causality so deep that

99
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:59,440
anger does not arise because I I do feel

100
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:04,480
not pivoting to talk trash about anger but but

101
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:13,520
Um I do feel like anger in the end is a basic confusion an impoverished

102
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:20,000
model of causality and I can see anger is never the last

103
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:25,359
word there's always something more to be seen

104
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:32,880
and at some point our emotional system may find ways of expressing our love and

105
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:39,520
our boundaries in such a way that does not involve rage

106
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,960
but until I'm that free till I'm free

107
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:54,079
from that and my emotional system really is changed I need to listen to my anger

108
00:37:54,079 --> 00:38:01,200
and to extract its wisdom to untangle the delusion and the wisdom to find a

109
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:07,680
way of making that movement that I was being invited to make that kicking of my

110
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:15,680
leg that doesn't harm anyone to find a way of kicking that kind of

111
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:21,880
expresses force but clarity

112
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:31,520
and all this is to say that um

113
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:38,160
uh I've been agrieved angered

114
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:45,440
by the proflegate moral vandalism

115
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:51,280
of our president and the wanting

116
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:58,240
cruelty that delights in uh inflicting suffering on imagined

117
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:04,079
enemies and um

118
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:12,079
and when somebody asks me how I'm doing you know I like there's a dimension of my heart it's true I can say honestly

119
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:18,240
extremely happy and in a sense that well-being is not

120
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:23,839
oluded by but it coexists with a lot

121
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:32,119
of heartache and anger over so much unnecessary suffering

122
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:38,880
and so can I extract the wisdom from my anger

123
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:46,920
can I untangle the wisdom from the delusion that I also know is there

124
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:52,880
and what what I'm asking myself what is a wise

125
00:39:52,880 --> 00:40:01,480
powerful expression of the energy of no what does that look like

126
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:07,520
and we need to kind of turn to

127
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:13,200
our moral heroes you know I read um the

128
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:20,800
recent I think it won the Pulitzer bio a very um biography of King

129
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:28,960
uh quite superb um Jonathan I and uh it's a book for our times

130
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:36,640
and um in that um uh biography argues that um history sort

131
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:42,640
of mistaken kings nonviolence for passivity

132
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:50,240
and it's it's sanitized and polished the legacy in a way that does um doesn't do

133
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,359
justice to just how radical and

134
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:02,000
uh fearless the approach was and the book argues that um we've

135
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:09,920
forgotten that the approach was more forceful than most anything the country had seen

136
00:41:10,319 --> 00:41:16,000
and moral outrage it needs a place to go like that energy

137
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:23,359
at the leg it needs a place to go but I don't want to dis kind of um

138
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:31,680
distort the energy i don't want to express it in a way that comes out sideways you know and when I do that I

139
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:37,760
always there's a kind of instant karmic reverberation sometimes even just giving

140
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,520
a dharma talk I'll just like something's not quite aligned in my heart there's

141
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:48,880
something uh self-indulgent or

142
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:56,319
um melodramatic or self-involved or something i'll feel it afterwards

143
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:02,319
and I I I with this I I want to find a way of

144
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:09,920
expressing this energy cleanly in my life in my teaching in my practice

145
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:15,040
and um and when the feeling is not kind of

146
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:20,640
expressed or discharged um is not channeled in some way it sort

147
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:27,040
of rattles around the cage of the heart mind and that rattle

148
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:32,640
compounds the pain that kind of passivity and the inactivity compounds

149
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:41,359
the pain it's easier to get angry when there's no movement of the energy out

150
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:47,040
and so action you know sometimes the only way

151
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:52,440
to actually discharge the pain of that

152
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,880
and so okay as a dharma practitioner what what where does this energy go how

153
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:05,680
is this alchemically transformed in a way knowing you know just how much faith

154
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:13,760
we develop in love and just how how profound the moral you know

155
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,680
persuasiveness of love is so much more persuasive

156
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,280
than unmitigated anger

157
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:31,839
okay it sounds paradoxical but can one's anger be

158
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,760
inform one's love and I had the sense that in King that something like that

159
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:43,040
happened that he kind of mastered that process of

160
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:48,960
um of moving the energy of outrage

161
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,720
moral outrage into a courage and love

162
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:02,040
and so this is February 1957

163
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:09,839
70 years ago uh King uh wrote "In speaking of love at

164
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:17,440
this point we're not referring to some sentimental emotion it would be nonsense to urge people to love their oppressors

165
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:23,680
in an affectionate sense love in this connection means an

166
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:30,000
understanding of goodwill when we speak of loving those who oppose

167
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:36,319
to us we refer neither to aeros nor filia

168
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:43,920
we speak of a love which is expressed in the Greek word agape agape means nothing

169
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:51,839
sentimental or basically affectionate it means understanding redeeming good

170
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:57,440
will for all people an overflowing love which seeks nothing

171
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,119
in return is the love of God working in the lives

172
00:45:03,119 --> 00:45:09,119
of humans when we love on the agape level

173
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:16,079
we love people not because we like them not because their attitudes and ways

174
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:24,040
appeal to us but because God loves them

175
00:45:27,520 --> 00:45:33,680
we don't have exactly the same theological language to pull on but it's

176
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:39,520
close enough it's close enough to love because God

177
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:48,800
loves them yeah and we put it all all the the movement

178
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:57,160
of the heart into expressing our uh care

179
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:04,480
so I offer this for your um consideration and um

180
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:11,599
uh yeah may we uh find ways of of

181
00:46:11,599 --> 00:46:17,839
expressing all that's wise in us okay I wish you uh wish you well see you

182
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:21,079
in July
