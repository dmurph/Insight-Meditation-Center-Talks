1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,520
so hello and welcome dear sangha to

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:10,639
to this edition of happy hour today

3
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:18,560
whatever the time might be in the time zone you're in around the world

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,680
so um [Music]

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:30,560
the theme for today's practice is um

6
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:38,160
meta and impermanent meta and impermanence

7
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,960
so so

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:51,360
impermanence i want to say a couple of words about that so impermanence

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,000
it's a fact of life nothing nothing that's challenging

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:05,760
stays ever the same everything will change everything that is quote good or quote bad in our

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,400
lives whatever experience everything changes everything changes

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:19,600
and sometimes we feel that um impermanence is on our side when

13
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,680
something is challenging and we know it's going to shift and change even though our minds think oh this will

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:32,079
never change will always be the same but of course they will shift and of course

15
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,439
if if there is a period of ease enjoy it because

16
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,680
it will shift it will change not to grasp not to cling because

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,280
clinging to it can cause um undo

18
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:57,200
undue pain so it's wise to realize everything shifts and changes part of this life so

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:04,479
so matter and impermanence so can we love can we love what is

20
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,520
knowing that it will shift and change especially knowing that it will shift

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,520
and change ourselves situations

22
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:23,200
people in our lives can we lean into meta

23
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,080
good will care love especially in light of impermanence in

24
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:35,120
the light of shifting nature of life that's just the way it is

25
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:41,840
on this dimension of being human and i want to offer a poem

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:47,680
as our inspiration

27
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,599
so the poem is called eternity

28
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:02,640
which is interesting because it's actually talks about impermanence it's by william blake

29
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:08,959
and here's the poem many of you probably already know it

30
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:16,800
he who binds to himself a joy does the winged

31
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:24,000
life destroy he who kisses the joy as it flies

32
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,040
lives in eternity's sunrise i'll read it one more time an apologies

33
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,319
it's gendered language but he lives from 1757 to 1827

34
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:45,200
so you can change the gender as it works for you but i'll read it as he has written it

35
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:51,599
he who binds to himself a joy does the winged

36
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:59,280
life destroy he who kisses the joy as it flies

37
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:07,200
lives in eternity's sunrise so this idea of impermanence

38
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:14,480
it's it's joy as it flies can we kiss the joy can we kiss the joy as it flies

39
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:19,359
instead of binding ourselves to it

40
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:26,000
destroying by by binding ourselves by the sense of clinging

41
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,360
destroying ourselves destroying it destroying the joy as it flies

42
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:37,759
so can we kiss it as it flies can we have good will meta love

43
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:45,440
for whatever the circumstances are as they're flying as they're flying they're changing all the time

44
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:52,400
changing all the time so can we live in eternity sunrise

45
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,800
by appreciating with love with gratitude with with meta the impermanent nature of

46
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,639
all things so that is that is the loose theme of

47
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,400
tonight's practice so let's settle let's begin together

48
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,600
so let's arrive in our meditation

49
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,600
posture whatever it might be supportive for you in this moment

50
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,038
sitting standing lying down

51
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,039
or maybe walking for those who might listen to this later on adiodharma

52
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:45,120
and for most of us right now sitting sitting feeling [Music]

53
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:52,680
our sit bones on the cushion on the chair

54
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:01,080
landing

55
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:18,080
in this moment in the impermanence the fleeting nature of this moment

56
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:26,080
kissing this moment as it fly ah

57
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:38,880
letting our feet the bottom of our feet

58
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:47,638

i am here

60
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,599
just as the buddha touched the earth

61
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:08,000
with his hand the night of his enlightenment

62
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:13,919
does earth be my witness touching the earth

63
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,639

with our bottom and the cushion i am here

65
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:15,759

00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:02,640
and i've lost all of them at early ages this last one

172
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:07,839
this last saturday night and unexpectedly

173
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:15,599
a few weeks though came to me the opportunity to have the golden retriever puppy

174
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,680
which i got and even though it diluted the

175
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:28,079
passing of the last one and

176
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:39,838
then there's obviously the definition of cute and

177
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:48,720
i've been working on the meditation question what does love without attachment look

178
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:55,119
like it's really you have answered with

179
00:40:55,119 --> 00:41:00,720
this entire practice tonight with the blank poem and everything since

180
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:08,240
to appreciate each moment having this puppy i found to my surprise

181
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:15,200
it was very anxiety producing that i would lose it an eagle would swoop down and grab it

182
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,119
and take off and eat it if something would happen one would lose it

183
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:26,720
and as you say so very truthfully

184
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,400
that each moment must be met with ease

185
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:40,880
and that if the puppy was gone tomorrow that i enjoyed it and loved it today

186
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:46,960
and i meet tomorrow with as much ease and

187
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,400
love as i can for that miraculous moment

188
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:58,800
thank you please thank you mark thank you so much for

189
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,040
your reflection

190
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:13,359
oh and thank you for sharing your puppy the image that was so sweet to see you

191
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:21,200
all here he is the definition of cute he really is oh my god brings up so much meta

192
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:26,319
oh yeah and

193
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:33,200
merry christine is also loving your puppy in in in chat he who says he who loves in the

194
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:38,000
present moment lives always in love

195
00:42:39,440 --> 00:42:46,079
he who stands alone in the present moment is eternally lonely interesting thank you

196
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:52,800
one more reflection because i have a relationship with this william blake poem i've created an art series inspired

197
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:59,599
by it i felt a wave of gladness and excitement when you read it anchoring on the breath helped me stay

198
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:04,880
grounded it was a wonderful combination thank you you are so welcome beautiful

199
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:11,880
reflection and i see wayne your hand is up please

200
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:19,440
um well i'm in my 13th hour here sitting in school

201
00:43:19,440 --> 00:43:26,800
and uh i'm because of the

202
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:35,200
emails from the principal demanding that all the teachers get their google slides together for tomorrow's

203
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:42,319
parent back to school thing on zoom i'm working and i'm thinking

204
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:48,640
all i could do was besides hearing the noises and i'm

205
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:57,040
sort of this year i'm i'm adding a whole lot of and i'm learning myself because i needed of executive functioning skills

206
00:43:57,040 --> 00:44:03,520
for my students and i was just pondering

207
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:09,920
what would the buddha say about executive functioning skills but then the more i think about it it's

208
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:15,520
like yes they can be they can be applied to my life and my practice

209
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,760
um [Music] i'm certainly no expert i don't god

210
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:27,520
knows you must have heard a lot about that living in silicon valley but

211
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,960
i don't know i'll ponder it but in seriousness i realize you know about not wasting time and being organized in my

212
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:40,240
daily tasks and my meditation periods and my zoom

213
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:45,680
sitting groups and teaching acquires requires

214
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:52,240
executive functioning that i need to work on yeah thank you wayne and bless you for

215
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:57,599
doing for being part of the community of teachers and your 13th

216
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:03,200
hour in the classroom preparing and serving and supporting so many students

217
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:10,000
so what i would say is is just one couple of words briefly is

218
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:17,040
you know executive function is not a term or concept that they put up

219
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:25,119
talked about however one thing that might be helpful to to consider is perhaps refining it as

220
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,480
wisdom how can you be wise with your time how can you be wise with

221
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:36,960
your purpose how can you be wise with the way you spend your time uh and serve your students so i'll just

222
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:42,800
leave you with that reframe thank you thank you thanks

223
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:50,160
so dear ones dear dear impermanent beings in impermanent conditions of our

224
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:56,000
lives internally and externally we are going to now

225
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,230
change everything changes so we now are going to shift and change from

226
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:06,960
[Music] being in the larger community and turning into small

227
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:13,680
groups of size 3 to support to share our practice with

228
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:18,800
each other practice in small breakout groups

229
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:26,319
so and as always we'll start with um 15 seconds of meta

230
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:32,240
for ourselves for the other people and um

231
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:38,319
then we will turn to sharing saying as little or as much as you wish about

232
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:44,480
impermanence and meta what came up for you so the rooms are formed

233
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:50,960
and here we go take care of yourselves take care of each other

234
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:59,040
so we have just a few minutes for reflections comments questions what

235
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:05,520
what came up what you realized so please don't be shy especially if you

236
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:11,079
haven't shared spoken for a while

237
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:16,770
[Music]

238
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:30,079
jerry says the poems at the moment is there it was just something specific

239
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:39,079
also that came up in the group that you mean the moment in the group or the moment for the for the meditation jerry

240
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:51,280
you're welcome i'm mute if you like you don't have to um i i both actually

241
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:58,800
uh at the very end the timing was get and i said oh this is a fleeting moment we need to say goodbye

242
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:05,440
and it was a moment of real and real moments because it was a very enjoyable uh

243
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,960
period to be with another member and the group but um but

244
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:19,119
the other part that we talked about uh because both of us were reflecting on one hand everyone's in a lot of pain

245
00:48:19,119 --> 00:48:24,960
uh you know jill has mentioned in his talks that well it will change the pain

246
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,839
will never going to be constant there's always a nuance and then of course i reflected on the other side that when

247
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:39,119
you're in joy there's a tendency to want to cling to it and not let it go but in both places

248
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:45,040
it's that space of trying to recognize things are always changing and

249
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:50,640
i gave the example of a cardinal that i buried that i saw the other day i took a picture and sent it

250
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:58,000
to the neighbor said it was good but i many times just see the bird and absorb that moment and enjoy it recognizing

251
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:05,760
it's going to go without having a sense of loss but you can get into a sense of loss when you're in a period of joy

252
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:12,559
right exactly exactly and you're bringing this up as as also mark brought it up earlier with

253
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:18,960
with the puppy like oh enjoying this puppy i love the puppy so much i love this this bird flying so much

254
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:24,480
oh what if it goes away that that sense of angst so so befriending befriending

255
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:30,960
the oh befriending that that that impermanent because that too is impermanent that sense of

256
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:37,760
grasping and clinging so all of that yeah beautiful thank you and thank you all for your

257
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:44,720
practice such rich practice with this theme um can also also one last thing quickly i

258
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:52,000
want to bring in is is um jerry as you're talking about pain physical pain uh

259
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:58,960
realizing everything is perfect is impermanent can bring a sense of sweetness a sense of befriending for

260
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:06,000
what is only here for a limited amount of time whether challenging or more pleasant and

261
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:12,559
henry on youtube says hello in breath goodbye out breath thanks so that that's

262
00:50:12,559 --> 00:50:18,400
another way to summarize our practice so thank you all thank you so much for your practice

263
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:24,319
for showing up for yourself for each other for all whose lives yours

264
00:50:24,319 --> 00:50:31,519
touches may all beings be well may all things be free including ourselves

265
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,280
thank you
