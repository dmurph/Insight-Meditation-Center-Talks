1
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:13,679
so good morning or good day everyone and um

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,880
coming here from having finished the being at a retreat teaching you the

3
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:30,779
retreat for the last week and and so perhaps The Retreat practice

4
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,180
that is still with me and maybe I can share a bit of it with you and this

5
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,739
meditation and I'll do it with um

6
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:49,020
a simile the

7
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:56,538
Buddha taught a lot with similes and he had one he had many having to do with meditation

8
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,860
and one that fond of is that that you know adapt it

9
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,200
for the kind of a modern example that um

10
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:14,520
you take dry flour and you sprinkle the water in it to make bread to make dough

11
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,799
and as the water gets into the flour uh

12
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:27,540
the idea is to begin kneading the flower first mixing first so that all the flour

13
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,439
can become moist and and then to really spread it out and

14
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:42,720
and kind of line up the structure of the wheat proteins so that it can can really

15
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:49,140
receive well the the the yeast and the I guess the carbon

16
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,259
dioxide the yeast make so it spreads and expands and so this is kneading the bread to get

17
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,780
the moisture needing the flour to get the moisture throughout evenly throughout

18
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:10,020
the Buddha used something almost the same idea that kneading and kneading some powder and dry powder until no part

19
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:16,020
of the dough is not moist saturated so fused with

20
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:21,660
moisture um but also not oozing

21
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,420
not the dripping with the moisture either just enough to hold it all together

22
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:36,000
and this idea of keep keep kneading so that the structure of the flower gets

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,420
a line and gets well established for the rising of the bread

24
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:47,700
and in this analogy the the body

25
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:53,519
is the flower and a body which is

26
00:02:53,519 --> 00:03:00,420
not saturated with awareness with attention is considered kind of dry

27
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:07,379
and not held together in a unified hole but as we take our awareness

28
00:03:07,379 --> 00:03:12,599
and we're kind of like awareness is the water more or less and

29
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:20,459
we are massaging or needing the water the awareness into the body

30
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:27,180
and the rhythm of it the kneading is the rhythm of breathing in and breathing out

31
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:34,400
and um and for different people maybe different halves of breathing is the

32
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:40,500
pushing the the dough down and then the other half is kind of

33
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:46,019
squeezing it together and um for me that what works well is the

34
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:52,019
in-breath is the kind of gathering together the dough into a ball and then the and then the exhale is spreading it

35
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:59,819
out and kneading in and spreading out other people is the opposite that somehow the exhale as they're kind of

36
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,760
gathering together and the inhale with the expansion of the Torso is the

37
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:13,140
spreading uh is the spreading out the exhales the Gathering

38
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:18,479
in bunching up and as we do this there's a kind of

39
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,820
Rhythm that goes with the breathing and some of that rhythm is inherent in

40
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:30,120
the breathing and very gently it's possible to just like with the dough

41
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,540
we don't uh try to knead the dough as fast as we can there's a speed

42
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:43,199
that seems to be proper appropriate for the dough

43
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:50,699
and so to not necessarily breathe in whatever way you happen to be breathing

44
00:04:50,699 --> 00:04:56,460
but to be attuned to what is the kind of breathing the

45
00:04:56,460 --> 00:05:01,919
speed of breathing the the extent of exhaling the extent of

46
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:07,860
inhaling that seems appropriate to the task of

47
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:13,139
moving spreading awareness throughout the body

48
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:18,900
so that's assembly and uh it gives a very different sense of what

49
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:25,139
to do in meditation than just you know follow your breath be with your breathing if your mind gets

50
00:05:25,139 --> 00:05:31,020
distracted come back there's a kind of embodiment or fullness and the imagination is a little bit

51
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,180
engaged so assuming a

52
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:44,340
meditation posture and one that allows your chest to be

53
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:50,759
more open have posture where the front part of

54
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:57,360
your body doesn't get scrunched up but rather the front of your body is a

55
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:06,199
little bit open and your belly can also a little bit

56
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:12,180
not be bunched up not be squeezed or

57
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,620
bit more open

58
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:24,259
maybe even allow it to relax and extend forward

59
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,259
gently closing your eyes

60
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:59,220
and maybe the dove is already starting to get moist

61
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,160
in the first few needs that you do

62
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:11,880
are large large long extended deep

63
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:17,940
really to kind of get started on the kneading of the dough

64
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:21,440
breathing in deeply

65
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:28,580
exhaling and relaxing into the body

66
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:46,280
breathing in deeply and exhaling so that the chest and the belly stay open

67
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,539
maybe even open a little bit more

68
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:57,139
by letting the muscles of your back

69
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:02,300
settle relax

70
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:24,800
and letting your breathing return to normal

71
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:39,120
and the body is malleable workable like a ball of dough maybe still not

72
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:46,440
completely moist everywhere parts of the body are not saturated with

73
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:53,820
awareness embodied awareness

74
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,839
breathing normally

75
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:34,580
maybe gently exhaling a little bit longer than usual

76
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:41,820
partly to so the Mind becomes more interested in

77
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,860
the body we're interested in breathing

78
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,720
or another deep instincts of the body is to breathe

79
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:09,019
the natural instinct to breathe in and breathe out

80
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:32,940
feeling breathing in your body how the body the Torso moves and

81
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,200
sensation shift

82
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,180
for this meditation in there

83
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:20,880
lovingly putting aside concerns with whatever you're thinking and also

84
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:29,600
whatever you're feeling emotionally not out of disrespect or

85
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:39,920
for these minutes it's all right to let those be on the side

86
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:51,500
to give yourself to the simple task of needing the body with breathing

87
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:03,019
and maybe as you exhale a gentle spreading

88
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:09,720
of attention awareness more broadly into the body

89
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,899
bit by bit wider and wider awareness

90
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:31,500
maybe on the inhale pulling in breathing in gathering together

91
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,300
his sense of preparing

92
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:43,459
to spread the awareness a bit more through the body

93
00:13:55,639 --> 00:14:02,060
perhaps gently a little bit longer exhales

94
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:16,620
in that extra longer period of exhaling this may be an occasion to feel more the

95
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:19,100
body

96
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:30,440
letting the thinking mind become quiet in favor of feeling the body

97
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,019
foreign

98
00:16:48,620 --> 00:16:53,759
yourself over to the rhythm of kneading

99
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,440
the rhythm of breathing

100
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:08,579
if you don't feel your body is so well inhale a little bit more so that the

101
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:13,400
chest expands the belly expands

102
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:21,660
if you still don't feel your body much gently hold your breath

103
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:29,280
at the top of the inhale the top of the exhale until the sensations of the body

104
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:34,340
ask you for to breathe

105
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:56,940
the kneading of dough doesn't make the bread

106
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:04,980
the kneading of the dough prepares the dough for the oven

107
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:09,080
prepares it to rise and

108
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,600
needing your body with the breathing

109
00:20:18,299 --> 00:20:25,260
done don't try to make your meditation into something

110
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:30,980
let it be the preparation loving gently

111
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:39,080
massaging the body with the breathing with awareness

112
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:45,919
that spreads as you breathe

113
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:10,500
when you stay close to the breathing the rhythm of breathing in and breathing

114
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:17,480
out the rhythm of movements in the body

115
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:22,700
there's less attention given to

116
00:25:24,179 --> 00:25:32,299
our reactivity our preoccupations or distractions or judgments

117
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,820
we're less likely to get lost in those

118
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:56,539
and it's possible when the rhythm of breathing in the body

119
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:07,559
to let breathing be connected to your care your love your

120
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:14,760
generosity your friendliness you might have for

121
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:22,340
others that those can coexist

122
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:30,179
and breathing can be like a gentle Bellows that blows

123
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:35,960
onto your good will for others

124
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:50,120
the exhale can be the gentle Bellows that blows your Good Will on others

125
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:10,759
as we breathe we are needing like kneading dough we're kneading

126
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:16,500
basic friendliness Goodwill

127
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:20,960
kindness to the world

128
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:36,019
by breathing staying in touch with ourselves

129
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:45,200
and letting her friendliness

130
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:50,720
radiate outward to the world

131
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:15,679
may all beings be happy

132
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,919
may all beings be safe

133
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:35,960
may all beings be peaceful

134
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:44,419
may all beings be free

135
00:28:55,400 --> 00:29:01,679
and may my respect and care and kindness

136
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:04,640
for others

137
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:14,820
live closely in my heart carried on the Winds of breathing

138
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:18,200
out into the world

139
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:38,789
[Music]

140
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:48,080
thank you

141
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,320
so warm hello on this Monday beginning of our week

142
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:07,799
and the theme for this week will be the Buddha's use of similes

143
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:12,960
for teaching meditation and um

144
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:20,940
it's possible to give very simple basic technical instructions on meditation

145
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:27,779
but that leaves a lot to be filled in by the meditator

146
00:31:27,779 --> 00:31:33,240
that Buddha did this he gave very simple instructions for breathing

147
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:39,419
and some people gloss over this instructions because they seemed too simple or

148
00:31:39,419 --> 00:31:44,700
or seemed kind of yeah kind of besides

149
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:51,120
the point almost the most basic instructions that he gave in a lot of different times

150
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:56,640
is one knows

151
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:02,640
when one is having a long inhale one knows one's having a long inhale

152
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:09,059
when one is having a long exhale one knows one's having a long exhale

153
00:32:09,059 --> 00:32:14,760
when one is having a short inhale one knows it's a shortened nail

154
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:20,700
when one is having a short exhale one knows this

155
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:26,720
and um so this doesn't really it's not very

156
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:31,799
inspiring or evocative it doesn't really indicate you know the

157
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:38,340
richness and the possibility of meditating in this way in fact some people it seems actually

158
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:47,960
maybe even discouraging or uninteresting uninspiring and and doesn't quite come alive

159
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:53,159
but the um and so in a sense the that

160
00:32:53,159 --> 00:33:00,059
simple instructions is just a a stand-in that represents a whole universe of what

161
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:05,340
can happen in meditation and it's kind of like a pointer or it's like a title

162
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:12,000
of a chapter that kind of gives you a sense of what the chapter is about but you know the

163
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,299
subject but that doesn't fill in the details that's what reading the chapter will do

164
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:25,399
and um and so meditation is something organic in a sense it's something that's

165
00:33:25,399 --> 00:33:31,679
holistic something that can can or with time includes all of who we are is

166
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:37,019
included in the practice of meditation it's not a simple

167
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:44,460
um you know certainly it's not a disembodied experience it's not only about becoming calm and centered

168
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:49,620
it's about gathering together all of who we are and having all of who we are

169
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:55,080
somehow held in a field of attention of awareness and

170
00:33:55,080 --> 00:34:01,399
and um and so it's uh multi-faceted it's

171
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:09,839
you know in a sense it's all of who we are not just a simple kind of mechanistic uh attention to how long and

172
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:16,679
short the breathing is and so to convey uh you know so so when

173
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:22,260
the Buddha gave instructions in meditation uh he sometimes would include

174
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:28,320
similes and the similes are actually part of the instructions they actually

175
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:34,980
give more life to the instructions they provide examples illustrations for how

176
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:42,480
to do the practice or how to a sense or feeling of what can happen as

177
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,020
we do them they provide kind of a somatic or kinesthetic feeling or sense

178
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:55,520
of what what's going on when we do this these instructions what can happen

179
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:02,940
and so this week I'd like to talk about these similes for meditation that the

180
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:11,460
Buddha gave and in particular we're going to focus on breathing in this guided meditation I just did I

181
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,280
felt that I talked quite a bit and those of you who are experienced meditators and

182
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:24,359
prefer to have silence I can sympathize with you and maybe for this week as we go through

183
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:31,380
this you would meditate a second time each day in the

184
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:36,480
silence admit and what I'm trying to do in the in the teachings here today is to

185
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:43,380
let some part of meditation become more alive and full for you um and so that when you do meditate uh

186
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:50,520
silently to you with yourself that that's with you kind of supporting you and guiding you and so if I speak a lot

187
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:56,099
uh with the instructions here this week think of them as laying the foundation

188
00:35:56,099 --> 00:36:01,680
for what you'll do maybe later in the day on your own and uh and to get the full benefit and

189
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:07,079
of what we're talking about and um

190
00:36:07,079 --> 00:36:14,640
so um um the it's kind of fascinating all the ways

191
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:20,220
the Buddha uses water in his similes especially similes for meditation

192
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:26,280
and sometimes I think water represents awareness and it's what happens to

193
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:32,880
awareness as we meditate that shifts and changes and and sometimes it seems more that

194
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:39,540
he's using water for it is using water to represent related things in meditation not to awareness

195
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:45,060
and how that works together is part of the richness that we kind of live into

196
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:50,880
so one of the um so this breathing in and breathing out

197
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,880
and being aware of long and short the the metaphor the assembly that I

198
00:36:56,880 --> 00:37:02,280
compared it to in this last sitting is that of needing flour

199
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:10,680
I'm mixing water into flour and then kneading it massaging it until the water

200
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,920
is evenly spread throughout the flower you make a ball where with the ball everything all the flowers held together

201
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:23,099
into the one hole and um and this is I think marvelous uh

202
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:28,380
metaphor for the Rhythm and massage of breathing and coming and going coming

203
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:34,079
and going and um and if if that's the kneading and

204
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:39,660
the awareness is the is the moisture then

205
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:48,420
um we're moving and developing that moisture of awareness so it spreads throughout the body and so the body gets uh uh gathered

206
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:54,660
together part of meditation in in the Buddhist teaching is a process of unification of

207
00:37:54,660 --> 00:38:00,020
gathering together bringing all of who we are in the same place at the same time

208
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:07,859
so there's a holistic feeling of being here connected in our lived experience

209
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:14,359
so this massaging that goes on and and so uh

210
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:21,260
so he gives us metaphor back in his time not of flower but of a certain kind of

211
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:28,619
soap powder that they had in the ancient world and that they would put the soap

212
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:35,339
powder into a metal Bowl basin and uh and then sprinkle water into it

213
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:43,560
and then start kneading massaging uh that fly that until the all the flour is

214
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:51,859
saturated with water the whole ball is saturated so if they go on with these wonderful uh words or kind of synonyms

215
00:38:51,859 --> 00:39:00,599
so the moisture pervades saturates suffuses fills uh the ball of soap

216
00:39:00,599 --> 00:39:08,579
powder so that the water suffuses pervades fills the the flower

217
00:39:08,579 --> 00:39:15,359
as we're making the dough the bread dough and um and this repetition of these

218
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:21,960
words is just kind of a delightful and you know the ancient world they weren't reading the text they were chanting it

219
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:28,680
and so to chant this over and over again you know this suffuse pervade saturate

220
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,859
fill it must have had kind of an embodied kind of reference point like when you chant it you just feel that

221
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:39,960
this is what we're doing and um

222
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:47,160
and so the Buddha goes onto says uh the same way as uh the person who's stopped

223
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:52,680
making this ball of soap powder that the whole thing is suffused so in the same

224
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:59,520
way the whole body is suffused uh uh with not no part of the body not touched

225
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,160
so it's clear that you know it's a really kind of a openness to the whole body

226
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,500
and uh and the way that this kneading of the flower uh wide works is a good

227
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:15,780
metaphor is that it's um it's kind of it represents the rhythm of breathing

228
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:23,460
breathing in and breathing out and um so here we take this as part of

229
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:30,540
the instructions that it's not just being aware of the long and the short but it's uh it's taking the whatever

230
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:36,780
like the the breathing every length of breathe that breathing is and entering

231
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:44,700
into it as if it's a massage it's as if we're supposed to get into the rhythm of it and kind of ride the Rhythm and kind

232
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:52,260
of let the awareness kind of gently not forcefully not with the expectations gently softly

233
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:58,680
um kind of kind of opened a wider and wider field of awareness in the body

234
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:03,780
and so we might start with awareness at a particular Point some people are aware

235
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:09,720
of the breathing and the nostril some people in the middle of the chest some people in the belly and really stay with

236
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:15,300
that be with that and then as we're doing it gently kind of a sense that

237
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:20,400
that sense of awareness and opening to the body kind of begins to spread and

238
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:27,359
spread and spread and um and then we're saturating the body with

239
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,900
awareness Technically when the Buddha gives us instructions it's not only awareness

240
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:40,440
but it's a certain kind of um satisfaction Delight

241
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:46,800
joy that comes when we can give our attention over to the meditation rather

242
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,900
than giving the attention to distractions to preoccupations

243
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:58,859
and this ability to appreciate attention to Value it and value attention which is

244
00:41:58,859 --> 00:42:04,800
not compromised by being pulled into these strong preoccupations we might

245
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,740
have it's also spreading that Delight that Joy with the awareness or feeling that

246
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:17,099
satisfaction of of awareness freed from distractions even if it's just for one

247
00:42:17,099 --> 00:42:23,720
exhale feeling the goodness of that the joy of that the satisfaction of UN

248
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:29,820
compromised awareness for a few moments that that satisfaction is what we're

249
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:35,640
spreading with the awareness through the body so there's a lightness there's a joy

250
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:42,540
there's a pleasure that of some kind that goes along with

251
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:49,320
the breathing maybe it's a subtle pleasure and but it's a pleasure of attention that's not

252
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:56,400
compromised or held hostage or something um in other metaphor that the Buddha

253
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,140
uses for water that has a very different reference for the moisture is

254
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:08,819
is taking to back the ancient world they didn't have matches the way we'd have or

255
00:43:08,819 --> 00:43:15,599
lighters or to light fires they would take Fire Sticks and rub the fire sticks together and if you rub it long enough

256
00:43:15,599 --> 00:43:24,119
they get hot then the spark gets created the and um but if the Fire Sticks even just

257
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:31,740
one of them is saturated with water and is moist the Fire won't get lit

258
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:40,380
and so here the water the the this the Soggy uh the stick the Soggy log that

259
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:46,079
you're um is uh the Mind saturated with

260
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:54,180
preoccupations with the hindrances with desires sensual desires and ill will and

261
00:43:54,180 --> 00:44:00,480
uh rigidity and stuckness and restlessness and all kinds of things

262
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,359
where they that grab the awareness and when we're saturated with that

263
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:11,700
um the Fire won't light up but so as we empty ourselves as

264
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:18,000
attention is not caught in those things and getting all kind of and then

265
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:25,500
awareness is kind of drier and can light up in the ancient world I think of Fire

266
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:32,339
that we relate even a small one like a candle was much more associated with

267
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:38,880
making light than it is for us because we have lots of light and electricity most of us

268
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:45,480
and but in the ancient world the fires one more form or other was a oil lamp a

269
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:51,359
candle the fire was how things were laid up

270
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:58,020
so so the uh um so to light up

271
00:44:58,020 --> 00:45:04,560
with awareness which is not compromised by distractions to light up the body

272
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:10,800
not necessarily put it on fire but to light it up and spread the awareness through the

273
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:17,220
body so these are the similes that Buddha uses and I think for many years I

274
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:22,920
ignored the similes because I don't know I just thought they were just kind of cute or something but

275
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:28,800
they're actually part of the instructions they fill in the details in certain kind of way

276
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:36,660
and with the similes the Imagine our imagination is is uh employed for the purposes of

277
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:42,540
meditation and so maybe uh for this next day you

278
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:49,380
could try meditating and engage your imagination with these similes

279
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:54,420
and see if having those these similes kind of present to your imagination a

280
00:45:54,420 --> 00:46:01,619
little bit can gives you a richer deeper sense of to get you connected and involved in your meditation maybe even

281
00:46:01,619 --> 00:46:09,599
absorbed in your meditation as you free your awareness from preoccupations

282
00:46:09,599 --> 00:46:14,880
where you get all soggy and there's no light nothing lights up

283
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:21,380
to this lighting up of attention that moves and fills the body

284
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:26,579
so um so that's I'll talk more about similes and Imagination as we go through

285
00:46:26,579 --> 00:46:34,200
the week and different similes the Buddha gave and I'm hoping this will kind of give you a richer sense of

286
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:40,520
what's possible in your meditation so thank you
