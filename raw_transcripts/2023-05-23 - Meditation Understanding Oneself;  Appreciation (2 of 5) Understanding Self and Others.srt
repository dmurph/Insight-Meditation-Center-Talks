1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:08,540
so good morning and welcome

2
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:16,040
and I appreciate the chance to be here today and

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:23,300
more poignant even more the appreciation that the theme of the week is appreciation

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:31,800
so for this meditation I'd like to suggest that one of the

5
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:40,260
purposes of meditation mindfulness meditation is for us to understand ourselves better

6
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:45,780
and if there's too much emphasis on relaxation or having particular

7
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:51,180
experience of concentration or

8
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,699
even to emphasis is on somehow diminishing the

9
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:05,820
amount of suffering we have all those are fine but if they're done at the cost of

10
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:11,400
not really understanding oneself well and deeply then

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:19,759
they some of the ways in which our mind our hearts behave or act or function

12
00:01:19,939 --> 00:01:25,799
will continue to operate subconsciously or in ways we don't understand because

13
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:34,100
we don't understand ourselves and we won't necessarily understand what our needs are very well or what our

14
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:40,460
challenges are that we have to somehow would be nice to

15
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,960
live a preventive life preventing or suffering rather than responding to our

16
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,619
suffering or trying to reduce it once it's there

17
00:01:52,619 --> 00:02:00,000
so this task of understanding and what is it that you don't understand

18
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,079
about yourself that's sitting quietly can make known

19
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:13,200
not to analyze or think about this question and now to analyze and think about

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,520
whatever understanding that comes but even just the attitude that what

21
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,319
we're doing here is making ourselves available to understand ourselves in a deep way

22
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:33,959
uh and um so

23
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:39,180
part of what's helpful for that is not to not to come with a lot of

24
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:47,280
preconceived ideas not to come with preconceived attitudes about ourselves about what we're doing

25
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:52,319
any preconceived Tendencies to judge in any kind of negative but also positive

26
00:02:52,319 --> 00:03:00,480
ways but to really be able to quiet and be still and just with a kind of a

27
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,060
open available mind what is it to be understood here

28
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:16,280
how could I understand myself better so to assume a meditation posture

29
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:24,120
and to close your eyes and perhaps with this theme today to

30
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:31,280
begin right away if you're quiet just with your eyes closed

31
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:37,260
and take a deep look at yourself as you are right now

32
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,420
what is there to understand about yourself

33
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:53,400
what is it to understand that's maybe particular to this moment the

34
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,360
thicker their time

35
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:07,159
as if you're a friend to yourself a friend who really listens

36
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,239
what is there to understand right now

37
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,300
so then to take a few long slow deep breaths

38
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:33,259
relaxing as you exhale

39
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:09,000
letting your breathing return to normal until we still relax your body as you

40
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:15,360
exhale relaxing is also

41
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:20,720
a releasing or giving in to the pull of gravity

42
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:44,060
and as you exhale

43
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,780
to also soften the thinking mind

44
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,360
a calming of the thinking mind

45
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,638
like calming the waves on an ocean

46
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,080
thank you

47
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,000
and then to settle in here with your breathing

48
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:11,180
maybe letting go of thoughts as you do

49
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:50,300
and what do you have to understand or acknowledge about yourself

50
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:58,700
so that that understanding might allow you

51
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:05,660
to settle further into this moment breathing

52
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,579
if you understand any ways that you're unsettled

53
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:14,699
maybe that can and create space or

54
00:16:14,699 --> 00:16:22,699
room for a calming attitude

55
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,800
towards whatever is unsettled in you

56
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,460
thank you

57
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:12,600
in order for your heart your mind to be Freer

58
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,658
well it'd be useful to understand about yourself

59
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:27,659
what stands in the way of deep ease and peace

60
00:23:27,659 --> 00:23:31,100
that in knowing that

61
00:23:33,260 --> 00:23:40,039
moves you in the direction of peace and ease freedom

62
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:12,380
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

63
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:21,559
what might you understand about yourself Here and Now

64
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,900
that might open you prepare you

65
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:35,720
to look out upon the world with kind eyes

66
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:45,260
with eyes of appreciation appreciating others

67
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:55,760
eyes of good will wishing others well

68
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:07,820
into it and the sitting

69
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:15,919
with gazing upon the world kindly and wishing it well

70
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:23,419
may all beings be happy

71
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:27,860
may all beings be safe

72
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:37,760
may all beings be peaceful may all beings be free

73
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:47,120
may all beings be happy in being well understood

74
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:53,299
may all beings be saved

75
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:58,039
cause they're well understood

76
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:07,879
may all beings become peaceful having been understood by others

77
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:16,500
may all beings be free because others have helped them

78
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:20,000
understand themselves

79
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,620
may we live for the welfare and happiness of the world

80
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:34,820
and may understanding be a vehicle for that

81
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:54,369
[Music]

82
00:28:56,940 --> 00:29:02,890
thank you [Music]

83
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:19,260
so good morning and um

84
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:26,880
welcome announcement before giving a talk

85
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:36,200
and um that is that I thought that this Friday we could have a community meeting

86
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:42,299
for those of you those of us in this YouTube Sangha

87
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:48,260
and so after this is over at about 7 45 on Friday

88
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:53,580
I'll open a zoom room and and then we

89
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:59,039
could meet there and you know I could have some discussion and maybe have some

90
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:05,159
breakout groups you could meet each other a bit and I kind of want to do it partly

91
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:11,220
because I'll be gone the month of June I'm going to go and do a self retreat

92
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:16,500
up in the Sierras and I'll be completely disconnected from

93
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:21,720
the electronic world and um and so I thought with my absence

94
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:29,520
before going off we'd love to say hello and chat little bit and and talk a little bit and so I'll post

95
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:37,799
the zoom Link in the calendar for the Friday event also on

96
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:44,460
the IMC what's new page and also I'll put it in the chat here

97
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:50,279
for on YouTube so you'll find the different places I'll repeat these ideas on Thursday

98
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:56,899
and um and those of you who don't want to go on Zoom we'll keep the YouTube

99
00:31:56,899 --> 00:32:02,399
continuing but there might not be in much exchange and I might be looking at

100
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:08,399
the screen for the people on on Zoom

101
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:15,260
so um look forward to meeting those of you who stay for that

102
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:22,380
so one of the ways of appreciating people one of the ways of showing

103
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:28,940
appreciation is to show them that they are understood understood

104
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:35,640
humans have a big need for to be understood I've been in many situations where

105
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:40,799
there's been conflict and people disagreeing vehemently about

106
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:46,380
something and or some people quite hurt by some behavior and they're trying to work it

107
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:53,039
out and the whole situation changes when uh

108
00:32:53,039 --> 00:33:00,360
one of the parties or both parties understands the other shows that they understand how what's going on for the

109
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:06,960
other person they haven't necessarily agreed with the other party's uh

110
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,140
point of view but they have understood the point of view and made that clear understood

111
00:33:13,140 --> 00:33:18,419
maybe the background for that point of view or background of what happened and their experience of something

112
00:33:18,419 --> 00:33:25,919
and there's kind of like a magic magic that happens in communities and in between people when someone it feels

113
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,320
like they've been understood something can relax oftentimes some even if yeah there can be a greater

114
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:37,860
feeling of safety or or being respected and so

115
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:43,620
um when we run into people situations where they're suffering and a situation

116
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:48,980
which maybe evokes our compassion to quickly respond compassionately

117
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:55,580
before we really assess the situation well can lead to inappropriate action

118
00:33:55,580 --> 00:34:01,260
inappropriate intervention or intervention or connection or support

119
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:06,720
for someone else that maybe isn't as rich or as valuable as it could be

120
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:12,419
so one of the ways of appreciating people one of the elements of compassion

121
00:34:12,419 --> 00:34:19,399
is to take the time to understand them better and um

122
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:26,158
and part of understanding them an important part of that would be to understand oneself better

123
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:33,060
because without understanding oneself we want to understand the bias we have or

124
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:39,540
the the orientations we use to understand the situation

125
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:46,740
different people can encounter the same person who's suffering and see the suffering in very different ways some

126
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:52,980
people primarily might see it as something emotional and respond as to their emotional situation

127
00:34:52,980 --> 00:35:00,180
some people might understand it as as physical and let's make sure that we get

128
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:06,359
people some water and food some people might see it as being something societal or something about a

129
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:12,900
larger situation we have to fix and so they're fixing the situation to help them feel better but we're not really

130
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:18,420
taking time to know them and so we Orient ourselves sometimes

131
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,940
very quickly in times of suffering because we think it's a crisis or we're we're alarmed

132
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:31,020
but if it's possible to slow down and take time to understand the other person

133
00:35:31,020 --> 00:35:36,720
and even if we can't support them or help them with their particular suffering it can make a huge difference

134
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:42,420
for people that they are understood and now that they feel understood or

135
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:47,579
their situation is really taken into account and so to

136
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:54,480
um uh and I've known people I've been to with people for example in the hospital where people were caring for them in the

137
00:35:54,480 --> 00:36:01,260
hospital but the people did not feel really understood in their suffering and their challenges they were having

138
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:07,920
and for someone to come and and not try to fix their medical situation or not

139
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:13,800
try to I know make a nice picture of it all you'll be okay but to really

140
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:21,180
acknowledge oh I understand that this is difficult for you um something relaxes in the person

141
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:27,119
so take time to understand the other person and maybe simple questions maybe

142
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:33,060
how is it for you and and oh this must be difficult for you you might say and

143
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:38,640
and then the person that's a prompt for a person sometimes to want to explain more and say more

144
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:46,619
because they know you're interested you seem to be attuned to them and um or you ask you you know that this

145
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:52,260
is this sounds this seems really difficult what's happening uh what part do you find the most difficult

146
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:57,420
because uh you sometimes we can be quite surprised but what we think the

147
00:36:57,420 --> 00:37:02,760
difficulty if we're someone else is very different it might be you're focusing on

148
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,300
them and their challenge they have but they're actually focusing on how their challenge is limiting their ability to

149
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:16,260
take care of a relative or a neighbor or something and so in helping them you might be

150
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:22,260
missing what's really important for them so um to ask you know to understand

151
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:27,300
others is a form of appreciation and allows us

152
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:33,540
also to find out what we can appreciate by people when people think that we really want to

153
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:40,500
understand them or we're beginning to understand them some people will open up more some people will relax and we see

154
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:46,619
them more fully and there's more to appreciate the more we appreciate the

155
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:52,820
you know the the uh the more it's beginning to be a compassionate action

156
00:37:52,820 --> 00:38:01,920
compassionate action can begins with appreciation begins with understanding that is compassion in in action

157
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:07,140
the other part of this understanding is how important it is to understand ourselves

158
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:13,320
the we have so many biases so many so much

159
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:19,500
so much conditioning about how we encounter suffering and do we understand

160
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:26,160
that what we're doing is really wanting to support the other person or are we taking care of ourselves some people

161
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,500
said you have compassion is to address suffering so that they don't have to

162
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:36,920
feel bad um it's more taking care of ourselves to

163
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:44,240
fixing others to take care of ourselves to make ourselves more comfortable or it could be that we have a certain

164
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:50,220
opinions about what does uh deserve compassion and what doesn't or what

165
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:56,820
counts for suffering and what doesn't or what elements of the life need to be

166
00:38:56,820 --> 00:39:02,599
addressed when they're suffering and so all these kind of to understand that we have

167
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:08,640
preconceived ideas often that we carry with us to understand the situation

168
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:14,880
and this is where mindfulness is invaluable because when we have trained ourselves

169
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:21,240
to be mindful we can we'll start becoming more sensitive to the beginning point of an

170
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:27,300
opinion we have the beginning point of an orientation of you a selective

171
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:34,560
process of a way of thinking and we can see it Arise at the beginning then we

172
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:41,460
can question it put a question mark is this really so if we see we're focusing on people's

173
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:48,119
emotional life is it really so that that's what's needed do I always look for reading people's

174
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:54,900
emotions or there's what comes up is idea something needs to be fixed here and I'm

175
00:39:54,900 --> 00:40:00,540
responsible to fix it one of my achilles heels is the sense of

176
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:06,300
responsibility for things but you're not necessarily my responsibility it's up to me

177
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:13,140
so I've had to learn to notice that in myself that how quickly that gets activated that oh it's you know I have

178
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:18,380
to take care of the situation where it's not mine take care of but it is mine to

179
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:23,940
connect to someone help people feel understood to appreciate people to

180
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:29,820
empathize to sympathize and so forth

181
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:37,680
uh also to understand that um you know what are we trying to do when

182
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:44,579
we are being compassionate or when we're trying to be with suffering um what are we trying to are we trying

183
00:40:44,579 --> 00:40:49,619
to you know how much self is involved there are we trying to look good are we

184
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:56,460
trying to um look good in the eyes of people who are not even here that we're supposed to

185
00:40:56,460 --> 00:41:03,540
be a certain way are there a lot of shoulds that we're operating under or or opinions that um

186
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:10,740
that uh you know are we scared so to understand ourselves better so

187
00:41:10,740 --> 00:41:16,339
both these movements take a little bit of time and

188
00:41:16,339 --> 00:41:24,320
maybe in some situations we have the time and so to not be a rushed into

189
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:30,300
compassionate action but to take time to appreciate the other person to find what there is to

190
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:35,760
appreciate to appreciate something about maybe that's deeper than their surface

191
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:43,140
Behavior or what they're saying and and then to uh try to understand

192
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:49,500
them a little bit more deeper what's behind their surface Behavior what's behind what they're saying

193
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:58,140
what uh what what do they need what do they think they need what is their uh

194
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:04,800
what does this difficulty mean for them or what is it how did they understand it for themselves but because there's so

195
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:10,560
many facets which of them it might be that facet that's important for you that

196
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:15,020
you think is important is not important for them

197
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:21,240
so to and then to turn the attention to yourself

198
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:27,960
and to ask the question you know what is there to understand about myself in relationship to the suffering that

199
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:34,140
I'm encountering am I afraid am I over eager to fix do I feel

200
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:40,500
responsible do I am I judging the person in some way or other what they're doing

201
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:48,240
so um so to

202
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,579
um so one element of appreciation is

203
00:42:53,579 --> 00:43:01,560
understanding in fact maybe we can't really appreciate others without some deeper level of understanding about them

204
00:43:01,560 --> 00:43:07,200
so an important element of compassion is

205
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:13,500
appreciation and an important element of appreciation is understanding

206
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:19,079
so um you might see how this works today when

207
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:25,260
you're with people maybe they don't have to know that you're you're making an effort to understand them better

208
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:30,500
but you might see if you can you can kind of in their conversations with others

209
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:37,200
ask yourself you know what is it what is it to under can I take time to understand this person more

210
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:44,460
uh can I understand myself more if I understand myself maybe I'll understand them better

211
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:49,920
and in that deeper understanding is there a deeper appreciation

212
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:55,079
and is there a deeper understanding of what are the issues that need to be

213
00:43:55,079 --> 00:44:01,619
addressed so um thank you very much

214
00:44:01,619 --> 00:44:07,980
and um we'll continue this um

215
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:14,780
discussion about different aspects of appreciation tomorrow thank you
