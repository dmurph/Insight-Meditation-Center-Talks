00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:10,799
hello everyone and welcome you to IMC

2
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:18,439
into our meditation together and

3
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:27,779
as we begin uh I want to mention that the attitude with

4
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,180
which we meditate might be more important than how we

5
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:42,260
meditate than practice meditation practice we do if we do a practice that is

6
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:51,539
striving we are just developing more striving if we do a meditation practice that has

7
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,680
a lot of focus on myself as a good meditator

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,480
capable capable meditator we might just be developing more preoccupation with

9
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,560
self if we do meditation half-heartedly

10
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,960
we might be cultivating more half-heartedness in our lives

11
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,200
but if we do a meditation practice wholeheartedly

12
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:30,600
as if each moment is arriving each moment is

13
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:37,200
fulfilling the the purpose of meditation

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,659
so we're not ahead of ourselves not trying to make something happen but

15
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:49,979
cultivating more a deep groundedness a deep settleness here in this experience

16
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:54,740
then we're developing that for ourselves

17
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:02,700
a way of being at home in this moment and if we meditate with the attitude

18
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,880
of deep listening that we're here to listen to ourselves

19
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:15,239
in a deep way then we cultivate number of things we cultivate listening we also cultivate

20
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:21,660
respect and we cultivate a openness

21
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:27,060
that allows something inside of us to reveal itself

22
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:34,200
if we're with a friend who's quite shook up about something and not really ready to speak we used to sit with them we

23
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:41,819
walk with them we bring them tea and we're we attend to them we're present for them but we don't push them to speak

24
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:47,400
if someone has something very important to say but they can't find the words they're

25
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:55,019
challenged they're it's difficult emotionally to start speaking then again we don't push them and

26
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:01,800
we sit with them and we're available and we're attentive waiting ready for when they want to

27
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:07,500
speak and then eventually since our friend began speaking

28
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,959
so the same something similar with ourselves that what's deeper in US

29
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,780
the deeper truths about who we are what's going on

30
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:25,019
they might need they might be shy they might be quiet they might need us to be quiet so we can

31
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:31,200
hear they also what's deeper in us might

32
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,580
not might not be ready to reveal itself to us until we have the right attitude of

33
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:46,019
acceptance or openness or non-assertiveness but wholehearted but may be available in

34
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:53,459
a wholehearted listening we're not coming with our judgments and expectations and desires even perhaps

35
00:03:53,459 --> 00:04:02,700
even with our fears all those are allowed to settle for an attitude of availability

36
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,840
so to assume a meditation posture

37
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,979
and perhaps are some way of elongating your spine a little bit

38
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:22,560
or maybe elongating little bit in the neck and letting that

39
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:27,919
chin tucked down a little bit towards the chest

40
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,060
and then to either lower your gaze

41
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:40,400
or to close your eyes

42
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:48,780
and letting the eyes be relaxed there's no need to be looking at

43
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:57,258
anything with the eyes searching for anything and the eyes can rest in their sockets

44
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:13,979
and without taking some deep breaths listen feel your way

45
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:21,000
to the beginning of the inhale where in the body

46
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,039
is the first indication that you're going to breathe in

47
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:29,060
first movement

48
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,220
where's the first indication you're going to Exhale

49
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,240
the beginning of that movement

50
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:01,580
and where does the exhale end it's a last sensation

51
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,199
that characterizes exhaling

52
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:08,000
and now from the beginning of the inhale

53
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,400
to the end of the inhale breathing in deeply

54
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,960
connecting to your body from the inside

55
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:27,740
feeling the expansion of the Torso

56
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:40,220
and let there be a lengthy exhale all the way to the end of the exhale

57
00:07:57,360 --> 00:08:05,300
breathing in deeply and fully and relaxing on the exhale

58
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,800
and letting your breathing return to normal

59
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:14,700
and for the next three or four breaths continue settling in on the exhale

60
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,700
relaxing

61
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,360
on the exhale relaxing the thinking mind

62
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:36,259
soften in the mind

63
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,480
and then settling into breathing

64
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:18,540
without any concern for anything that's before or after

65
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,860
one inhale

66
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,540
without any concern for anything that's before or after

67
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:37,560
the exhale as of each breath no matter how

68
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:46,200
comfortable or uncomfortable it is is arriving here

69
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,940
is the destination

70
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:04,260
to be with each in-breath and out breath it's not the beginning of a process of

71
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:11,660
meditation it's the completion of it for that moment in that breath

72
00:12:53,339 --> 00:12:58,940
with each inhale you arrive in the present moment

73
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:05,240
with each exhale you arrive here and now

74
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:14,120
to be content with that as if that's the fullness of it all

75
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:36,120
and then to the degree to which you're here with each breath

76
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:43,880
here in the moment see if you can have an attitude

77
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:51,959
of being available to whatever wants to reveal itself

78
00:13:51,959 --> 00:13:59,279
deep inside what is your depths

79
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:05,480
want to say and how can you listen

80
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,440
foreign

81
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:11,299
nothing more to do but to be here available to hear sense feel

82
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,080
what is here

83
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:43,220
and then coming to the end of the meditation taking a short period here

84
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:49,639
to maybe let go of whatever meditation you've been doing

85
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:56,778
and instead just to listen deeply to yourself

86
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:05,220
if you're available quietly not searching not trying looking for something

87
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:10,159
just available for yourself

88
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:17,360
what shows itself to you

89
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:34,580
and might it feel good

90
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:46,380
for how you are to be received and known

91
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:54,080
in the simplest possible way hello to be as you are

92
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:17,460
and may it be that what we learn about listening to ourselves being available

93
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:23,340
to hear feel discover how we are in some deep

94
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:30,299
way may it be that we can apply this to

95
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:35,460
others we could learn to do it in our relationships

96
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:42,620
to be listeners to be present to be available

97
00:27:42,659 --> 00:27:50,279
for them so what's in in them in their depths

98
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:58,460
you can have space can be accepted can be known

99
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:02,779
even if they don't tell us

100
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:13,039
maybe it's good for them to have this respect and care

101
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:17,658
and may it be

102
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:30,919
that the benefits of our mindfulness our ability to be present

103
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:42,020
serves for the welfare and happiness of the world may all beings be happy

104
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,559
may all beings be safe

105
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:55,919
may all beings be peaceful

106
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:01,760
and may all beings everywhere be free

107
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,840
thank you

108
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:39,200
so good morning everyone and welcome to the second talk

109
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:45,740
on wise listening and uh

110
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:54,240
it's a really a fantastic thing to become a

111
00:30:54,240 --> 00:31:00,000
listener to listen well to listen well to ourselves to listen

112
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:06,779
well to others and so I want to read a

113
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:12,720
a poem by a Japanese poet named

114
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:16,940
Shin kichi Takahashi

115
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:27,000
it's a short poem I don't take your words merrily as words

116
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,679
far from it I listen to what makes you talk

117
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:40,940
whatever that is and me listen

118
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:48,299
so it's not just listening to what people have to say certainly that's important especially if they want us to

119
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:54,299
understand but it's also listening to what makes them speak what's the motivation what's

120
00:31:54,299 --> 00:32:01,260
the underlying kind of um inspiration or movement to speak

121
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:08,460
because there is the message of the words and also there's the message of what's making a person say what they're

122
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:15,179
going to say is it the movement to feel more connected to you

123
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:24,380
or is it a movement to pull away to avoid you Martin is it a movement to

124
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:31,140
appraise themselves and get affirmation or is it a movement to apologize for

125
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:36,240
themselves and to somehow make themselves smaller in relationship to you

126
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,279
is it because they want to get something from you or is it because they want to support

127
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:47,580
you and see what they can offer you uh is it uh are they saying what they're

128
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:54,720
saying so that in fact they do feel maybe safer with

129
00:32:54,720 --> 00:33:01,260
you or feel more like a sense of friendliness or connection

130
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:07,080
or what are they saying what they want to say because they want to be safe and they're trying to create some safety

131
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,440
so that goes on the list can go on and on and um but if we are only taking the

132
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:18,659
literal meaning of the words into account we

133
00:33:18,659 --> 00:33:25,440
might actually be missing a huge part of what's really happening in the conversation

134
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:32,640
and and so to go along with the teaching last week on a right speech where the

135
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:38,220
the second criteria for right speeches is it true

136
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:45,559
so for a wise listening what's most true here what's really true

137
00:33:45,559 --> 00:33:51,240
because sometimes the literal meanings of the words of what people speak

138
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:58,320
it might be true enough but not really the truth that needs to be expressed really the truth that is what's

139
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,360
happening here for the person and um you know if a person is praising

140
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:10,858
you which might feel nice and you might get distracted by the niceness of the praise but if you listen what's behind

141
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:18,300
the praise and um and maybe people feel insecure and they're looking for some way to make

142
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,460
themselves safe in uh in your presence because if they praise you you'll relax

143
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:31,200
and not threaten them so if that's what's true under the words that's a powerful and important truth to

144
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:39,118
recognize and if we care for them and offer them general you know genuine care then we

145
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:45,300
take that into account and maybe the praise is not that important what's

146
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:51,599
important is that we show that them that we're that they have nothing to fear with us

147
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:59,099
if if what they want is they're trying to manipulate us to get with something that's actually important to see that's

148
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:06,060
actually more true than the words the words might actually be deceptive and so if what's true is they're trying

149
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:14,700
to trick us into getting something from us then um then if we know that then how do we

150
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:20,160
care for them then do we simply cut them out and say no or avoid them

151
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:25,200
but you can also keep asking more deeply what what drives them to want to try to

152
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:31,800
get something for me are they afraid are they insecure are they poor and

153
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:37,619
desperate what's happening for people and um and this idea of listening for

154
00:35:37,619 --> 00:35:43,440
what's most true uh in others is a powerful gift we give to people

155
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:51,180
what is most true for this person here now is it uh and you know so this then going

156
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:59,760
under the words going deeper what is most true and my suggestion and I thought that the

157
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:06,599
kind of the Assumption the theory that I operate under is that if you could find what is most

158
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:11,880
true in yourself most true in others you discover Beauty you discover something

159
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:18,599
precious just whatever is mean tender something that uh it's uh easy to love

160
00:36:18,599 --> 00:36:26,520
or care for or be generous towards and even people have the the you know the

161
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:32,760
worst behavior and horrible words of hate and and um

162
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:39,420
um if we can listen if we can be present enough and behind the hate behind those

163
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:46,619
words behind the attitude of hate that's there and good what is most true at the depths

164
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:53,160
of who they are and I'm not saying this is Universal at all but what comes to mind right now is

165
00:36:53,160 --> 00:37:00,300
that there we might find that even though the person is a grown-up we find a scared three-year-old

166
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:07,079
that somehow never no one ever cared for that fear and and it never got resolved

167
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:12,240
and and the hate is just an expression of trying to be safe trying to have a

168
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:18,900
temper temper tantrum to get attention or something and so again I'm not assuming that all

169
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:24,000
hate is this way but this Theory this assumption that I

170
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:31,578
like to operate under these yet if you go deep enough you find what's most true you find something beautiful

171
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,960
um I'm not going to claim it's always that that's always the case but

172
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:44,220
um it's uh very often if that's the Assumption and we listen for it that's

173
00:37:44,220 --> 00:37:51,420
what gets then it has a chance to come forward then it has a chance to be discovered and but if we don't have that

174
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:57,599
theory then never be discovered and then um

175
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:02,820
so um so to listen what is most true what's what's the most important thing

176
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:08,960
here what's the the root of all this behavior that we hear and see

177
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:15,780
and um so to listen to be available to sense and I love the idea of this kind of

178
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:21,300
listening being being an availability because we're no we're not

179
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:26,640
rushing people we're not probing necessarily to get to the bottom unless

180
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:33,540
they're asking us let's to can you help me explore something but if um but just this deep sense of

181
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:40,740
availability and the lesson of that kind of listening and availability is that we can be

182
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:46,800
complete we can be at ease we can be at home in this world in that availability

183
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:52,640
which is available for what's here we're not uh

184
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:59,160
anxious about Sierra or greedy of what's here or expecting something or

185
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:07,859
you know wanting it to be different there's something very powerful about just feeling and sensing oh this is good

186
00:39:07,859 --> 00:39:13,380
and I saw this with um when I was Raising young children

187
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:21,420
that how significant it was about the attitude the adults around them had

188
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:26,640
and if the adults who were anxious Were Somehow teaching the kids that the world

189
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:33,960
doesn't a dangerous place and you should be anxious but the parents who even when things

190
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:39,800
were difficult and challenging had a sense of being at ease and at home here

191
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:45,180
and that the the children were learning this lesson that oh this world is a

192
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:50,220
place where I can feel at home I can feel at ease even when there are challenges

193
00:39:50,220 --> 00:39:56,460
so this idea of listening available as if there's nothing else we need to do and

194
00:39:56,460 --> 00:40:04,619
we're just content and happy to be present and available in here and and be a listener I think it's

195
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:14,240
medicine for many people to do this so to listen for what is most true

196
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:20,820
and I believe that to do that well we have

197
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:26,760
to also have done that for ourselves to listen to hear to sense what is most

198
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:32,040
true here but not to do it searching into the future

199
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,920
but more as arriving here and being available so what's that deep inside of

200
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:44,280
us stops being shy or feels it's okay to come forth and

201
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:51,359
reveal itself so the attitude it's creating in ourselves an attitude of Welcome

202
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,838
availability to ourselves and to others

203
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:02,579
so um so if these uh

204
00:41:02,579 --> 00:41:07,940
words about listening today or

205
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:17,400
seem interesting for you to experiment with during the day you might say in the right time

206
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:22,680
um be a little bit wise about the time to do it not automatically do it everywhere you go with all conversations

207
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:29,220
you go but you might see if you can what happens to you if in your mind you ask

208
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:36,599
yourself the question what is most true here under these words behind these words that this person's speaking uh

209
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:44,579
what is what is most true what's making them say what they're saying and um but don't be probing and don't be

210
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:50,040
a microscope staring at them but rather be available

211
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:55,260
to sense and feel be available most as if uh if you're really asking that

212
00:41:55,260 --> 00:42:00,320
question and available maybe something will be revealed you don't have to

213
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:07,500
figure it out so thank you very much

214
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:16,200
and um and uh I will look forward to tomorrow

215
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:23,660
and thank you
