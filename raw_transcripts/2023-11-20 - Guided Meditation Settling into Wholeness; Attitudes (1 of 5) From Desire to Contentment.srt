1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,760
so I have been away and Retreats the last two weeks and uh I still

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:16,760
feel somehow the presence of those Retreats and so I'm going to offer something uh this morning for meditation

3
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:25,480
that does come um that does uh come to

4
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:30,800
um uh from from the retreat

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:38,480
and we'll see if it works for you all this way outside of Retreats and

6
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:45,640
um so now some people are saying they have no sound but I think that

7
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:57,399
uh uh let's see let's wait a moment and see if uh what other people say sound is

8
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:05,000
good okay so I think that uh it might be a local

9
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:13,400
issue so okay so we'll start and um I'll take you maybe on a

10
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:19,200
little journey uh for

11
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:25,000
uh um the general theme for this week is

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:31,280
attitude the attitudes that we live our lives by and some of these attitudes are

13
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:38,320
quite deep some of these attitudes are uh we're not often conscious of them but

14
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,360
they can be pervasive uh setting the mood or setting the orientation

15
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,560
perspective by which we live our lives and how we understand ourselves and part of the possibility of

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:58,240
meditation is that it's a um quieting movement of the mind so

17
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:08,319
that we begin quieting some of of the voices some of the attitudes some of the beliefs some of the uh ways of thinking

18
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:15,560
ways of believing about ourselves our life that have a chance to quiet down because they're no longer active every

19
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:21,120
belief every way of thinking is an activity of the mind it's not inherent

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:27,879
in the universe and so to quiet the thinking mind so that we see ourselves and see

21
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:34,480
the world without the usual f filters of how we uh approach the world the usual

22
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:39,800
filters for understanding ourselves the internalized messages we

23
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:47,080
have from our society about who we are or all kinds of conclusions we have and these are getting

24
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:54,360
quieter and so when we start meditation with the process of relaxation um this is not

25
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:01,280
uh beginning Buddhism it's really the the uh uh part and parcel of this very

26
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:08,280
deep movement to settling

27
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:15,680
deactivating some of the unnecessary activations of the mind that do not give us a

28
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:23,680
accurate perspective on this life of ours so to assume a meditation

29
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:31,680
posture and to gently close your eyes

30
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:41,280
and take a few moments to feel your body as if it's okay to be just the way

31
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:50,239
you are whatever way you are almost as if you appreciate that

32
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:57,599
whatever is happening for you whatever way you are is part of a wholeness of the

33
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,720
moment and you are going to to sit in the middle of that

34
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,920
wholeness feeling and knowing the discomforts of the body the emotions of

35
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:15,599
the body the tensions as if it's part of the

36
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,518
wholeness discovering what's

37
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
here

38
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:42,680
and then gently taking some deeper breaths and on the exhale relaxing the

39
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:01,560
body not breathing in too deeply but just enough so that's there's a pleasure

40
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:09,479
aliveness that comes from breathing in deeply and then relaxing the muscles of

41
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:11,720
the

42
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:24,880
face maybe you can imagine the muscles of the face falling away from the bone the

43
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:36,319
skull relaxing around the

44
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,520
eyes and then to breathe gently and

45
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:12,440
deeply as you exhale relax the shoulders soften in the

46
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:28,400
shoulders there's a way in which relaxing the body the tensions of the

47
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,599
body helps the mind to

48
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,198
relax the tensions in the body begin in the

49
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:52,080
mind breathing in and relaxing the

50
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
belly

51
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:19,680
on the exhale now the feel the feel the area of your heart

52
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:26,240
heart center and relax soften in the

53
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,319
heart

54
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:53,000
as you continue relaxing the thinking

55
00:07:53,000 --> 00:08:01,599
muscle whatever Sensations there are in the head or in thighs shoulder

56
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:05,400
belly connected to

57
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:19,800
thinking ancient Buddhists imagine there was a puppeteer in the

58
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,720
head with strings that tugged on all the

59
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:30,599
muscles and letting that Puppeteer relax

60
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:33,120
settle

61
00:08:47,959 --> 00:08:54,320
down and then relaxing on the exhale down into

62
00:08:54,320 --> 00:09:01,200
your torso maybe even all the way down to the belly

63
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,160
and feeling the movements of the body as you

64
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:28,120
breathe maybe almost as if you're gently being rocked by by small waves as you float on

65
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
water

66
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,640
for if there's a lot of

67
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,320
thinking with each

68
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:14,839
exhale quiet the thinking

69
00:10:27,079 --> 00:10:34,519
mind if you think in [Music] words let your thinking become like a

70
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:42,120
library voice quiet soft maybe even

71
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:52,200
loving if you think in images perhaps there's a way of slowing them

72
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,040
down or letting them recede a little bit into the

73
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,680
distance so they're not so

74
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
pressing

75
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
for

76
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:29,600
allowing the Torso the belly the chest

77
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:35,839
to experience the movements of

78
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:46,360
breathing maybe as gentle waves while you're sitting on a little

79
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:54,600
boat rowboat comforting small

80
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
movements

81
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
for

82
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
for

83
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,160
if you find yourself thinking

84
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,920
trusting that it's something there's something deeper here for you to rest

85
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:30,320
in if the thinking mind can become quieter so

86
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:38,199
softer more relaxed letting go of thoughts and

87
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:44,800
letting go into the body's experience of

88
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
breathing

89
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

90
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:42,880
and then to imagine a very peaceful Clear

91
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,240
Lake the water is so clear you can see down to the bottom clearly see the

92
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,399
bottom of the lake it's peaceful

93
00:15:56,399 --> 00:16:00,600
clear clean

94
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:12,800
a beautiful Stillness in the water and you have a round Flat

95
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,199
Rock of some very light

96
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:25,839
material and you take the Rock and you release it into the

97
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,240
water and as you watch it settle to the bottom of the

98
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:39,959
lake let your thinking become quiet quieter as everything

99
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:49,360
settles let your awareness settle let you settle into the bottom of

100
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:54,480
your inner Lake to come to a rest in the deepest

101
00:16:54,480 --> 00:17:00,440
place within and for from

102
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,560
there become attuned to the body

103
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:24,630
breathing and from the deepest place you [Music]

104
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:32,360
know gently say no thank

105
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,840
you to any thoughts that

106
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:42,000
arise especially any

107
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:54,720
thoughts that have any criticism

108
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:00,400
or judgment negative judgments about yourself

109
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:10,880
you don't need to think these right now let go let

110
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,279
go relax into the depths of your

111
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
being

112
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:41,159
here there can be a place within when we're relaxed and

113
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:46,640
settled where there's no need for any thoughts that there's

114
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:52,919
something wrong with us those are

115
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:59,799
extra without those thoughts

116
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:03,880
we can experience ourselves as being

117
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:10,360
whole no part pushed out no part

118
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:26,519
judged as thinking gets quiet it can heal the inner divisions we

119
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
have

120
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,158
and everything we are could be included in the

121
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
whole

122
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

123
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,120
for

124
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
for

125
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
for

126
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
e

127
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

128
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:29,760
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

129
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,960
to imagine that you're sitting within a

130
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:45,720
large sphere of goodness of

131
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:53,000
warmth of safety and that all of who you

132
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:59,880
are makes up that sphere

133
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:06,158
you have nothing to prove nothing to

134
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:13,760
assert you're allowed to be yourself in whatever way you

135
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,159
are but not choosing any particular

136
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:24,559
aspect letting it all exist within a larger

137
00:24:24,559 --> 00:24:30,480
hole parts of yourself yourself that you know and you don't

138
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:44,440
know and from whatever place inside that's calm or

139
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:49,440
relaxed even if it's just ever so slightly

140
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:56,519
so imagine you're gazing upon other

141
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:05,000
people looking upon them from a place of safety and maybe

142
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:14,320
contentment and from there maybe there's Goodwill

143
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:18,809
warmth [Music]

144
00:25:20,919 --> 00:25:29,279
care and see if you can from that place have desires for their will well

145
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,559
beinging a

146
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,559

147

00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:53,120
safe may the people of my

149
00:25:54,399 --> 00:25:59,679
life be healthy

150
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:06,120
May the people of my life be

151
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:17,679
peaceful may they be free a freedom where there can be their

152
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:25,240
wholeness where they can settle and be contented and happy as they are in their

153
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:32,440
wholeness the wholeness which does not act

154
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:39,278
from The Limited perspectives of anger ill will or

155
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:47,159
greed may all beings be happy may all

156

beings be safe may all beings be

157
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,600
peaceful may all beings be free

158
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:09,200
and may the way that we look upon

159
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:20,120
people help them see themselves as whole

160
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,000
respected and loved people in this

161
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520

170
00:29:15,159 --> 00:29:23,600
a in beginning of this winter season focusing on the topic of

171
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:29,240
attitude there was a time when I taught the introduction to mindfulness

172
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:34,880
meditation which normally is a 5we program there was a a period of time few

173
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:42,080
years where I did six weeks where one of the weeks was um the fifth week became a

174
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:48,279
focus on uh mindfulness of attitude and attitude is very important

175
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:57,960
because it's the uh it's the background or the manner or the lens

176
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:05,120
by which we see the world understand the world behave in the world and um and it's often invisible

177
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,080
because it's kind of like um if you're looking you're focusing on what you're

178
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:19,200
seeing it's you might not be paying any attention to the fact that you're straining or that you're afraid and

179
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:27,279
you're you're looking for the dangers or the safety or that you are thinking that you

180
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:32,679
you know in order to be have a good time and be safe or be comfortable in

181
00:30:32,679 --> 00:30:38,799
yourself you have there has to be pleasure and so looking for where is it Pleasant where is the nice things to do

182
00:30:38,799 --> 00:30:43,880
and so there's an attitude behind or a belief behind how we

183
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:51,440
see how we talk how we live and those attitudes can be quite deep and

184
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:57,039
subconscious and that we don't are not often conscious of them one that I had

185
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:04,159
uh in when I I started my meditation practice in the monasteries at some point I realized

186
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:09,320
that no matter what I was experiencing the belief the attitude I

187
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:16,120
have towards all of it was it it's not the real thing um so in any any meditation

188
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,919
experience any way I was like if I was calm it wasn't the real calm if I was

189
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:28,039
present it wasn't the real way of being present if I um if I was breathing it wasn't their true way that you're

190
00:31:28,039 --> 00:31:34,519
supposed to breathe when you meditate and I didn't know that I had this belief it was very very quiet in the back of

191
00:31:34,519 --> 00:31:40,720
the mind but it it it uh it brought a kind of a discontent and a

192
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:48,799
dissatisfaction and kind of little bit feeling of an adequacy or that I carried with me and everything I was doing and

193
00:31:48,799 --> 00:31:54,480
uh I was so grateful to see it because once I saw it I saw well this is a little bit

194
00:31:54,480 --> 00:32:00,960
ridiculous and then um I tried tried for a while just to switch the belief to um

195
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:06,360
if it's happening to me it's the real thing and um and that kind of loosened

196
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:13,200
things up and broke up the the um the strength of this uh this this attitude

197
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,000
that I carried with me for so long and so uh to become aware of

198
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:25,919
attitude and as we do this week I would like to um say that um

199
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:32,360
um um um there are kind of like two categories of attitudes that we have

200
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:38,720
depending on the source within which it comes from one is an attitude that is from

201
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:45,279
reactivity and maybe from a certain kind of conceit and the other arises out of it

202
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:52,919
is maybe a kind of activity but arises out of a non-activity arises out of a deep

203
00:32:52,919 --> 00:32:58,519
ability to not always be busy not be racing around not do doing not feel like

204
00:32:58,519 --> 00:33:04,639
we have to accomplish something or fix something or understand something but let

205
00:33:04,639 --> 00:33:10,360
something a deep rest happen so uh for today I'd like to

206
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:15,919
suggest that some one attitude that can be pervasive in some people's lives is

207
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:24,080
um desire uh that there's always wanting something and uh and so sometimes there

208
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:30,200
are some people who um Can want without even having something in mind of what

209
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:36,840
they want it's just the habit of wanting the desire to have something and so they're kind of uh wherever they go

210
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,720
they're looking for what is it I might want in this situation what do I want to get what do I want

211
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:49,120
to what I want to do or have or receive or and there's always this wanting like

212
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:57,639
and some of it can come from a feeling of uh lack feeling of inadequacy feeling of of um scarcity even

213
00:33:57,639 --> 00:34:03,120
and um uh I spent uh uh a period of time

214
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:08,200
in my very early 20s being very poor and not having enough

215
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,919
food and for a while after that period um I became uh kind of a little bit

216
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:20,599
neurotic eater I just like just always looking for food and wanting food and eating a lot to make up for it and this

217
00:34:20,599 --> 00:34:25,960
wanting was just so powerful until um until I really started uh meditating and

218
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:36,000
settle something deep deep inside of me and um and so uh and so that wanting that

219
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:43,520
desire sometimes that greed um uh is expressed in how we use our eyes where

220
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:49,398
the eyes are searching and scanning and maybe a little bit coming out of their sockets kind of like the are straining

221
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:54,720
to kind of figure out what is it that I want or how do I get it or something and

222
00:34:54,720 --> 00:35:01,000
um I've had that uh when when I went to bookstores and when I was younger I loved to the idea of when I was poor I

223
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,320
couldn't buy books much but I wanted books and um and uh I used just look at

224
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:12,200
all these titles look at books and you know I was in in the bookstore looking for the books that I wanted to buy buy

225
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:19,000
buy buy but you know I wasn't going to buy any but you know and left bookstores with kind of headache and exhausted from

226
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:24,400
it so sometimes in the eyes sometimes in uh our posture leaning

227
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:31,160
forward or tensing up in a kind of way from the desire and um so to begin becoming

228
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:39,000
sensitive to a pervasive attitude manner a mood of desire which maybe

229
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:44,079
underlies a lot of the behavior we have a lot of ways we're thinking um if you

230
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:49,400
track your what you're thinking about through the day how much of the thoughts are motivated by desire and wanting

231
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:55,240
something wanting something different and um and as I said some of

232
00:35:55,240 --> 00:36:01,480
that can be born from a discontent from an attitude from a belief that there's not enough that there's we're afraid we

233
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,800
want to prove ourselves we want to be you know approved of by other people all

234
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:12,920
kinds of things can go behind uh that desire but they're all activities of the

235
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:19,680
mind and um kind of of the surface mind and as we meditate as we have some some

236
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:25,920
some way to quiet that surface mind and there's an absence of always doing

237
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:33,520
always going and um and then there can be uh the alternative i' like to propose to this

238
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,240
mind that's always Desiring is to uh

239
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,760
contentment to be content to content with what you have to be contented with

240
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:52,000
um your basic requisites cared for and um and uh roof over your house

241
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:58,079
you know clothes on your body um you know just you you know just uh content

242
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,839
with the basics you're safe you're cared for and um and uh but it's not a

243
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:10,040
contentment that is a belief or something you have to do or now talk yourself into it's a contentment that

244
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,440
comes from the mind being quiet enough that it's not operating from this desire

245
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:20,800
and feeling of lack which are activated States reactive States and this

246
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:26,800
quietness this contentment that is almost a non-doing or arises out of of

247
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:34,480
this deep subtleness that um you have to stay settled to feel this deep contentment or

248
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:41,880
return to it it's not something if you lose your contentment you have to do more to become content it's more like an

249
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:48,079
undoing and um and realizing that uh there is a contentment that's possible a

250
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:53,240
certain kind of contentment not necessarily content with everything but

251
00:37:53,240 --> 00:38:00,240
uh the ongoing attitude the mood that we're in that's what we're talking about this week so that they even though that

252
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:08,680
you might be discontented with something politics or something um that um the the

253
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:18,800
ongoing attitude by which you see the world understand the world understand yourself uh is seen through a a uh lens

254
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:25,960
of contentment there's a mood of contentment that's pervasive it's the background for how you think and speak

255
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:33,160
and go about the day and um and I'd like to propose that

256
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:40,960
that sense of contentment um uh arises when we're not

257
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:47,880
activated with other attitudes other beliefs other ways of thinking that

258
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:54,400
somehow are critical somehow are divisive somehow fracturing something

259
00:38:54,400 --> 00:39:00,520
that takes away our overall sense of hope wholeness when we're operating from the

260
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:06,319
those the thoughts the belief that something's wrong with us the acting

261
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:11,359
from a place that we're a problem and there's problems with us we all have

262
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:17,520
so-called problems we all have things ways in which we you know are not

263
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:23,000
perfect but to be operating with that as an attitude it's just pervasive carrying

264
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,280
with us retelling ourselves the same story the same idea so we walk travel

265
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:36,400
around with that attitude all the time is completely unnecessary and to find some way to

266
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:43,680
settle that to step away from it to uh enough so that we don't believe it

267
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,720
enough so that a different attitude is the one that is supporting us that's uh

268
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:56,040
feeding us that's um um benefiting us and we're not walking around with an

269
00:39:56,040 --> 00:40:04,079
attitude that's undermining ourselves so even if some of the things you about you are true that maybe you

270
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:11,880
have some kind of Quirk that's difficult um do not make not use that as

271
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,920
as the basis for a pervasive attitude that you carry with you all the time

272
00:40:16,920 --> 00:40:24,359
that's unnecessary there's ways of being honest and clear and practical about the quirks

273
00:40:24,359 --> 00:40:29,839
we have without it becoming a pervasive view that something wrong

274
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:36,599
with me something I have that I'm a problem for the world or something like that and

275
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:42,839
so contentment so today I'd like to suggest that if you're interested that uh you

276
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:48,800
kind of ride through the day with an investigation and looking at these two

277
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:54,920
how does desire work for you how pervasive is it how much are you caught in the world of Desire you're wanting

278
00:40:54,920 --> 00:41:00,480
things and uh is there kind of not just a doing of contentment which is not so

279
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:06,599
interesting but rather a settling into contentment a kind of uh opening up and

280
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:14,520
relaxing into a place where more where there's a sense of wholeness of who we are rather than a sense of divisiveness

281
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:22,200
or fractured sense of self and in that wholeness there's less to do less to

282
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:29,319
prove and from out of that can come a contentment out of that contentment can come a very

283
00:41:29,319 --> 00:41:35,079
different way to operate in the world and speak and do things and you know be

284
00:41:35,079 --> 00:41:42,680
a full fully engaged citizen but uh but from an attitude that's

285
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:48,800
beneficial so um so to spend some time

286
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,200
uh appreciating uh what might be the pervasive attitudes that you carry with

287
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:59,920
you and consider whether attitudes the attitude that you're carrying does it

288
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,480
need to be uh 247 does it need to be always operating and always the view

289
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:13,040
through which you see things and if it's a reactive attitude or or undermining

290
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:19,319
attitude um is there an alternative and for today it's I suggest you look at

291
00:42:19,319 --> 00:42:25,160
desires and contentment and um is there a way to be

292
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:30,720
content and still take care of what you need take care of what needs to happen

293
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:37,480
but from that contentment rather than from an attitude of Desire or even

294
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:43,720
greed so thank you so um May

295
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:49,920
uh this support your deep well-being to see the difference between

296
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:57,480
these two kinds of attitudes
