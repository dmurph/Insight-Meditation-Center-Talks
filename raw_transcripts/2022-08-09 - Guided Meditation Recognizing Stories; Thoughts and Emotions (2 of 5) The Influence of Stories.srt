1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:06,199
so hello everyone and welcome

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,119
so

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,080
humans spend a lot of time thinking and to get

4
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:35,040
lost in thought absorbed and thought preoccupied with thoughts does not help the process of meditation

5
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,000
of waking up really being present here

6
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:47,360
and so becoming wise about our thinking world our thinking life

7
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:53,039
is really essential for becoming a proficient meditator or

8
00:00:53,039 --> 00:01:01,760
if not proficient uh someone who delights in meditation

9
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:08,080
and and so one thing that can help very much

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:15,040
is to be able to recognize when you're thinking

11
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,080
is thinking stories when you're telling yourself stories

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,920
about something or if you're a visual kind of person you have a whole scene in front of you

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,560
that's playing itself out with characters and conversations

14
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:39,600
that uh telling us a story it's a narrative about something

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,799
something happened some fantasy and if you could recognize

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,799
the narrative thinking the story making mind when it's happening

17
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:58,799
and simply let go of that letting go of your thing all your

18
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:04,240
thinking might be too high a bar to quiet the thinking mind entirely

19
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,080
but you simply and maybe lovingly kindly

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:17,200
don't let yourself continue telling you a story and one way to do that

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,720
is to recognize clearly this is a story

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:30,480
this is me telling a story this is a narrative of fantasy of memory of planning

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,080
anticipation whatever it might be it's a story

24
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,160
and um and stories are are narratives that take time

25
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:49,519
or involve a certain kind of time and a signing of meaning to events that are happening

26
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:55,360
so simply recognize story as a way of

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,440
not necessarily stopping telling the story but no longer

28
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:08,239
placing yourself telling the story no longer committed to the story

29
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:14,640
well that's a story and then return to the breathing

30
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,760
return to the present moment enter the world of the present

31
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,959
over and over again stories take you away from that so learn to so to become proficient in

32
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:32,400
meditation learn to recognize stories in the mind

33
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,360
when they begin when they're happening and for today make it a particular theme of the

34
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,799
meditation not with stress or strain but

35
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:52,879
see if you can have a heightened sensitivity to when you start thinking stories

36
00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:00,480
and then recognize that oh that story that story some of you might have to

37
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,200
recognize it every 20 seconds some of you there might be more gaps between the next story when it arises

38
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,879
doesn't really matter what matters for this exercise is that you recognize it

39
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,040
in fact maybe if it happens regularly then um you might actually get better more benefit from this rather than being

40
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,120
discouraged maybe you can be incurs oh yeah story story and then come back to the

41
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,560
breathing and maybe in doing this maybe that

42
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,680
supports the mind for the mind to quiet

43
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:41,280
become quieter and stiller so

44
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:47,360
taking a meditation assuming a meditation posture

45
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,639
and gently lowering your gaze

46
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,120
and gently closing your eyes

47
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:11,840
and in a gentle way not too ambitious take a little deeper breaths than usual

48
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:18,240
so that you're entering into the experience of breathing

49
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,440
you're participating

50
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:29,840
and let yourself ride the exhale breathe in deeply

51
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:36,360
and ride the exhale ride the letting go

52
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:51,240
and then letting your breathing return to normal

53
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:01,360
and participate some more with your breathing by feeling your inhale

54
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:08,560
and as you exhale relax different parts of your body

55
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:18,280
as you exhale settle in here

56
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:15,639
and then letting your breathing become the center of your attention

57
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,758
letting your awareness be the companion of your breathing

58
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:38,240
gently accompanying

59
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:47,720
breathing in accompanying yourself breathing out

60
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,440
accompanying yourself

61
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,159
when you accompany your breathing

62
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:52,160
and if you find yourself involved in a story

63
00:08:52,959 --> 00:09:01,080
take the time to recognize oh that's a story that's storytelling

64
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,320
and then begin again with your breathing

65
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:23,639
maybe as you exhale relaxing the thinking muscle

66
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:38,040
okay

67
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:13,959
so

68
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,720
so

69
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,959
so

70
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,880
are you thinking and is your thinking

71
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,600
involved with storytelling

72
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:10,280
so

73
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:40,640
instead of telling stories accompany your breathing

74
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,440
as if you're accompanying a good friend on a walk

75
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:55,039
who needs you just to be a silent companion present

76
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,320
but not talking about things

77
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,760
so

78
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:18,320
there is the mind that's involved in stories in their minds and there's the mind that

79
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:26,120
doesn't two different ways the mind operates

80
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:39,559
for meditation stories are not needed

81
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:49,278
stories are not needed to be with what is

82
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,080
as it is

83
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:48,840
so

84
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:05,679
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

85
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:15,278
now you can use your storytelling mind

86
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,000
to tell yourself a simple story

87
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:27,600
of yourself starting your day or continuing your day

88
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:35,760
and the people you might have some connection with

89
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:42,720
because you pass them on the street or people with who live with you

90
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,000
that work people you'll communicate with over

91
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,600
email or some other way

92
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:59,480
people that you read about in the news

93
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:05,600
there's a story here of you and them and

94
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,679
how would you like to relate to them

95
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:19,440
perhaps coming out of meditation it's a wonderful time to consider

96
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:27,799
what it's like to relate to others with friendship with friendliness

97
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:36,080
to think and consider how wonderful it is to

98
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,919
bring friendliness into the world

99
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:48,399
and part of this story is that for you to

100
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,520
wish that unto the world

101
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:58,799
to wish greater friendliness for everyone

102
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,360
may the way that you walk through the world today

103
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,480
may it to known in unknown ways spread

104
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,600
friendliness and safety

105
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,960
may it spread a sense of peace and acceptance

106
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,240
may how we walk through the world be one walking with care

107
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,880
kindness

108
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:51,200
with wisdom may it be that this practice we do

109
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:58,399
is for the welfare and happiness of everyone may all beings be happy

110
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:03,000
may all beings be free

111
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:13,490
[Music]

112
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,320
um

113
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:29,120
so continuing this week's topic of the relationship between emotions and

114
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:35,600
thinking thinking and emotions and

115
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:41,440
one of the ways that sometimes we live is we tell the story of our day to a friend

116
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:46,880
that we might see and imagine that the friend sees you and

117
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,880
says tell me how was it at work today

118
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:58,480
and maybe you know maybe not for you but just imaginary ideas someone said someone says tell me how it

119
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:05,600
was at work today but tell me about the challenges you had with your boss

120
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,880
and oh that boss of mine oh that boss is always so demanding and so angry and i

121
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:16,159
can never do enough i can never do it right and there's so much disrespectful and

122
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:22,159
and and i have some ideas and that the boss takes the ideas and makes it

123
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:29,679
their own and not you know and i don't get any credit and and um i'm delegated to the back room

124
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:36,960
and so as we tell this story there's more anger there's more depression or just despair like oh this

125
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:43,679
is terrible but then imagine that the friend said

126
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:50,640
tell me about your day at work what did you learn about patience today

127
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:55,919
how do you learn to be how did your ability be patient improved today

128
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:02,000
and then you might say oh well i have a difficult boss but

129
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:09,760
so many times during the day when the boss was demanding or did something i was able to um breathe deeply and just

130
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:16,158
relax not buy into my tension and my anger and i was able to stay calm with it all

131
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:22,878
and i was able to manage the situation so much wiser with a calm and i had much more patience and then

132
00:34:22,879 --> 00:34:30,158
when i was working with a colleague who was really slow in doing the tasks

133
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:36,398
that i needed the colleague to do i found myself more patient and that was really good because later i

134
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:41,520
found out that my colleague was dealing with a d big really big personal issue

135
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:49,358
someone in their family had died recently and i was so glad i was able to be patient

136
00:34:49,359 --> 00:34:55,839
so that's a different story and and the emotions of telling that story uh would probably be very different than

137
00:34:55,839 --> 00:35:01,200
the first one if the person said to you for your day

138
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:09,359
to how was your day and um can you tell me uh i'd love to hear a little bit about uh what uh what

139
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:17,280
brought you joy today and delight oh yes it was so nice that

140
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:23,839
you know to watch some of my colleagues uh work together and collaborate and they were

141
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:30,640
so creative and so supportive each other and so kind and we don't do that much of my job and but to watch it across the

142
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:36,480
room and and see how respectful they were of each other that

143
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:43,280
was like a highlight of my day and i if i got a reminder it's possible to be this way with each other

144
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:49,119
so what i'm trying to convey here is that we can tell the same story more or less

145
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:55,040
with different themes different purposes different things that we emphasize

146
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:00,160
and depending what we emphasize will have a different emotional response to it

147
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,520
the tone of voice the body language everything the feelings inside the emotions that come

148
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:10,640
depending on what we emphasize and what happens to many of us human

149
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:17,920
beings is that we're telling stories a lot and but we don't we're not so conscious

150
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:23,680
of the choice we've made for what we're emphasizing in the story

151
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:30,079
some people are emphasizing how everything is wrong and a lot of their stories have to do with complaining

152
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:33,760
some people are emphasizing how

153
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:42,079
how everything impacted me and you know i'm the victim to everything and it's so hard

154
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:48,079
uh some people are telling the story from the point of view of of um

155
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:55,440
a lack there's not enough here there's i mean it's so it's an infinite number of ways of stories of a day a situation can

156
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,880
be told and if we tell the same story over and over again or the same

157
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:07,760
always the same focal point that we're emphasizing in each story then we're going to reinforce

158
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:13,920
the inner emotional life the inner disposition that we have

159
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:20,960
and we might not be aware of how much conditioning influence

160
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:26,480
the stories have on who we are and how we are

161
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:32,400
and these are stories we say out loud to our friends and people and uh

162
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,480
stories we tell ourselves and often especially when we tell them ourselves but often

163
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:43,680
we're kind of living the story or the stories are an expression of

164
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:49,119
of of our emotional life and what we think is important or

165
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,560
how we're feeling anytime so if we're angry if there's aversion

166
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,599
then a lot of the stories can be aversive stories what's wrong what's wrong what's wrong

167
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:06,240
if we're hurt if we have a deep sadness or hurt it might still be angry because we're kind

168
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:12,160
of recoiling from the hurt and we want someone to blame and so we're looking the story is a lot of blame

169
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:20,880
on the victim stories and someone someone has been the perpetuator you know as it has done bad to me

170
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:27,119
and so some of these stories have aspects of truth to them

171
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:34,160
and that makes it more complicated because then we think that well it's true and so then it's i'm justified in

172
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:42,560
telling the story the way it is but truth is varied it you know truth is thematic

173
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:47,760
how we tell one story depends on the angle we take on it

174
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:53,119
so if we tell the story from the point of view of what did i learn today

175
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:58,960
versus how was i hurt today will tell the story differently they're both kind of true

176
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,880
but which is better for you which has a better influence on you

177
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:10,160
if you tell the story of how you were kind today

178
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:15,200
that's a different story than if you go home and tell a story oh i was mean

179
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:23,280
today and i'm always mean and i can never not be mean and this is hopeless for me

180
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:30,400
but if you tell the story how it was kind today then maybe you'll notice oh yeah there was a moment today where i opened the

181
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:35,680
door for someone i guess i'm not always mean

182
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:40,720
so to tell to be sensitive that we're biased

183
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:46,480
we tell our stories in biased ways and select we select how to tell our stories

184
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:53,359
and when we re illuminate we tell the same story over and over again or use the same bias to tell the story the same

185
00:39:53,359 --> 00:40:00,640
angle to tell it it can reinforce our inner life and reinforce our dispositions our emotional life and how

186
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:06,480
we feel what we do it's hard to change the ocean liner make

187
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:13,440
it go a different way but it is possible to start recognizing what is actually happening

188
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,920
and one of the ways to begin that is to start becoming

189
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:26,000
skilled at recognizing oh that's the story that's telling a story

190
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:33,280
there's a story you can do that in meditation but you can do that in daily life as you're going about you can do stories in

191
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:40,000
your you know see notice your thinking and story making notice how much it's happening

192
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,599
once you notice how much it's happening then spend some time

193
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:50,720
investigating your stories some of you might actually write them down in a journal tell the story in a

194
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:57,440
journal and then see it on paper and then look at what is the angle that i'm using

195
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,839
to tell the story what is it what what kind of self am i

196
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:10,560
in this story am i a self that has agency or am i a self who is a victim

197
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,920
am i a self that uh has rights and needs to demand for my my

198
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:23,280
rights or myself who has uh can you know has a sense of confidence

199
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:30,560
oh man i'm just making things up in it i don't want to imply anything here but uh but you know look and see the themes

200
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:36,480
the what what how your stories tend to go and consider not to make a pollyanna

201
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:41,920
story but consider are there realistic alternative perspectives to look at the

202
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:48,640
same thing perspectives it doesn't deny there's been difficulty but perspectives that you become a

203
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:53,920
better person support you helps you become more free more kind

204
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:00,640
it helps you become wiser helps you engage in this situation in a way that's better for everyone

205
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,319
and so one perspective that i i like for stories if you're trying to problem-solve and figure out what's

206
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:12,160
happening or something is ask the question um

207
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:19,440
what is best here for everyone involved as opposed to what's best for me

208
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:27,200
what's best for that person what's best for everyone involved and um and then maybe that story

209
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:34,640
it will help living a life that supports everyone self included

210
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:41,440
so so stories they're very important part of human

211
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,920
life sometimes i think that we shouldn't be called homo sapiens we should be called

212
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,760
homo historians because probably

213
00:42:53,760 --> 00:43:00,560
stories are such a powerful characteristic of human life maybe animals tell stories but the creativity

214
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:07,680
and the ways we can do it disassociated from reality um and the impact stories have on our

215
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:13,200
inspiration our faith our confidence our lack of all these things and and

216
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,960
our sense of purpose and meaning is huge it's huge these things

217
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:26,119
and um and so to become wise about stories

218
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:31,200
and in meditation to the degree to which you become really

219
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,800
quiet and still with thinking very still and quiet

220
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:44,880
one of the values of that is to help us see with greater clarity

221
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,880
the stories that we live by and when we see them

222
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:57,839
let us become wise about that part of our life so that we are not

223
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:04,000
unduly our emotional and inner life is not unduly and unhelpfully influenced by

224
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,520
the stories we tell so um

225
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:16,480
thank you and um i hope that today is an interesting day

226
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:22,160
and looking at your stories and and

227
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:27,280
if you have someone to have a conversation with stranger or friend or someone

228
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:32,880
you might have a conversation about what the role stories have have for you

229
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:40,880
stories have in your life kind of become wiser about this whole topic of the storytelling mind

230
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,119
thank you
