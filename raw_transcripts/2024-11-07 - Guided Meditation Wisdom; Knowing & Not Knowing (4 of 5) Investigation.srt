1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:07,000
so go ahead and um get started good day to all of you it's so good to be sharing the

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:13,519
Dharma with you again especially this week it's been such a

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,880
um a week of challenges for so many of

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,920
us so I'm going to continue with the theme of knowing and not

5
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:30,599
knowing um and uh specifically the topic will be investigation

6
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:37,160
and investigation is sometimes referred to as the tool of

7
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:43,680
wisdom so you might consider if um we're walking on a scary ledge high up on a

8
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,320
mountain you know one of the instructions I was given is we don't look down you know so instead of

9
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,879
thinking how far down it is if I fall I can shift my attention to where

10
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:05,080
we place her next step and that's a choice we actually make out of wisdom right um you know we

11
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:10,400
investigate what's in a moment we make that choice in a

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,320
moment we understand our situation we don't look down we look this

13
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,640
way and um one way of describing wisdom is the clarity of mind that allows us to

14
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,400
understand the situation and allows us to see which decisions we make are helpful and which

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,159
are unhelpful in relation to the practice it

16
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:43,079
means making the choices are helpful for a well-being and happiness in relation to ledge it's the

17
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:51,280
choices that let us survive um um investigation lets us see what

18
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:59,200
choices lead to Freedom towards Freedom so the wisdom of practice

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,479
develops seeing her experience intimately from seeing the details of

20
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:10,759
our experience noticing the distinctions between

21
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:17,239
things for instance we notice a difference between being tense and relaxed and we can make the helpful

22
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:23,560
choice to relax or maybe we notice between thinking about the breath and feeling

23
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:30,920
the sensations of breathing and we make the helpful choice to feel the breath

24
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:36,319
and for many of us processing the events of in the US of the last two days we

25
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,560
have the choice to do so with wise reflection or with

26
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:48,680
Obsession wise reflection feels intimate unreal it feels

27
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:55,080
connected and we might feel our suffering we might feel our sadness but if there's suffering there we can bring

28
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:03,239
compassion to it if we're thinking about it obsessive OB l or about anything obsessively we

29
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,280
tend to feel contracted and disconnected we feel

30
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,440
disheartened if we're cut up in aversion or ill will we can make a choice to let

31
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:23,239
go of the story perpetuating the aversion we can turn the attention to

32
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:30,519
the felt sense of the body how this aversion or anger feeling the body

33
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,159
turning to the body sensation stops feeding the aversion and allows it to

34
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:43,920
dissipate in its own time in meditation practice we have to

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,920
see our experience closely to even see where there are choices to be made

36
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,480
sometimes we make the choices very quickly almost unconsciously but that's okay that's

37
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,200
that's a skill you know when you're playing the piano you know whether you're hit the note a little bit harder

38
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,439
a little bit softer let just practice but we're still making those

39
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,280
choices since you practice this morning you might give a little extra attention

40
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,280
to the details of your experience staying really really close to

41
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,799
it so let's

42
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:33,360
sit so taking a comfortable an alert

43
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:41,720
posture and gently closing your eyes taking a little time to settle into

44
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:48,039
your meditation posture making any small adjustments

45
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:55,320
that are helpful connecting with the body the

46
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:02,720
body that's always present always here supporting

47
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,600
us and setting aside any thoughts and concerns you may have about your life or

48
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:16,240
the world you can put them to rest right

49
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,960
now being with our bodies

50
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,960
and from within the body becoming aware of our

51
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,240
breathing however we experience

52
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,599
it noticing the movements the sensations of

53
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,680
breathing maybe the chest and ribs are expanding and

54
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,560
Contracting the belly rising and

55
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,479
falling the air moving in and out of the nose and

56
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:20,639
throat being at ease with whatever we notice however we feel these movements

57
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,440
taking a few long slow deep breaths with each inhale feeling the

58
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:57,720
body expanding filling the body with energy and with each

59
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:03,919
exhale allowing the body body to relax a little bit more deeply into our chairs

60
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:12,520
or cushions to soften to open

61
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:45,800
allowing the breath to return to its natural Rhythm noticing however the sensations

62
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:53,960
of breathing are easiest to feel in allowing the attention to rest

63
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:59,879
there this can be your home base your anchor

64
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:08,280
staying close to the breath noticing the changing

65
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,478
sensations of breathing in and breathing

66
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,479
out e

67
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:30,279
if any other bodily Sensations become compelling

68
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:36,560
you might gently shift your attention to them to feel the details of those

69
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,839
Sensations to see them closely you might

70
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:48,680
notice Sensations like tingling vibration

71
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:56,839
pressure movement warmth it might be pleasant or

72
00:09:56,839 --> 00:10:02,920
unpleasant just notice them however they

73
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,279
are and when they're no longer compelling returning to the moment to

74
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:17,560
the breath to those Sensations

75
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,120
or if any emotion becomes compelling again you can shift your

76
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:02,360
attention to it bringing the attention to the physical sensations of the

77
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:08,040
emotion and letting go of any story or ideas about

78
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,639
it is staying with the bodily

79
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:25,360
Sensations and when it's no longer compelling just returning to the rhythm

80
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,240
of breathing in and breathing out

81
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240

e e

97
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:08,159
if the attention has drifted and notice

98
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:17,080
it and gently bring it back to the present to the moment to moment

99
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:31,799
Sensations just keep returning to the rhythm of breathing in in and breathing

100
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:39,240
out or the details of any other experience that shows

101
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
up

102
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520

110
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

111
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

112
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

113
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

114
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:31,159
e e

115
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:21,799
when the sitting I'll ring the bell in a

116
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:26,960
moment when I do you might take a couple of slow deep

117
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:32,080
breaths again for opening your eyes

118
00:28:40,720 --> 00:29:04,970
[Music]

119
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:43,799
so I'll continue with the um theme of knowing and not

120
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:48,880
knowing um by exploring the factor of

121
00:29:50,679 --> 00:29:56,840
Investigation so when I was um about six years old I

122
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:03,480
was very very near cited but didn't have access to corrective glasses I lived in

123
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:10,720
a city which was like totally flat and hadn't seen much nature there wasn't um

124
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:17,679
there wasn't even a tree on our street so excuse

125
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:27,519
me so when my family took a train ride across the mountains I looked at the

126
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:33,640
beautiful Countryside and there were these gorgeous green Rolling Hills uh

127
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,080
and but I wasn't able to see the detail so I assumed they were smooth like in a

128
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:45,559
picture book I enjoyed imagining what it would feel like to roll down those smooth

129
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:51,640
mountains and it wasn't until I was 12 and um finally having glasses that I

130
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:57,600
went on my first camping trip and to my great surprise I found out that nature

131
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:05,840
was so smooth there were rocks and twigs and thorns and uneven ground there was just

132
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:11,960
no place to roll down the hill and I now saw all the

133
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,760
details and so investigation is a little bit like putting our glasses on and

134
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:21,840
seeing clearly the details of our

135
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:28,720
experience when investigation strengthens as we see the distin itions

136
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:34,760
of our experience instead of seeing a painful knee for instance we might notice all

137
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:41,639
the very Sensations that come and go and change in our perception of

138
00:31:41,639 --> 00:31:47,600
pain we might feel the pressure we might feel a tingling we might feel a little

139
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:53,159
pain some a little sharpness uh a little piercing feeling

140
00:31:53,159 --> 00:32:00,559
all these different things that just kind of come and go they're not just uh one One Big Blob of

141
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:07,000
pain um this isn't meant to be an act of probing a doing but just an intimate

142
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:12,360
noticing of what's there engaged engaged with the

143
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,799
experience not dwelling and thoughts about the pain but the details all the

144
00:32:17,799 --> 00:32:21,799
pinching the shifting areas of

145
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:30,320
intensity so investigation sees the details of work experiences and notices

146
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:35,799
what's different between them and that allows us to see much more

147
00:32:35,799 --> 00:32:41,120
clearly primarily in practice investigation is used to distinguish

148
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:47,320
between what's wholesome or UNH wholesome in our minds what skillful or

149
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:52,960
unskillful we might use the intellect or discursive thought to guide the mind but

150
00:32:52,960 --> 00:32:58,039
as the Mind settles more deeply investigation can become non-discursive

151
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:04,320
and non-verbal if um we find ourselves

152
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:10,000
struggling or lost or confused um sometimes framing a useful

153
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,279
question can be part of Investigation it can guide us where to

154
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:22,399
look now maybe a thought arises in the mind about something we're worried or concerned about and we keep dwelling of

155
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:27,480
the thought or related thoughts um maybe the mind gets heavy or

156
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:35,240
tight with unhappiness investigation looks at more closely and maybe we frame a question

157
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:41,000
such as what am I clinging to here what is it I'm clinging

158
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,039
to as we get closer to our experience you know sometimes we might notice we

159
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:53,600
want to fix the problem or maybe we're clinging to the idea that it shouldn't be there you know what uh we often call

160
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:59,000
arguing with reality it shouldn't be this way it shouldn't be this way and then we dwell

161
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:05,039
on it again and shouldn't be this way um so we start seeing what we're clinging

162
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:10,638
to and sometimes just by seeing the clinging we see through it and the

163
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:17,358
clinging releases and other times the clinging is so strong that uh the body has

164
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:24,679
contracted with the clinging in significant ways and so we might notice the added tensions in the body as we

165
00:34:24,679 --> 00:34:30,398
cling and allow those tensions to release elves relaxing into the clinging

166
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:38,839
relaxing the clinging relaxing into those feelings relaxing or resistance to the

167
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:41,919
way things are in the

168
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:49,760
moment and as mindfulness becomes more deeply established investigation has a

169
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,000
chance to grow and develop it can see much deeper into our experience and can

170
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:01,559
develop the discriminating wisdom system that can cut through or

171
00:35:07,079 --> 00:35:14,359
delusions so there are two aspects that are particularly relevant what we pay attention to and

172
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:22,079
how we pay attention what we pay attention to is very important we can pay attention to a

173
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:29,720
juicy fantasy um you know when we meditate it it can be very helpful to consciously

174
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:35,280
remember why we're meditating consciously remember to set aside any

175
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,880
thoughts and concerns we have about our lives or the world to pay attention to the present

176
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:49,079
moment but how we do that is just as important you know it requires that we

177
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:55,839
look at our current experience wholeheartedly and intimately without

178
00:35:55,839 --> 00:36:03,560
reservations every breath every sensation every emotion that

179
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:10,640
arises every thought that goes by do we see it clearly wholeheartedly

180
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:16,800
intimately without reservations for instance if if you were

181
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:22,160
investigating a dead body but you were repelled by it it'd be

182
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:29,319
difficult to really see it as your attention will be taken up by the repulsion

183
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:35,880
I like the term affectionate curiosity as a guide to how to pay

184
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:43,280
attention it's an attitude that comes from caring about ourselves about others about this

185
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:49,880
world it isn't a cold superficial analysis it's warm and

186
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:56,680
intimate you want to investigate without strain without forcing anything just

187
00:36:56,680 --> 00:37:02,640
allowing things to reveal themselves as we pay attention with

188
00:37:02,839 --> 00:37:08,359
care and we can see quite clearly if we if we're really looking if our attitude

189
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:13,560
is not wholesome if we're paying attention for

190
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:19,720
for uh so we get more concentrated or for some other reason than just really

191
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:26,520
seeing what's here affection of curiosity can be the

192
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:31,800
sensitivity that recognizes the difference between a tight willful

193
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,440
effort and an easeful

194
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:48,680
one now we could say that suffering is just a bunch of unh wholesome habits of

195
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:54,440
mind and habits are just that they play out in similar ways again and again kind

196
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:00,839
of like biting our nails you know we worry about the same type of stuff and we run it through over and over and over

197
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:06,680
again in our minds as we stay intimate with our direct

198
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:12,480
experience the factor of Investigation strengthens and we're able to see again

199
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,520
and again the distinction that distinction between what's helpful and

200
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:23,440
not helpful we see clearly the difference between hating or shoulder pain and

201
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:30,079
getting to know it with a kind attitude and in one way we don't actually have to

202
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:35,480
choose it becomes obvious because when it's we see clearly it just feels better

203
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:42,280
to meet it kindly It Feels Right the more clearly we see this the

204
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:47,680
more naturally we let go of the UNH Wholesome unhelpful Way of

205
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:53,920
being so even if we have pain in the body or mind can be at ease even if

206
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:59,440
there is sadness or sorrow the mind can be at

207
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:13,119
peace one of the teachings that has guided me is the idea that if we're

208
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:19,160
struggling in any way something is being left out of our

209
00:39:19,319 --> 00:39:25,880
attention when we're struggling we're clinging investigating allows us to see

210
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:32,440
the process of clinging by giving the struggle a careful

211
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:38,280
open-handed attention seeing it feeling it we see

212
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:45,319
what we might be adding to the experience what's extra an extra attention an extra

213
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:51,680
resistance an extra idea and this wholesome attention begins

214
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:57,079
to transform any experience from struggling with it to being engaged with

215
00:39:57,079 --> 00:40:03,560
it in a helpful way it can lighten our grip of

216
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:10,520
clinging and bring spaciousness so if we're feeling

217
00:40:10,520 --> 00:40:16,440
anxious investigation adds a wholesome quality to the anxiety makes it easier

218
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:23,960
to experience instead of worrying we're now investigating the

219
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:33,160
worry so can we explore our suffering without pushing it away without judging it with a warm

220
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:35,799
careful

221
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:46,839
attention in practice the purpose investigation is Awakening letting go of

222
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:52,319
clinging it's really simple we pay attention to the service

223
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:59,240
of freedom to free your minds from suffering from discontent

224
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:06,800
and as we see deeply into into our experience to know ourselves not

225
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:12,520
intellectually but in every fiber of our being to know the truth that clinging

226
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:19,160
always causes suffering and then letting go of it leads to

227
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:25,319
Freedom you this factors of play at all levels of practice from when we first

228
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:32,079
sit down with a wild Restless mind mind investigation helps a steady

229
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:38,680
attention we use it in establishing a helpful attitude recognizing whether it's a wholesome

230
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:45,280
attitude or not we use it in noticing the many habits of mind and weeding out the

231
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:50,839
unhelpful ones but when the Awakening factor of

232
00:41:50,839 --> 00:41:56,240
Investigation is well established practice can lead us to much

233
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,440
deeper understanding in a deeper wisdom where we can see beyond our

234
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:08,240
personal histories and see the reality that everything is changing all the

235
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:14,280
time and none of our changing experience will ever bring us lasting

236
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:19,760
happiness this is not an intellectual understanding but a deep nonverbal

237
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:26,599
insight into the nature reality we can see that everything

238
00:42:26,599 --> 00:42:31,040
arising also passes

239
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:39,400
away everything that appears disappears including every concept we

240
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:46,440
have of Who We Are Everything Changes there no

241
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:53,280
people no situations no things that can bring us lasting

242
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,200
happiness and when we see this deeply it's what allows the deepest Letting Go

243
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,480
Liberation and

244
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:10,960
freedom so I'd like to end with a quote by aan

245
00:43:11,079 --> 00:43:20,000
Sha peace within us is to be found in the same place as agitation and

246
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:26,119
suffering it's not found in a forest or on a Hilltop nor is it given by a

247
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:34,079
teacher where you experience suffering you can also find Freedom from

248
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:40,559
suffering trying to run away from suffering is actually to run towards

249
00:43:44,599 --> 00:43:51,839
it we thank you may all beings everywhere be it

250
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:57,240
is the seen and the Unseen

251
00:43:57,319 --> 00:44:05,079
those living close to us and those living far away throughout this

252
00:44:05,079 --> 00:44:11,359
world may they be happy may they be

253
00:44:11,480 --> 00:44:18,599
peaceful and may they be free thank you all
