00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,680
afternoon maybe it's some really early in the

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,000
morning

for those of you on zoom you know who i am so uh warm welcome

9
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,840
warm welcome

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,720
as a little introduction i um heard this from gil

11
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,799
some time ago and i liked this uh idea that

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,880
when we're practicing with anapanasati when we're practicing with the breath

13
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:34,320
we might think of it as in the same way that we go for a walk we might go on a

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:40,880
pilgrimage and we keep walking one step after

15
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,840
another we keep walking whether we are going

16
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,840
whether we are there's things to notice there's

17
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,520
landscape there's buildings there's other people but

18
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,398
because we're on a pilgrimage we just keep

19
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,080
walking doesn't mean that we're not noticing other things but we keep walking

20
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,319
maybe sometimes with a little bit more emphasis on noticing the way we're walking and sometimes

21
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,800
the attention shifts a little bit to the way that we are noticing whatever there is

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:32,120
to be noticed so in the same way with

23
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:39,840
anapanasati practice that is mindfulness of breathing practice we stay with the breath

24
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,760
just like we might keep walking

25
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,160
and we might notice things the landscape of our experience if you

26
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,400
will and but we keep with the breath we keep

27
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:06,800
noticing sometimes it's in the foreground sometimes it's in the background but we keep noticing the

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,800
experience of breathing

29
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:21,840
and then to take this analogy a little bit further we might say that when we're walking we

30
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:28,640
might encounter stray dogs and some of them are so cute and we stop

31
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,920
and we pet the dog maybe for weeks we completely forget that we're walking on

32
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,720
a pilgrimage maybe there are barking dogs that

33
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,599
we ignore they they don't really seem to be a problem so we

34
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,159
don't give them any attention we just keep walking

35
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,439
maybe there are some barking dogs that we meet and we open our hand we show them our hand

36
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,519
to show that we're safe that we're okay we're safe for them

37
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:10,720
they don't have to be worried about us

38
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:20,079
maybe there are some dogs that come up to us and we clearly say to them no

39
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,479
go home

40
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:35,120
so through all these different dogs that might visit we just keep walking

41
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:42,160
so that's what i'd gil offered this initially and i kind of like this idea

42
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,560
there might be different experiences that arise but maybe there's some way that we can

43
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:53,360
just stay with the sensations of breathing

44
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:03,759
okay so before our guided meditation

45
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,960
just taking alert posture

46
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,720
posture that expresses our intention to practice

47
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:26,240
as well as some warmth some care kindness

48
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,440
so some uprightness but that doesn't have some coldness or

49
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:39,840
or hardness to it

50
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:53,840
and to connect with the experience of breathing

51
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:07,840
feeling the breaths

52
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:21,840
noticing the quality of the breath

53
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:35,840
are they smooth are they rough

54
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:49,840
maybe the breaths are long maybe they're a little more short

55
00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:03,840
maybe the quality is maybe some deep breaths or maybe they feel a little more shallow

56
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:17,840
for just noticing

57
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:31,840
feeling the rhythm of the breath

58
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:59,840
an in-breath and then an out breath

59
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:40,959
and then is there a way that we can stretch our awareness

60
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:48,399
expand our awareness to include the whole physical body

61
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:59,440
this expanding stretching of the awareness helps us to

62
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:05,040
not get lost into our experience

63
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,839
or contracted around something

64
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:19,360
it might be helpful to imagine sometimes with the exhales a

65
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:27,120
little bit of blowing up the awareness just like we might blow up a balloon in a relaxed

66
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:37,839
easy manner

67
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:19,839
having the body be the arena of our attention

68
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:56,000
again nothing in particular needs to be happening we're being with

69
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:15,839
sensations of the breathing and with the body

70
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:32,959
can we offer our attention to different parts of the body

71
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:43,839
the face

72
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:48,000
the shoulders

73
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,839
the chest

74
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:11,839
the belly

75
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,399
it might be that bringing our attention to these

76
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:32,079
different areas allow a certain amount of softening

77
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:39,839
relaxing letting go of the tension

78
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:55,680
maybe not also we don't have to make it a problem if

79
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:00,160
there's still some tension some holdings

80
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:14,320
but is there a way that we can let go of some of the holding patterns in the

81
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:24,800
body maybe with the exhale there's a little

82
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:35,839
bit of release very subtle

83
00:13:55,199 --> 00:14:02,639
this relaxing calming is more associated with allowing

84
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:17,839
letting go than with any doing

85
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:48,639
we might check in and see if we're creating any new tension by

86
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:59,839
expectations we might have

87
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:21,199
we can't notice any pleasant sensations that are associated

88
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:27,839
with breathing

89
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:36,880
this can be very subtle but maybe there's a little feeling of

90
00:15:38,839 --> 00:15:41,839
smoothness

91
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:51,519
maybe there's a little feeling of letting go with the exhale

92
00:15:52,800 --> 00:16:09,839
that has some pleasure with it

93
00:16:10,639 --> 00:16:15,920
maybe there's some pleasant sensations associated with the

94
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:23,839
just being intimate with our breathing

95
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:59,279
maybe there's a feeling of contentment

96
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:06,880
a vague feeling of okay-ness

97
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:16,480
this may not be our dominant experience it may be just a corner

98
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,839
of our experience

99
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:32,559
can we tune into this aspect of our experience any sense

100
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:38,240
of okayness contentment pleasantness

101
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,840
and allow this to be a support

102
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:43,840
being settled in the body feeling the sensations of breathing

103
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:50,160
you can now turn towards the mental

104
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:01,840
experience a gentle inquiry are there any thoughts

105
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:11,840
some mental activity that takes us away from the present moment experience

106
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:25,360
and just like we did with the body and with the breath we can notice

107
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:31,039
the experience of this mental activity

108
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:35,039
rather than trying to make it go away

109
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:45,440
perhaps they have a lot of energy associated with them

110
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:53,840
or maybe not so much energy with this mental activity

111
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:11,840
are the thoughts more discursive writing novels so to speak

112
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:20,240
are they very simple descriptive just a single sentence

113
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,280
somewhere in between

114
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:35,840
just noticing the quality not so much the content

115
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,399
there might be a sense of constriction or tightness around

116
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,640
the breath i'm sorry around the breath but also around the

117
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,880
mental activity maybe there's a sense of ease

118
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:12,720
spaciousness openness can feel into that associated with the

119
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:18,880
thoughts the mental activity is there a tightening or

120
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,840
opening

121
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:44,640
maybe there's a sense of pushing or pulling not liking liking this movement of

122
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:59,840
wanting we can notice that also

123
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:15,280
maybe there's a sense of looking for something searching

124
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,520
how does that feel what is that experience

125
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,919
letting the content of the thought take care of itself

126
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,400
more being with the experience

127
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:55,840
of having these thoughts

128
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:22,320
maybe we're identified with the thoughts this is me this is

129
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,720
mine

130
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:37,200
no matter which way we are experiencing the thoughts

131
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:44,159
as we breathe in as we breathe out can we

132
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:51,840
relax soften these mental activities

133
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:07,360
letting the activities of the mind come to rest

134
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:20,000
maybe the breaths themselves are can reassure the mind in

135
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:25,840
some kind of way that the mind doesn't need to be so

136
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:33,840
active

137
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:47,840
not getting involved with the thinking but trusting the breath

138
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:52,559
not all mental activity needs to stop

139
00:25:53,200 --> 00:26:00,320
we're just allowing a calming a softening of whatever is

140
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,519
happening in the mind

141
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:25,840
we can do this by being aware of mental activity without getting involved getting tangled up in

142
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:56,240
all the while breathing in

143
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:07,840
and breathing out

144
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:40,480
staying with the sensations of breathing

145
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,759
allows the settling of the mind and the body

146
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,680
the calming

147
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,838
so that we aren't pushed around

148
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:04,319
by this mental activities or

149
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:14,240
sensations in the body so that we don't spend all our

150
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:19,280
energy reacting to

151
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:27,760
responding to trying to take care of trying to make different our experience

152
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:36,960
and instead we can be with our experience

153
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:41,119
sometimes that includes being with others

154
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:55,040
if we have a certain amount of calmness then we're more apt to really be able to deeply listen

155
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:02,960
to what others are saying to us really be present for others

156
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:10,960
as well as for ourselves in a way that perhaps

157
00:45:10,960 --> 00:45:19,599
we might be a refuge for others if we're not agitated we're not busy

158
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,560
with ourselves

159
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:33,040
so may our practice be a support for us

160
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,400
and for those around us

161
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:46,240
may all beings find ease and happiness

162
00:45:46,240 --> 00:46:01,839
may all beings know peace

163
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:57,839
good morning again

164
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,880
and for those of you on youtube who

165
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:12,640
weren't there at 6 45 this morning i'm diana clark and gil will be back tomorrow at seven

166
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:18,319
california time he's spending some time with his family this morning

167
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,760
so just say a few words about anapanasati practice mindfulness of

168
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:33,520
breathing that gill has been doing on these mornings

169
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:41,599
and as many of you know there are 16 steps and gil has been through the first half

170
00:47:41,599 --> 00:47:46,720
the first eight and there's a number of ways in which we might understand

171
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:53,200
all these steps and the organization of them

172
00:47:53,200 --> 00:48:00,800
one way is that this is a progression of getting to know one aspect of our

173
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:08,400
experience the body the mind

174
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:14,960
and then after becoming familiar with it and being with it then there's some

175
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:21,839
letting go some releasing of that aspect of experience

176
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:28,800
when the time is right doesn't have to be in a hurry we just take our time

177
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:35,838
allowing the experience perhaps to melt or soften

178
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:44,000
as best we can so we started with noticing the physical

179
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,559
aspect of our experience breathing and this breathing accompanies

180
00:48:50,559 --> 00:48:55,920
us through all the other explorations

181
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:02,319
just in the same way that when we're on a pilgrimage we just keep walking

182
00:49:02,319 --> 00:49:09,040
one step after another one breath after another

183
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:17,838
then after breathing then there's expanding to include the whole body

184
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:25,119
the bodily sensations of course breath is occurring within a body

185
00:49:25,119 --> 00:49:31,839
so to expand the awareness to include the body

186
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:40,240
and in this we also include any sense of contentment any sense of okayness any pleasure

187
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:48,240
pleasant sensations associated with this bodily experience

188
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:55,119
and allowing those to be a support

189
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:03,119
as we continue on our pilgrimage so to speak

190
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:09,359
i mean then we turn towards the mental aspect of our experience

191
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:14,480
including the physical sensations that are associated with

192
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:20,078
thinking or whatever mental activity we might be having

193
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:33,280
sometimes that's really subtle the physical aspect of the mental experience so without getting

194
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:38,640
tangled up and trying to

195
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:45,960
figure it out maybe just kind of being with the experience without being

196
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:51,440
identified or lost in the experience in some ways it's

197
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:57,920
a little bit of a pulling back from our thinking and of course

198
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:04,160
noticing how our judging our evaluation of our experience is yet one more mental

199
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:13,200
activity we might feel feel how that feels the judging the pushing the pulling

200
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:23,838
wanting not wanting this is desirable not desirable

201
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,599
so this to help support this experiencing mental activity is it can

202
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:36,880
be a stepping back of some sort so kind of a pulling back a little bit and knowing what is taking place rather

203
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:40,880
than being fully immersed into it

204
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:51,359
and mental activity deserves our attention sometimes we might have the idea that we just have to get rid of it

205
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:58,720
but it deserves our attention because when unattended it often is running our lives

206
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:05,838
without our even knowing it

207
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:14,400
so then there can be after becoming familiar with mental activity there can be a calming

208
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:21,440
as softening or relaxing of that mental activity

209
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:29,680
and notice that i'm not saying we have to eliminate eradicate exterminate something like this

210
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:36,078
the mental activity we're just allowing it to quiet

211
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:46,160
maybe i'll say a few words about what can be some supports for this

212
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:53,240
one is that the earlier steps in anapanasati the breath being with the bodily

213
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:59,680
sensations allowing some ease or relaxation of the bodily sensations

214
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:06,720
can be a tremendous support for calming the mental activity

215
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:14,400
so if we find ourselves really caught up and busy with thinking can just

216
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:20,559
incline the mind towards the physical experience including the physical experience of

217
00:53:20,559 --> 00:53:27,760
thinking so that's one way is to ground

218
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:35,760
our awareness in the present moment in the embodied presence that we have right now

219
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:48,319
and this also includes being aware of some of the pleasant sensations

220
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:54,000
we might be having there might be some ease with the breath some

221
00:53:54,000 --> 00:54:01,200
smoothness of the breath there also might be some vague diffuse

222
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:07,119
experiences of just some contentment or okayness

223
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,920
maybe we can incline the mind that direction that also can be a support for the

224
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:22,640
calming of the mental activities is to if there's some aspect of ease

225
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:28,000
to tune into that aspect of ease

226
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:39,520
and maybe we can rather than feeling like we have to get

227
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:48,240
rid of our thoughts or make them slow down or go away or whatever ideas we might have

228
00:54:49,359 --> 00:54:56,160
maybe we can have this emphasis on a gentle inquiry is this

229
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:01,680
helpful or is it unhelpful

230
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:08,079
is it helpful in promoting a sense of ease and freedom

231
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:16,319
peace and or am i learning something here is this valuable

232
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:21,440
or or is there a feeling i'm just stuck and i'm just going around and around and

233
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:27,200
around there is no sense of potential potential learning or

234
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:35,359
potential freedom or ease

235
00:55:35,359 --> 00:55:42,319
so that might be one another way to kind of work with mental activity is to shift away from it has to be

236
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:50,079
different to shift towards well is this helpful and sometimes the answer to that can

237
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:56,720
bring a different reaction response to our mental activity which might allow that mental activity to

238
00:55:56,720 --> 00:56:03,838
unfold in a way that is helpful

239
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:17,119
another thing that we might do is to just do a gentle inquiry of what's fueling this thinking

240
00:56:17,119 --> 00:56:24,400
there might be an emotion and just like at the beginning of this

241
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:30,319
um before the guided meditation i talked about when we're on a pilgrimage there

242
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:36,000
might be some parking dogs and one way to be with them is just to

243
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:44,160
like show them our open hands and show them that we're safe for them so is there a way in which

244
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:52,400
we can be safe for our emotions to be expressed to show up

245
00:56:52,720 --> 00:56:59,680
can we maybe in some way listen deeply to ourselves and

246
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:06,079
allow the emotion to arise without getting tangled up and thinking

247
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,640
that it has to be otherwise or has to be different

248
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:18,559
can we just create the space for our emotional experience

249
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:24,160
and that might also kind of soften some of the mental activity

250
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:31,040
as we soften the fuel what's supporting that mental activity

251
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:39,440
and then maybe one other thing that i will say is

252
00:57:39,440 --> 00:57:46,559
sometimes it can be skillful to replace unhelpful thoughts with other mental

253
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:50,799
activities that are more helpful

254
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:59,520
so to intentionally do something an example might be to do some

255
00:57:59,520 --> 00:58:06,480
loving-kindness practice if we feel that we're filled with rage and ill-will and thoughts of

256
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:11,920
harming hostility in a way that is not helpful or healthy or

257
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,838
we just feel like we're lost in it

258
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:24,400
so we can do some loving kindness practice in whichever way it's easiest

259
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:30,960
we're not necessarily towards the object through which we have hostility but just

260
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:36,079
incline the mind towards where it's easy with a lovable

261
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:41,760
being allowing the mind to kind of like calm down and settle with this loving

262
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:49,280
kindness so it might bring in to like replace

263
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:55,839
thoughts and comfortable thoughts with some or unhelpful thoughts with some other

264
00:58:55,839 --> 00:59:03,520
thoughts another way might be to use our imagination

265
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:09,359
sometimes we do this in guided meditations maybe you do it yourself

266
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:14,400
the wings of a bird flapping

267
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:25,520
or maybe ice skaters that they skate skate skate and then glide and feeling into the glide

268
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:35,040
or maybe the imagination of taking off this itchy scratchy sweater

269
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:40,400
and instead putting on your favorite t-shirt

270
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:48,480
so there might be some skillful ways in which we can replace some of our thinking

271
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:54,559
and can we do this while being aware of the breath all the while allowing the breath to

272
00:59:54,559 --> 01:00:01,760
accompany us that may be the last thing i'll say

273
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:08,960
is there might be also an opportunity to say for some thoughts some mental activity no

274
01:00:08,960 --> 01:00:15,440
i'll work with this later after meditation right now i'm going to be with the

275
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:18,880
sensations of breathing

276
01:00:21,280 --> 01:00:28,240
so i offer these as some tools that might be helpful as we're practicing

277
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:35,359
meditation and as tools if they're not helpful we don't use them

278
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:44,720
so with a sincere wish

279
01:00:44,799 --> 01:00:52,400
that you are being with the sensations of breathing with your practice your meditations

280
01:00:52,640 --> 01:01:01,920
maybe they be a source of support of ease and peace and freedom in your life

281
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:11,839
and in the lives of others thank you

282
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:14,720
you
