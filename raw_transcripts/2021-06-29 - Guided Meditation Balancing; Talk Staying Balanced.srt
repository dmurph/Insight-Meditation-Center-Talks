1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:07,279
good evening good morning good afternoon

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:17,039
i'm happy that we're practicing together

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,599
so we'll begin with a guided meditation

4
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:31,439
we'll start by just coming into the body

5
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:38,160
recognizing that we're here at this moment

6
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,800
and maybe in a global way

7
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:58,000
i'll just check in how is the body

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,440
maybe it's feeling a little bit tired or maybe a little bit restless

9
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,720
or a little bit achy or a little bit spacious

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,840
or maybe you're not quite sure yet

11
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:27,119
however it may be it's all welcome and invited

12
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,400
doesn't mean it matches our preferences of course but

13
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,479
we don't need to exclude or push away

14
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:47,439
our experiences but to make room for them

15
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:55,840
and allow them to be here as best we can

16
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,599
and feeling connected grounded feeling the pressure of the chair the

17
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:23,680
cushion the bench the couch whatever you're sitting on

18
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:37,840
feeling the pressure against the body

19
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:56,239
and then checking in with the posture is there a sense of evenness a sense of

20
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,879
balance sometimes it's helpful to rock back and

21
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:09,599
forth a bit a little bit of an adjustment

22
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,319
we all know how uncomfortable it can be if the

23
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,800
if we're not sitting just right

24
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:30,840
then we find ourselves squirming or just simply getting up and abandoning

25
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,959
it but to feel the uprightness

26
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:47,840
and the balance in the posture

27
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:15,840
and then to allow the attention to rest on the sensations of breathing

28
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:12,080
and feeling the inhales feeling the exhales as the chest moves

29
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:25,840
the belly moves

30
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:42,880
enter every now and then just check in with the body in a global sense

31
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,280
just noticing the posture

32
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:57,120
are we leaning forward maybe we're slumping

33
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,840
maybe our chin is up

34
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,680
without making it a big project

35
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:20,720
but just feeling into the body maybe the body as a whole

36
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:31,840
seeing if there's a sense of balance

37
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,240
if you find that your shoulders are up or maybe you're leaning forward a little

38
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:14,000
bit we don't have to make it a problem we just very

39
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,160
simply bring our posture back into alignment

40
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,840
into balance

41
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:44,240
and if we notice that repeatedly we're leaning forward or our chin

42
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:51,839
is up we might just get a little curious

43
00:09:54,160 --> 00:10:01,120
is there a mental state that's associated with this physical

44
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,240
expression this physical movement

45
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:19,839
some people sometimes when their chin is up they're doing planning

46
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,480
leaning forward it's a little bit of

47
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:36,720
striving getting slumped collapsed is

48
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,360
maybe lost in fantasy or lost in some kind of thought

49
00:10:43,360 --> 00:11:01,839
maybe a feeling of dejection or disappointment sadness

50
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,839
being sensitive to our posture

51
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,399
can be another way in which we can be aware

52
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:29,839
of our experience our inner experience

53
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,560
maybe the mental state

54
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:43,839
maybe our emotional state

55
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:57,839
we might not be aware of it until we notice the shift in our posture

56
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,840
hey

57
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:09,760
so finding the balance in our posture in our body

58
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:17,840
can help us notice when we're a little bit out of balance

59
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:25,200
in the mind maybe there's a lot of wanting this leaning forward

60
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:34,080
maybe there's some collapsing mentally as well as physically

61
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:48,080
maybe there's a lot of planning and or striving

62
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:56,159
we don't have to make it a big problem or make a big project out of it we can just very gently

63
00:27:56,159 --> 00:28:02,159
bring the body back into balance

64
00:28:02,159 --> 00:28:06,960
allowing perhaps the mind follows

65
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:15,600
perhaps the mind is already there but using the body

66
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,200
and this idea of balance as a support

67
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:24,158
for our practice

68
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,440
help us not to be out of balance

69
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:45,120
so that we can take care of ourselves and take care of others in a way that's

70
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,760
appropriate

71
00:28:51,760 --> 00:29:00,480
so in this way our practice is for the benefit of all beings

72
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:09,200
not just for ourselves for those we come in contact with and

73
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:16,799
whom they come in contact with they come in contact with etc etc

74
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:27,840
so may all beings be free from suffering

75
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:39,360
welcome welcome a really warm welcome for everybody

76
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:50,240
wherever you are whomever you are

77
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:58,159
sometimes when we listen to a dharma talk or give a dharma talk there's this tendency

78
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:03,600
to approach them with our cognitive minds i know that certainly is the case for me

79
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:08,799
sometimes been reflecting on this and for many of

80
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:15,679
us who have had a profession or just enjoy kind of like solving problems figuring

81
00:31:15,679 --> 00:31:20,720
things out to acquiring knowledge understanding it and

82
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:27,919
creating models from the data that we get or i know that my years as a research

83
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:35,919
scientist i used to love that so much love that's when the to get the data and like wow okay now

84
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:43,360
what does this mean and put together the little pieces and there's so many different ways in

85
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:49,279
which we might uh do this whether we're actually doing experiments or not

86
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,960
and so of course of course we or sometimes will bring this type of

87
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:01,360
thinking or this type of way of being into the way we approach dharma talks

88
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:06,960
either giving the dharma talks or uh listening to them

89
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:13,519
trying to might be a way like if we're listening to them we might have this idea that okay just if i just take in enough

90
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:20,240
information if i understand it if i can make all the little pieces fit together

91
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:26,000
nice neat and tidy or maybe if i can the sense of okay if i

92
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:33,360
just have to get everything straight now how does this relate to that and what precisely is the definition of

93
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:40,080
that and this energy of um trying to figure it out and this feeling

94
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,480
this may be leaning into well if only i just added all the information

95
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:53,518
then i could do this buddhist practice thing i could do this meditation thing

96
00:32:53,600 --> 00:33:00,480
of course it's easy for us to fall into that type of thinking when we have it probably in so many

97
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:06,880
other areas of our lives and in some ways and sometimes that type

98
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:12,799
of approach of figuring it out or acquiring information

99
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:19,679
is helpful with our buddhist practice is helpful with meditation

100
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:27,679
but it's not the only way and nor is it have to be the predominant

101
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:33,039
way there's so many different ways in which we might listen to a dharma talk or just approach

102
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:39,039
the dharma in general

103
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:46,000
so one way that also this cognitive uh really intellectualized approach

104
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:53,120
may also approach uh listening to dharma talks is not only trying to figure it out but

105
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,799
also there might be this little nuclean thought okay it's surely it's not really that

106
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:05,279
simple it must be more complicated so this always this thinking that there's like

107
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:14,079
there's got to be more here this idea of mindfulness just being with them our experience

108
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:20,960
surely that can't be enough pay attention to one's breath surely there's there's got to be more

109
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,320
that there that's doesn't seem snazzy enough

110
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,760
so there's this way in which we might be tempted to substitute knowledge for

111
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:42,158
practice they cannot require information or thinking they have to figure it out

112
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:53,520
but there's a way in which practice can be actually really simple really simple

113
00:34:53,520 --> 00:35:00,560
one way we might think about it is maybe can be demonstrated with this simile perhaps some of you are

114
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:07,920
familiar with this simile that's uh in the suit does so we might and the buddha tells the

115
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:14,400
story as a way to make a point that suppose there's a crowd of people

116
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,440
who are watching a performance a really beguiling

117
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:26,320
uh interesting performance and their attention is there and maybe

118
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:31,680
there's a in my mind there's like an upbeat mood

119
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:37,760
maybe there's a yeah there's just like a a um in my mind it's kind of like you

120
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:42,960
know you know sometimes we see concerts rock and roll concerts or something like this

121
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:50,960
pop concerts so there's these people that are what happily watching a performance

122
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:58,400
and then you can imagine that you have been instructed to carry a bowl of oil

123
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:05,599
on your head and to walk through the crowd towards

124
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,440
the stage without dropping the oil

125
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:19,119
from the bowl and just to make it a little more interesting there's a person behind you

126
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:28,000
with a sword that will cut off your head if one any drop of oil falls

127
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:36,960
it's a little bit outrageous even to imagine this but the buddha is pointing to this is

128
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:42,640
one way we might consider mindfulness practice that is if you're going to walk with a

129
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:47,760
bowl of oil on your head that there and there's like some hustle

130
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:54,800
and bustle going around around you and people are paying attention to the performance not to you

131
00:36:54,800 --> 00:37:01,839
that means you need to have some mindfulness you need to be aware and to be aware of your posture so that

132
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:10,079
you remain balanced but there also needs to be some flexibility and some agility and to be aware of

133
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:16,079
what's going around but around you maybe not so much that you like

134
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:21,760
returning your head to look and see everything but in a way in which maybe your

135
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:25,440
awareness is kind of broad

136
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,119
so it has to be like really embodied with a sense of agility or a sense of

137
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:38,800
flexibility and stability to walk through this crowd with a

138
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:45,520
bowl of oil on your head and then you might consider that

139
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:52,880
the sword the person with this sword and the that's gonna chop off your head it's more

140
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:57,920
pointing to the to be sustained to have this sustained

141
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,000
mindfulness so it's not to be upright with good posture and balanced

142
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,320
in a sense of agility once or twice but the entire time you're walking

143
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,480
towards this stage and i'm imagining i don't know but i'm

144
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:22,560
imagining in the buddha's time maybe um it wasn't so unusual to walk with a bowl of

145
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:28,160
or walk with anything on your head so maybe they it's not that doesn't have the same

146
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:35,119
degree of difficulty that it might for us but again pointing to this sense of

147
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:40,319
embodiment and awareness

148
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:46,400
so if this were to be a simile that points to practice we could say well

149
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:56,000
actually in some ways the practice is simple be aware and stay balanced

150
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,838
be aware and stay balanced

151
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:07,440
but we might also hear about some of this this person in the sword in the back of

152
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:14,079
us with a sword and we might consider there'd be some tension and some tightness about this

153
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:19,920
not flexibility or agility or something like this

154
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,440
so maybe to bring in another visual you know sometimes we can understand things

155
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:32,160
with a visual with similes and stories and even though buddhist buddhism

156
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:39,040
and buddhist practice certainly has a lot of lists there's also these stories and these visual things so that's a little bit

157
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:47,760
what i'd like to use today so here's a another visual

158
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:55,359
but there is a a monastic who is feeling really discouraged

159
00:39:55,359 --> 00:40:02,960
it feels like they want to leave the monastery when they disrobe

160
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,960
and this person was in before they became a monastic would

161
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:14,240
play the loot we can think of the lutus proto guitar

162
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:22,160
it's in the guitar family perhaps and so when the buddha hears that this

163
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:29,520
person sona wants to leave the monastery in disrobe he goes to sona and

164
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:37,920
says so sona you're a loot player right yes venerable sir well when the string

165
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:45,119
was too loose did it sound good no venerable sir well what about

166
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:52,400
when the string was too tight did it sound good no venerable sir so

167
00:40:52,400 --> 00:41:00,400
in the same way tune your level of effort so that it's just right

168
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:06,240
in the same way that you would tune the strings of a guitar so it has the right

169
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:12,640
sound like tune the level of effort that is

170
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:21,280
to not be too tight and striving and straining and not to be too laxadaisical

171
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,359
and one thing that's nice about the simile of the loot is if we think about the loots have more

172
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:33,920
than one string i don't know exactly how many but that's when we know with guitars that

173
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:41,359
when you tune one string then you tune other strings to that string

174
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:47,920
so that everything comes into harmony so you can pay attention particular to

175
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:55,760
one string and then everything else it becomes a little bit easier to tune all the others so to pay

176
00:41:55,760 --> 00:42:01,040
attention to the amount of energy the amount of effort

177
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:07,359
and maybe one way that is an indicator for how much effort

178
00:42:07,359 --> 00:42:15,280
one is applying is your reaction when the bell rings at the end of a meditation period

179
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:19,359
when the bell rings and there's a sense of

180
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,920
that's the sign that there's a little bit too much tightness it may be too much straining or a little bit too much

181
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:34,640
a sense of white knuckling it till the end of the period the meditation period

182
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:46,079
so we will need to tune our energy we need to have some agility but also maybe to emphasize this

183
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:52,079
sense of a little bit of movement here's a one other simile

184
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:57,680
i'm sorry this isn't a simile this is a little story

185
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:05,200
in which a deva this is a unembodied being comes to the buddha and

186
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:10,480
says dear sir how did you cross the flood

187
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:15,920
and we could use the word flood to represent all kinds of things

188
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:20,960
but without saying anything specific we know that floods are generally

189
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:29,280
undesirable that they kind of like destroy things in their path and our have a lot of power and

190
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:34,240
i mean you know the product of torrential rains or something

191
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:41,680
dear sir how did you cross the flood i crossed the flood by not halting

192
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:48,160
and not straining then the davis says but how by not

193
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:53,520
halting and by not straining did you cross the flood and the buddha

194
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,720
responds when i came to a standstill i sank

195
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:03,440
and when i struggled i got swept away

196
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:10,079
so to not do anything to sink but to put afford a lot of

197
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:16,880
effort a lot of energy struggling fighting is to get swept away

198
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:23,440
in this torrential flood to not find a way across

199
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:29,359
but to be susceptible to the energy of the flood itself

200
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:35,119
so there's these are some visuals in which we might understand practice way we can might really

201
00:44:35,119 --> 00:44:42,000
simplify practice be aware and stay balanced

202
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:51,119
i heard this from another dharma teacher be aware and stay balanced

203
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:57,280
so what does this mean stay balanced i talked about this a little bit in the guided meditation one way is with

204
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:03,200
our posture whether we're sitting or walking

205
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:08,800
or whether we're moving i guess you don't worry about your posture so much when you're lying

206
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:15,920
down in terms of being balanced but it's really worthwhile to

207
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:24,240
spend some time learning which kind of seating equipment is best

208
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,800
and to really learn is our our ears over our shoulders and sometimes

209
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:37,599
having to tuck the chin a little bit so that it opens up a little space in the back of the neck

210
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:47,839
so that the spine has a real sense of uprightness and allows the arms to just hang

211
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:55,760
but as we are sitting we might notice during meditation if we have this intention to check our

212
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:02,480
posture we might notice that sometimes there's a certain amount of leaning

213
00:46:03,280 --> 00:46:08,960
it can be leaning forward maybe maybe not so much literally but maybe

214
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,520
kind of like figuratively leaning backwards that's kind of like a push and a pull a sense of a push and a pull

215
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:23,200
that we feel in the body as well as we feel in the mind

216
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:31,200
but this leaning we can maybe if we notice that we're leaning might be an encouragement to to inquire well what

217
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:37,680
are we placing our attention on what are we aware of

218
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:46,079
because sometimes our minds fixate on what we want or what we don't want

219
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:53,359
and then this kind of um causes us to lean either literally or figuratively

220
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:59,680
this push or pull but mindfulness practice is to be aware

221
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:06,400
of this this preoccupation with what we want or with what we don't

222
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:12,000
want is of course it's a natural human impulse to be preoccupied preoccupied

223
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,400
with these things and trying to fix them but we can be aware of our mental state

224
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,319
rather than just letting them

225
00:47:24,319 --> 00:47:30,880
continue like unchecked but to beware and stay balanced is to

226
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:37,440
notice when are we a little bit out of balance so to be leaning towards something to be

227
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:44,240
wanting something to have desire for something it's not inherently problematic

228
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:50,000
we we all have the desire to eat when we're hungry we have the desire to care for

229
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,359
and protect those people we love we have a desire for the world to be a

230
00:47:55,359 --> 00:48:00,720
better place i have a desire for practice and to find

231
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:06,640
more freedom experience more freedom so desire by ourselves itself isn't

232
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:13,599
inherently problematic but this our practice is about becoming aware

233
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:21,200
and being able to distinguish between skillful and unskillful desire

234
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:29,119
the desire that leads to more and more freedom or the desire that lends to getting

235
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:35,838
tangled up and leading to less freedom

236
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:41,280
so practice isn't about getting rid of all desire even though sometimes i have heard some

237
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:46,960
buddhist teachings that made me think that perhaps it was but this recognition of what's skillful and

238
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:53,359
what's unskillful sometimes we can notice that by whether

239
00:48:53,359 --> 00:49:00,640
we feel out of balance or not and if we notice that we're a little bit of out of balance with our desire

240
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:08,000
one thing we can do is to take a careful look at the object of our desire

241
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:15,520
the actual thing or the situation and

242
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:22,640
to just do this gentle inquiry are we seeing it accurately

243
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:30,880
chances are when we have a lot of desire we're just seeing all the beautiful aspects all the attractive

244
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:37,040
aspects but everything has you know it's not

245
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:42,079
the chances are that something is a hundred percent beautiful

246
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:50,000
is not high so can we see the fullness can we see some of the unattractive aspects of whatever we're

247
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,680
desiring and can we take a

248
00:49:55,680 --> 00:50:02,640
and imagine well this really fulfill these expectations that i have

249
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:08,800
and ask in that question ask us well what are our expectations

250
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:13,839
that we have for whatever it is that we're desiring

251
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:21,200
and then that kind of brings us back to our own experience so there's the object with it is it

252
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:27,359
really as beautiful and perfect as we're imagining and what is my experience both what are

253
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:32,480
my expectations and how does it feel to be desiring

254
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:37,920
how does it feel to be like leaning this

255
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:45,119
pulling being pulled towards something and it might be really subtle

256
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:54,400
this way that we're maybe a little bit off balance in a subtle way

257
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,559
so to simplify the practice to be aware and stay balanced one way that we might be out of balance

258
00:51:00,559 --> 00:51:05,839
is because we're filled with desire and of course the flip side of that is

259
00:51:05,839 --> 00:51:11,920
aversion this mild or maybe even really strong dislike or really

260
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:17,200
sense of i don't want this and just like with desire there are healthy forms of

261
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:23,760
aversion and in some ways it might even be a kindness to turn away

262
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:31,280
from some things that are painful and there are times also when we're just

263
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:38,400
for so many different reasons not quite ready to work with some particular

264
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:45,119
difficulties or have that particular difficult conversation

265
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:52,400
so we feel like okay it's the time isn't quite right and that's perfectly natural

266
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:58,559
so not every single time that there's an aversion there's a turning way doesn't mean that it's bad

267
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:05,838
and again practice is about learning to discern when is it helpful and when isn't it helpful

268
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:13,920
but aversion also can be mixed in with a little bit of hostility

269
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:21,119
and have some ill will that of course is not helpful and it's been more a little bit out of balance

270
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:26,640
so this kind of a push maybe like a really strong pushing away

271
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:33,520
so to work with this can we just be with this aversion or ill will without

272
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:39,119
trying to fix it can we just notice oh yeah that's what's

273
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:44,240
happening right now i'm aware this is what's happening i'm aware i'm a little bit

274
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:50,000
out of balance and then sometimes when we're just

275
00:52:50,000 --> 00:53:00,079
bringing awareness some open-hearted awareness we come back into balance

276
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:07,359
also similar to desire when we're the invitation is to

277
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:13,400
look really closely at the object and to see is this really going to satisfy our

278
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:20,880
expectations maybe when there's some aversion maybe to do a little bit of an imagination

279
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:28,480
how would you feel if you acted out your aversion

280
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:35,920
your ill will maybe there'd be some regret maybe there'd be some remorse or maybe

281
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:41,359
there's a sense of oh yeah okay the wise thing to do here

282
00:53:41,359 --> 00:53:47,520
is not to get tangled up with that but to come back here to center

283
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:55,839
so to just check in and to use our imagination

284
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:03,040
about a it's the objects as well as be how we feel and just to notice also

285
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:08,640
how does it feel to have a version there's often a real sense of tightness

286
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:13,760
and constriction and a sense of

287
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:19,520
maybe collapsing or it's not it's the opposite of open and

288
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:24,800
spacious and then also we don't want to have

289
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:30,640
aversion towards a version because that just perpetuates a version so

290
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:38,400
is there a way and that we can just recognize and allow ah yes here's a version

291
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:44,160
i'm a little bit off balance here because i have some aversion

292
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:53,040
so that's one way that kind of this leaning maybe that literally or metaphorically

293
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:58,319
might be one way we're a little bit out of balance but another way it might be kind of like energetically

294
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:04,480
that is there might be this like a lot of restlessness there might be a sense of we want to

295
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:09,520
jump up and run away or maybe there's a sense of

296
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:17,920
ping-pong balls inside that are bouncing around so this agitation or maybe a real

297
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:23,920
scatteredness in the mind can't really settle anywhere

298
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:30,640
where there are also this kind of there can be a really subtle way

299
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:38,720
in which the mind is like quietly searching for something more interesting

300
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:44,079
so rather than kind of like landing on the object like the breath

301
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:49,520
instead there's this kind of like this probing this looking this looking for

302
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:55,680
what's next what's next maybe a type of foraging or something like this

303
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,280
it can be a really subtle type of

304
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:06,319
restlessness which maybe it feels i don't know if i would use the word out of balance

305
00:56:06,319 --> 00:56:11,839
because it's very subtle but it is out of balance when you compare it to

306
00:56:11,839 --> 00:56:19,040
the experience of just really being here like completely here with

307
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:24,640
our experience and so when we have this restlessness we

308
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:31,200
might again use our imagination to work within

309
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:41,119
one thing that sometimes i like to do is to imagine stepping into a cathedral

310
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:46,799
i was in rome

311
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:54,720
this is now quite some a long time ago but i remember that sense of awe

312
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:01,280
of stepping into this magnificent cathedral these really

313
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:09,280
high ceilings and the just the sense of space so it's not that the restlessness

314
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:14,559
has to go away but now that same energetic feeling but in a

315
00:57:14,559 --> 00:57:19,680
big space it's a way that kind of like is a sense

316
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:25,280
of calming can be a sense of settling like there's

317
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:29,280
room for the restlessness to be

318
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:36,319
so that's one way to work with restlessness another way it

319
00:57:36,319 --> 00:57:43,119
might be to kind of like zoom in and how does it feel in the body and to just really get

320
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:50,960
curious about the the jaggedy feeling that goes with the restlessness

321
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:58,480
and then of course energetics the opposite of restlessness is a sense of

322
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:05,680
dullness in the mind and the body a sense of maybe collapsed energy

323
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:11,680
sense of just not enough energy and maybe conflict literally or figuratively

324
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:17,520
collapsing not enough energy to sit up not enough energy to really be

325
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:25,920
with the objects but instead just kind of a foggy

326
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:34,559
detached way so this like maybe so maybe there might

327
00:58:34,559 --> 00:58:40,798
like an absence of vitality as a way to describe it

328
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:46,160
and it might show up in our mind is just kind of retreating a little bit

329
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:52,720
from what we're wanting to pay attention to rather than arousing just enough energy

330
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:58,079
to pay attention and when we find ourselves in this i

331
00:58:58,079 --> 00:59:04,000
might call it sloth and torpor we find ourselves with this we might

332
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:10,480
investigate what's underlying it often there's there's been a

333
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:18,640
not quite paying attention that there's been some discontent a little bit of aversion

334
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:24,960
some boredom which is also a little bit of a version

335
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:31,200
maybe there's also just some physical tiredness from the body not being have enough

336
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:39,040
sleep or maybe sometimes there might be some of this shutting down or lack of vitality

337
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:44,240
when there's some really difficult emotions that we don't quite feel ready or capable

338
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:49,920
to be with and so there can be this collapsing

339
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:59,119
so we can really simplify our practice without having to use exclusively kind of thinking about

340
00:59:59,119 --> 01:00:09,599
it but to use imagery and use experiences in the body to be aware and stay balanced

341
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:16,240
and we might use this idea of balance and our posture as a way to point when we're a

342
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:22,000
little bit off balance and we can discover ways to come back

343
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:28,240
into balance but first is to just recognize oh yeah i'm leaning

344
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:36,160
or i'm bouncing or i'm collapsing i kind of like use the kinesthetic

345
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:42,640
somatic experience as a way to point to when we're a little bit out of

346
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:48,480
balance and of course the more we are in balance

347
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:54,240
the more we can respond appropriately not only to what's actually happening to us

348
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:59,359
but what's happening to others so that we may be able to support others and

349
01:00:59,359 --> 01:01:04,880
help them so in this way our practice can be a

350
01:01:04,880 --> 01:01:11,839
benefit not only for ourselves but for others thank you
