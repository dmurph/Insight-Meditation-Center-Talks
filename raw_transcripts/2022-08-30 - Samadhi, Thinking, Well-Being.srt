1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,358
so again welcome welcome everybody nice to see you all

2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:14,639
the air conditioning just went on i'll just say that this room ends up having a little bit of micro climates

3
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:20,880
it comes out right there and so if if the air conditioning is bothersome

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:27,439
under there is a little bit warmer i'm just pointing this out usually it's fine for everybody but

5
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,920
hmm so today i'd like to continue on this series that

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,040
i've been doing on samadhi and i'll explain what that is

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:44,239
and then this little series i'm doing on this is within this bigger series on the

8
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:51,440
seven factors of awakening so things that promote greater freedom greater peace greater ease

9
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:59,760
and one of the factors is samadhi and i'm just spending a few weeks here kind of flushing that out and exploring it

10
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,559
and maybe saying a few things more about it

11
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:13,280
so what is samadhi and why am i using this polyword and not an english word

12
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:20,400
first i'll start with one way that we can understand samadhi is that it's this uh we might say it has

13
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:27,280
these three elements the sense of unification kind of like this collectedness

14
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:34,159
as opposed to being really scattered and distracted and you know agitated

15
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:42,240
so it has this quality of unification and steadiness so that it can uh the mind can land on

16
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:48,640
something and not immediately just be bouncing around but just this feeling like you know can have a certain amount

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:55,840
of steadiness and some well-being to definitely accompanied with a real

18
00:01:55,840 --> 00:02:03,119
sense of ease and happiness and joy and gladness and i'll

19
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:11,039
talk about a little bit about that as i go so this idea of samadhi

20
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,440
is something that just naturally arises and there certainly are things that we can do to promote it and kind of like

21
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,200
support its arising but it also is something that just naturally arises when we're doing

22
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:29,040
mindfulness practice and we're doing it for maybe like a little bit longer

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:37,040
longer being either just a longer meditation period or maybe we do a sitting period

24
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:44,640
for however long that the body can be comfortable and then it may be stained with this mindfulness for some walking

25
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,280
and then maybe another sitting so as a way that we can maybe for a longer duration but without the body

26
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,480
complaining too loudly so

27
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:02,840
this one english word that is sometimes used for samadhi is concentration

28
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,440
but the reason why i don't like to use this word is because concentration really is pointing to

29
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,440
this uh we might have this idea as this microscopic uh focusing bearing down

30
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:21,120
onto one single point but that's not really what it is i used to think this

31
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,319
and wow i really did a lot of there's a lot of suffering around you know trying to

32
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,360
do this so i've been trying to kind of like unpack this and explore different ways

33
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,599
in which we can have this experience of samadhi and then something else i like to say

34
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:44,239
when i'm talking about this is that it's not like there's

35
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:51,760
for somebody we could say that there's a switch it's either on or off it's definitely a spectrum

36
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,400
and so we're just like moving one direction towards more collectiveness more sense of well-being

37
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:05,120
or we're moving the other was being a little more distracted and it's not that we can't be distracted

38
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:11,920
i'm just talking about samadhi here so i'm not talking about all of our meditation experiences and mindfulness i

39
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:20,639
don't want us to think that this is the only way but it's just the topic of what i'm exploring and talking about tonight

40
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:28,759
so just a little bit more this idea of unification

41
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,360
there's a polyword i'm not going to bother talking about it but it's you know kind of this idea gets brought up

42
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,960
there's a number of ways we can talk about or think about this in one is

43
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,040
that the body and the mind and somehow are a little bit more unified

44
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:54,160
of coming together two ways we can think about that is the body is here

45
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:02,080
of course it's here where else would it be it's here but sometimes the mind is over there

46
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,199
you know fantasizing about the future or recollecting the past or something like that the mind is anywhere except here

47
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,639
sometimes so that might be one way we could think about some unification

48
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:21,280
is the mind and the body being more in the together or in the same

49
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,639
vicinity i remember this uh

50
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:32,400
one time that i was meeting with a meditation teacher this was early in my practice

51
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,880
and um i was running a little bit late and i wanted to be on time i wanted to give a good impression you know i didn't

52
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:46,000
want to be late and a little bit agitated you know when i'm driving i'll be irritated with everybody

53
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:51,680
get out of my way you know this kind of a thing and

54
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,360
i finally get to this appointment i show up and i'm in the room with the

55
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,840
meditation teacher and i kind of like sit down and like okay you know i wanted to talk about my practice

56
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,280
and this meditation teacher said why don't you finish arriving

57
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:16,720
and that was just like such a nice way like okay to finish arriving i can do this to kind of like get myself

58
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,840
collected in some kind of way so that's one way we might think of

59
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,800
unification so samadhi is another way we might think

60
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:35,840
about it is kind of like a settling and i often find myself doing this with my hands i can't help it it's uh

61
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,240
i think andrea fella she has this assembly that's really helpful about those snow globes where we shake them up

62
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:49,520
and then we put them down and then the kind of the glitter settles it kind of it can feel like that

63
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,120
so part of this maybe both a little bit of unification and settling

64
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,400
and arriving all three of these is becoming embodied to just like a

65
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:06,319
feeling like we're connected to the body that's one way we might understand kind of like this

66
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,599
settling but it's not uncommon for people to have

67
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:18,560
this idea that it's all about how much i'm thinking and so they're evaluating like am i

68
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:25,039
thinking am i not thinking how much am i thinking is this a lot of thinking and so i seem to be thinking less than last time but what can i do to stop thinking

69
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:32,639
right and they're just doing all this thinking about thinking and so it's not it's not so much that we

70
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:39,360
have to stop all our thinking that can happen that usually happens

71
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:45,919
after a lot of meditation practice and that usually happens in a retreat setting hours weeks months and

72
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,759
meditation so it's not so much about

73
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,840
not thinking as what is our

74
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,240
relationship to our thinking because why we spend so much time thinking of course

75
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,639
we do this is what humans do when problems arise difficulty so rise we want to fix

76
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:15,919
them and we're so used to thinking as a way that we sit fix and solve problems

77
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:21,039
so it's about what is our relationship to our thinking and i'll talk about this

78
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:27,360
a little bit more and what is the content of what we're thinking

79
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,760
is there a way or maybe i should there can be the content but also what is the manner or

80
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:40,000
how we're doing it i'd like to unpack this a little bit

81
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,399
so we can this idea of what is our relationship to thinking

82
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,800
is maybe one way we can think about it is what happens when we sit down

83
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,360
or to meditate and we have this intention i'll use the

84
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,680
example to be with the breath this is what we often teach about it is to just you know be with the

85
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:11,440
sensations of breathing and then the mind starts well what am i

86
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:18,480
gonna have for dinner or when is that dang bell gonna ring you know whatever it is whatever it is

87
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,680
lost in this thought and then it's just it's a mystery really like all

88
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:29,360
of a sudden pink they were kind of like a waking up oh yeah i'm supposed to meditate be meditating

89
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:37,360
and then maybe we begin again with the objects that of our meditation the breath for example

90
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:44,800
so what happens when there's that little being oh right i'm meditating

91
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,760
this could be a great place to kind of like check in with what is our relationship to thinking

92
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,320
because what happens in the next moment in the next beat is there like i keep on going

93
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:04,640
sometimes it feels like that like a little light goes back on like oh yeah right i'm supposed to be meditating

94
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:10,240
is there a the next moment is there like dang it how long have i been

95
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:15,440
thinking oh gosh i'm always thinking

96
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,480
everybody else they're probably not thinking oh remember that time when i didn't have

97
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:27,519
as much thinking and it's not like that now right so there can be this dang it or this kind of it's too bad i

98
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:33,040
wish this weren't this way and with that there can be a lot of

99
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,320
storytelling like i'm never gonna get this everybody else can do this or

100
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:45,959
whatever it is we all have our favorite ways of kind of like what's happening the next moment

101
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,560
or maybe it could be like distinct oh

102
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:59,279
thinking and just feeling the ribs expand

103
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:06,079
with the in-breath and with the exhale a little bit the

104
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:11,920
stopping of the stretch so that's another way right just to

105
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:16,959
label it we could just say this word thinking

106
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:23,040
and just begin again with the sensations of breathing it doesn't have to be drama there

107
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:30,399
doesn't have to be an analysis there doesn't have to be any commentary whatsoever

108
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,680
and i'm saying this like making it so simple but this is definitely something

109
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,720
we have to learn we're so used to commenting and we

110
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:48,319
definitely have opinions and ideas and how things should be and should not be

111
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:57,360
but one is to just notice what is our relationship and if there's any harshness there

112
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:03,600
and it's amazing right how harsh we can be on ourselves is there a way that you can bring in a

113
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,519
little more gentleness instead of dang it or maybe it's like

114
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:15,360
dang it oh it's okay sweetie and then come back to the breath or

115
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,720
whatever your anchor is so the first beat might be this habitual one

116
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,880
or whatever our habit is but then is there a way that we can soften it

117
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,160
do not underestimate how powerful this can be it seems like a you know pretty

118
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:39,120
straightforward and it's not even about being mindful or something like this but this can make such a difference

119
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:45,200
to soften as best we can our relationship to the thinking when we

120
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:52,600
discover that we've been lost in thought for however long we've been lost in thought

121
00:12:53,360 --> 00:13:00,240
and then maybe along with this is to recognize that there's actually three moments

122
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,639
happening there's the being lost in thought and when you're lost in thought

123
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:13,920
no problem you're just lost in thought right you're just planning or remembering something or rehearsing a

124
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:21,120
conversation or whatever it might be right there's nothing you're just lost in thought that's how it is

125
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:27,680
and then there's this waking up moment and then there's our reaction to that

126
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,440
moment and sometimes it's helpful or i would say maybe it's always helpful to just

127
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:38,480
notice there's these three different steps because sometimes they get all mushed

128
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,320
together and it's there's only really one step that

129
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:49,519
there's a place where we can do something and we're lost in thought we're lost in thought that's just the

130
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:55,120
way it is nothing we can do there nor can we like make ourselves wake up

131
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:00,720
from loss of thought if we could you would not be here at a meditation center you would just be home you know wake it

132
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:06,639
up from whatever you needed to but it's that our reaction to when we

133
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:14,560
kind of wake up to our thoughts the fact that we've been thinking that's where there's something we can do

134
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:21,040
and to soften bring in a little bit of uh in whatever way is helpful and

135
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,639
supportive for you i use this word oh it's okay or oh sweetheart or honey for some

136
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:33,360
people that's like no way that just feels too weird and for some other people it feels like a nice way

137
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:39,839
whatever feels helpful for you to soften any harshness

138
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:44,880
and then just begin again with the sensations of breathing or whatever your

139
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:50,720
object used to be then i'd like to point out that like not

140
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:55,760
all thoughts are the same of course not all content is the same

141
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:02,000
but one way we might think about it is sometimes our thinking is like we're

142
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:09,199
writing a novel it's a little bit of drama and there's a plot and there's lots of characters and you know just you

143
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:15,120
turn the page and it goes on and on and this is when we're lost in thought like a lot of words

144
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:20,160
this is what happens it's okay but sometimes we can just get it down to

145
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:26,079
a chapter kind of like you know this train of thinking it's just a chapter

146
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:31,360
not maybe not as many different scenes or not as much trauma maybe there's just

147
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:37,519
one drama one thing that has some emotional charge to it and after that

148
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:45,279
maybe there's some waking up then it can be paragraphs

149
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:51,120
and then it can be sentences and there can be words

150
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:56,959
and so with our this settling practice is this kind of process of going for

151
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:03,360
long novels or maybe it's a non-fiction just some big book okay you know so the

152
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:11,120
down to chapters paragraph sentences and then words just like maybe a single word

153
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:19,600
so this um way of evaluating whether we're thinking or not

154
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:26,320
that turns out not to be so helpful because there's so much kind of like judgment that gets associated with it

155
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:32,560
there's often when we're meditating we have this idea i shouldn't be thinking this is a really common

156
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,839
idea i hear teachers talk about this maybe not as much mindfulness teachers

157
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:44,399
but it's such a common thing for meditation you have this idea okay it's supposed to empty your mind

158
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,440
yeah we can't just sit down and empty our mind that doesn't happen

159
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:57,360
so that's just one way to think about this we're just moving to the thoughts are less

160
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,639
it's less of a thought train less complicated you know it's just

161
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:11,199
less of a story and more when i'm talking about it just comes down to a sentence or a word

162
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:18,160
usually when it's kind of quieted to that within their space in between the words and the sentences

163
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:23,600
then those sentences those words are often about

164
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:29,520
the meditation so in the little example i gave before i

165
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,080
kind of said a little note oh thinking so like just like maybe a label that

166
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:42,720
gets put onto an experience is a way to kind of like okay i see you

167
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,880
and then i'm just gonna come back to my object so to just do a simple note

168
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:55,840
one word can be really helpful don't worry if it's the right note

169
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,640
just do whatever comes up first sometimes it's helpful to maybe sometimes the note is like sadness or

170
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:09,120
anger or itching or pressure like we feel the pressure of

171
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:14,240
the chair or cushion against the body or something like this

172
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,679
but there's a way that sometimes it could also be like a sentence that's a

173
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:25,039
recognition like oh the breath is really

174
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:30,400
slower than i realized or you know it might be something like this

175
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:36,640
so it's not uh really different than the meditation but it's a way in which we're kind of

176
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:42,360
connecting with or recognizing what's happening

177
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:51,360
so i'll just introduce this idea to that we can use thinking to support our

178
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,880
practice that is we might if we find that you know

179
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,640
there's this like pressure to think or and of course we often have this

180
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,440
because there's so much behind thinking like it's how we spend our days mostly

181
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:16,080
but is there a way in which we can use the thinking to our advantage or as a support

182
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,840
in one way is there a way that you can give yourself some meditation

183
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:29,600
instructions like maybe there's a guided meditation that you've heard that you've kind of internalized you've heard it so

184
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:34,640
often or maybe you're there's a favorite teacher or an app or you know a dharma

185
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,679
talk or guide meditation whatever it might be to just bring that up

186
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:45,520
and just do a little bit of a guided meditation for yourself

187
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:50,720
for me because i've done a lot of guided meditations you know with a microphone too

188
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:57,679
i find myself doing this sometimes i'm like talking to myself kind of like giving myself guided meditations

189
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:05,600
so maybe it's an acquired taste and i just offer this as something that's supportive nothing that's you need to do

190
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,799
but something that you might try or to if you feel like it might be

191
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:16,799
helpful or supportive or there's something like maybe some

192
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:23,760
like dropping in some encouragement like if the if there's this feeling like

193
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:29,520
that bell is never going to ring sometimes it feels like that

194
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:36,240
you could just say well everything has a beginning a middle and an end

195
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:42,320
or nothing lasts forever or it's going to end it's okay

196
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:48,880
trying to make it ring doesn't make it ring right so there's a way that we could

197
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,000
just like give ourselves this little reassurance or encouragement or

198
00:20:54,000 --> 00:21:00,240
something like this to a way that we could use the power of thinking

199
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:05,679
or we could also bring in some what we might say some borrowed wisdom

200
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,039
maybe we don't have access to that wisdom right then but you know we've heard this maybe

201
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:19,039
we've understood it in a certain way but this idea of well things change

202
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,480
so this with the bell or with whatever we're experiencing just this recognition

203
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:29,600
well this isn't going to last forever or if it is changing we can maybe notice

204
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,880
that or we also know right that there is difficulties there's dukkha there are

205
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:42,880
things that are uncomfortable sometimes it's just helpful to say well

206
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:49,600
yeah this is uncomfortable without having to make it be a you know

207
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:55,440
a huge problem that has to be fixed right then so that's a way which we can use

208
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,880
the thinking to help support the settling this

209
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:08,240
this movement from book chapters down to paragraphs and sentences and words

210
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:17,760
then i also want to talk a little bit about this well-being that's part of this settling process

211
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:22,960
it just naturally arises we don't have to

212
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:29,039
go and search for it or you know manufacture it or drum it up

213
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:34,960
there's something that's naturally arises when there's a settling

214
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:42,159
is accompanied with this with some gentleness or some openness or

215
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:48,799
some not with some grasping or clinging and this is why i've talked about how

216
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:56,480
our relationship to thinking if we can soften that make a little bit warmer as best we can

217
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:03,679
can be so helpful because if there is some warmth and some softness and just the way that we're practicing

218
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,840
that definitely creates the conditions for the well-being to just simply arise

219
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:16,720
and this well-being like in the buddhist teachings they talk about this a lot there's a lot

220
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:25,440
in there about this and part of it is this um the word we could translate as gladness

221
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:30,640
so this gladness just arises when

222
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:36,400
the hindrances have softened so the hindrances are things that hinder

223
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:41,919
not surprisingly and they get in the way of this settling process

224
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:48,960
i'm not going to go into all the gory detail about this there's a number of talks on it and

225
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:57,840
um tanya wiser and i will be teaching a class on them um in the spring or in the new year

226
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:04,640
and i'll just say that it's uh some of the hindrances are like when you feel like you have too much energy

227
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:11,600
you're restless or not enough energy you're falling asleep or maybe there's this fantasizing i just

228
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,200
gotta get this thing or aversion i gotta get away from this

229
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:23,520
thing or what we say doubt this i'm not quite sure what to do and it's this

230
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,559
vacillation or this hesitation there's a lot more we could say about

231
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:36,960
that but that's kind of these five hindrances but when they start to settle then there's this gladness that arises

232
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,480
and this gladness we might think of it it has this um

233
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,640
quality of like it's if you go this happened to me

234
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:55,120
not too long ago that uh went for a walk and i didn't bring a water bottle with me and

235
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,120
i was just feeling thirsty like i feel like i really need to have a drink

236
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,760
it wasn't like the end of the world and you know the walk was going to end like i knew it was going to right but i just

237
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:14,559
this feeling like i would really like a drink and um i had a water bottle on my back

238
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:19,760
at the end of the walk and then when i just got the water

239
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:26,720
and drank and drank a drink there was like ah that kind of a feeling

240
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,840
so this satisfaction or this kind of this sense of relief

241
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:38,640
it's also can be like have you been on talking with somebody and for whatever reason their cell phone

242
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:44,159
or their bluetooth device or whatever it is isn't working well

243
00:25:44,159 --> 00:25:50,080
and that you can't quite hear and you're like or you hear all this background noise they don't realize they're putting

244
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:55,200
away the groceries while they're talking to you and this bang bang and the grocery bags and all this kind of stuff

245
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,480
but you really want to have this conversation and then when they stop doing that

246
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:06,480
oh how nice that feels so it's that gladness that kind of this

247
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:11,520
uplift and this nice feeling that happens

248
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:18,640
but then this gladness if there's if this is arising right in

249
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,799
our meditation practice and there's with this settling there's this other

250
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,000
way we would say joy that arises and the joy

251
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:38,720
feels a little bit different than the gladness it's not so much of a relief or it's not so much of a nice

252
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:47,760
feeling but joy has this really bubbly this really um exuberant exhilarating

253
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,880
euphoric rapture like people use these kinds of words to

254
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:58,320
describe these experiences it can be a knock your socks off finger

255
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:06,480
in the light socket kind of feeling or it could just be a nice feeling this kind of bubbly oh

256
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:11,919
wow feeling it makes no difference where you are on

257
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:18,960
that spectrum nobody knows why for some people it's you know a little bit too much too

258
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:25,039
intense and for other people it's just this really pleasant maybe bubbly

259
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:30,159
tingly really nice really nice feeling

260
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:35,600
and if this gladness was like this glass of water i would say that the joy is

261
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:41,039
more like champagne like champagne happens when you're celebrating you're happy happy birthday

262
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:48,240
happy anniversary congratulations you know it has that kind of like uplift feeling to it

263
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:53,200
so there's this joy that happens

264
00:27:53,279 --> 00:28:01,960
as the mind and the body are getting more and more like connected and collected and settling

265
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:08,000
there's also this happiness that then happens so maybe the gladness has kind of

266
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,760
moved away and it's a little bit more joy and there can be this happiness

267
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,480
and that happiness uh if the joy is like champagne the happiness is more like

268
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:26,000
this hot chocolate like if from at the uh when it's a

269
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:32,000
little bit cold or something or hot chocolate and look just the way you like it just the

270
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:38,320
perfect temperature just you know with the right amount of sweetness and if you like marshmallows

271
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:43,600
there is marshmallows or whipping cream or whatever it might be so it's this

272
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:51,520
maybe this feeling of uh contentment or this feeling of um

273
00:28:53,360 --> 00:29:00,320
it's uh i'm going like this with my hands because there's definitely this feeling of this of expensiveness

274
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,960
like this sense of yeah it's this it's okay sometimes there can be tears associated

275
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:14,320
with it because like wow i just didn't even know that humans could actually feel like this

276
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:19,440
and there's tears like just i don't they're not tears of sadness

277
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:27,840
it's like wow so this is what's can happen

278
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,520
the vast majority of time this happens in a retreat setting when because this settling and the

279
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:42,720
collectedness it takes some momentum we have to to build that because we have to interrupt

280
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:48,240
the momentum of being distracted and being busy and doing this and taking care of that and

281
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:55,600
solving this problem and thinking and talking right of course we're busy with that but in order to allow this settling

282
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:01,679
to happen often takes time for some people it takes they haven't

283
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,200
they will have to meditate for maybe years before they have this that certainly was

284
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:12,240
my experience but it's always like a movement that

285
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,720
direction it's like we might have a glimpse oh wow there was something there

286
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,600
and these kind of like glimpses are nourishing and they support us and recognize there is a different way to be

287
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:33,039
in the world there is a way in which there is some ease and some of this well-being

288
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:40,000
there may be something that i'll say about a little bit more about this well-being and why i took the time to

289
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:46,880
make this difference between gladness joy and happiness is that as this settling and this

290
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:52,799
quieting happens and i don't want to say that um

291
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:58,559
sometimes we have this idea that we have to get like more and more and more concentrated but

292
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,799
another way to think about it is we're just noticing more and more subtle

293
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:11,039
uh experiences this happens with mindfulness practice right and with samadhi we're just noticing things

294
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:16,640
a bit more subtle and i'll say that the happiness is more

295
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:22,720
subtle than the joy i talked about like joy kind of this bubbly and wahoo kind of a feeling

296
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:31,278
and like i said for everybody it's different for some people it's just this kind of maybe tingly really pleasant

297
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:39,519
but to support concentration to support this movement of more samadhi or settling

298
00:31:39,519 --> 00:31:46,000
is an interesting thing happens so there's this joy and this happiness there may be happening at the same time

299
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:53,200
but the joy is like so loud that's pretty much all we notice but then it starts to like settle down

300
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,880
and we start to notice oh yeah there's this happiness here that's less bubbly that's

301
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:04,799
more warm and soft and cozy and then

302
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:10,799
it starts to go like this to the happiness starts to be more and more

303
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:16,640
and the as there's more in the joy is kind of like draining out

304
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:23,200
and there's just this happiness so there's this kind of this shift in the relationship between that joy and

305
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:28,480
happiness and knowing this is a way that we can help support the

306
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:35,760
mind this continuing settling so i keep on talking about you know okay

307
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:43,440
well maybe this happens this knock your socks off type of stuff happens after a lot of practice but

308
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:48,640
there is a way as i said like like this it's just a natural process

309
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:54,240
so there are times if we give ourselves over to the

310
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,679
practice to the meditation practice as best we can

311
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,840
and like i said there might be maybe it's just like a sit walk set

312
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:12,480
maybe it's a whole day what maybe it's a few days

313
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:19,600
or it's just every day every day for you know day after day after day there's a

314
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:25,919
way in which the mind and the body just get used to settling and you can just sit down and this settling just starts

315
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,919
to happen so i'll just say here at imc right we do

316
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:37,760
have half days and day longs and then we have we have retreats at our retreat center as a way

317
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,960
to kind of like support this practice happening and we have you know we sit here for 45

318
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:48,399
minutes on monday nights for some people that's a long time for most people

319
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,440
most everybody you know 45 minutes is a long time so and it is definitely

320
00:33:53,440 --> 00:34:00,799
something to i don't know i'll just say for myself i

321
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,640
would never go if somebody had a 45 minute set no way i wouldn't go because i just felt like that's just not

322
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:13,040
possible but it just happened because i just started a meditation

323
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:18,560
practice and wasn't like i had to was striving for 45 minutes it just happened

324
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:24,398
so i just am offering this i don't i want to send two messages one

325
00:34:24,399 --> 00:34:30,800
that this when the settling the samadhi can really go into some beautiful places

326
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:37,520
that they're not the they're not the purpose of practice but they just support our lives

327
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:43,200
this um the sense of well-being that can be so nourishing

328
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:50,000
especially if we have this habit of being harsh to ourselves to have these experiences kind of like

329
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:56,079
helps uh i don't know like maybe place a salve on

330
00:34:56,079 --> 00:35:02,480
that or something like this maybe so i want to give that message and i also want to give the message that we

331
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:10,560
don't have to wait till we have these fantastic or experiences but just to notice

332
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:16,480
and allow support senses of well-being that arise

333
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:22,400
whenever they arise they are arising but often we're so

334
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:27,680
often more dismissive like oh yeah okay i have to solve this problem i have to

335
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:34,640
take care of this thing like there's something that's not quite right and we just have this habit of course we do

336
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:41,359
to take care of the problem to tune into what's not quite right so just an encouragement to notice

337
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:46,800
though any feeling of well-being openness warmth that shows up

338
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:51,839
and this will be a support for the mind to settle

339
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:57,760
just like settling brings up well-being well-being brings up settling they work

340
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:03,440
together so i want to live a time for some questions

341
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:08,880
so maybe i'll end there this idea of samadhi and

342
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:14,000
thinking and well-being we don't have to get rid of our thoughts

343
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,040
they just will maybe we could use them to as a support

344
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:25,599
and we can use well-being as a support so with that maybe we can open it up for

345
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:31,599
questions i'm sorry richard i didn't tell you before that i was going to do this but

346
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:38,880
i said anybody have some questions if we could use the microphone it would be great or i don't know sveta if there's any on

347
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:46,079
people on youtube if they have any questions no maybe we can

348
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:58,640
good evening diana thank you again um well during the sitting

349
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:06,320
i found myself trying not to be so harsh but then once the bell rang i was like oh gosh

350
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:12,960
i was supposed to be in the here and now and i you know i was just feeling worried and

351
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,359
just that feeling of well-being supporting it just

352
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:26,079
you know when things happen at work and you don't feel that sense of just being present

353
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,119
and then you're just thinking about how to solve something and then you're getting frustrated

354
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:39,119
i just i know that this practice has helped me not feel so agitated all the time but

355
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:45,599
i still get really upset when i'm feeling that way because i'm more aware of that but

356
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:51,838
i just i want to be okay with that but i don't want to keep striving

357
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:59,680
this is great thank you for saying this i i appreciate this very much a few things that you said is that um

358
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:05,200
first of all i'll just say that i'm talking about somebody here on some other times i will talk about

359
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:11,200
mindfulness which uh can be a real support for this so i don't want to say

360
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:17,599
that we have to be doing this you know somali practice or um

361
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:23,599
this is what happens when we first start noticing like oh my gosh my mind

362
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:30,720
it's crazy and i can't make it do what i want it to do and i definitely want to feel better this is exactly what happens

363
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:37,200
this is a an uncomfortable place where we are start to notice more and more

364
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:44,839
how we haven't been noticing and so this anytime we

365
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:50,320
can bring in remember to bring in some kindness

366
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:56,160
and usually what happens like will set the intention like okay i'm gonna when i notice i'm gonna try to be a little more

367
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:03,119
kind or warm towards myself instead of harshness when i notice the harshness and what usually will happen is you

368
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:09,280
won't remember the whole day you will not forget i mean you will not remember at all

369
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:15,839
and then maybe the next day you won't remember and then you may oh yeah i'm going to go to imc on monday night

370
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:21,520
oh right they've been talking about this uh uh not being harsh with oneself and then

371
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:27,280
maybe you'll remember once or twice during the day then maybe you'll come here you heal

372
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:33,839
some things and then the next day you'll hear it a few times and then you'll forget again and then so this is what

373
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:42,880
happens that it's okay it's okay we are rewiring ourselves right that we

374
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:48,079
have a lifetime of being harsh or

375
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:55,200
trying to solve everything with you know pouncing on thoughts or something like this this is a process that will takes

376
00:39:55,200 --> 00:40:02,160
time but can we just be okay with of course we want to solve it

377
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:10,240
but there's a way in which we can be okay with our not being okay

378
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:16,720
so that's the place to practice and then i just wanted to normalize and uh support your the idea that of course

379
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:22,000
we have these intentions to be mindful and sometimes and not to have the harshness

380
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:28,000
but this is exactly how it works just one step at a time one step at a time

381
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,240
thank you

382
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:47,599
thank you um that today was uh pretty brutal um

383
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:54,400
i but i didn't notice something i noticed like i would be switching positions a lot and

384
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:00,240
finding a comfort in one position and i think oh i'm comfortable now

385
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:06,079
and then like 15 minutes later then like the discomfort comes and i didn't really move at all it's just so i

386
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:12,000
thought it was really interesting that like you know i think i feel my body craving the

387
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,880
comfort of a sitting and yet it's not satisfied with that position and it has

388
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:25,040
to change and i just thought that was interesting so not really a question i just uh yeah

389
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:32,079
interesting it's quite something and we'll notice like if you pay attention during the day how often we are shifting

390
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,119
our butcher posture in our chairs you know maybe every two minutes or something where there's a little arm

391
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:44,560
moves or removes something like this we're always shifting our postures so 15 minutes is pretty good actually

392
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,960
compared to what we're often doing but there's a way in shifting our posture doesn't have to be a problem

393
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:56,240
we can say oh my my knee is uncomfortable

394
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:03,760
let's see would it be better maybe i'll um i'm going to shift my posture now i'm gonna move my knee

395
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,760
and then we just move the knee moving the knee feels like this

396
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:16,160
so it's just incorporated into the practice okay so that's but i appreciate you saying this

397
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:18,880
nathan thank you

398
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:27,920
um i'll sometimes be sitting and uh

399
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,680
i noticed that kind of something all this happened today like especially when i'm sitting with other people and it

400
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:41,440
gets really still something will kind of fall away and i feel like i'm in this like really glowy

401
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:46,960
like kind of i can't describe it really uh and i'm

402
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:53,599
just like really in my body and in the moment it just feels like glowy but then like so quickly there's like this little

403
00:42:53,599 --> 00:43:00,160
thought that's like is this samadhi am i doing it i have to keep doing it i shouldn't be thinking you know and then

404
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:07,040
it like so it's just it never can last because my mind is trying to like hold on to it what would

405
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:14,160
you advise doing in that moment when the thoughts start to like amp back up

406
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:19,839
about the the state i guess yeah yeah this is very common i'm not in my head

407
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:25,520
yeah right of course this is very common um a few things um

408
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:32,000
one maybe you could make a note like oh thinking or something like this

409
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:38,960
and there would be it could be a way that uh that can have like stop the agitation of the thinking or

410
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:44,319
something like this um and something else would be

411
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:53,880
um do you have a sense of like when you say something drops do you have a sense of like what supports that dropping

412
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:05,520
i think it's oh i don't i'm not sure how to answer that specific question but like what leads to it i think it's just

413
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:12,000
time and sit like sitting and and the thoughts start to quiet more and more and i can let them go and just like the

414
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:18,240
novel it turns into words and then there's and then it kind of sneaks up on me it happens all of a sudden

415
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:24,560
and then um so yeah so it's not i don't think i'm quite and sometimes like those thoughts

416
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:31,280
are just like a little like it can hold the thought and it's just a little wave that comes and then leaves but then like

417
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,680
i'm like oh i did such a good job letting go of that thought you know and then it the more it's just

418
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:44,079
you know they keep coming yeah yeah it doesn't have to be a problem this is something that

419
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:50,880
happens it's you have to experience that like maybe a hundred times a thousand times like oh

420
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:56,079
okay that's just that and it's not a it's not it once we gain familiarity

421
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,280
with it then the then the idea oh was that somebody or not you stop caring

422
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:07,119
whether it is or not it just feels like oh okay this feels like the right way to go so your it sounds like you're on the

423
00:45:07,119 --> 00:45:14,000
right way right right go in the right direction just do that like a hundred times a thousand times

424
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,680
100 stop caring how many times and then you're there stop caring how many times that's it

425
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,920
exactly exactly

426
00:45:24,880 --> 00:45:31,920
okay okay so we're at the top of the hour here so i want to thank you for your practice

427
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,200
and i'll stay here if some people have some questions afterwards but otherwise i wish you all

428
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:44,359
a wonderful evening and with uh filled with some well-being so thank you
