1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:07,279
so warm welcome to all of you um wherever in the world you are

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:13,840
and um we've been practicing we've been going through since the beginning of the year we've

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:19,840
been going through the categories of meta

4
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:25,680
one by one the concentric circles and now we've moved to compassion we've

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:31,279
been going through the categories of practicing compassion for our friend for ourselves

6
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,719
for the neutral person which we hung out with for three sessions and now we've

7
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:42,800
come to a really important practice

8
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:48,239
which might seem challenging but it's actually really heart opening

9
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:56,399
and we'll approach it very very gently it's the practice of contemplating

10
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:03,840
compassion care for someone whom we have a challenge with

11
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,600
seeing their humanity because we're all human beings we all

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,880
have challenges so by seeing the humanity

13
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:23,280
by opening our hearts as much as possible we're not going to force it to open to compassion and care

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:31,119
but ever so gently as much as it's available seeing the common humanity of someone

15
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:39,920
who's a little challenging of course we're not going to choose the most challenging person in our lives that will just topple us over but

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:48,159
someone we have a little bit of challenge with as a start and surprisingly we'll find

17
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:55,520
that we will experience more peace more ease more joy more connection

18
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:03,040
ourselves so we don't do it as a service to them but we're doing it for

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,959
our own heart we're doing it for the opening of our own heart so that when we are interacting with

20
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:15,840
them or thinking of them there is not a sense of fear or contraction or or more pain

21
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:25,760
um either thinking about this person or interacting with them there can be a sense of ah

22
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,959
more peace more ease and even if it's appropriate some

23
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,239
forgiveness again not to condone the harm that has been done

24
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:41,519
this practice of compassion is not about condoning

25
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:48,640
any harm it's about seeing their common humanity

26
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:55,920
that they too are human being just like us yes we've been heard they've done things

27
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,959
that have been unskillful we can separate the intention the the

28
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,360
actions the impact from the humanity of the person and thereby offering ourselves more

29
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,560
safety and the way to actually work with

30
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:20,000
if reparations need to be made to have a more sense of empowerment

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,680
through practicing compassion to actually enable that

32
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:32,640
so it seems like a complex practice but it's not as complex as

33
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:40,640
perhaps conceptualized as we feel into it it will open up into the ways that we don't expect

34
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,319
so as i guide us into this practice tonight a

35
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,440
couple of things to keep in mind one day one is don't push it

36
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:57,599
and at any point if it becomes challenging for you their sense of lack of safety anger

37
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,640
upset comes up then turn the compassion to yourself

38
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,959
because you're the one who's hurting in that moment so turn the compassion to yourself

39
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,000
and see anything else i want to add um

40
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:23,680
[Music] i think that's it let's explore anything

41
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,840
you need to know will be shared with you and enjoy

42
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:39,199
enjoy take delight in this capacity of our heart to see the humanity of all human beings

43
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:45,600
even those we happen to be locked into some kind of something with right

44
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:52,320
now so so with that i'd like to invite you to get into your

45
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,720
meditation posture you need to lie down shift

46
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:11,600
move this is the perfect time to do that

47
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:25,840
landing arriving in your body arriving in this moment

48
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:30,639
letting go of all the words

49
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:53,840
and just landing with the breath

50
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,680
the sensations of the body the feet

51
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:07,840
on the floor your bottom

52
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,230
and the cushion the raw sensations grounding settling soothing

53
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:21,840
[Music] connecting

54
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:35,840
just connecting with the breath

55
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,120
and as thoughts arise

56
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:54,800
as they will gently telling them thank you not now

57
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:02,479
i'm giving myself to this practice right now come back later please putting them

58
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,560
aside gently

59
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:16,400
but confidently reconnecting with the breath

60
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:31,840
and the body

61
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:24,720
just this in-breath just this out breath

62
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,079
intimately connecting with the sensations of the breath

63
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:47,839
let your body relax soften let go arrive

64
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:53,839
just settling and arriving

65
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,720
tilling the soil

66
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,839
of awareness

67
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:32,399
now i'd like to invite you you would bring to mind someone

68
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:39,519
you have a small entangled entanglement

69
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:44,959
i'm with choosing the most entangled relationship

70
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:52,880
someone who maybe you have a sensitive been doing their best as you have but there's some kind

71
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,839
of entanglement

72
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,279
there's not an ease of flow but

73
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,300
something that needs to be put down

74
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:20,839
[Music] for the ease and freedom of your own

75
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,800
heart for their sake

76
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:37,839
bringing this person to mind as clearly as possible

77
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:00,480
and realizing perhaps at some point maybe you you weren't entangled with

78
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:05,839
this person maybe you were friends

79
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:12,640
maybe in the future you won't be entangled it's just that right now there's some entitlement

80
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:19,839
the beautiful practice

81
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,520
it opens our heart and offers us ease too

82
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:33,679
to let us to let ourselves invite ourselves to think about

83
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:39,679
something good something good about this person

84
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,240
might be something good they've done for us in the past

85
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,679
even if your mind doesn't want to go there no i don't want to think of their good

86
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:58,320
qualities it's okay mind it's okay let's just try

87
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:04,720
it for a second we can go back after this meditation and not think about their good qualities at

88
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:14,240
all but now let's just give it a try let it be an experiment

89
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:19,520
just these few minutes thinking about some good quality

90
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:29,840
or something they've done for you that you appreciate at some point

91
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:37,200
or maybe there's a value about them that you respect maybe you know that they're a good

92
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:43,840
parent or a good friend to someone

93
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:54,160
or a good sibling or a good child maybe they're caring

94
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,559
maybe they work hard they're a hard worker

95
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:09,360
maybe they show up on time something about them some value

96
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:17,519
that you appreciate you admire something good about them

97
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:25,840
or again something good they've done for you in the past

98
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:49,120
this way our minds our hearts can have a more well-rounded feeling

99
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,360
our perspective can shift to be more

100
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:11,039
balanced again not condoning the harm but having just a more balanced view that

101
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:18,399
this person is not one-dimensional there is complexity to them

102
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:25,840
they are a mixed bag just as we are just as everyone is

103
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:35,840
i'm seeing their goodness too

104
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:49,840
spending some time being creative in the ways you need to

105
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
okay

106
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:35,679
thinking about the aspects of this person's life where there is goodness

107
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:41,840
where there are wholesome actions

108
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,320
where their beauty and their values

109
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,960
and seeing allowing that to open you up to their humanity

110
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:06,320
again not condoning the harm that has been done but that they too are human being

111
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:15,600
complex with intentions for goodness

112
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:22,000
and ignorance that causes harm

113
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:28,480
but letting yourself open up to the goodness to have a more balanced view

114
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:37,840
feel free to be creative

115
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:32,720
appreciating that just like you this person as a complex

116
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:41,520
inner life with challenges sorrow

117
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:50,000
suffering just like you they want to be happy

118
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:58,240
they don't wake up in the morning wanting to cause harm in the world they're doing the best they can just as

119
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:05,360
you are of course they have ignorance they don't see clearly

120
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:17,600
but perhaps you can see that you have hurt other people too

121
00:25:17,679 --> 00:25:23,440
we have all been harmed and have harmed others

122
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,840
knowingly or unknowingly

123
00:25:30,559 --> 00:25:38,158
so saying that this person is not so different from you

124
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:47,039
there maybe things that you both love appreciate

125
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:58,080
are dedicated to and seeing

126
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,919
this place of common humanity

127
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:14,910
wishing them well from whatever sorrow challenge they're having

128
00:26:14,910 --> 00:26:21,120
[Music] might be physical physical pain illness sickness

129
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,840
emotional psychological

130
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:32,640
relationship financial part of the human condition

131
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:39,840
they hurt just like you do and there is goodness in them

132
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:51,600
and again you don't have to be best friends you don't have to be a part of your life

133
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:58,080
at all but releasing your own heart

134
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,679
from enmity from ill will by wishing them well

135
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:10,320
fellow human beings may you be well and free from pain and sorrow

136
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:18,240
just as i don't want to suffer i know you don't want to suffer

137
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:26,158
just as i want to be free from suffering and pain

138
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:39,679
i wish you the same may both of us both of us entangled in in this way

139
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:48,720
due to causes and conditions

140
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:55,200
perhaps many of them beyond control above and beyond our control we're in try we're entangled

141
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:02,480
in this wave we've become entangled

142
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:09,679
i wish you ease i wish you well many ways our entanglement isn't

143
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:17,840
personal it's born of causes and conditions

144
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:24,240
may you be free may you be free from pain and sorrow

145
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:34,320
may you have ease and peace just as i want to have peace and ease i

146
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:45,840
wish you the same and release my heart from ill

147
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:10,398
seeing what works best for you repeating the phrases of compassion

148
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:19,519
connecting with a common humanity suffering they both experience

149
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:27,840
extending grace good will to them

150
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:41,840
as much as it's available right now as little as it's available right now

151
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:06,399
you be free from sorrow and pain

152
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:19,840
may you have ease you have peace

153
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:47,840
just as i want to have peace may you have peace

154
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:26,799
last couple of minutes of this practice period made both of us

155
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:32,399
entangled in this way may both of us be free

156
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:39,840
challenges sorrow pain disappointment whatever is difficult for us loneliness

157
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:53,840
may we both be happy and happiest

158
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:07,840
may we both be free from the pain and challenge of our entanglement

159
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:23,839
me all the beings all the people in this zoom room on youtube

160
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:30,400
practicing together listening later on dharma

161
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:41,040
may all of us and all the people we're entangled with all the pears may we all be free

162
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:50,960
from sorrow challenge pain difficulty may we all have peace and peace

163
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:59,200
offering the gift of goodness freely to all these beings

164
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:13,838
including yourself

165
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:28,640
thanks for your practice everyone

166
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:37,440
so this this can sometimes appear as a challenging

167
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:43,119
practice and yet it can be so heart opening

168
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:48,400
offering us so much ease and freedom safety in our own heart when the

169
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:54,960
entanglement is a little softened

170
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:02,160
i would love to hear some reflections from you how was this for you questions comments

171
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:07,350
complaints and if you haven't shared in a while you can raise your hand

172

[Music] or if you can type in chat i'll change the settings

173
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:20,320

174
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:25,760

175
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:34,720
at the bottom or or open the participants button

176
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:42,400
so so what came up what arose how did you find this

177
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:52,078
insights challenges all welcome

178
00:38:01,359 --> 00:38:08,160
as i'm waiting for your reflections to come i'll say that i think this practice of it's actually

179
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:15,040
in the visuri maga path of purification teachings that oh think about something positive about

180
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:22,000
the person you're having a challenge with um it's at first you think no nothing

181
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:29,280
positive i don't want to think about something pleasant or positive about them but then when you work with it it becomes uh

182
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:35,119
actually the heart really softens it's magical it's almost magical

183
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:43,119
kim says there was more ease after i imagined apologizing to them ah thanks for sharing that kim

184
00:38:43,119 --> 00:38:49,920
yeah interesting would you like to say more or you're welcome to if you wish you

185
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,200
don't have to um you can unmute yourself if you like or pass

186
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,320
it's all good

187
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:09,520
not sure what more i can say uh i well i realized that

188
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:17,920
yeah the entanglement was there was a different cause from my side and her side

189
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:24,800
so i guess when i saw i was very judgmental of her

190
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:33,440
so when i imagined myself apologizing to her that loosened the tangles

191
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,760
nice nice nice thank you for sharing that it's

192
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,599
that is quite an insight that there was something about the that the entanglement was being kept in

193
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:53,280
place by this judgment and then when there was the ah softening of i'm sorry then

194
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,480
everything kind of softened so that's the transition so when i asked

195
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:05,040
you if you would like to see more that's exactly it's like the observation though oh step by step this is how this is how the

196
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,319
sausage is made this is how entanglement is made

197
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:17,440
brilliant yeah thanks for sharing that insight kim and one reflection coming through the

198
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:23,200
chat i was getting ready to say i forgive you at the end of the practice and didn't

199
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:28,240
expect the wish for both of us to breathe to be free of

200
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:33,680
pain make sure i got that i was getting ready to say

201
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:39,119
i forgive you at the end of the practice okay so you're getting ready and then

202
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:45,760
and didn't expect the wish for both of us to be free oh so you didn't expect that to be an instruction

203
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,839
at the end that's how i'm interpreting the the comment

204
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:58,079
if you want to say more you're welcome to chat type it in chat or you're also welcome to unmute yourself if you wish

205
00:40:58,079 --> 00:41:04,640
um you don't have to raise your hand but thank you for that i'm also getting this sense of

206
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:12,400
oh yes you're unmuted go ahead please um yeah i think i was realizing that i was

207
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,839
also building expectation and um from the person and

208
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:25,119
um for the harm i was getting ready to you know forgive and and let go um

209
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,160
but just that wish of you know i don't want to be in pain and

210
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:36,160
i want to be free and i don't want you to be in pain and free was was enough it was it was liberating i

211
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,440
didn't need to forgive him or for him to forgive me

212
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:50,240
thank you for sharing that that's really powerful it's a very powerful insight actually

213
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:55,839
just as you said that i got i got chills the sense of oh just that wish of both

214
00:41:55,839 --> 00:42:01,520
of us being free that's that that is a co-forgiveness it's

215
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,640
forgiveness it somehow isn't needed anymore it just becomes a part of this wish for both of

216
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:12,800
us to be it's not directional it's just for both of us beautiful thank you so much for sharing

217
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:18,319
that powerful [Music]

218
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:24,240
one more reflection in chat i'm just coming off of a meta retreat so

219
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:31,440
i'm riding the wave of mitta lots of concentration expansion and care it felt sweet overall to offer care to

220
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:39,680
someone i have a very mild entanglement with beautiful yeah great great to hear the wave of meta and

221
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:47,839
writing that way and overall the sweetness of of offering um this

222
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:54,960
this care yeah this practice can be so beautiful really so freeing any last comments

223
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:00,400
before one more don says wishing this person well makes it

224
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:06,160
easier for me to interact with them yay lovely when i talk with this person i

225
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:13,520
specifically keep in mind this practice oh fantastic that's great i appreciate how there is the uh really

226
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:19,359
thinking of how to take this to the to the world into the real world how to interact with them and

227
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:24,480
it is freeing it is so freeing thank you for sharing that don

228
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,880
such beautiful wise reflections i love this community and the

229
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:38,839
wholehearted practice and the wisdom you share so so as a part of our community

230
00:43:38,839 --> 00:43:45,280
practice [Music] we transition to practicing connecting

231
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:52,400
with other people this is an important part of happy hour that we connect with others in the way

232
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:59,440
of holding them sharing with them and then holding us with care and

233
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:06,960
as i create the breakout rooms maybe spend 30 seconds without any words just wishing each other well

234
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:12,000
with eyes open just looking at each other sharing meta sharing care for these

235
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:17,599
fellow human beings who are just like you they're in they have entanglements just like you

236
00:44:17,599 --> 00:44:26,000
we're not so different so there's humor in that right in the common humanity oh all this oh dear fellow human beings

237
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:31,440
um and then as you wish you can share as little or as much as you wish about your

238
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:40,079
practice and be held in care by others and hold them with affection and care

239
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,200
in your heart and see how beautiful it can be to connect with people in this way

240
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,319
um and i'll create the breakout rooms and it's usually

241
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:58,000
just for six minutes or so so it's pretty quick six plus one minute so i'm going to

242
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,520
create the breakout rooms and i hope you don't jump off and i hope you you

243
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,880

okay so rooms are created opening them here you go so welcome back

245
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:21,520

00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:29,680
you might have about how the practice was um the practicing groups

247
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:35,680
um the first part of practice on your own the reflections in groups would love to

248
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:42,960

249
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:47,838

250
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,839
it was my first session thank you very much it was lovely to meet the group and i really enjoyed the six minutes of

251
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:02,800
kind of small group sharing it's nice to meet some people individually thank you great lovely fantastic

252
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:07,920
welcome to happy hour gym and hope you come back and practice with us in the community

253
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:14,720
lovely great thanks nikki for giving this opportunity

254
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:21,200
it was beautiful um i really liked the group interaction as well

255
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:27,359
because in these times you tend to get very isolated so practicing with everyone online and

256
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:33,440
then getting to know them individually that it was really beautiful thank you so much for that

257
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:39,680
great thank you lena thanks for showing up and being here and supporting yourself and supporting

258
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:46,079
others by showing up and sharing of yourself it's a big gift we can give each other at this

259
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:50,720
time of isolation yeah

260
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:58,240
maybe one last reflection anyone else please yes fred

261
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:09,040
whoops i'm sorry i have my there i am sorry um yeah i'm

262
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:15,119
newish and um i was just noticing how in

263
00:47:15,119 --> 00:47:21,970
any exercise like this there's always for me a little threshold to be crossed to

264
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:27,040
[Music] talk with people i don't know in an intimate way and

265
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:37,280
you know it's always there's always reluctance to cross it and it's always worth doing my experience again tonight

266
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:45,280
thank you for sharing that fred and exactly as you put it that there is a threshold of discomfort to cross

267
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:52,720
and and the sense that ah it was crossed and a sense of delight and gratitude that

268
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:58,240
comes up afterwards that the threshold was crossed

269
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:06,400
the way you put it is exactly what actually studies put it but studies have been

270
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,520
done for this phenomena of of practicing in groups in this way

271
00:48:11,520 --> 00:48:19,359
and it tends to come up for a lot of people that threshold and after they do it ah there's such a sense of gratitude and

272
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:25,440
gladness for having crosses so thank you for verbalizing as beautifully as you did

273
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:32,640
so we have come to the end of the sessions happy hour thank you so much for showing up for

274
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:38,000
practicing for your own sake for the sake of all those whose lives you touch

275
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:44,960
and for the sake of those with whom you have some entanglement may you all be safe happy healthy may

276
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:49,839
all beings everywhere be free

277
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:56,400
[Music] thank you all
