1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,680
so hello everyone welcome to our meditation time together

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:18,160
and one of the supports for meditation is

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,880
our meditation posture and there's many dimensions many

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,199
elements to the value of the meditation posture but one of them uh the simple one that

5
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,320
i'd like to offer today is familiarity

6
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,800
that to more or less take the same posture meditation after meditation

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,920
when you sit down to meditate and take that posture

8
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,840
the associations with meditation the channels of meditation the habits the

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:01:00,079
the orientation towards meditation can kind of begin to click in

10
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:06,320
like your body knows what to do and uh so it becomes it doesn't have to be so

11
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:12,400
much of a mental effort to meditate because the body participates it kind of

12
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:18,880
takes the posture and and our awareness kind of enters our body and

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,320
there's places of maybe some comfort from the familiarity oh this is

14
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:32,159
my meditation place this isn't how i am and and then that familiarity that physical

15
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,439
sense of familiarity can make it easier to

16
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:45,280
be oriented towards the present moment here and now in this body

17
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,680
and and that we need help sometimes because of how strong the

18
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:56,880
occurrence of thinking is that maybe takes us away from

19
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:01,600
the present moment so

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:10,319
to assume your meditation posture

21
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,760
and sometimes if you do it slowly and

22
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,440
kind of carefully that supports this movement towards

23
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:28,800
familiarity and entering into entering into the present moment through your posture

24
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:38,959
sometimes i've seen that the longer someone meditates the more time

25
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,879
they take to get into their posture kind of moving back and forth

26
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:50,400
kind of adjusting their knees maybe twisting a little bit maybe

27
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,200
moving their heads just all kinds of kind of getting everything kind of lined up and

28
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:02,319
and coordinated cooperate cooperating

29
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:07,280
with being present here and now

30
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,440
and lowering your gaze

31
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,400
perhaps if it's comfortable closing your eyes

32
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:51,280
and then taking a few long slow deep breaths

33
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,200
and those deep breaths can also be part of this entering the posture or

34
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,000
returning to your posture to your body that's here and now

35
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,640
a deep breath and on the exhale a long exhale in which

36
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:20,959
you relax the shoulders the belly

37
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:32,400
a kind of letting go that they somehow in the center of your being

38
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,400
and letting go into the pull of gravity

39
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:57,160
letting your breathing return to normal

40
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:08,280
and on the exhale relaxing the muscles of the face

41
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:18,080
around the eyes the jaws cheeks

42
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,360
if it helps the mouth be a little bit more relaxed let the teeth fall away from each other

43
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,039
slightly so the lips are very lightly touching

44
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,000
perhaps relaxing your scalp or even just imagining the scalp as a

45
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,000
relaxing

46
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:21,840
relaxing the shoulders on the exhale

47
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,759
taking time to feel the release or softening of the shoulders

48
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,479
and perhaps how it settles you more into your torso

49
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:59,880
softening the belly soft belly as you breathe

50
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,560
and then turning your attention to the breathing itself now

51
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:27,560
centering yourself in the body breathing

52
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:43,360
maybe imagining that the sensations are breathing

53
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,560
like a river ever flowing river wherever

54
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,919
repeating wave is washing up on the shore

55
00:07:54,319 --> 00:08:00,080
and for you to settle back and watch how all the aspects are

56
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:07,759
breathing the details of breathing come and go

57
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:13,560
the inhale comes begins

58
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:21,599
and ends it disappears the exhale begins

59
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,800
and ends

60
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,680
if there is a pause between the exhale and inhale

61
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,560
that pause kind of begins and ends

62
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:58,320
and within the inhale there are particular sensations

63
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:06,440
that are the manifestation

64
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,839
of inhaling

65
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:18,480
and rather than hanging on to each sensation see them as a

66
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:23,000
river flowing through

67
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:36,279
whereas a constantly changing wave washing up on a sandy shore

68
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:43,519
with all the little the foam and the little

69
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,320
waves and

70
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:57,200
and all the detailed sensations of inhale they come and they go they appear and

71
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:03,760
they disappear don't hold on to anything

72
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:09,600
but see if you can settle back and just allow those sensations to wash through

73
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:15,160
you wash through awareness

74
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:27,200
and the exhale as well all the sensations of exhale settle back

75
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,480
relax let them flow through you

76
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:41,680
as they appear and they disappear and for this meditation you're more

77
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,360
centering yourself on the flow of coming and going

78
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:51,000
appearing and disappearing

79
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:54,560
your mind wanders off in thought let go of your thinking

80
00:12:54,560 --> 00:13:01,440
and let go into the flow of breathing

81
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:07,839
the sensations of your body as you breathe

82
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:19,120
almost like you're receiving it like the sand receives the

83
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:28,120
waves or you're floating on it like you're floating on the river flowing

84
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:19,440
and then gently expanding your awareness that as you experience breathing in

85
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:26,000
the flow of sensations you begin to be aware of the flowing

86
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,440
sensations of the body

87
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:39,399
being aware of the coming and going vibration

88
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:45,839
tingling glowing

89
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:52,279
way in which sensations come and go in the body as well

90
00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:00,959
and so the flow of sensations and breathing is centered

91
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:07,680
in a larger field of flow and

92
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,399
comings and goings

93
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:28,679
the best you can centering yourself in the flow and

94
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:34,400
vibrant moving changing sensations of breathing and

95
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,400
body

96
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:49,200
any place maybe where there's a hardness or things are coagulated or

97
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,840
bunched up

98
00:18:54,799 --> 00:19:00,559
as you exhale see if that can be relaxed or softened

99
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:13,919
opened or expanded so that everything

100
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,120
is somehow participating or joining

101
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:28,000
the dynamic way in which sensations

102
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:35,440
come and go and appear and disappear the vibrancy

103
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:43,160
tingling flowing glowing

104
00:22:52,640 --> 00:23:00,080
if you are thinking a lot relax the contracted mind

105
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:05,480
relax the thinking muscle

106
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:31,840
so the mind too can somehow float on the

107
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:36,679
flow of change throughout the body

108
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:45,880
maybe even becoming a flow of change

109
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:14,480
and if what is hard and closed is in the heart

110
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:21,919
perhaps for a little bit you can open your heart relax

111
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:29,520
so the heart also floats supported let's float supported by the

112
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:36,320
flow of sensations it's okay to open the heart

113
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:42,960
to allow it to be to float to be held

114
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,640
by all the flow in the body

115
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:35,760
to have the awareness centered on all that's changing in the

116
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:41,600
body all the sensations coming and going

117
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:45,360
is said to be healing

118
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:53,840
because it begins to dissolve the places of contraction and holding

119
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:59,120
resistance the more things flow

120
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:03,799
the more health moves through us

121
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:12,480
and it is liberating the more we can

122
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:20,799
relax into the changing nature of life the less we're holding on

123
00:27:20,799 --> 00:27:24,240
clinging resisting

124
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,919
and over time we can become the change

125
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:39,200
become the dynamic process of flow

126
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,840
of our explanatory experience

127
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,919
and as we come to the end of the sitting

128
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,840
with with time we'll discover that opening to the

129
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:37,440
changing dynamic nature of the body is moving towards wellness moving

130
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:43,158
towards healthiness to wholesomeness

131
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:50,559
to freedom and may it be that what we learn

132
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:54,080
but wellness and freedom

133
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:01,200
that we carry that with us into the world

134
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:13,440
and perhaps sharing just by the nature of who we are and how we are sharing that wellness

135
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,559
that freedom with others

136
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:26,640
may the ways that we develop and grow in this practice

137
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,278
may it be for the welfare and happiness of others

138
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:39,120
may all beings be well

139
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:43,520
may all beings be healthy

140
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:51,840
may all beings discover the wholesome body the

141
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:56,640
wholesomeness embodied within

142
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:04,320
may all beings discover freedom as it flows through our veins

143
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,320
flows through our muscles and bones

144
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:23,360
may we live harmoniously in this changing world

145
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:27,760
knowing how to float and open

146
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:37,840
to the rhythms of change the comings and goings of things

147
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,000
may all beings be happy

148
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:06,190
[Music]

149
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,880
thank you

150
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:28,480
so we're talking about the refrain of the satipatana sutum

151
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:35,120
and the first line which we covered somewhat maybe never complete

152
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:40,720
is a line that goes in this way

153
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:48,720
one abides observing that the body

154
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:54,158
internally the body in terms of the body internally

155
00:31:54,559 --> 00:32:00,480
what observes the body in regards to the body externally

156
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:07,679
that's the first line the second line is when abides observing

157
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:15,600
the arising dhamma what observes arising uh observing

158
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:21,120
the ceasing of dhamma what observes the arising and ceasing of

159
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:27,360
dhamma and the word dhamma here dharma usually in english

160
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:33,519
is um it's not a hundred percent sure exactly what this means uh

161
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:39,279
beaker body translates it as nature that isn't quality and nature of something

162
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:44,480
so observing the nature of arising in the body

163
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:50,399
observing the nature of ceasing in the body observing the nature of arising and

164
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:57,279
ceasing in the body that's because the emphasis here

165
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:03,200
is not that what the sensation is in and of itself but rather that the

166
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,720
process by which all sensations in the body have a have a way in which they appear

167
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:14,000
and disappear and as that's tuning into the flow the changing nature the appearing

168
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:22,240
and disappearing arising and passing um is uh is is uh what this practice opens up to

169
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:27,600
when we're able to be centered and stable in the present moment when

170
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,960
we're able to kind of settle back to abide and observe

171
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:40,240
without the mind jumping into thoughts jumping into concepts and ideas and reactions it's just there very quietly

172
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:46,480
to observe what's happening the um

173
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:55,120
so it's another meaningless word dhamma is just experience

174
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:01,519
uh it's the particular experiences that come so whatever experience that arises in

175
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:07,039
the body we see it as a rising whatever experiences pass we see it as

176
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:12,240
passing whatever experiences both see arise and pass

177
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,158
in the body we're observed that what this the third one means arising and

178
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:24,560
passing is that some things last very short time

179
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,800
they just uh almost as soon as they arise they're already passing away like you know a sound

180
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:36,000
of a bell you know it's it's there suddenly it appears but then you're aware of it

181
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:41,520
fading away and um and sometimes that happens quite quickly some sounds like if i snuff my

182
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:49,200
fingers it both kind of arises appears and disappears almost at the same time

183
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:56,480
and so as the mind gets more and more still and quiet this magic begins uh appearing and that

184
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:03,920
is that all the things that we thought were a solid uh turns out their solidity

185
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:08,960
is partly a function of perceiving it conceptually perceiving it

186
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:14,000
through an idea maybe subconsciously that way

187
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:20,640
or seems solid because we're kind of holding on to it or we're contracted around it but as we get deeper and deeper more

188
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:27,760
relaxed and settled and be able to tune in to the to the momentary processes we see that

189
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:34,720
even something which is remains in the remaining it's coming and going

190
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:42,079
arising and passing it's um so like for example there might be

191
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:48,320
you know you might have a constant rustling of the leaves in the in the tree in the wind and just kind of say

192
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,760
it's oh just rustling all the time it's just constant but in fact the rustling if you really

193
00:35:53,760 --> 00:36:00,880
tune into it is a lot of small little rustle sensations of leaves that are coming and going and coming and going

194
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:06,160
and but the aggregate we take to be you know more of a continuous kind of solid

195
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,680
thing so the same thing with the body the aggregate of pain in my knee can seem

196
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:18,079
like solid pain but if we can settle enough and quiet enough and just open to the

197
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:24,800
and receive the the sensations of the pain often what happens is that

198
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:32,400
we drop below the aggregate level and to the to the more uh particular sensations

199
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,839
that make up the total and we see that those are sparking and passing away

200
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:43,200
there's a dance of sensations all the time even in something that felt like it was solid

201
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:49,599
and the stance of sensations and comings and goings begins as we keep practicing becomes

202
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:56,000
more and more the orientation of what we are aware of this can happen uh naturally by itself

203
00:36:56,000 --> 00:37:04,079
it's not like we have to go looking for it in fact to look for it this kind of way of being too soon is uh leads to kind of

204
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,960
certain kind of imbalance and uh even

205
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,040
meditation imbalance meditation or challenge meditation it's better just let it

206
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:20,880
appear as we get more and more settled into the practice more more here and relaxing to

207
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,079
the place where we can just abide and observe in a very relaxed way

208
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:31,359
but what can help and support this is to know that this is valuable

209
00:37:31,359 --> 00:37:37,599
sometimes when people learn mindfulness practice they're supposed to always know something you know you know really go in

210
00:37:37,599 --> 00:37:44,640
there and know that's that's pain that's tightening that's clenching that's warm that's coolness that's

211
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:50,079
and um and so it's kind of like focusing on the kind of i don't know if that concept is the right word here to say

212
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:55,680
but on the thing but at some point what we're interested in is not the thing

213
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:03,200
but to have a deeper intimacy that allows us to see to perceive to sense to feel

214
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:08,240
that whatever thing that's there whatever dhamma is um

215
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:16,560
is arising and passing how it's sparking out and so the the word anicha a n i c c a

216
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:23,119
often translated as impermanence literally means in constant in constancy

217
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:28,560
because some things are when we use the word impermanent england english some people

218
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:33,599
think it means it it's not going to last sooner or later

219
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:50,640
but the individual pieces of sound are in constant they come and go

220
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:58,160
and our breathing is you know as long as we're alive our breathing is constant

221
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,839
uh you know it doesn't you know you know it's not impermanent you know in a final way until we die

222
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:08,880
but the um it's impermanent or inconstant in that it it uh

223
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:16,560
it's it's uh not co in breath is not constantly there the in-breath is inconstant because it

224
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,640
uh it yields to the exhale the exhale is not constant because it

225
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:27,839
yields the inhale and so but they appear there's they're in

226
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,599
constantly uh continuously there they're in constantly

227
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,200
continuously reappearing and so a lot of what we see in the body

228
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:45,200
is a better uh described not as impermanent but as in constancy we see the

229
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:51,200
inconsistencies flow the change moving and um

230
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:57,760
so this uh if if at that time at that time when we're able just rest in that experience abide

231
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:03,520
and observe abide and just sense where the observing is akin to

232
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,880
receptive awareness so if the idea of seeing the observing with is

233
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:14,720
not quite the right metaphor for you there might be some other like feeling

234
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:20,480
it's the receptive feeling receptive perceiving is closer to what it is than

235
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:26,720
than actively looking as a deep as we deepen into this kind of world of inconstancy

236
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:33,280
it's not even receptive anymore because that replies lit implies a little bit of a separation from the experience or

237
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,480
duality or being a little bit active like i'm i'm the one receiving

238
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,599
it's just things appearing and disappearing without us receiving it or

239
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:49,920
actively going to it it's just flowing in this field of awareness

240
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:56,160
and um so there's a whole bunch of degrees by

241
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:04,640
which this happens sometimes we just feel uh hints of it or small degrees sometimes it's very all pervasive

242
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:11,040
and um the but whatever degree it is uh it does represent a movement towards

243
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:18,560
a kind of healthiness in the body because um the contracted and tight and

244
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:24,880
solid solid feeling of the body is normal as it is not like necessarily a problem in ordinary life

245
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,040
maybe even needed an ordinary life but um it also can be the place where

246
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:39,040
we get physiologically congested or things get tense or tight or restricted

247
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,319
and and the blood circulation nerve circulation i

248
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:51,440
don't know exactly all the energies that exist in the body don't flow as smoothly and as we kind of open up to this kind

249
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:57,440
of flowing nature vibrant nature it can feel like like the health is flowing

250
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:03,280
through our body even if someone is sick maybe with incurable

251
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:08,720
disease to have access to this level of meditation it just feels like that this

252
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:15,119
feels healthy and whether it actually heals disease that's a whole other issue but

253
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:23,040
it certainly feels good to have this deep relaxation and opening and probably is good for the immune system and things

254
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:28,960
but more important for in buddhism it's a stepping stone where it says opening

255
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:34,960
it's a it's a a it it's a

256
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:41,920
way of being that begins showing us the potential for freedom in a deep way

257
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:48,160
and um and that'll be the topic for tomorrow so um

258
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:56,960
abiding observing uh the body and its nature and it's a

259
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:02,560
rising nature in the arising experiences

260
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:11,119
abiding observing the body in its seizing experiences abiding observing the body in the rising

261
00:43:11,119 --> 00:43:16,480
and ceasing of all these experiences um

262
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:23,720
so um thank you and um

263
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,640
i look forward to being here with you tomorrow
