happy hour hi so for this friday edition

45
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:09,360
of happy hour after another week um in this

46
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:16,479
interesting world of ours um so a couple of themes

47
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:24,479
one is one theme i'd like to to invite us to explore tonight given that it is friday i think i'll

48
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:31,520
have a quieter happy hour with a lot of space so there could be a lot of silence

49
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:38,080
to settle in with the body with the breath and just have the sense of refuge of

50
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,880
of quietness that's one thing that we'll explore and another theme i like

51
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:50,000
to bring in from wednesday so wednesday we explored

52
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,800
the theme of safety offering safety may i feel safe may i be

53
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:05,200
safe offering safety to ourselves and others and then towards the end the um

54
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:10,800
with the reflections it came up that oh

55
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,880
offering safety is a precondition or perhaps even

56
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:26,640
synonymous with love when we offer safety to someone and let them be just

57
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:33,279
as they are they can be themselves it's a way of loving them it's a way of allowing them to be

58
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:39,120
completely safe and guess what it's the same for

59
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,399
ourselves offering safety to ourselves

60
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:54,480
completely to whatever is coming up might be challenging emotions

61
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,920
might be challenging physical sensations

62
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,800
to allow them to be however they are in the moment instead of fighting with them to make

63
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:12,240
them go away there is this idea of offering

64
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:19,120
safety to our fear for example or offering safety to our disappointment or sadness

65
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,040
instead of squashing it wanting to wanting it to disappear enough now enough no no

66
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:32,950
offering it safety okay yes you can be here you can be here it's fine and there can be resilience there can be

67
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:41,279
[Music] spaciousness there can be actually love holding it all so that whatever we're

68
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:46,399
offering safety to doesn't become the focus doesn't there's

69
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:52,800
first of all there's no battle there's no battle and also there's plenty of space for a

70
00:10:52,800 --> 00:11:00,240
lot more to arise for for gladness for happiness for ease and peace to be

71
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,920
there so so those are the two themes

72
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,399
tonight within this context of meta meta loving kindness friendliness love

73
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:20,480
that we explore towards ourselves so i think that's enough

74
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:26,240
for setting the stage let's practice together

75
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:32,880
ah so i invite you to get into your meditation posture whatever might be appropriate for you in

76
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:41,360
this moment moving maybe see what your body needs

77
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,199
to sit comfortably or maybe to lie down comfortably

78
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,839
ah landing landing with this body

79
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:11,839
landing with the breath inviting the body to relax to let go

80
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,839
letting go of whatever thoughts

81
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:28,000
preoccupations concerns have come before

82
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:39,200
landing in this moment intimacy with this moment of being alive

83
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:53,839
that has never been and will never occur again

84
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,959
relaxing into this body with each breath

85
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:21,839
embracing as if we're embracing this moment with ease not with tightness

86
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:38,560
same sense of ease embracing this moment

87
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:46,959
as if you're lying in the hammock comfortable with ease feeling safer

88
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:53,199
your body relaxed a warm breeze

89
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:03,199
grieving the warm breeze outside

90
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:17,839
creating the warm breeze inside your breath

91
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:41,519
and letting go of the thoughts that are rising right now there's nothing wrong

92
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:49,120
with thinking per se but just now as we're trying to settle and arrive

93
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:57,440
thanking the thoughts thank you please come back later right now i'm giving myself

94
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:03,600
wholeheartedly to intimately sense

95
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,720
feel be open to

96
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,600
refuge

97
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:37,839
solitude busyness in this moment

98
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,559
letting this moment be a refuge

99
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:48,720
refuge a safe haven offering your heart your mind a

100
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:57,039
refuge turning away from busyness

101
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:00,080
feeling safe

102
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:05,440
contained

103
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:25,840
content the simplicity of this moment as refuge

104
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:53,360
what would it mean

105
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:05,520
for you to fully offer safety to yourself in this moment drop in that question

106
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,400
into your body

107
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,840
so that emotions feel safe

108
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:26,320
the body however it is showing up with fatigue aches pains

109
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:32,720
excitement story whatever it is

110
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:45,840
for all of it to be completely okay just as it is

111
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,840
no part of you rejected in this moment

112
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:58,640
parts that disappointed

113
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:03,120
etc etc it's all okay

114
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:13,840
fully embraced received one breath at a time

115
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:19,840
making yourself a safe refuge for yourself

116
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:33,840
breathing in safety breathing out safety

117
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:53,679
in what ways offering your heart

118
00:26:53,679 --> 00:27:00,080
safety feel synonymous

119
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:07,840
with offering your heart your self-love and acceptance

120
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:59,840
especially with respect to self-judgment

121
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:07,278
can you see how offering safety to yourself

122
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:17,279
can be synonymous with self-love self-compassion

123
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,399
ways in which one is the precondition or perhaps

124
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:27,840
similar to the other

125
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,720
a soft gentle smile is an evolutionary way we signal

126
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:52,398
safety to strangers to others

127
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:01,840
what happens if you share a smile with yourself an inner smile

128
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,760
offering yourself safety

129
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:15,840
and care see what happens

130
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,840
experiment

131
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:12,079
you're welcome to explore phrases if you wish or continue without phrases

132
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:21,838
may i be safe or may i feel safe

133
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:35,839
from inner and outer arms

134
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:03,280
may i be happy

135
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:17,839
and joyful

136
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:31,838
may i be healthy and strong

137
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:59,838
and may my life flow with ease

138
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:27,839
may i have ease in my life take care of myself happily

139
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:13,119
and now what if we were turning to safety and offering others

140
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:22,320
safety can we make ourselves a safe haven for others

141
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:26,079
so people in our life

142
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:37,839
feel safe with us at ease with us have no reason to be afraid

143
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:50,400
in our presence may i be safe

144
00:37:50,400 --> 00:38:05,838
may i be saved

145
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:33,838
and sharing the safety goodness with others turning it outward

146
00:38:52,720 --> 00:39:00,720
may all the beings whose lives i touch

147
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:08,079
may all of them be safe feel safe

148
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:18,319
giving this gift of safety this wish freely

149
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:28,640
cultivating our heart knowing too well that life is uncertain

150
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:35,920
without attachment to outcome externally we offer this wish

151
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:44,480
knowing it may or may not be realized but we offer it nevertheless

152
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:57,838
a wish of goodness

153
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:04,799
may all i come uncontact in contact with directly or indirectly

154
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:11,838
may all the beings in my life

155
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:25,839
be safe feel safe

156
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:51,280
knowing full well that may not always be possible but sharing the good wish the good will

157
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:58,720
standing further may all beings everywhere may all beings everywhere

158
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:07,838
may they feel safe be safe

165
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:51,838
male beings everywhere including myself be healthy and strong

166
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:37,200
may all beings including myself have

167
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:47,839
ease

168
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:53,520
and for the last moment of this practice period

169
00:46:54,079 --> 00:47:01,760
offering safety to yourself to whatever rose the past

170
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:08,839
30 some minutes of this practice period whether there was sleepiness

171
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:15,040
distractedness it's okay you showed up as best as you were able

172
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:24,079
to offering safety instead of self-judgment

173
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,800
to yourself

174
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:40,558
may all beings including ourselves be safe from inner and outer harm

175
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:47,599
may all beings including ourselves be

176
00:47:50,839 --> 00:47:58,550
free [Music]

177
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,480
thanks everyone for your practice

178
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,559
so we explored

179
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:25,400
as promised on wednesday following up on practice of safety offering our

180
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:31,520
self-safety and other safety as a precondition for love

181
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:38,480
see what it feels like this offering of safety to ourselves so it's synonymous with care with love

182
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:45,599
to ourselves also what it feels like when we offer it externally

183
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:53,920
i'll share one reflection and as i was practicing with you i found this particular emphasis to be so

184
00:48:53,920 --> 00:49:00,480
soothing calming really just as a sense of refuge for

185
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,599
for this being who's me just very calming and soothing

186
00:49:05,599 --> 00:49:13,359
grounding so would love to hear your reflections you can type them in chat and if you

187
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:19,200
type them just to me i will consider them private i won't say

188
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,720
your name when i read them or you can just say private and i won't even read them

189
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:30,079
or you can type them to everyone in which case i'll read your name or you can raise your

190
00:49:30,079 --> 00:49:37,200
hand your zoom hand you love to love to hear some reflections what did

191
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:42,880
you discover how did this go for you did you notice

192
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:50,078
some things about offering safety to yourself with self-judgements

193
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:59,838
with emotions with body pain what happened what happened

194
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:18,800
eric says soothing is the word it was like a warm bath for my neurons i love it

195
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:25,200
thanks erica that's how i feel too

196
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,400
bill asks how does one offer safety to negative thoughts

197
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:35,440
and yet discourage these same thoughts

198
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:43,839
yeah it's the same way so what i bring up the image i like to

199
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:51,359
bring up is um so with a child

200
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:58,960
or the young child um who's misbehaving perhaps or or not be

201
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:06,640
i don't want to say misbehaving but you know there's something behavior that's challenging

202
00:51:06,640 --> 00:51:13,440
you know you don't beat up the child to to shape them up right you want them to

203
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:20,880
feel safe you want to offer them safety and then with as

204
00:51:20,880 --> 00:51:26,240
they feel safe so that so that they wouldn't hide any mistakes from you because if they're not

205
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:31,440
safe they will hide mistakes from you they'll hate you they'll run away

206
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:37,520
no they won't so you need to offer the the child inside you safety and say oh

207
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:46,240
sweetie this is not a good idea please don't do this so it is a it is a wise balance so

208
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:53,040
you offer safety instead of trying to push them like beat yourself into shape

209
00:51:53,040 --> 00:52:00,240
yes you're safe you're doing the best you can and yet you have a certain

210
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:08,400
um you have certain values or intention so you turn you try to learn you try to

211
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:13,760
steer the ship you're trying to to learn um again back to the example of

212
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:20,160
the child you want to be clear of what is desirable what is desirable and yet you do

213
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:28,079
you don't want to beat up the kid so that's the same idea bill so you offer safety

214
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:35,599
like oh i see you i see you i see you i see yes yes this is not very helpful

215
00:52:35,599 --> 00:52:43,200
dear this this this as you put in your question negative thoughts um this is not very helpful dear yeah i

216
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:50,720
see where this is coming from i see where this is coming from cause and conditions and yet it's not very helpful it's not very inspiring

217
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:55,599
so that's what i suggest working with them

218
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:01,838
and yes

219
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:08,720
love your comment erica yes lovely and then ben says it is so important for

220
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:15,200
parents to take care of their inner child yes indeed jerry says it helped when you said that

221
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:22,160
life is uncertain and this made it realistic then wishes of goodness and safety to yourself and

222
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,440
to others made this real despite the uncertainty

223
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:35,520
thank you jerry yeah i really appreciate how that landed for you exactly so we're not trying to

224
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:43,920
disregard um impermanence yes it is impermanent it's

225
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:50,800
we don't know and yet we offer this wish of safety and goodness and bill says thank you you are welcome

226
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:56,640
bill hope that was helpful for you yeah thank you all for your reflections

227
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:02,640

229
00:54:09,119 --> 00:54:15,680
so dear ones the invitation for practicing in sangha is to practice and see how we can

230
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:23,839
offer ourselves safety and offer other safety can we make ourselves safe for others

231
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:31,119
just listening to them with care and also offering safety to ourselves so

232
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:38,640
that we don't have self-judgment oh i shouldn't have said that oh and if that comes up it's okay can you

233
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:46,000
offer that safety offer yourself safety with that this is a really important practice so i hope you stay and practice in this

234
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,280
way this is a great sandbox these small groups that we do with supportive

235
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:58,799
community which we can then take to the world if you have to go you have child care etc thank you for

236
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:06,720
practicing come back soon but if you can stay please do all right so i will create

237
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:13,860
the breakout rooms and here we go um

238
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:20,000
[Music] let's see

239
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,319
all right so the rooms are being opened now

240
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:35,839
let's start with 15 seconds of meta for each other here you go

241
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:41,920
god that's so cool hi everyone welcome back

242
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:49,599
the rooms are closed so we have a couple minutes for reflections

243
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:55,680
for what you notice what you learned so please you can raise your zoom hand if

244
01:02:55,680 --> 01:03:02,240
you like or type in chat how was it what was it

245
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,680
like what did you discover

246
01:03:11,280 --> 01:03:16,720
i would love to hear your your wisdom if you would be so kind to

247
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:22,480
share your wisdom or questions with the sangha

248
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:31,838
i see some smiles

249
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:48,319
jerry says just wishing the folks in the group meta made me feel safe ah

250
01:03:48,319 --> 01:03:54,720
great great insight jerry that i love

251
01:03:54,720 --> 01:04:01,599
you um saying this because actually when we wish meta for other people we feel safe

252
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:08,559
isn't that amazing isn't that interesting so what you just shared is is really profound

253
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:13,599
really profound in fact it is said that that's why the buddha

254
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:20,079
taught uh this practice to begin with for safety for a sense of safety you you

255
01:04:20,079 --> 01:04:27,920
wish meta for others you feel safe it's it's wild so great great i so appreciate you bringing

256
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:35,119
that that in um bill says i found this a very satisfying experience thank you very

257
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:41,680
calming you're welcome bill glad you're here practicing sarah says to me safety and love aren't

258
01:04:41,680 --> 01:04:49,200
the same thing but safety is a prerequisite for feeling love and giving love beautiful thank you sarah for that

259
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:54,559
exploration to see that for you one is the prerequisite of the other great

260
01:04:54,559 --> 01:05:01,200
whatever you discover is is fine is great is your own discovery there's no right answer here or wrong

261
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:07,440
answer gita says for the first time for me the need to say i in all of this

262
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,480
diminished it was less personal the relationship to difficult emotions

263
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:17,680
ah very interesting would you say a little

264
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:25,680
more guitar why you what do yeah sorry i'm muting myself it was interesting because when

265
01:05:25,680 --> 01:05:33,280
i tried to be in my body and experience the space for

266
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:39,440
emotions the ones you mentioned and then you brought in the phrases of

267
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:46,400
may i feel safe suddenly i thought it wasn't necessary it just was felt more natural to

268
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,680
experience this as there is safety or may there be space for safety which then

269
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:59,039
also made it less important to distinguish between being safe for others as and self to my

270
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:06,079
for myself um i conceptually i guess that makes sense

271
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:11,119
and it's quite common i think to talk about uh

272
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:17,200
in our in our general sort of community may there be safety or may there be this but i must

273
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:23,760
admit for the first time i was seeing that there is a possibility of dropping the eye

274
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:30,799
fantastic fabulous thank you for sharing that yeah beautiful may there be safety just

275
01:06:30,799 --> 01:06:37,760
feeling your safety well when that self-referential frame just as you described it that drops in there is

276
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:43,119
no need for it it's just offering safety internally externally

277
01:06:43,119 --> 01:06:48,240
just safety internally it's beautiful thank you guitar i'm delighted

278
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:54,960
yay yay that that insight came up beautiful kathleen says it seems that

279
01:06:54,960 --> 01:07:00,000
being and feeling safe with myself will enable the vulnerability needed to

280
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:08,079
love more beautiful thank you kathleen great insight yes and jeannie says wish machine turns

281
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:16,000
healing oh oh may you may you heal may you heal terence yeah

282
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:21,599
