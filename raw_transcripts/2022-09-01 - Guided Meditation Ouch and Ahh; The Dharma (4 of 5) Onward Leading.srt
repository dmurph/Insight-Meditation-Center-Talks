1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:04,040
so hello everyone

2
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:13,860
and it kind of warms my heart to be able to sit down here and

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,580
be able having the opportunity the honor to be able to teach this

4
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:28,380
so thank you so earlier this week a lot of the

5
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,640
emphasis has been

6
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,700
staying close to what is directly visible Here and Now

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:49,320
that which is immediate the extended moment the leisurely moment the

8
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:55,640
ability to really stay here to see what's happening in a deeper way

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,059
and um

10
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,680
and responding to a kind of a call come

11
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,260
come look into this ability to be calm and settled

12
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:19,200
and extend that comes with this extended present moment this time you have time

13
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,080
for the present give yourself time for it

14
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,619
there's also a call to I see it to be here and what is the call to see

15
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:36,960
and the call to see what we're asked to see what's available to us that's not

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:42,960
available when the mind is stressed and jumping around a lot or preoccupied with things

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,899
it's uh it sees a path to what is wholesome path to what is

18
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:55,200
freeing a path to um peace and happiness

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:02,040
that it's difficult to see if the mind is preoccupied and caught when the mind is preoccupied caught

20
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:07,259
stressed that itself more likely is going to help

21
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:12,300
produce more agitation more anger fear

22
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:18,599
greed being caught in desires and aversions

23
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,000
but when we take time to for this present moment take time for

24
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:31,680
time then we have a chance to see something

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,720
that is maybe hidden from the preoccupied mind

26
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,720
and we can see the difference between where what the Mind does

27
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,120
that has an ouch in it and what the Mind does that has an ah in

28
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:54,599
it we can see where the mine gets involved in stress

29
00:02:54,599 --> 00:03:00,239
in in suffering and and where the mind can be involved in

30
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,599
letting go and being peaceful where the mind can kind of follow

31
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:12,599
uh you know in that which kind of says Ah this is good this is good

32
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,819
and as that path to ah this is good it opens up

33
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:24,500
then things that are good things that are ah that involve stress that involve

34
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:30,480
agitation or a lot of energy that part of it is seen oh we don't need

35
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,860
to do that let's go to the Ah that's more peaceful and more settled

36
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:42,780
so this is the advantage of sitting quietly and being kind of open to the

37
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:48,540
present and taking their time with it that something shows up something

38
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:55,260
appears come come see to hear to see the difference between Ah that's

39
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:00,840
an ouch and that's an ah we don't have to analyze it figure it

40
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,239
out to understand why it's there but to in meditation to

41
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:13,200
in that peacefulness and then not doing so much in the mind to allow yourself to kind of

42
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,079
go in the direction of the ah where it's peaceful and quiet and settled

43
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,780
a lot of wonderful things open up there an analogy for this meditation a little

44
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:31,979
bit would be that there's something that you're searching for that is really

45
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:39,660
fantastic for you maybe it's a a loved one or a long lost friend or maybe it's

46
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:46,500
a wonderful treasure that you know about and you're told that you have to follow

47
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:52,979
the clues in the jungle to find it or clues in the

48
00:04:52,979 --> 00:05:00,120
city Wherever You Are and the clues are something that's you have to it's not so difficult to see

49
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:05,520
if you're quiet and peaceful if you're kind of attentive and not preoccupied

50
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,419
and so you stay attentive You're motivated wow yes I'll follow this Trail

51
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:18,419
that's onward leading to this wonderful thing

52
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:23,520
so as we sit today maybe this can be the orientation is to

53
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,900
give yourself time for time so that your your heart your mind can be

54
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,600
sensitive to what you're doing in the mind and the heart that's either a ouch

55
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,960
or an ah and lean in the direction of ah trust

56
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:51,380
the ah have confidence that that you don't have to be involved you don't have to be committed to or

57
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,800
entangled with the ouch be committed to the ah

58
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:03,560
the Simplicity of it the opening to it

59
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:13,160
so assuming a meditation posture and gently closing your eyes

60
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:19,100
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

61
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:30,240
with the exhale relaxing with the exhale

62
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,580
making space for time

63
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:43,860
leisurely time to breathe in

64
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,879
to breathe out

65
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,680
letting your breathing return to normal

66
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,539
and no matter how you're breathing

67
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,419
maybe you couldn't your attitude your feeling about your breathing

68
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:24,319
can switch from somehow an ouch to an arm

69
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,639
whatever way you're breathing is okay is their way of holding it being with it

70
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:37,740
with a mind that's has an ah attitude about okay this is

71
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,340
how it is

72
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:56,479
on the exhale relaxing in your body

73
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:34,518
and then settling into your body breathing

74
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:47,160
maybe with a feeling in the mind the whole body that

75
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:54,839
you have a lot of time infinite time just to be here with your

76
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,500
experience Here and Now

77
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:38,600
and as you exhale to calm the mind

78
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,560
for these minutes here meditating there's many things you don't have to be

79
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:54,959
involved in it's a good time an ah time

80
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,940
to trust the quieter mind

81
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,279
that's not in a hurry

82
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:13,640
not trying to engineer something in meditation just here

83
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:03,180
and if you find yourself with thoughts and high feelings

84
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:10,980
attitudes emotions which have an ouch to them

85
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:19,399
it's okay but in the quiet of the meditation

86
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:28,519
can you feel and sense that there's a way to tap into the ah

87
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:42,959
and up head wholesome attitude

88
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,700
an easier way of being

89
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,720
not being entangled

90
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,620
and then as you sit here being with your breath

91
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:11,420
be sensitive to the path of all

92
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:18,620
just ah here now breathing

93
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:57,079
be quiet enough to feel the direction of awe

94
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:04,980
and if there's an ouch which remains

95
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:10,520
see if you can shift a way of being

96
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:21,319
that the way you your attitude of ouch is closer to ah something good

97
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:28,160
so you're not limited by the ouch

98
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:51,620
but you move towards the unlimited ah it's part of the unlimited now

99
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,340
foreign

100
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,440
foreign

101
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:12,419
and then to end this sitting you consider how when we're stressed and

102
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:21,320
harried deeply troubled and caught up in things

103
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,059
how there might not be much room

104
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:34,279
to feel and sense and take in the humanity of others

105
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:39,600
to really sense their fullness and who they are and

106
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:45,799
that's maybe deeper than what they say and what they do sometimes

107
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:02,580
and to reflect on how it's like to meet with people

108
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:09,299
when we have time and availability our hearts available

109
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:16,320
we have plenty of time to sense to feel to see

110
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:23,460
others maybe the time when we feel safe and comfortable

111
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:30,860
and nothing needs to happen except being together accompanying someone

112
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:43,860
and probably the latter there's more opportunities for ah

113
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:48,500
more opportunities to feel and sense

114
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,539
how you can

115
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,600
move towards kindness and compassion generosity

116
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:15,799
care so at the end of meditation session

117
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:22,620
chances are more often than not that here in a state of

118
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:30,299
way of being they can access a greater degree of

119
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:37,940
healthy sensitivity healthy attitude towards others

120
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:53,520
and to give voice to that to take a few moments to

121
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:58,399
give time for that what comes out of that

122
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:08,720
as a way of also supporting and reinforcing a positive way of being in the world

123
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:14,539
so to end with dedication of the benefits

124
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:20,899
may all beings be happy

125
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:26,720
may all beings be safe

126
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:34,940
may all beings be peaceful

127
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:39,860
may all beings be free

128
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,260
and may each of us have the wisdom

129
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:50,059
and the presence

130
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,380
to support this possibility

131
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,929
foreign [Music]

132
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,059
[Music] thank you

133
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:35,580
so my friends we continue now on the

134
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:40,799
five characteristics of the Dharma and this uh

135
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:46,440
little statement is often chanted it's part of the probably daily Liturgy of

136
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:49,820
terravan monastics

137
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:57,360
the Dharma is well spoken by the Buddha

138
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:05,419
it is visible here it is immediate now

139
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:11,419
it invites us to see

140
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:18,779
it's onward leading to be experienced

141
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:26,519
personally by the wise so the today the topic is onward leading

142
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:33,059
this is a beautiful and wonderful quality of the Dharma quality of this practice we do

143
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:38,279
that it is onward leading it leads to what's really good it leads to Freedom

144
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:46,440
it leads to peace to a kind of dharmic happiness and um and how it leads there is also

145
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:53,279
quite fascinating because um uh we certainly have our role

146
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:58,620
in the practice and going the path to practice but there also there's a way in which we

147
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:05,820
end up kind of doing this practice in the current that carries us

148
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:11,820
in the direction of these uh what's good and healthy that there's something that we discover

149
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:18,240
that is leads us to Greater peace and happiness

150
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:23,580
and so it's in this way the dharma's onward leading

151
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:29,220
um carries us on and how does this work what is this

152
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:35,220
and um and some of it is has to do with this

153
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:43,519
ouch and the ah that I talked about in The Meditation today and that is that it's simplistic to just

154
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:50,940
Orient ourselves to feel and sense things from the point of view of an ouch and an ah but the benefit of it is it's

155
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:58,799
so simple the outers don't have to be understood in all their complicated ways just to

156
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:04,740
take it you know whether it's a you know some irritation and having an

157
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:12,919
you know I don't know it's a meditation cushion is too hard to having

158
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:20,039
some major world of difficulty happen for us we just see ouch

159
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:25,500
and those stories no complicated things no trying to understand why

160
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:32,299
and the same thing for the ah um we can get sensitive to what feels good and feels right

161
00:33:32,299 --> 00:33:39,080
and move in that direction without making it complicated for us without

162
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:45,600
appropriating it for self For Me Myself and mine identity not making it a big

163
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:53,460
project the engineering project understanding why we're doing it and and um and questioning what is this all a

164
00:33:53,460 --> 00:34:00,799
for or am I doing the right thing there's a way of making it so simple

165
00:34:01,159 --> 00:34:07,080
that comes from a sensitivity and ability to be really here and present

166
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:16,138
so this is not thinking about things it's more closer to feeling things or sensing or or experiencing the ouch and

167
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:23,099
the Ah that's the other advantage of this these words is they're more experiential than they are

168
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:30,240
Concepts and ideas so as we're able to kind of stay here in

169
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:38,040
our direct experience as we're able to stay in the direct experience now in this extended now

170
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:44,158
and maybe even Timeless now really stay here time for time just relax and not

171
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:52,440
rushing and being ahead of ourselves here and we we respond to the call to to see

172
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:57,960
more carefully what is here what is this experience what's going on here

173
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:03,119
and to see as simple just oh that's ouch and that's ah

174
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:08,339
if I'm breathing in a way that feels a little bit shallow and deep it may be a

175
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:14,820
little uncomfortable then I might have a thought that um wow

176
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:21,119
you know I ate too much breakfast and I'm always eating too much breakfast and and I'm a lousy breakfast eater and now

177
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:27,720
I can't be a good meditator all those sentences all those attitudes have an

178
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:34,920
ouch to them if you're really quiet if you're not if you're in the thoughts if you become the thoughts then they kind

179
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:41,160
of Drive the show and we'd almost don't even see the ouch in them but if we're

180
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:48,000
quiet and peaceful and calm enough we go that's an ouch there's another ouch I do a lot of

181
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:54,420
ouches these are the second arrows that we talk about in Buddhism how we pile we might

182
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:59,820
have something uncomfortable some suffering and then we add suffering on top of it and on top of it there'll be

183
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:06,540
layers and layers of self-criticism or blame on the world or anger or despair

184
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:12,420
or all kinds of extra things and and so this Simplicity is oh that's

185
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,820
an ouch and have time for that oh not in a hurry

186
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:23,579
not pushing it away not judging it just Oh that's oh look at that that's

187
00:36:23,579 --> 00:36:31,800
certainly an ouch and because of that time lots of time we have to be here then we

188
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:38,160
can also feel and sense there's a direction there's something that opens up in the direction of an ah there's a

189
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:45,960
way of being that's onward leading there's a way of of there's another way in fact the simple fact that I'm giving

190
00:36:45,960 --> 00:36:53,700
time and and space to feel the ouch that is an awe that is good

191
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:59,339
the ability to step back and see it to be curious and not entangled in it

192
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:05,760
but to see it from a place of some modicum of calm that's enough

193
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,800
trust that use that as a guide that is onward

194
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,680
leading stay close to the ah the uncomplicated r

195
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:22,680
if there's an ah that do we stand appropriate for ourselves and say oh that's really good I should really kind

196
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:30,000
of luxuriate and really kind of indulge in it or relish it or this is my chance and

197
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:37,440
and um if you really if you do in fact give yourself time to feel what's going on to really see it you'll see the

198
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:43,859
stress in those attitudes you'll see the ouch in it the onward leading way is the way in

199
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:50,160
which mindfulness is self-correcting or corrects us mindfulness gives us information

200
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:57,680
for what is ouch and what is on and as the practice deepens we get calmer and with the ah opens up to more

201
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:04,020
time or space more present and moment attention more sensitivity

202
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:10,320
um uh it works beautifully to help us not get caught in the ouches and to move

203
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:17,480
towards a more and more valuable ah a more valuable way of kind of

204
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:28,039
moving towards greater peace or greater freedom the word for onward leading in poly is

205
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:34,099
in that phrase it's uh

206
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:42,599
copernico and and the the upper is a prefix that could

207
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:48,599
mean upward so and then on

208
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:55,200
is to lead and so oppa can be upwards leading upwards which is kind of a

209
00:38:55,200 --> 00:39:00,540
metaphor for moving towards freedom it could also the upper also has a

210
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:07,079
prefix meaning of near leading close to getting extensive this leads closer to

211
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:12,900
Freedom this lays closer to peace this leads closer to what really feels right

212
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:20,160
here full present and and sometimes we follow that path

213
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:26,700
towards you know what's onward leading upward leading brings us closer

214
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:33,540
and sometimes what you can feel is that we're being brought there that the Dharma is leading us the Dharma

215
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:39,900
is guiding us we're in the current that flows in that direction and a lot of what the practice becomes

216
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:45,900
is just continuing to open and let go of anything that gets in the way of that

217
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:51,740
process it's letting go of all the ouches all the

218
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:58,380
self-centered efforts we might do and and uh and part of so part of the

219
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:05,160
practice is to know when to let go when to trust that process and that takes this very deep

220
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,680
sensitivity of it comes from being present in a Timeless way almost to really feel and

221
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:17,339
sense what's here so we can sense and feel when we have to when it's best for us and most healthy

222
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:23,460
for us most ah for us to come back to apply ourselves to let

223
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,980
go of something and be more actively involved because the alternative is worse

224
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:36,119
and when the best alternative is not to do so much just let go let go let go

225
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:41,760
and then they're not letting go feel like being carried and moved along

226
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:48,420
so it's one of the great uh kind of aspects of the Dharma is that the Dharma

227
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:54,420
is not external to us it's found inside of us and it's found inside of us in this

228
00:40:54,420 --> 00:41:02,280
onward-leading way in which our psychophysical system moves towards Freedom given a chance

229
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:08,760
that has a capacity to move towards the greater ah the greater ease the less

230
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:17,339
stress to um to the absence of stress the absence of strain the absence of

231
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:23,119
inner oppression that we can often live under

232
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:28,200
so um so

233
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:35,940
try today to go through parts of the day or the whole day

234
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:42,480
see how simple you can make this and this understanding this observation

235
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:49,500
of suffering in your life and happiness in your life make it so simple there's an

236
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:56,700
ouch and there's an ah and see if in that Simplicity whether there's a little more freedom around the

237
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:02,819
ouches and a reminder to kind of take say calm

238
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:09,000
and mindful and a greater awareness of the ah the possibility

239
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,220
that you don't have to sacrifice that maybe you don't want to ignore that you

240
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:22,020
want to make space for this ah because it's onward leading it creates a good environment it's also creates a

241
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:27,119
more onward leading healthy direction for our social relationships

242
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:34,380
and uh and that's part of the value of this Dharma it it also supports our

243
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:43,880
communities our relationships to move in healthy direction so try today's keep it simple

244
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:51,420
and if you can have enough time to really feel that maybe you can feel the onward leading nature the door that

245
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:59,040
opens up from the ah that can take you in further in the direction of ah

246
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:06,318
so enjoy and uh and um

247
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:12,799
and I look forward to giving the last talk on this series tomorrow thank you
