1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:07,040
so good morning everyone and or at least everyone on the west coast good morning

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:14,000
and on the east coast later morning and

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:19,199
in europe good afternoon or good evening

4
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:29,119
as you can see gill is not giving the morning meditation today

5
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:36,880
i am for those of you who don't uh know who i am i am paul haller

6
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,559
a dharmi teacher at the san francisco zen center and for this

7
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:53,760
for three weeks this is the second week of a three-week series of called harmony of the passana and zen

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,320
and guild suggested that there's three teachers there's gill myself and then foo schrader who's the

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:09,040
average of one of the temples at san francisco zen center and guild suggested that

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,479
during this time he would give the guided meditations for the first

11
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:21,520
week i would do them for the second and then foo would do them for the third so

12
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,640
and then within our intensive we are taking up the topic of the

13
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:38,000
harmony of the past night and then through uh the its established teaching

14
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:45,040
of early buddhism of sila samadhi panya and

15
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:53,759
for this morning i'll translate them as sila as the behavior that supports

16
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:01,520
practicing and samadhi as the continuous

17
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:09,039
contact of awareness and then panya the fruits

18
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,280
of sila and samadhi

19
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,080
and it over the course of buddhist teachings in buddhist practice

20
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:30,080
panya or in sanskrit or prajna has been related to in a variety of ways

21
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:36,800
and here's what i'm going to suggest to you this morning three ways the first one is

22
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:45,280
understanding as we bring awareness to

23
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:52,959
the human condition actually more particularly when we bring the awareness to our version

24
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,560
me version of what's happening

25
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,560
and and we start to see um the world

26
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:11,040
the subjective world that's created by me

27
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:20,480
and then the second version of panya or wisdom

28
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:26,959
is insight we start to

29
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:36,239
not so much we just draw conclusions but it includes that but it's more that

30
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,799
it's as if we see what's happening in a broader way than just

31
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:53,519
as as within the world according to me you see something more thorough

32
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,720
more more expansive than just the world according to me

33
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:07,200
and then the third way is what i'm going to call realization

34
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,599
is where the moment is experienced so thoroughly

35
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:21,280
that we literally forget the world according to me we forget creating

36
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:28,720
an interpretation and understanding and just the immediacy

37
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,400
of experiencing the moment has teaching that goes beyond

38
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:44,880
how we think how we conclude how we judge how we reference our version of reality

39
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,320
our version of the self so these three

40
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:58,800
and and they support each other so first of all i'll offer a meditation

41
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:07,120
and and the way i'll offer it is i'm referred to understanding

42
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:15,680
you know because out of our understanding comes our intention to practice

43
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,800
and actually out of our understanding comes our notion of what practice is

44
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,720
and how to practice it you know

45
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:34,880
but primarily the great gift of it is this intention to practice

46
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,639
and then it also includes how to practice you know we have an understanding of how

47
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:47,039
to practice and then

48
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:54,560
that opens us to how does that understanding of practice

49
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:00,639
engage what's happening for us in the moment

50
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:11,759
and the part of the understanding is an acceptance of what's happening for us

51
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:16,880
at the moment that it's not that we're broken and we

52
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,240
need to be fixed it's it's not that there's a pristine

53
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:30,800
consciousness that we're determined to create it's more that each moment is itself

54
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:38,639
and we are engaging it in a way that allows that to be so

55
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,759
it allows that to be the lived reality of the moment

56
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:52,479
and then so that creates an intention and an attitude

57
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,560
okay this is about being present for what's happening

58
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:06,639
it's not about control it's not about making something

59
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:14,560
happen that's not already happening it's about aligning

60
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:22,400
the mind aligning the emotions aligning the body aligning the breath

61
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:30,080
with the activity of awareness and being fully present for what that

62
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,560
creates

63
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:44,960
so so let's do it so if you could

64
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,720
just start by noticing

65
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:58,879
and if you can in just noticing what's happening

66
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:03,440
intend non-interference

67
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:17,599
noticing the difference between noticing doing noticing and being noticing

68
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:40,080
the difference between doing noticing and being noticing

69
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:55,839
and then bring that delicate awareness to noticing the body

70
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,880
what physical sensation is most apparent

71
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:13,200
sometimes we notice a tightness

72
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,839
some part of the body is complaining a little bit

73
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:37,839
sometimes we can feel the heart beating

74
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,000
and then intentionally

75
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,000
open the body to awareness

76
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:05,839
traditionally that means an uprightness

77
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,279
a sense of balance

78
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,839
a sense of physical attention

79
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:33,839
and a sense of ease

80
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,720
and each body has its own response to those notions

81
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,640
noticing the response of your body

82
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:15,839
with the intention and attitude of being aware of physicality

83
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:43,839
and then quite deliberately bring awareness to the exhale

84
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:52,639
and two characteristics i would offer you in relating to the exhale

85
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,839
one is when we're asleep

86
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,639
the breath and the body

87
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:11,839
dictate how the breath is not the mind

88
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:19,279
so can you allow the body to

89
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:25,839
express that kind of breath

90
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:34,480
it's like rather than having an idea about how you should breathe trying to notice how is the breath when

91
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,839
you just leave it alone

92
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,880
okay a very standard phrase

93
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:06,959
for relating to the breath in awareness meditation is following the breath

94
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:21,839
the breath is allowed to breathe and the attention follows that experience

95
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,680
and our noticing is all-inclusive

96
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:40,880
if our attention is mixed you know

97
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:49,839
interrupted by thoughts ambient sounds so good

98
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:59,120
and then the other quality of breath on the exhale is like

99
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:17,839
like a sigh like softly letting something fall away

100
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,519
and often when we engage the breath like this

101
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,720
allowing it to be what it is allowing it to be designed

102
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:40,240
by the body not the mind and we release with the exhale

103
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:49,440
it helps create a capacity to notice how the breath

104
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:59,839
can have an emotional quality to it

105
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:12,079
and we can use that attribute of breathing to help create awareness in the moment

106
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:20,000
and then as you breathe in can the inhale be

107
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,199
allowing whatever is going on in the mind and emotions

108
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,920
just allowing it to happen

109
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:41,839
inviting awareness of it

110
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,240
it's almost like when we're feeling the texture of it

111
00:15:51,839 --> 00:16:00,800
is there ease in the emotions in the mind is there a particular topic

112
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:09,839
issue that's causing some disturbance

113
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:17,279
sometimes there's an unsettledness that doesn't have a particular topic

114
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:23,920
so as we breathe in this allowing

115
00:16:26,079 --> 00:16:37,839
allowing what's going on in the heart mind of being

116
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,759
it's almost like we're reassuring the heart mind of being

117
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:51,759
that it's utterly okay to just be what it is

118
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:54,240
it's okay

119
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:05,839
it's okay

120
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:12,000
and with the exhale so be it

121
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,240
all things arise and pass away

122
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:33,200
this is the great rhythm of life arising becoming with the inhale

123
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:47,039
releasing with the exhale

124
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:52,399
in a tender way in a way that supports

125
00:17:54,559 --> 00:18:01,760
the delicate nature of our mind and emotions

126
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:15,840
in how they ripple through the body and the breath

127
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:40,480
and this intention this attitude disposition

128
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:44,320
starts to make evident

129
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:52,000
what we are in this moment

130
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,760
starts to make evident the state of mind

131
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:11,840
this emotionality of being

132
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:25,280
we're not attempting to change it we're attempting

133
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:39,390
to be as fully attentive and engaged with it as possible

134
00:19:39,390 --> 00:19:42,819
[Music]

135
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:03,520
and as we continue this process and

136
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:11,919
we can notice and acknowledge

137
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:21,840
with each breath we start over

138
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:26,080
allowing opening

139
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:38,159
receiving the mind the emotionality the

140
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,039
physicality

141
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,840
and with each exhale

142
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,840
releasing

143
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:58,000
and whatever happens is the gift of the moment

144
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,039
whatever happens

145
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:12,080
the next breath is a new beginning

146
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:27,840
a new intention a new moment of acceptance

147
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,840
so

148
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:07,039
and with the beginning of each breath

149
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:15,440
cycle an intentional

150
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:25,840
commitment to awareness

151
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,399
to letting the body breathe

152
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:39,840
the mind be mind

153
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:51,600
and letting the human organism that you are

154
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,799
express itself in response to that

155
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:07,840
body and breath and mind

156
00:27:18,260 --> 00:27:21,529
[Music]

157
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,919
you

161
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:41,840
so

[Music] [Applause]

[Applause]

164
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:16,480
so this notion this intriguing spiritual notion

165
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:20,320
that as we practice awareness

166
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:33,120
it shines a light on the human condition it shines a light on the person we are

167
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,399
how we're constructing the world how we're relating to the world

168
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:49,360
our version of good and bad or evil or whatever you want to call it

169
00:31:53,039 --> 00:32:02,480
the places where we get stuck the ways in which we get stuck the places where we open and release

170
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:08,159
how both of those influence

171
00:32:09,519 --> 00:32:15,840
our state of being

172
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:26,799
so awareness starts to give us enormous amounts of information

173
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:34,158
you know about what's going on for us and how we're responding

174
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:43,840
and it starts to give us information about how to relate to that

175
00:32:47,919 --> 00:32:56,480
and so i was calling this understanding you know that way in which

176
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:03,120
when we start to see something we have an understanding of it

177
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,840
and as we bring awareness to understanding

178
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:21,760
it helps us refine it no it helps us see oh

179
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:29,760
i'm tending to look at it this way i could also look at it that way

180
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:43,519
once i was talking to someone and a woman and a man had proposed to her

181
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:50,640
proposed marriage to her and but he came from a tradition

182
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:57,840
a culture where marriage was to a very large extent arranged

183
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:07,519
and so he said to her you're this sage and i'm this age and my parents

184
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,800
want me to be married

185
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:20,000
how about it and she was quite deflated you know

186
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:26,960
i mean she actually she liked the person that wasn't it but somehow

187
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:33,040
the matter of factness of it this looks like it could work you know

188
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,358
you have these common interests you know

189
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:45,679
and you know i'm being nudged in this direction you know by my parents um

190
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:54,000
and she realized that from the cultural background she came from

191
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:59,760
that romance was very important it was very

192
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,400
significant

193
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:14,839
and there was a kind of a cultural divide between these two

194
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,000
attitudes well when you get together with someone

195
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,240
isn't it kind of an arrangement doesn't it have a practicality

196
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:33,119
how will you pay the bills where would you live you know who cooked the food

197
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:40,880
it's very practical in a way and then in another way

198
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:46,480
i would say in our western culture and

199
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:55,599
the um how we're relating to it you know

200
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:02,000
romantically know so just as an example

201
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:07,200
of a cultural attitude

202
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:17,760
and then there's a very interesting way until something brings it into being

203
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,640
it's kind of im implicitly accepted and invisible

204
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:32,720
and so awareness is to bring into being to bring in through awareness

205
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:42,480
we become aware of it and we become aware of it by experiencing an incident of it

206
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:52,160
so our understandings when we pay attention to the process of

207
00:36:52,160 --> 00:37:00,240
practice and our understandings of it you know they will start to teach us

208
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:09,839
here's what helps and here's what hinders no in terms of awareness

209
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:17,599
they will start to teach us our own biases

210
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,839
as we experience examples of them

211
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:33,280
and when we bring awareness to it it both supports the process of practice

212
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:40,320
but it also is supporting the process of liberation

213
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:50,480
[Music] because the the lessening of suffering

214
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,960
the mind that experiences in an

215
00:37:56,960 --> 00:38:04,240
appreciative way what's happening the heart mind

216
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:09,359
that relates to what's happening

217
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:17,599
with the deep compassion for the trials and difficulties of the human condition

218
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:25,119
and a deep appreciation for the potential of

219
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:32,000
living engaged in the world engaged in the self beyond

220
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,040
fixed ideas

221
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:44,720
so it stirs up awareness stirs up our understanding

222
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:52,720
in terms of the request of practice the sense of self the details of self

223
00:38:54,160 --> 00:39:01,838
and the opportunities practice offers us

224
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:05,040
and then the insight

225
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:15,839
is those moments when we step out of all of that

226
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:24,800
it's almost like see it oh i have a bias about

227
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:30,720
marriage i come from a western culture

228
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:37,280
that upholds the notion of romance

229
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:47,760
i mean if you think about our culture now um not so long ago i mean

230
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:55,519
sometimes ritually we still do it the father gives away

231
00:39:55,599 --> 00:39:59,680
the bride yeah

232
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:07,200
and and now that's sort of becoming alien to us

233
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:14,720
the notion that marriage was a contract between a man and a woman

234
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:21,440
we're starting to see well that's just one way to think about it you know

235
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:29,760
if there's romance isn't that enough does it matter what the genders are

236
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:42,400
as we bring awareness and we see our fixed ideas

237
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:49,920
and attitudes the awareness inclines us towards expanding

238
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:58,960
our thoughts expanding what's possible and then also

239
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:06,240
inviting us to reflect more fully on what's most important about

240
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:08,880
being alive

241
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:19,040
like when we see okay there's romantic and there's arranged

242
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:22,880
they're both options

243
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:34,079
and when we see in as in an increasing way then we sort of see beyond

244
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:41,280
okay what options will we collectively start to see in the

245
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:49,040
next 50 years

246
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:53,760
so this um

247
00:41:54,880 --> 00:42:02,160
this way of noticing acknowledging and letting it

248
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:06,240
inform us in a deep way

249
00:42:09,119 --> 00:42:16,720
how not to suffer how to lessen suffering how to be more open to the possibilities

250
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,200
of life

251
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:31,839
and then the third aspect of wisdom prajna

252
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,680
that as there's experiencing you know

253
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:48,079
romance is romantic

254
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,440
until you feel a hard connection with someone

255
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:59,680
until you feel an affinity you know

256
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:08,000
the greeks have four definitions for the word love you know

257
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:19,440
it's as we open up you know there's an experience

258
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:27,520
and it draws us beyond the conceptual it can even draw us

259
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,960
beyond the emotional and then in another way

260
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:41,280
it includes them as part of the whole process of experiencing

261
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:47,839
but there's some some learning that happens through the immediacy of experiencing

262
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:55,839
you know

263
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:08,640
when you fall in love you know something of the nature of the romantic

264
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:16,560
when you look at the nature of love then you start to see okay there's romantic love dysphilia

265
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:22,640
love brotherhood sisterhood this familial

266
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:28,078
a sense of belonging to family or tribe

267
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,560
and then there's agape a universal love that includes everyone

268
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,839
and everything

269
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,799
the very process of awareness

270
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:53,599
opens us invites us to greater being

271
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:06,319
and this is in one way we could call it

272
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:14,318
the fruition of tanya or we could call it

273
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:23,280
the full expression of panya the full

274
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:30,960
expression of samadhi the full expression of sila no

275
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,838
they're interwoven

276
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,760
okay

277
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:47,838
so as you go through your day

278
00:45:51,359 --> 00:46:00,000
noticing acknowledging and opening to

279
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:06,800
um okay this is what's happening

280
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:14,400
let's be it let's feel it let's experience it

281
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:22,560
let it teach in a way that goes beyond ideas and emotions

282
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:29,839
okay thank you enjoy your day
