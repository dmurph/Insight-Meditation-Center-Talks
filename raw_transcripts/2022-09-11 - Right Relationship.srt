1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:07,440
so hello everyone and um I'm going to uh

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,780
try to talk about the topic of right relationships

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,660
and um and how I'm using this term is in the

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:25,019
same way that the word right is used for in the Eightfold Path so right

5
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:33,180
view right intention right speech right action right way of life right effort right

6
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:38,579
mindfulness and right concentration and um

7
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,860
the and in fact one way of looking at the

8
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:51,719
Eightfold Path all eight of those factors are defining or bringing forth right

9
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:59,579
relationships that's what the April path is about and and the word right is some people

10
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:06,900
have problematic with it in English because it just seems like maybe it's righteous or if it's you know

11
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:14,220
some kind of moralistic right that you have to be a certain way the word summer in the ancient language

12
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,520
samyak in in Sanskrit is um

13
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,460
the first definition in the dictionary in probably English dictionary is thorough

14
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,680
and in Sanskrit it's uh first But it includes the definition of being full or

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,900
complete so the intention the view the relationships that are complete or full

16
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:45,180
is part of the meaning and so what would it like for a relationship to be complete to be whole

17
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,420
his uh part of this question and being part of the Eightfold Path

18
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:56,820
um it also the word some also has the apparently the etymology of it that goes

19
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:03,180
back maybe before maybe for the Buddhist time has also the meaning of doing client

20
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,340
words to move towards like a be directed towards a particular direction

21
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:15,060
and so the the the complete in the kind of completely involved in a

22
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,459
particular direction and the direction is towards Liberation

23
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:27,060
towards freedom and this Freedom that Buddhism talks about is very relational in a certain

24
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:33,660
way and a certain way is is a transrelational maybe or you know free

25
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:40,620
of relatedness and and this wonderful kind of richness of the combination of both as part of this fascinating way in

26
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:46,200
which the Dharma practice deepens so the way that the Eightfold Path can

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:52,560
be seen as being relational is that the first right view has to do with seeing

28
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,860
suffering and seeing what the how suffering comes to be sometimes just seeing the cause sometimes seeing the

29
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:04,140
Dynamics of how it appears and and suffering is always relational

30
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:10,440
the suffering that we're looking looking about it has to do with the way that we relate to things in the world and to

31
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:16,200
others and sometimes that when suffering is we've caused harms been caused to us is

32
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:22,140
because someone's in relation to us or the world's in relationship to us in such a way that there's harm caused

33
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:29,060
but in a strict sense in Buddhism and they use the word suffering they uh there's a very personal

34
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:36,379
contribution that goes into that that um that uh

35
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:41,760
that we want to take into account and one of the contributions is that there's

36
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,099
clinging there's attachment to that and so uh and it be attached to anything

37
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:53,400
is to be in relationship to that thing to be attached to anything you're not free of it

38
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,340
you're kind of entangled or caught in it and if you can become free of it

39
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:05,400
that gives the opportunity for us to be related to it to have a relationship it's very different

40
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,099
and uh so there's no there might be no intentional relationship to it in terms

41
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:16,320
of wanting something or intending something but when a person's free then

42
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:22,979
they're good will their love their compassion can flow and that contributes to whatever they relate to whatever it

43
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:28,080
might be and um and when you're free you're not

44
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,540
being defined by the relationship when you're not free we tend to be

45
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:39,540
defined or shaped or limited by the relationship because of the attachments of what we

46
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:45,300
want or what we don't want or what we're resisting and all these things So Right View has to do with

47
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:52,100
understanding that right intention the second factor of the April path is clearly relational

48
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:57,840
it's uh the right view is one way of understanding it is that it is to relate

49
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:05,340
to things with compassion to relate to things with kindness and relate to things with with very

50
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:11,360
dangerous word in English concept with pronunciation

51
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,979
so it's nice to be challenged by these big words but uh but the simple way of

52
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:22,440
saying it is to relate to things without projecting or Clinging On It our

53
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:29,639
attachment on it and the pronunciation the Buddha always focuses on is not pronunciation of things but when it

54
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:36,960
relationship to our clinging attachment to things so it's a different relationship with or

55
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,080
without clinging right speech is completely relational right usually we speak to ourselves and

56
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:48,360
we're relating to ourselves perhaps but but uh you know when we speak out loud

57
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,699
it's usually to other people and so we're in relationship with them and what comes through the speech how we're

58
00:05:53,699 --> 00:05:59,520
relating what's being created there what's being done there and right speech is speech which is kind

59
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,360
of timely truthful beneficial so really if you're looking at the relationship and what's kind

60
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:12,479
what's beneficial for What's Happening Here right action is uh usually understood to

61
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:18,539
be able to avoid three actions which you'll understand are very relational

62
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:24,240
one is killing someone the other is stealing from someone and

63
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:31,139
the third is engaging in sexual misconduct with someone so that's very relational right and so

64
00:06:31,139 --> 00:06:38,400
as we as we developed the Eightfold Path that those areas of our relatedness to others begins to shift and perhaps

65
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,220
rather than having those three awful things happen it's the opposite that begins happening there's a reverence for

66
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:49,440
life there's a tremendous generosity and not taking but giving and there's a deep

67
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,919
respect for people and and their sexual well-being and all that that entails

68
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:02,580
and um and there's right livelihood or like right living which tends to be for most people is very related to something

69
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:09,720
if not to other people if you're a subsistence farmer living by yourself you're still relating to the world

70
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:16,080
into the Land There some of the most beautiful relatedness to the world sometimes it's for people

71
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,419
who are farming and some kind of harmony with the natural world

72
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:27,060
uh I write a wonderful New York Times article this last week about

73
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:33,000
um um maybe it was titled some like a truce in

74
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,460
the war and it was the war that farmers I think it might have been in Colorado

75
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:45,419
or in some place Arizona that they had with uh beavers Ranchers with beavers

76
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:52,319
and they in order to because they felt that these beavers are causing too much problems they would blow up the beaver

77
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:58,560
dams and then this man inherited his father's farm and he thought there's another way

78
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:04,440
and he started to allow the Beavers to build their lead gems and then he kind of worked with him a little bit

79
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:11,340
sometimes he needed to help drain the water and he put pipes in but didn't destroy the dams and what happened was

80
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:17,039
that his farm his Ranch became much more resilient in times of drought and at

81
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,979
times of flooding the the dams turns out protected the land tremendously and protected the moisture in the land

82
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:28,680
tremendously and so now there's Ohio movement to to for renters to work with

83
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,719
the Beavers rather than getting rid of them so this idea of you know being in real

84
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:39,479
how we live our life in relationship to the world what kind of relationship are we living there

85
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:46,860
and then right effort that that could be seen as relate a relationship right effort is mostly very personal

86
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:52,380
uh though it has it has a has a relational effect but it has a lot to do

87
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:58,200
with your relationship to yourself and so um to really understand in

88
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:03,600
yourself what motivates what engages you with activity in the world and yourself

89
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:09,600
and so to have a mind mental activity that avoids what is unhealthy mental

90
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:16,080
actions and mental activities and do those things which are healthy and so it means tracking yourself being

91
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,180
mindful of what's going on right mindfulness is is uh you know

92
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:26,459
maybe a little bit harder to find exactly the rich way but it's the foundation for allows us to be in

93
00:09:26,459 --> 00:09:31,800
relationship to the world in a good way and right concentration is a

94
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:38,899
phenomenally beautiful way to be related to oneself it's probably one of the kind of one of the most beautiful ways to

95
00:09:38,899 --> 00:09:45,000
relate to yourself to set up this kind of inner life to be really settled and

96
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:51,779
deeply concentrated relaxed and allowing the natural kind of um a flow of energy

97
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:57,720
within us to kind of flow in a harmonious way it's a beautiful thing

98
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:03,000
so NATO passed to the totality of the output Old a12 Pad maybe we can call

99
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,279
right relation relationship and what is the relationship and some of

100
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:14,880
you know that there's sometimes there's a category that's they say there's three things there's you

101
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:22,740
there's you there's others and so we that exists between them me you and we

102
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:27,899
but we as little bit of a maybe abstract idea and so I like to say but there's me

103
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:33,480
you and the relationship between us and sometimes we need to take care of

104
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:40,200
that relationship more than we need to take care of the other person more than we need to take care of oneself

105
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:45,300
I saw this very clearly as I started to have children

106
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:51,660
and I have two sons and when they were young it became clear at some point the way I

107
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:59,279
had known before that um because I think because my my wife maybe myself especially

108
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:05,640
um uh I done I've done a lot of Letting Go letting go and said you have compassion and caring and so it was like

109
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:11,940
just let's take care of this kid you know at all costs whatever you know

110
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:17,760
whatever is needed and um and my mother would tell me you're careful you don't

111
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,160
spoil him and that didn't mean anything for me I just ignored her

112
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:30,120
and later I understood if she only used maybe a different word she actually was good advice

113
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,959
but um but what happened I realized after a while that it didn't really make sense as a as a child when the child was

114
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:43,740
you know a month old of course you sacrificed everything for the kid that can't do anything for it for himself

115
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:50,700
but as they get older and older you have to pull back and let them kind of more autonomy and but also became clear as my

116
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:55,920
son got and the sons got older there was a we there was a family unit

117
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:02,700
and unless we took care of the family unit we were going to create a skewed relationship in the family

118
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,100
and my son wasn't going to learn how to live in harmony with the family unit it

119
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:15,779
wasn't all about his welfare and what he wanted right that's the recipe for disaster but he had to also learn that other

120
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:21,360
people had need and the family had need and so I think just in time we got some

121
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,700
sense of that and um and so that we became very

122
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:31,740
important to family units and so that's true you know for for when there's two

123
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:38,700
people involved or a family involved it's true when there's a song got involved a community involved a town a

124
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:44,940
city a nation a world that there's also the way of the of everyone everyone and

125
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:51,600
and how does that what what's the relationship of that and what's happening there and what are we contributing to that relationship

126
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,060
and to focus a little bit on the relationship is is unusual for some people

127
00:12:57,060 --> 00:13:02,220
there are some people for whom what they focus on is Me Myself and mine

128
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:09,180
everything is seen through the filter of how this affects me what I want what I don't want how this is impacting me

129
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:15,480
and how I'm being hurt by this how I'm a victim for this and now I'm afraid of everything or something it's all about

130
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:20,820
me and there's powerful conditioning forces in our

131
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:27,360
society that really inculcate this kind of view it's not something we create by

132
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:33,240
ourselves this whole focus on me me me that can exist is something that's been

133
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:39,899
some people have been kind of trained by our society I mean like I said in my family I could see if we weren't careful

134
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:47,160
at some point that's what we were creating in our sun and our society with so many different

135
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:53,459
forces is reinforcing um self-preoccupation self-concern in it

136
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:58,800
for yourself all kinds of things and um and so that's some people's

137
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:05,700
default and it's so strongly in our culture that people don't even know they're doing it and they're so strong

138
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:12,720
in our culture that it's like second nature for people to be self-concerned and it's about me and

139
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:19,139
don't even know they don't even recognize their thinking that way it's just obvious and and um and it's obvious

140
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:24,920
you're supposed to share yourself you know in some way that me is about me in a way

141
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:30,660
um and um and then some people are the opposite it's all about the others

142
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:36,060
like if it can be for young parents like me who are kind of naive not knowing and

143
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:41,100
just kind of give everything uh and it's all about that person that person

144
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:46,320
and um and and some people have religious

145
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,899
and family kind of World Views that really reinforce it's about others but

146
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:58,320
others about others taking care of them but what is about that third thing that

147
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,500
in the relationship and what happens in that relationship how do we study it how do we see it

148
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,779
and it's not something we see physically and this is now we're kind of entering into

149
00:15:09,779 --> 00:15:16,320
you know a little bit The Invisible world and not the not not like a mystical

150
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,899
invisible world or something at the other but it's something we don't obviously see you have to be attuned to

151
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:28,620
you have to pay attention you have to pick up the cues you have to understand yourself better in order to really

152
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:35,579
understand what's happening here in the relationship to this but that also makes it kind of fun

153
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:42,360
and it's a very different way of navigating in the world nervous surfing along the relatedness

154
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:49,079
rather than engaging This World by asserting oneself or or

155
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:54,980
denying oneself and the example that I have for you that

156
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,779
you know no it's not going to work for many of you because many of you probably haven't gone surfing

157
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:06,300
I think it's possible I haven't been a really start surfing more than once

158
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,639
so I don't know what I'm talking about maybe so but maybe you'll forgive me and I'll

159
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:18,720
just just use as an example and hopefully I can um uh when you're on if you're on a

160
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,699
surfboard and you're able to catch that wave

161
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:29,399
though it's you you don't catch it and on this on the wave and that's okay I've

162
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:35,100
done it now I can just freeze and just kind of ride the wave out and not do

163
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,320
anything anymore but the wave is dynamic and you're a dynamic and everything is

164
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:47,160
dynamic and so you have to you have to be totally and kind of in Harmony in

165
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:54,000
relationship to all the different factors in at Play and and uh and shifting and adjusting

166
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:02,160
accordingly the whole time and probably one of the reasons is so fun to be on a surfboard is that uh

167
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:07,980
self-concern drops away self-preoccupation self-consciousness drops are because you have to be so

168
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:13,558
fully engaged to be right in the present moment to track all the different things going on

169
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:19,199
and it's not just the wave but it's everything that's involved

170
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:24,600
including you and uh you know and so for if there's

171
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:29,820
two different people writing exactly the same wave and one

172
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:35,400
person is really petite and one person is humongous the size whatever they're

173
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,559
probably going to ride the wave very differently and they might follow the wave just as

174
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:46,799
far the same distance so both of them are managing to do the wave perfectly

175
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:54,360
but it's going to look very different for these two people and so the perfect way to ride that wave

176
00:17:54,360 --> 00:18:01,260
it's going to be different for those two people it has to do with the relatedness between what the factors that the

177
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:06,299
individual brings and the factors of the board you know they have different size boards and

178
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:11,880
depends what board you have probably the same person writing the same wave on different boards

179
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:18,539
switching boards every time perfect white riding the wave is different because it all depends on the

180
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:25,860
board too so the person's writing the doing the perfect ride is in constant conversation

181
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:33,980
relatedness with that contributing that relationship so to stay on the board but also

182
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:41,100
recognizing what the wave is contributing what the what the board is contributing the whole thing

183
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:47,160
and so it's a dynamic thing and it's the combination of all the relatedness all the things coming

184
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:55,620
together that allows us to do the perfect Rock to perfect ride so for you living your life

185
00:18:55,620 --> 00:19:01,440
what's the perfect life what's the perfect way to do things what's the perfect way to be in a conversation with

186
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:07,760
someone what's the perfect way of caring for someone or what's the perfect way of doing anything

187
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:13,799
if you carry an external standard of what that is I'm supposed to be like someone else

188
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:20,940
that's the way they do it it's not going to be it the perfect way to be or in the language

189
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:26,820
of samma right the complete way to be the whole way of being in relationship

190
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:32,100
to this situation has to do with your contributions as and

191
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:37,320
who you are and all kinds of things about you as much as it has to do with the

192
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:44,039
situation so um if you're a

193
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:50,880
if you're offering I train people to do spiritual caregiving as chaplains and I said tell

194
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:56,039
that these people being trained sometimes said if you're a

195
00:19:56,039 --> 00:20:01,220
um maybe I usually say unrepentant extrovert but maybe that's not a good way of saying it

196
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:06,360
and then I followed that by unrepented introverts but but what I mean by that

197
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:13,020
is you're completely at home with being who you are you're not you're not to apologize you don't have to you know

198
00:20:13,020 --> 00:20:19,140
it's not a crime yourself anyway so um so someone who's a very strong

199
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:26,179
extrovert shows up to for someone who they're offering spiritual care to like in a hospital

200
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:32,580
the right spiritual care relationship is found in the in that relationship

201
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:39,299
between them and so the person doing spiritual care has to be attuned to not the other not

202
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:45,780
only the other person but to themselves to know where that right way of being is

203
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:52,020
and I knew one spiritual caregivers Joplin who showed up to very difficult situation

204
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:59,100
and um and uh couldn't really not really communicate this person who was conscious but but it

205
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:04,260
was you know it was header face to the wall wouldn't communicate to anyone was pretty upset

206
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:09,679
and so the spiritual caregiver started singing uh Amazing Grace

207
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,080
if I sang Amazing Grace I just would sing to my kids sometimes

208
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,940
when they were little and they'd tell me to stop

209
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:28,140
so you know that wouldn't be my way but that was that person's way and uh and if someone is in this

210
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:34,700
unrepented introvert what their their perfect spiritual caregiving conversation

211
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:40,260
is going to be very different maybe for them who they are and what's

212
00:21:40,260 --> 00:21:47,039
right that is maybe they should sit down quietly and hold someone's hand and that's the Avenue with which some

213
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:52,559
the perfect spiritual caregiving thing happens so it's in the relationship between all

214
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,220
the factors not in some abstract idea that we have perfection so this is very respectful of yourself

215
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:07,200
you get to be yourself imagine just be to be yourself but you have to be you know yourself well enough

216
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,440
to know what you're contributing and to know the situation well enough to know that you're contributing the right

217
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:19,919
thing and you're creating the right relationship in that interaction between them

218
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:25,980
and if what you're contributing is clinging grasping attachment it's

219
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:31,100
probably not going to be a good outcome if what you're committing

220
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:38,340
bringing into it is cruciality and unkindness meanness it's probably not a

221
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,679
good relationship it's not one that you you're going to thrive in or is healthy for you and others

222
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:50,280
if it's wrong speech if there's a lot of complaining and a lot of bit you know you're doing kind of verbal verbal

223
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:56,400
stabbing of people verbal knives about you know just kind of get back and get them and and that's not that's that

224
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,780
you're establishing a certain relationship there but if your words are kind supportive

225
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:08,760
not mean not cynical or complaining about something

226
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:16,080
or blaming a very different relationship gets formed and the sad thing is sometimes people

227
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:21,780
want to have an unhealthy relationship now sometimes because they think they

228
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:27,480
think they get some benefit from it or something so to be careful with this relatedness

229
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:33,419
the right relationship where do we how do we what do we contribute to it

230
00:23:33,419 --> 00:23:42,780
and one of the principles you find sometimes in Buddhism is the idea that um to assert the self

231
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:50,340
is delusion but to allow all things to inform you

232
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:55,500
is Awakening so to take you you know the self your

233
00:23:55,500 --> 00:24:01,919
self-assess that it is the key word is assertion pushing yourself asserting yourself aggressively putting yourself

234
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:09,059
up into the world want you know with clinging attachment and that can be done forcefully

235
00:24:09,059 --> 00:24:15,659
but it could also oddly enough in Buddhism Buddhist terms we assert ourselves in the world when we are

236
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:22,020
really shy that's just as much even though it looks like we're pulling back and not doing

237
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,360
something there's still a strong sense of self that we're contributing to the situation

238
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:36,900
and um and so what we're learning in Buddhist practice is how to soften and relax

239
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:42,539
um all attachment all clinging so there'll be the opportunity to come forward in different way

240
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:49,620
and one of those attachments is this excessive preoccupation with self that has been the case since the time of

241
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:57,659
the Buddha otherwise he wouldn't have been teaching this and not sell for non-selfishness that he taught but in

242
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:04,380
probably every generation thinks it's gotten the worse now so maybe that's you know but uh you know

243
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:12,240
it seems to me it's pretty bad and um it was still an issue so to

244
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:18,659
really understand that Me Myself and mine and how much were self-preoccupied and measuring

245
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:25,020
things by the impact it has on us of course we want to respect ourselves that's we're part of the we're

246
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:31,860
definitely part of the writing the wave right but uh are are you contributing a

247
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:37,080
healthy relationship to yourself and maybe we should not even use the

248
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:45,179
language healthy relationship to yourself because as soon as you see the word to itself it's a magnet for all these cultural

249
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:51,539
familial religious ideas of what it means to be a self that we're way down under

250
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:58,500
so another way of saying it may be a healthy relationship to all that lives within us

251
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:05,460
free it from this idea of being the self that we have to prove or defend or do anything with

252
00:26:05,460 --> 00:26:11,460
to be awakened is to be informed by all things and so to be informed by what's within

253
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:18,919
us it's all to be respected every thought every impulse every feeling every

254
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:25,140
emotion in this practice is respected we're in a healthy relationship to it we

255
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:32,279
don't condemn it we don't and we don't hold on to it and oddly enough we don't celebrate it

256
00:26:32,279 --> 00:26:39,120
maybe you don't get you if you nothing gets kind of overly evaluated overly

257
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:46,140
valued everything is respected which allows for this the birth of this

258
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:52,380
healthy relatedness this freedom in which things can flow and the idea that things can flow within

259
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:57,900
us without it being appropriated by self

260
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:04,039
made into self measured by self is a fascinating and delightful and

261
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:11,880
empowering empowering kind of situation to be in and so to begin exploring this world of

262
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:17,760
self the self thing we do the attachment to it not in any blame nothing now

263
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:24,480
you're a bad Buddhist uh you don't become a bad Buddhist by anything that you do and how you are

264
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,700
and maybe you're never a bad Buddhist but uh where Buddhism is found and where

265
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:35,760
the health is found is in the relationship we have with all things

266
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:41,940
including your relationship to yourself and some of the relationships that people have with themselves what's been

267
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:46,980
going on here is very difficult there's a lot of criticism sometimes

268
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:53,460
despising of oneself there's a lot of difficulty here and so and it's painful

269
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:59,100
very deep and so trying to come to a new relationship finding your relationship

270
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:04,320
where there's compassion and care and kindness It's a slow process

271
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,500
but it's helpful to know that this is what we're doing we're trying to come to a new relatedness

272
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:17,100
where we're freeing ourselves from the fixed ideas of who we are fixed ideas of

273
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:22,500
this is what perfect is or this is what imperfect is there's no actually there's no

274
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:27,620
imperfular perfect or if there is perfection in writing the wave

275
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:34,159
the perfect riding the wave you know how long that lasts

276
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:40,260
it lasts probably less than a second so congratulations but you don't have

277
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:46,740
any time to congratulate yourself because you're on to the next half seconds when you have to kind of make the adjustments for the next perfection

278
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:53,340
and so with this kind of idea you know how long you're imperfect a few of us are occasionally imperfect

279
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:58,919
right a little bit you know but you know how long it really lasts it's like the wave

280
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:05,580
it's like it might be true for half a second unless we're caught in the idea of it

281
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:13,020
we're projecting the idea we're living the idea I'm imperfect but the idea is just an idea

282
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:19,980
the idea of the wave is just the idea but the wave is always changing you're always changing everything is fluid

283
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:27,360
and one of the the one of the things we're coming to in this practice of mindfulness is appreciating deeper and deeper the

284
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:32,580
fluidity of the moment to moment we're always on a wave

285
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:39,179
we're always finding our way and if you're not finding your way you'll probably fall off

286
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:45,539
The Wave in some ways if you get involved in too much retrospective thinking about what I did

287
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:52,440
you probably fall off the wave so to ride the wave of the present moment and what is the right relationship

288
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:58,340
what is the way what's the relationship that rises when it's informed by everything

289
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:04,980
within and without and as we become Freer what we discover

290
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:10,620
is that we don't have to be so self-concerned about how we respond

291
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:15,779
the sense of the right response it's just it becomes more and more it

292
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:21,120
feels almost natural obvious of course you're going to be kind

293
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,860
of course or say differently maybe you'll automatically be kind

294
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:35,100
but you'll automatically not be unkind you won't be mean

295
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:40,260
you're automatically be succumb someone this is very clear in Buddhism they say that once you reach a certain maturity

296
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:48,059
in this practice you become someone who will never kill intentionally never steal never engage

297
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:53,940
in sexual misconduct that harms people so there's all these ways in which

298
00:30:53,940 --> 00:31:00,440
you don't do all this stuff that's as harmful because that takes work and effort

299
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,179
and with the absence of that what is left

300
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:16,760
and what I love is this tradition that was Buddhist tradition that we're in it doesn't specify what's left

301
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:23,100
it's very reluctant to say that what's left is your basic human goodness

302
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:28,320
what's left is wonderful what's left is love and delight and all

303
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,880
that because I think because as soon as you say that

304
00:31:36,179 --> 00:31:42,720
you fall off the wave as soon as you'd say that you're kind of locked on into something and you this is

305
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,179
how it has to be but rather there's a deep Trust

306
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:53,279
in with this maturity of just allowing

307
00:31:53,279 --> 00:32:00,779
something to flow through us now that you know is not going to be unhealthy not going to be harmful

308
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:07,260
so that's taken out of the picture and then what the response is from the inside

309
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:13,159
might not look like the ideal might not look what you think it's supposed to be

310
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:19,260
but maybe it's the right thing in the combination the relatedness of

311
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:24,899
you and everything else who knows what that's supposed to be you don't even know what it's going to be

312
00:32:24,899 --> 00:32:30,299
sometimes to come with preconceived ideas

313
00:32:30,299 --> 00:32:36,480
limits of what might arise so to assert the self

314
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:43,320
is delusion to allow all things to inform you

315
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:48,200
or allow all things to inform

316
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:55,980
allows for health to unfold the healthy wave

317
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:01,020
so I'd encourage you if this talk had some meaning for you

318
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:06,960
that um I'm not I'm not assuming that what I was saying about the relationship between

319
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:13,679
you and the world you and others is an obvious category to understand

320
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:19,260
maybe because it's always shifting I'm not saying it's easy like now you can just kind

321
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:26,039
but there is this relatedness there is something that happens in relationship and it takes a while to begin to become

322
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:32,700
sensitive to it and attune to it and appreciate it and with some people it's easier and

323
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:37,860
some people it's not so easy there might be good friends that you can say I there's a new thing I want to understand

324
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:43,500
better maybe you can help me there's not you and there's me and that's what there's what happens between

325
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:48,539
us let's explore that and having some friend to help you might

326
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:54,059
be make it kind of come alive more and interesting and and make it uh help you

327
00:33:54,059 --> 00:34:00,480
with this new kind of world and uh and maybe you'll understand some

328
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:06,960
point very personally to assert the self is delusion

329
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:14,700
and to a lot of allow everything to inform you is Awakening

330
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:17,960
thank you
