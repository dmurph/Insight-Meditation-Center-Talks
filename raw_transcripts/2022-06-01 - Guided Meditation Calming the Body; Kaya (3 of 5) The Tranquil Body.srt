00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:21,039
hello everyone and welcome to our time together our 30-minute

2
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,400
meditation and um

3
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:36,880
the theme for today is tranquility to sit with a tranquil body and mind

4
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,879
i think of it as a ability to sit quietly without being in

5
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,680
conflict with anything without being disturbed by anything

6
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:55,120
and it's a remarkable state to experience

7
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:00,718
because it can feel like one of the most

8
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:09,119
noteworthy remarkable forms of spiritual health

9
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,799
maybe even sometimes mental health even physical health at times

10
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:20,479
to sit with their whole system at ease

11
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,840
undisturbed but alert clear

12
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:33,439
it involves learning not to be preoccupied with the little thoughts we

13
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:39,840
have the buddha and talking about his own practice talked about not

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:45,600
running after the little thoughts i love this idea of little thoughts

15
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,200
they can seem so big our thoughts so huge and monumental and important

16
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:58,960
and maybe they're just little thoughts maybe thoughts by themselves are just floating

17
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,520
ideas and memories and plans and

18
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:12,400
projected fears into the future so to sit quietly and tranquilly

19
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:19,440
to relax all that can relax while all that can be alert

20
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:26,640
can be present and clear so

21
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:33,599
not easy to accomplish but the buddha said that

22
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:40,640
the nourishment the food for tranquility is tranquility itself

23
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,640
so in other words the ability to recognize is maybe at first just a hint

24
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:53,200
of tranquility and then build on that

25
00:02:53,200 --> 00:03:02,239
uh feel the tranquility as an alternative to preoccupation an alternative to

26
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:09,040
being involved with the thoughts that are distressing or disturbing or

27
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,040
um react reactive to what's happening here

28
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,159
so assuming a meditation posture

29
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:26,640
and maybe wiggling your body swaying back and forth a bit

30
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,760
swaying forward and back straightening up and bending a little bit

31
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,120
until you find a posture that for you

32
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,000
represents a balance of tranquility

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,920
and alertness tranquility and attentiveness

34
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,360
and attentiveness alertness that's embodied

35
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,720
aware through the body

36
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,200
and then to

37
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,439
lower your gaze and letting your eyes be cool

38
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:21,759
ever feel any kind of coolness quiet that's possible in their eyes as they

39
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:29,520
rest in their sockets not looking at anything in particular

40
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,360
and then to gently close your eyes

41
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:05,759
and gently maybe not a full deep breath but a half

42
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:13,680
deep breath gently tranquilly breathing in more fully

43
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,880
and you might try at the top of the in-breath to gently hold your breath for a moment

44
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:29,039
or two so that when you do

45
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,080
begin the exhale it can feel like a letting go

46
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:43,360
a releasing letting go into a quiet state

47
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:54,639
and you might with a deeper taking deeper breaths pause for a moment or two at the end of

48
00:05:54,639 --> 00:06:01,680
the exhale so that when you do inhale it's a

49
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:08,160
welcome attentiveness welcoming

50
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:14,800
the feeling of attentiveness alertness awareness of breathing

51
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:23,199
and here we have this wonderful the alternation between

52
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,080
releasing relaxing on the exhale

53
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:35,840
and aware and alert on the inhale

54
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:53,280
letting your breathing return to normal and on the exhale

55
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:57,120
soften the body

56
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,919
a global softening

57
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:14,400
on the inhale as if the body expands the whole body expands and gets

58
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:21,280
larger beyond the boundaries of the body even

59
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:27,319
you know the exhale is softening settling

60
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,599
releasing

61
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:41,800
softening the belly

62
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,319
softening in the chest

63
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,960
releasing the shoulders

64
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,800
releasing relaxing the muscles of the face

65
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:35,080
and quieting calming the energy of thinking

66
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,159
relaxing the thinking muscle

67
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:15,200
and now see if you can find within your body

68
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:23,640
someplace that there is a bit of calm or tranquility

69
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:38,640
it could be in the torso the arms and hands and the legs

70
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:46,160
in the head in the back anywhere where there's some feeling of tranquility

71
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,160
calmness

72
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,200
it doesn't have to be dramatic just the place in your body where it's

73
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,839
most where it's calmest

74
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:16,720
and then see if you can breathe through

75
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:22,320
that area of calm breathe with it

76
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:32,120
there's a way almost as if you're gently blowing on a small fire

77
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,800
so that it grows

78
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:08,880
adjusting your mind so the mind is calmer

79
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,880
quieter

80
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:22,720
maybe even a stillness of mind as you're aware of whatever

81
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:29,000
stillness tranquility

82
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:38,040
peace there might be in your body in your heart

83
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,000
so

84
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,560
whatever is not come for you see if you can let that recede to the

85
00:13:54,560 --> 00:14:01,480
background of awareness

86
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:08,240
not to dismiss it or to ignore it entirely or

87
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:17,760
but to give time to your capacity for being calm

88
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:24,720
that also it's important for that also to exist

89
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:32,959
for you in a strong way and so to feel into

90
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:38,240
calmness tranquility

91
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:46,240
when you exhale letting go of your thoughts

92
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:58,519
relaxing the holdings in your body

93
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:09,600
letting go into the place within that is still

94
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,600
quiet

95
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,680
so

96
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,519
so

97
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:32,279
so

98
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,279
so

99
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,160
so

100
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,480
so

101
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,640
so

102
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,640
so

103
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,120
so

104
00:21:56,880 --> 00:22:03,840
underneath your thinking maybe you'll find a place of calm and

105
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:10,960
tranquility breathe with that place

106
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:16,080
breathe through it breathe out of it

107
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,399
let tranquility be the flavor

108
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,960
of your meditation

109
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,919
so

110
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,200
so

111
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,600
so

112
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:54,799
you might try having tranquility

113
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,640
come the feeling of it be at the center

114
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:07,840
almost like that's who you are if you're identified with your thinking

115
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:13,520
more as who you are switch to whatever degree of calm or

116
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,600
tranquility stillness you might have within

117
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:26,400
let that be who you are let that be the center

118
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:33,480
around which everything else orbits

119
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:49,640
taking refuge in the calm

120
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:04,840
and see if you can [Music] let your eyes be calm and

121
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:10,080
tranquil cool still

122
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:21,440
either with your eyes closed or if it's most tranquil to open the eyes gently

123
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:30,278
maybe gazing down 45 degrees let the eyes open slightly

124
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:40,320
and with a calm gaze relax gaze

125
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:54,080
be aware of the world around you the extended world out beyond your

126
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:01,440
where you are people in your lives people in your communities

127
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:10,480
people far away people you don't know gaze upon it all calmly

128
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:17,760
peacefully for a few moments not disturbed

129
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:25,440
not in conflict just a calm regard

130
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:31,919
as if calmness tranquility his medicine

131
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:35,519

[Music]

141
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,240
thank you

142
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,279
foreign

143
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,559
uh

144
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,480
hmm

145
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:42,559
so here we are

146
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:50,799
and the topic is tranquility and in the theme of the week of

147
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:56,080
different ways of experiencing experiencing our

148
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:03,440
body it's possible to have have the body

149
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:10,240
be felt as a tranquil body a peaceful body

150
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:17,519
and uh this is a remarkable feeling of health of well-being

151
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:23,600
that everything is kind of right here now

152
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,799
it's a experience of the body that comes when we're not disturbed by anything in

153
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:36,240
conflict with anything and we're not spitting out thoughts and

154
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:41,360
ideas it's a quieting of the mind

155
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:48,080
of the mental activities that's used to relate to the body

156
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:53,440
and because these different bodies i'm talking about have a lot to do with the state of the mind the activity of the

157
00:32:53,440 --> 00:33:00,159
mind so i've seen diagrams of the brain kind of um

158
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:07,440
kind of diagrams where they're showing what parts of the brain are most biggest or most active or something

159
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,679
and uh and they show that um people who do the same activity over and

160
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:21,200
over again that part of the brain grows i don't know if it physically gets bigger or just more activated

161
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:27,120
so that someone who is um you know their whole profession maybe is

162
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:33,200
typing there's been a whole day typing that somehow the the brain centers having to do with the

163
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:38,720
fingers grow bigger and and so these brain centers that they're

164
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,480
involved with different parts of our body can grow and shrink depending on the

165
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:50,240
usage in which we have it and so as the activity of that center grows

166
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,279
then there's more maybe orientation to feel and sense and experience and know

167
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:02,159
that part of the body but if those mental activities if the mental

168
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:08,878
activities the mental centers get quiet and calm then the ways in which the mind

169
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:16,079
constructs remembers the body fades away as well

170
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:23,118
so you know we can have a very strong body image of some part of our body

171
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:29,760
the you know i recently i i clipped my fingernails and

172
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,760
and so i might be self-conscious that i didn't clip my fingernails just right maybe it's a little bit uneven and here

173
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,878
i am with a few hundred people uh you know watching me and maybe noticing my

174
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:47,679
fingernails and so my whole world starts thinking about my fingernails and so that fingernail part of the

175
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:54,878
center of the brain maybe gets probably other centers too becomes bigger more activated

176
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:01,119
and so in my mind i kind of have an image of my fingernails my fingers

177
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:09,359
um and i'm just you know oriented around the image of it and what the impact that has on other people

178
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:14,960
and so my my i have a i have a i'm operating under an image of

179
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:21,280
fingernails but if i let my mind become quiet and calm

180
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:27,440
that part of the mind that's busy and activated to think about fingernails to imagine what they look like

181
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:34,560
to to be concerned about you know their shape and their smoothness or whatever

182
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:39,920
that's all god turned quiet and in my experience

183
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:46,800
fingernails kind of disappear from awareness you know i sit here quietly meditating

184
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:53,359
with my breathing meditating my torso grounded feeling centered quiet

185
00:35:53,359 --> 00:36:00,079
and the and that for 30 minutes i wouldn't even think about my fingernails then this in a certain kind of way

186
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,760
in experience they don't exist of course they exist but i'm not experiencing them

187
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:10,880
they fade away from from attention in the same way

188
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:16,880
as the mind gets quieter and quieter the body begins to recede from its defined

189
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,599
definitions from its image that we carry with us subconsciously we carry images and ideas

190
00:36:23,599 --> 00:36:29,119
and projections and priorities about the body we're in conflict with the body we're

191
00:36:29,119 --> 00:36:35,920
adjusting it we're reacting to the pain and pleasure in the body there's a lot of kind of sub

192
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,680
liminal subconscious and conscious activity going on in the brain

193
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,119
in relationship to this body that we have as that

194
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:55,359
those mental activities quiet down um the body begins to feel more calm and

195
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:01,280
peaceful it's almost like the puppeteer in the brain has taken a vacation and is not

196
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:07,440
pulling and tugging and directing and and awakening and and

197
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:13,040
being no no no nosy into all the different things going on you know something's going on in the

198
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:18,640
body the body is just left radically alone and this uh

199
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:25,920
not obstructing not interfering not activating not thinking about the body

200
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:31,520
leaving the body alone in a nice meditative way allows the body

201
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:38,079
to move towards a kind of health the body has tremendous uh kind of

202
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:46,160
movement towards homeostasis thesis uh to harmony to subtleness to release

203
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:52,960
the body itself just wants to relax wants to relax the tensions that are being held there

204
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:59,839
and and so as the mind gets quieter

205
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:05,040
our relationship to the body shifts and change and then the way we experience the body

206
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:11,280
changes and the body can have a very refreshing peaceful feeling to it

207
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,320
the tranquility can be a feeling of suffused tranquility

208
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:22,800
through the body or suffused coolness or refreshment that exists somehow nice

209
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:29,760
peaceful um it's a more peaceful state than the bliss body the joy body that we

210
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:35,359
talked about yesterday that um because that's still a little bit uh

211
00:38:35,359 --> 00:38:41,839
activated compared to now that quiets down as well and um

212
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:47,040
and there's not exactly any place we can you know anything solid or too much

213
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,480
solid in the body it's more like a glow of peace glow of tranquility

214
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,800
of refreshment and it's a it's a very different way of experiencing ourselves

215
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:05,200
it's a tremendous gift to the body when we can you know no longer have the mind

216
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:12,880
preoccupied by it or reacting to it or defining it or having an image of it

217
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:18,960
some people find that the edges of the body begin to dissolve and there's no clear sense of the

218
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:26,079
boundary between the body and the air around it because the boundary itself that's the

219
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:33,119
shape of our body the boundary we have is part of the mental construct the ideas the mind does

220
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:40,960
that that based a lot of memory but if we so drop into the feeling body

221
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,560
without all the ideas and reactivities the feeling body moves towards

222
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:53,359
subtleness and peacefulness and calm it only gets activated if the puppeteer

223
00:39:53,359 --> 00:40:00,079
pulls the strings if the if the cook stirs the pot

224
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:07,760
and if we're not pulling strings or stirring the pot the body can go quiet and peaceful

225
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:13,760
and it's a um remarkable to feel the

226
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:20,880
the um tremendous value the wealth in a sense that uh comes with this very deep sense

227
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:26,000
of peace and tranquility it's um

228
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:32,880
and uh from the vantage point of that state of tranquility and peace calm

229
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:38,319
it's possible to have a clear sense that many of the ordinary pursuits we

230
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,359
have in our life um especially if they involve tension or

231
00:40:43,359 --> 00:40:48,560
anxiety or or ambition or greed

232
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,160
are so much less valuable the richness the well the

233
00:40:54,160 --> 00:41:00,800
peacefulness the richness the texture of this tranquility and peace and calm that can

234
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:06,720
exist this doesn't mean that we have to kind of stay stuck and always be tranquil and

235
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:13,040
calm but it does mean that we have a lesson a dramatic kind of contrast between

236
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:19,200
different ways of being and we can begin appreciating how the puppeteer works

237
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,240
how the mind works in activating the body and prioritizing the body or

238
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:30,560
defining the body you're concerned with the body in such a way that um

239
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:35,839
you know that the turn quilt tranquility is lost

240
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:41,839
so um [Music]

241
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:50,010
it's a beautiful to really marvelous thing to have this

242
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:58,319
[Music] the the shift in the body from the karmic body to the joy body tranquility body

243
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,920
and where the experience of the body the energies the sensations the

244
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:10,640
these qualities of well-being and of tranquility seem to emerge from the inside out

245
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:15,839
and are not dependent on the ways that we relate to the body from

246
00:42:15,839 --> 00:42:23,200
the outside in we have individuals families societies have

247
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:29,440
tremendous painful attitudes beliefs

248
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:36,480
behavior uh relationship to the outer body kind of how it looks

249
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,040
in terms of size and shape and color and race and

250
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:50,640
and all kinds of things that um people can have a lot of suffering over

251
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:59,040
but the body's experience of itself from the inside out from what emerges peacefully when we're

252
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,880
not tamping it down or constricting it with all these

253
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:12,520
outside-in kind of concerns and preoccupations and obstacles

254
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,400
what comes and emerges what flows what can be there from the inside out

255
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,240
is it can feel like it's really independent of the outside in concerns

256
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,000
if there's a liberation from outside in there's a liberation from the societal

257
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,720
pressures on the body and judgments and ideas just to have the body have its own

258
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:42,240
experience from the inside out where its own flow of energy's flow of sensations

259
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:50,079
can settle and open to joy and to tranquility is a powerful lesson

260
00:43:50,079 --> 00:43:56,000
in freedom powerful lesson in an alternative way of living that's

261
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,839
not outside in it's not caught up in thoughts and ideas and images of

262
00:44:01,839 --> 00:44:09,760
how the body is and what should be so tranquil body

263
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:16,480
so you might over this day see what you can do as through the day

264
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:23,200
to let the body be more tranquil maybe it's how you sit in a chair

265
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:28,400
you can sit in a chair in a way that the body is more settled and easier to relax

266
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:33,520
and in a tranquil way it's it's not necessarily

267
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:38,800
slouching in a chair i don't know if that gives us the most tranquility

268
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:45,839
um but where do you feel the most calm and subtle that we're settled and rooted and grounded

269
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:52,319
and as you walk as you do some work as you talk as you drive

270
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:58,560
look and look and see how you can do all these things with some modicum of calm or peace or

271
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:05,200
tranquility and see what you learn in the process and

272
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:12,480
and certainly what you can learn about what takes you away from the tranquility but maybe for this exercise today

273
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:19,839
what you learn about the benefits of living a tranquil life

274
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:25,839
so thank you very much and

275
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:32,680
and i look forward to continuing this series tomorrow
