1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:12,719
so then we'll start and with more kind of official uh

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:22,320
good day to all of you and welcome and uh some idea that you might want to

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:30,560
incorporate into your your sitting

4
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,320
is the idea that we are in doing meditation not just trying to

5
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,760
become calm and peaceful not just to have insight and see clearly

6
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,520
what's going on we're also trying to grow grow inner qualities

7
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:54,879
wholesome qualities the skillful qualities and there is a movement towards this

8
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,320
there's some in this teachings of the buddha some powerful words that are used that could

9
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:07,680
be translated into english as growing in in a way that we thrive or into

10
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:14,320
abundance and and so this recognition of something can develop inside of me

11
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:21,680
that um that um inside of us that grows and develops and

12
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,200
unfolds over time and this can be in confidence it can be

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:32,960
growing in wisdom it can be growing in equanimity growing in generosity compassion

14
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:38,000
kindness a certain kind of strength of fortitude

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,960
all kinds of things can develop and the metaphor for this growth is that of a plant growing

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:50,079
and um and so the farmer provides the conditions this is

17
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:57,360
the soil and the i mean there's a price so the the fertilizer and the water and maybe

18
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:04,479
the light to allow something to grow and so meditation practice is also

19
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:11,599
providing these things so that we could grow and one of the things that

20
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:18,000
we try we try to do in meditation is to let go of thinking and preoccupations

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:25,599
so that our awareness our capacity for pr being present becomes open and available

22
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,640
for something to fill it to grow into it if awareness is preoccupied and

23
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:37,120
claustrophobic there's no room for something to grow and develop in almost like into that space so there's

24
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,319
no space for it to grow it's like a crowded um uh

25
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:48,400
garden bed was full of weeds and the plants we want to grow that our little seedlings don't have any

26
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:54,160
don't get to the light and so we clear the weeds so the plants that we want to grow can grow and

27
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:00,080
develop and so we have you know some of us have some weeds in our mind

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:05,360
that interfere with the growth of these beautiful plants we have

29
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:11,599
and so the idea of getting out of the way and allowing something to grow make

30
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:18,159
space for something just that very idea of okay let go of my thoughts

31
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:24,640
let go of my preoccupations and offer a kind of open awareness a kind of

32
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:30,480
uh clear attention to what's here in which there's almost like space

33
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:37,440
there's almost like silence or stillness or spaciousness in which there's space for something

34
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:43,920
that's new something healthy that can grow and

35
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:51,760
and sometimes what needs to grow first is the weeds so we can really see them and um and then can

36
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:58,959
work with them and find a way with them but really they do have something growing

37
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:15,360
so um so so taking a meditation posture

38
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,840
and

39
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:28,320
and it's a posture ideally that you have some sense an idea that allows for

40
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,440
space for something to grow so some people find that taking a

41
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,520
posture that has some confidence and

42
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:47,759
openness and presence real sense of presence it's in the presence that

43
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,199
something healthy can grow

44
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,840
softly close your eyes

45
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:11,840
and become aware of your breathing very simply calmly

46
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:18,560
become aware of breathing the body breathing

47
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,840
maybe even becoming aware sweetly

48
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:31,120
gently quietly aware of breathing

49
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,840
as if breathing is a

50
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,840
maybe a gentle being gentle place that you want to approach in a gentle

51
00:05:50,840 --> 00:06:06,560
way with awareness

52
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,840
and maybe the idea is to approach yourself gently

53
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,400
sweetly and as you exhale

54
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:26,080
to gently relax parts of your body gently means not forcefully not with

55
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:34,080
high expectations just enough

56
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:49,840
relaxing the muscles of the face

57
00:06:52,240 --> 00:07:02,000
relaxing the shoulders in the relaxation

58
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,720
there's more room in your body for something to grow

59
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:17,840
there's space tension limits the space for things to grow

60
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:30,080
and softening the belly

61
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:38,720
soft belly is like a field that's been well tilled and soft and rich with

62
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:59,840
a mess with compost

63
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,280
and then gently

64
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:17,918
quieting the mind the thinking mind gentling the thinking mind

65
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:27,599
to begin the process of making more mental space

66
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,720
for something to grow

67
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:46,080
if we are preoccupied in ill will or resentment or

68
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,959
strong desires it's sometimes likened to an

69
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:00,720
infertile field in which nothing can

70
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
grow

71
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:18,160
letting go of your thoughts with the idea that you are getting out

72
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:26,320
of the way or making space for something to unfold and show itself

73
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:33,360
and grow maybe something you can't know ahead of time

74
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,560
without expectations of what will grow

75
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:50,240
letting go of thoughts preoccupations opening to your body breathing

76
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,200
as if you're giving open clear space

77
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:05,839
for the wholesome within you to grow

78
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,839
letting go of thoughts

79
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:26,079
centering yourself in your body in the body that's breathing

80
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,600
the more aware you are of your body

81
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,760
the more the wholesome has a chance to

82
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,839
grow

83
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:40,000
as we come to the end of this sitting

84
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,600
i'll point out that there are some

85
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:56,320
expressions of ways of living that open

86
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:01,278
us up in some that close us

87
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:09,279
when there is friendliness it tends to be an opening of the heart opening of

88
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:16,840
ourselves to someone else when there's animosity there's a closing

89
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:24,080
barrier when there's love tends to be opening

90
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:30,840
hate is closing as we come to the end of a sitting and

91
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,200
whenever a buddhist practice session is over

92
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:47,279
there's the practice of doing something which is opening partly to allow what's

93
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:55,120
within us to continue to grow and flourish to give expression to what is the good

94
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:03,279
in us and also to express our care for the

95
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:08,400
world and that is called the dedication of

96
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:14,880
merit and here on this morning this day of

97
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:23,039
meditation may we offer up

98
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:29,840
through generosity and love and kindness

99
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:42,720
whatever benefit that we received from this practice today may we share that benefit with others

100
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:47,760
may we share it in a way that continues to make room and space

101
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:57,840
for the wholesome to grow in us

102
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:07,759
may the benefits of this practice that we do be expressed in the wish and the actions

103
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:18,640
that promote the welfare and happiness of all beings may all beings be happy

104
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:26,720
may all beings be safe

105
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:33,840
may all beings be peaceful

106
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,840
and may all beings be free

107
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:09,600
so continue our discussion about the wholesome and the skillful

108
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:16,880
and one of the definitions of what is kusala wholesaler wholesome or skillful is that

109
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,840
which um

110
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:29,200
results in happiness and is non-afflictive so the idea that it

111
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:34,960
doesn't cause harm doesn't hurt us in any kind of way that's one of the requirements what's

112
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:41,200
wholesome and it brings happiness and

113
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:48,159
the word is results in happiness and so meaning that there's a movement

114
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:53,919
towards greater well-being greater happiness that's that's part of what wholesome is

115
00:27:53,919 --> 00:28:00,640
but wholesome is also considered to be beneficial or healthy

116
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,399
or good in and of itself so it's both good in itself and it has a further on

117
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:13,039
the onward leading towards happiness because sometimes we the wholesome's not automatically happy

118
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:19,279
we're practicing and making space and allowing for the growth of that over time and we want to create a stable strong

119
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:24,559
foundation for happiness so we're not so dependent on the

120
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:30,159
changing nature of our experience our life circumstances are also the changing

121
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:35,520
experience changing nature of our physiology and our and you know our

122
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:43,760
hormones and our tiredness and how much food we've eaten and all kinds of other things that can affect our mood to have some kind of

123
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:49,760
stability there because of the strength of these good qualities that have been developed in us

124
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,200
over time and uh when i first came to buddhism

125
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,960
the in zen practice there was very little discussion about

126
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:08,799
that we're actually maturing and developing and growing through the practice because there was a a

127
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:15,919
very strong tendency to point towards what was considered the absolute what's ultimately true

128
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:22,880
um so for example emptiness to really see into the nature of emptiness or or to see into the nature of

129
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:28,000
enlightenment here and now and and uh experience some kind of non-dual

130
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:36,080
state that and as soon as we talk about growth then we're into a duality do do list dualism or we're into uh gaining

131
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:41,440
ideas or we're into kind of missing the boat of really being here and discovering freedom right here

132
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:47,440
and now and there's some real wisdom to that kind of kind of direct

133
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,399
pointing to some kind of awakening or state of being but it also can really miss or

134
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:02,159
shortchange a hugely important natural part of the human being and that is human beings whether they

135
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:07,760
want to or not are constantly changing and growing and developing

136
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:14,240
sometimes what's growing and developing is not healthy so if someone has a habit of complaining

137
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:22,640
or being angry or irritated if they do that a lot that's what grows inside if

138
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:27,840
and so there's all this kind of unhealthy stuff that can grow by the repeated doing of it

139
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:34,320
and and if we keep making space for what's good then something will

140
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:39,360
different will happen and come up and so even if we do this non-dual to

141
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,520
directly pointing to reality the whole system that we're in the psychophysical system

142
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:51,520
will begin shifting and changing as a result of that and it's possible to track that and see

143
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:56,799
how people change and develop over time and

144
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:02,720
it's also possible to support that growth and development and

145
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:08,559
move it along when i was uh doing zen practice at some point in the

146
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:14,399
monastery i was made the gardener and and i would go around and

147
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:20,159
part of the job was to weed and uh that was the instructions it was to weed

148
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:30,640
and let plants grow and at some point i wondered whether wasn't it okay also to weed the weeds of the mind

149
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:37,120
weeding the mind did was that some kind of dualist dualism was some kind of

150
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,799
gaining idea was some kind of conceit or missing the boat that we would notice

151
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:48,240
there's weeds in the mind and i didn't see there was any reason to see that my mind is any different in the

152
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:54,880
garden in the garden i took care of weeds why not take care of the weeds of the mind as well when i was angry or greedy

153
00:31:54,880 --> 00:32:00,240
or something and so um but as we kind of uh

154
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:06,640
make space and take the weeds out it makes room for something else to grow and develop

155
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:14,080
and this so you find the teachings of the buddha a great emphasis on this developing of growth and uh

156
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,519
and i can't under uh uh value it and i can't can't emphasize it

157
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:25,039
enough that it creates a really good strong strength or foundation

158
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:31,840
that carries a stable into all kinds of challenges of our life and

159
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:37,600
known people who've relied on having kind of shortcuts to kind of mystical

160
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,440
experiences or great states of consciousness or even it's kind of what felt like states of freedom

161
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:50,000
but they didn't really have this inner strength to hold that and to rest in that and to receive it

162
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:55,919
and be influenced by it and they would succumb back to the usual old habits which are

163
00:32:55,919 --> 00:33:01,200
not so healthy and then they would swing between these great states and then

164
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:07,279
and then um you know go back to where they were so for the buddha the idea is to develop

165
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,799
and cultivate these inner capacities so that we can hold some of the higher

166
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:17,919
experiences of realization of freedom that come with practice

167
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:24,720
and if the idea of these higher states of attainment or freedom is not so interesting for you

168
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:29,919
the it's also that as we become stronger develop these healthy qualities

169
00:33:29,919 --> 00:33:38,000
we also able to hold basic human experiences of love better and our love is so much

170
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:44,080
healthier and stable and and um non not so fragile when the all these

171
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:49,440
other wholesome qualities have developed and grown in us

172
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:56,799
um so the buddha said abandon what is unwholesome so that just means

173
00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:04,399
you know weed the mind of the weeds the things that are not helpful and also what's unwholesome is what is

174
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:11,040
afflictive and which leads to the opposite of suffering opposite of of happiness it leads to

175
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:16,800
suffering so abandon what is unwholesome and devote yourself

176
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:23,839
to wholesome to wholesome conduct this particular quotation so

177
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:32,839
to actively behave in ways which are beneficial skillful wholesome for that is how you will grow

178
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:39,118
increase and come to fulfillment in this dharma that the buddha was

179
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:46,878
teaching so part of what we're doing is living behavioral changes so not just changing

180
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:53,760
the what we do you know quality of our inner attitudes and hearts but actually making choices for how to

181
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,040
behave differently and to choose those behaviors which are wholesome

182
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:04,160
beneficial and so yesterday i read the 10 skillful actions

183
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:09,440
which are 10 wholesome things to do that helps this inner growth and

184
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,319
development happen

185
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:20,880
so one of the meanings of translations of

186
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:27,760
kusula is as skillful and and that has a wonderful benefit to

187
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:32,960
translate a skillful because it um um

188
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:39,920
it doesn't it tends a lot less to have it tends not to have so much of a moral moralistic kind of weight to it that

189
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:45,599
even wholesome can seem moralistic and some people are a little oppressed or it's heavy kind of

190
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:52,960
uh to kind of even to get close to that kind of language but skillful is kind of free of that

191
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:58,880
and um and then you ask skillful for what skillful for cultivating the path of liberation

192
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:04,480
skillful for developing you know all kinds of wonderful things we can develop including

193
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,680
skillful in developing the practice and and skill developing a skill

194
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:20,000
is done by repeated engagement over and over and over again and a lot of small movements sometimes

195
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,280
to learn a skill and uh and so one of the skills that i've

196
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:32,800
learned in the last three months and i'm surprised you know how i'm still learning

197
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:37,839
the art of it it seems like it's very very simple and i thought it was much simpler than it is but

198
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:43,359
i'm learning these very subtle distinctions that makes me more and more skillful and

199
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:49,119
the actually the word skill in english comes from a germanic word

200
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:56,320
in norwegian at least it's the word schiller and it means to

201
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:03,040
distinguish or separate out and that's the original kind of germanic source of the word to make distinctions

202
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,520
to separate out and so i'm making this skill i'm learning finer and finer little skills to make it easier and easier

203
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:15,599
and that is my right eye now i wear a contact and for these last few

204
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,520
months and putting that contact in i'm getting better and better at and sometimes it

205
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:29,200
was a real challenge i could it would fall out it wouldn't get in right i didn't couldn't quite sometimes get it to work

206
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:34,400
and and then and then over these months doing a day after day after day and

207
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,920
paying attention to what i'm doing paying attention to exactly the position of the fingers where the contact fits in

208
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:45,520
my fingers all these little details and i'm getting better and better and and it was surprisingly now

209
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:52,000
it's just like so easy when it's when it's done right it's like it's just like so

210
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:58,960
it's like such a beautiful smooth easy kind of graceful kind of it just kind of just

211
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:04,000
slides right up on the eye just sits there with no effort on my part it's just like almost like

212
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:10,320
it wants to be there and sit there on the on the eyeball and um so you know i'm

213
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:15,440
still learning skills in my old age right so that's a wonderful skill i'm learning

214
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,680
but these subtle little distinctions same thing happens in doing buddhist practice we're learning these subtle subtle

215
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:27,119
distinctions in our posture and how to sit and we develop our meditation posture

216
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:32,720
it's more more skillful or wholesome or beneficial we're developing all these little skills

217
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:38,400
and how to be with a breath and how to pay attention to the breath um we're learning all the little

218
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:44,480
movements of the mind slowly slowly incrementally we learn what it's like to be mindful what it's

219
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,520
like to let go what it's like to where to focus and how to focus and and

220
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:56,400
uh how to concentrate and how to be equanimists and how to um you know what kind of effort to make

221
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:02,320
an energy to make just the right amount of effort not too much and too little and this is

222
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:08,960
partly learned not because you read a book and say this is the formula what you do but rather it's

223
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,160
um it's through engagement over and over and over again

224
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:20,079
like a swimmer whose athlete who's swimming training for competitive

225
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:27,040
racing they learn ever ever refined distinctions and how they move their arm

226
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:33,200
in the water to make the least resistance get the most uh push off the water so the same thing

227
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:38,640
in meditation we learn the body the system even unconsciously there's this growth and development of

228
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,400
skills and so when we talk about meditation practice rather than how we live in our

229
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:49,520
interpersonal lives uh the word kusala is sometimes better translated as

230
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:55,520
skill and we're doing what's skillful we're developing certain kinds of skills

231
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:01,359
and the the metaphor the buddha uses for uh uses metaphors that are clearly

232
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:07,760
having to do with skills that people develop so developing the five faculties

233
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:16,319
which was the theme for the first five weeks of these youtube 7 a.m teachings i did starting last

234
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:24,800
march the metaphor used for the five faculties was tuning and playing a loot

235
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:30,240
and a five string loot and you know you want to you get you you learn how to tune it better and

236
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:35,920
better you learn how to play it better and better and so we're learning these five strings inside of us

237
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:42,960
and slowly we learn to tune them and play them for mindfulness practice the metaphor

238
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,480
there is also developing a skill and that is learning to cook and

239
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:54,720
and cooking also is a skill that's learned over time and and the more we cook a dish the simpler

240
00:40:54,720 --> 00:41:01,119
straightforward easier more creative we can get and we develop a skill that we were awkward when we first began with

241
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,960
the recipe and kind of trying to put it all together and figure out how it all worked

242
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:16,160
so a skilled meditator skilled mindfulness practitioner is like a skilled cook according to the buddha and

243
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:24,160
and so this idea of developing a skill and so a skill grows through time

244
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:29,680
and as certain skills develop they make room for other good qualities to develop and grow

245
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:35,839
as well and so the theme for today is idea of

246
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:42,880
growth of kind of inner growth of our good qualities our abilities

247
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:49,920
our mental capacities our mental attitudes a growth in what's beneficial

248
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:55,680
that is little bit different than making something happen but allowing for this natural process of

249
00:41:55,680 --> 00:42:02,560
growing that is slow comes repetition over over and over again doing the same thing

250
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,480
over and over again doing kindness over and over again friendliness generosity over and over again

251
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:16,319
we're developing a skill and making finer finer distinction in all kinds of ways that benefit us and hopefully benefit

252
00:42:16,319 --> 00:42:22,000
others and uh in such a way that over time something's growing and

253
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:29,119
thriving there's an abundance there's a there's a filling out of something really

254
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:34,560
marvelous within us um and um

255
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:41,040
and so to make room for that to recognize that that's part of what we're doing here so we have the

256
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:46,400
patience to continue and keep going

257
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:51,920
and also the ability to recognize that it's not just about experiencing

258
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:58,319
emptiness or strong states of concentration there's all these things we're cultivating and developing and become

259
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:03,920
skilled for that will support us so i'll talk more about some of the wholesome

260
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:11,520
skills that are developed in the next couple of days next few days so thank you very much may

261
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:17,920
may you study reflect on ways that you have grown in whole

262
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,280
wholesome qualities how over the last five years 10 years 20 years

263

265
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:41,838
