00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:05,878
hello everyone and

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:14,440
welcome one of the ways that uh practice and even

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:21,240
Enlightenment is talked about in the ancient texts is that um is through the

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:27,400
language of touch We Touch Awakening with our

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:34,160
body and uh and there's something that's very special about human

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:41,079
touch uh so can it can express many things of course hostility certain kind

7
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:47,079
of way of touching others but there's a way of touching that uh is

8
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:53,559
friendly reassuring uh gently touching someone on

9
00:00:53,559 --> 00:01:00,039
their shoulder to say I'm here with you uh we might hold someone's hand

10
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:06,200
touch as I did when my mother was dying I was holding her hand the

11
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:14,720
um uh a newborn mayy allow babies Thrive with touch and are

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,479
reassured and um and so this the possibility of

13
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,079
expressing friendliness kindness love is done can be done through

14
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:32,479
touch and um and then I think of uh the

15
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:39,040
Greek myth of uh King Midas Midas Touch everything he touched tur into

16
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,680
gold it's possible through this practice of ours

17
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,719
to not hold ourselves removed from our experience not to be up in the head the

18
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:56,399
control tower looking down and from a distance kind of analyzing thinking

19
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:02,280
about our experience it's possible to have awareness

20
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:11,560
attention touch everything and as we touch everything turn everything into meta

21
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:19,560
everything into love everything into compassion whatever

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,080
the the circumstances call for in the moment but this idea of coming close to

23
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:31,280
touch with kindness may be

24
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:36,440
the control tower is feeling sad or angry

25
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,159
upset afraid

26
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:49,280
distracted but when we approach something with attention approach our breathing

27
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:55,680
approach approach the sensations of our body approach how we feel emotionally

28
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:03,519
through how they're experienced in the body if we approach with

29
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,239
mindfulness the process of thinking not about the content of our thought but the

30
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:19,440
the process the activation the the energy the agitation the tension

31
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:24,840
that's involved in thinking the physicality of it and all these things

32
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:30,799
we approach and we can touch touch in the body and touch with me down touch

33
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:37,439
with love to have not the mest touch turning things

34
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:43,200
into gold but the meta touch turning everything

35
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,640
into um our friend our beloved

36
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,079
our what we care for to touch so for this meditation today maybe

37
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:03,319
this idea that mindfulness is a form of touching touching the physicality of

38
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:10,760
every everything that we experience directly has some way in which is

39
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:15,079
occurring through the medium of our

40
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:22,120
body and uh and what is it in the body we when we're mindful we can

41
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:28,560
touch to recognize it's there to say here I'm here I'm here with you here to

42
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,479
support you here to be be your friend your

43
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:42,960
companion to care so to assume a upright meditation

44
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:48,600
well to assume an alert meditation posture whatever posture that might be

45
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:54,199
for you and

46
00:04:55,560 --> 00:05:01,639
um and perhaps it's a posture of care

47
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:08,880
in being alert having a certain kind of Vitality in your

48
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,039
posture and in that Vitality be a form of

49
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:27,400
care if you need to rest deeply certainly take a posture of rest

50
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,680
but have within it somewh or other some place in the body is also

51
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:40,560
alert adjusting the head the back of the neck maybe

52
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:47,880
straightens a little bit the midd between the shoulder blades

53
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,960
the spine pulls in a little bit so that the

54
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:58,680
chest comes out just a little bit more open

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,319
and lowering the Gaze gently closing the

56
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:25,400
eyes the body's experience of breathing is a physical experience of

57
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:32,720
movement of pressure release of pressure expansion and

58
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:41,639
contraction as you feel the sensations of the body

59
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,800
breathing Let each Sensation that passes

60
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:59,198
through be the meeting place of your touch and your body the touch of awareness

61
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:16,478
as a way of caring for yourself gently ever so

62
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:25,360
tenderly take some deeper breaths Fuller breaths just so it's right for

63
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,520
you and longer exhale

64
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:38,120
caring for yourself as you

65
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:46,479
release the air from your lungs settling as you exhale

66
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,759
letting your breathing return to

67
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:25,360
normal and feeling if possible is there some place within

68
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:33,599
you where there's tenderness the kind of tenderness or

69
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:43,399
softness that's associated with t kind of a soft or Tender Love or

70
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:50,279
Compassion Care a gentle gentle

71
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:55,680

72
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,959
open-heartedness is available

73
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,560
and is it as if mindfulness

74
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:25,720
tension is at home in this place of

75
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:31,640
tenderness as you're aware of breathing body emotions

76
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:36,560
thinking sounds whatever might

77
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:43,760
be feel the place of touch feel the place

possibility thank

141
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
you e

142
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:24,039
so hello everyone and welcome to this fourth talk on uh the five core principles or

143
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:29,360
foundations for my teachings my the way I offer

144
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:36,880
Buddhist teachings and um so today

145
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:43,440
the what I'd like to talk about is the social emotions

146
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:50,960
of uh love as an umbrella term for all of them but certainly friendliness and

147
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:59,080
kindness goodwi compassion sympathy empathy

148
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:11,398
appreciation appreciative Joy empathic Joy sharing joy and the joy of

149
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:16,799
others and um and a profound form of

150
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:23,200
equinity of Peace of nonassertive

151
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:32,000
non wavering love in the face of challenges in the face of of of of

152
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,880
um our inability to make a difference for people we still have some kind of

153
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:42,760
our love is still unshakable

154
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:49,440
equanimous so I talked earlier in the week that um

155
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:56,559
one of the foundations of that I really appreciate for Buddhism and is the idea

156
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:04,200
of not having any fixed views not having any ultimate philosophy or ultimate this

157
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:10,000
is what's ultimate but rather uh a uh not having

158
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:16,519
that not not experiencing the world through the filter of our philosophies

159
00:32:16,519 --> 00:32:23,039
Our World Views our cultural views our philosophical and religious

160
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:28,519
views but actually shedding those as if they're kind of a filter through which

161
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:36,679
we experience the world and the reason why I feel so much so confident in that is uh for what I

162
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:43,360
talked about yesterday the naturalistic orientation to this practice that we do

163
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:49,559
that we have a profound wonderful deep capacities that

164
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:56,559
are often overlooked submerged uh in the hustle and bustle of Life the challenges of life the

165
00:32:56,559 --> 00:33:02,480
sufferings the pains the betrayals we have the busyness of trying to

166
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:11,559
survive but if we can uh uh somehow um put all those down and put

167
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:18,519
down our views our opinions our stories that we uh are living in all the time

168
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:26,200
then um the um it allows that that something deep naturalistic movement this deep

169
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:32,840
natural movement of of um of that is buried deep inside of us I don't know if

170
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:38,960
buried is the right word but um functions best when we're relaxed when

171
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:45,639
we're at ease when we do feel safe that then we're more likely to welcome the

172
00:33:45,639 --> 00:33:52,200
stranger as they come by an Ancient Ancient uh tradition of welcoming The

173
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:58,960
Stranger not shunning them or being afraid of them doesn't necessarily mean that we welcome them into our home if

174
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:05,600
that's not appropriate but uh maybe we give them um support and maybe you show

175
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,720
them the way to where they're going but this idea of welcoming The

176
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:19,560
Stranger welcoming the friend welcoming those we know welcome everyone comes

177
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:25,638
well into our tenderness our love our capacity for

178
00:34:25,639 --> 00:34:31,839
friendliness and um when when we're caught in views caught in opinions caught in

179
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,200
stories um including stories uh and Views about who I am and who I have to

180
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:44,118
be and what I who my identity I have to defend that I've created uh sometimes that interferes

181
00:34:44,119 --> 00:34:51,679
with our capacity to uh feel and sense and and respond from some deep place

182
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,200
inside someplace that's resilient some place that is um uh clear enough

183
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:03,720
to not be caught in even insults even um

184
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:10,800
uh criticism uh we don't cover it we don't we don't lose touch with this

185
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:18,960
resilient place that is not actually um troubled by the challenges in our life

186
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:26,880
it's it's uh it's free of needing to be caught and influenced and and and uh

187
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:35,280
doesn't react to things and so this fantastic capacity we have for love for

188
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:41,520
care for kindness and um

189
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:50,319
and uh the way that I came across this in this practice uh discovering the

190
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:56,839
tremendous wonderfulness the wonderfulness of compassion the wonderfulness of mea of kindness and

191
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,960
friendliness the wonderfulness of of a very simple uh care and benevolence that

192
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:09,359
we can carry with us is not because I was told I should or I felt like I

193
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:17,760
should that I should engineer it that I should Pump It Up and really try to as a duty be friendly and kind but rather it

194
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:24,240
was a byproduct of doing the meditation practice that I did first Zen practice

195
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:30,079
then mindfulness practice that something settled something relaxed something

196
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:37,560
showed up something became alive from deep inside and in that living sense of depth

197
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:45,680
within there was um the the uh the crust around my heart softened and fell fell

198
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:51,280
away and that's the way it felt when I was doing Zen practice that all this crustiness all this defensiveness all

199
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:58,599
this hardness around my heart uh softened and softened and chipped away and fell away until the heart was soft

200
00:36:58,599 --> 00:37:04,040
enough and tender enough uh that when I I could feel the suffering of the World

201
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:12,000
Around Me Without Fear without reaction without um uh a burden without being

202
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:17,960
oppressed by it or dismayed by it and there was this beautiful feeling of

203
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:23,520
compassion I think healthy compassion no matter how uncomfortable

204
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:29,560
it is to feel suffering of the world healthy compassion has it a beauty to it

205
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:36,040
and uh it's hard to imagine for some people that compassion can be beautiful when there's so much ugliness in the

206
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:41,680
suffering of the world but it is possible and it arises from this depth

207
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,640
it's not something that has to be done and with uh with the mindfulness

208
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:56,119
practice I discover the same thing with friendliness with kindness with meta that um as things cleared away as I was

209
00:37:56,119 --> 00:38:03,520
felt quite settled and at ease and happy just to be alive that uh then there was

210
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:10,800
this welling up of this natural capacity for friendliness for love for

211
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,599
kindness that um was not I wouldn't characterize it as beautiful the way I

212
00:38:16,599 --> 00:38:26,440
did for for compassion but it uh was sweet it was joyful it uh if it was a um

213
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:32,440
adjective I would call it a smile smilingly or smile smiling

214
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:41,079
smilingly um and um and then as uh my my deep my practice

215
00:38:41,079 --> 00:38:46,680
deepened and it wasn't so much uh uh uh

216
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:51,800
compassion that was the Forefront or love that was a Forefront but there was

217
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:57,960
some there was a greater and greater U freedom from any kind of attachment and

218
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,920
that kind of not covering over not interfering with life through the attachments the bondage the clinging

219
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:11,839
that I had the Cravings that i' had before I was surprised by

220
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:20,560
U by um a very tender a very satisfying form of

221
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:28,400
care a care that was peaceful a care that uh was not reactive was not

222
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:34,599
um wouldn't succumb to distress or to anger or to

223
00:39:34,599 --> 00:39:41,920
hostility or to fear very simple and ordinary care appreciation valuing of

224
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:49,560
things and these things that for me arose from uh something deep inside that was

225
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:55,680
being freed uh when there was no overlay no nothing would

226
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:04,400
interfere and uh it's kind of like a flower which when the conditions are right um blossoms and so when the

227
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:10,599
conditions are right uh this capacity for our social emotions can blossom not

228
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:15,680
because it's a should but because it's the natural tendency when the conditions

229
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:24,680
are right and Buddhist practice I'm sure other spiritual practices as well um uh

230
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:31,200
they um uh

231
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:38,359
um are what helps us get out of our own way get out of the way for something

232
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:45,240
profound within that we can trust that um is not even personal so

233
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:51,079
it's not directly tied to all the ways we think about me myself and mine which

234
00:40:51,079 --> 00:40:57,359
are primarily more views and uh and so to feel the freedom

235
00:40:57,359 --> 00:41:03,560
and the joy and the delight and the freedom of a tender heart of a loving

236
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:10,560
heart a Caring Heart this is the this is the um byproduct or the

237
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:19,359
consequence of a path of freedom and um and

238
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:27,920
uh so for me this is foundational to myself as a human being that the com

239
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:33,280
first it was compassion uh then it was augmented by

240
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:39,720
meta and friendliness it was augmented by this sense of care under Kaa that

241
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:45,480
um I feel like this is in some ways one of the primary organizing principles

242
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:50,880
that motivates My Life um certainly the end of suffering

243
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:56,520
uh caring for suffering but that caring for suffering now comes out of this uh

244
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:03,720
same place of care of compassion that uh this tender heart that

245
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:09,400
um this seems like be the it's for me it's the most important thing in life is

246
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:15,599
uh caring in all directions compassion in all directions love in all directions

247
00:42:15,599 --> 00:42:20,640
and to the best of my ability um I have

248
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,760
uh organized or guided my life uh with

249
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:34,440
uh around this with around this um the motivation of it comes from

250
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:40,720
compassion and love so um so as a teacher and and

251
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:46,079
offering these teachings this is what drives it what what animates it this is

252
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:54,200
what gives it life so thank you very much and

253
00:42:54,200 --> 00:43:02,119
um and I look forward to this F talk in tomorrow in this series
