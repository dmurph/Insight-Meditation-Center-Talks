101
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:38,600
IMC beginning these YouTube sits back at the very beginning of um the co shelter

102
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:44,960
in place here in California in the US helped out a little bit here and

103
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,519

part of this online Global sa so it's a delight to be with you

105
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:06,120
and today introduce again the topic for the week for those of you who tiptoed in

106
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:14,519
late into the YouTube sit and um the week's theme is on inner and

107
00:32:14,519 --> 00:32:23,200
interpersonal sources of Dharma wellbeing Dharma well-being and these

108
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:29,960
are on cultivating qualities helpful for internal and interpersonal

109
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:37,799
flourishing and I'll start with the theme a little bit for the week by telling a very condensed story so if you

110
00:32:37,799 --> 00:32:44,039
can picture in Ancient India the time of the Buddha the Buddha is sitting around with a group of his

111
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:50,320
practitioners probably monks and I picture it being kind of dusk evening maybe they've got a fire

112
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:56,279
going it's kind of cozy and he's telling this ancient story

113
00:32:56,279 --> 00:33:03,320
of a series of Kings and how through a series of mishaps with

114
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:09,600
the eighth in this line of seven amazing Kings Society began to have

115
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:15,120
difficulties a lot of bad things happened and there began to be societal

116
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:20,320
tensions and Division and eventually um kind of a

117
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,760
breakdown and then he talks about how through developing these inner qualities

118
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,279
especially ethic qualities Society regenerated

119
00:33:32,279 --> 00:33:39,600
itself and then he finishes the story by encouraging everyone to develop

120
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,480
beautiful qualities and relationship to themselves and each other and he talks

121
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:51,440
about five kinds of well-being practitioners in particular can

122
00:33:51,440 --> 00:34:00,399
develop even in difficult times and they are Spirit virual power or

123
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,960
empowerment true beauty

124
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:12,760
happiness heart wealth and freedom and I'll unpack each of these

125
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:20,358
over the course of this week but the theme this morning or whatever time of day it is for you is spiritual

126
00:34:20,359 --> 00:34:26,878
empowerment or spiritual power and I'm going to talk through four

127
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:36,240
areas of this but first I just want to say they're all kind of held by supported by joyful enthusiastic

128
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,838
engagement with practice and a sense of immersion as best you can in the

129
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:51,440
moment so the first of these is healthy

130
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:57,240
desire healthy desire and in spiritual circles and in

131
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:02,760
meditation practice desire often gets a bad WRA and sometimes for Justified

132
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,440
reasons there can be desire for unhealthful even unhealthy distracting

133
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:15,520
things or even being overly fixated on a good goal a healthy

134
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:21,400
goal both of those can kind of run counter to meditative Spiritual

135
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:27,240
Development but Chanda the word for desire in the ancient language of p is

136
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:37,040
actually neutral and there's something known as danda desire for the Dharma a wholesome

137
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:44,119
practice process of being in love with the practice of meditation it's considered to be

138
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,440
skillful at many stages of development and

139
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:57,680
um it's has these qualities of being kind of expansive or um open rather than

140
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:07,319
obsessive and constricted it's the difference between this grasping hand or the Fist and an open hand an open hand

141
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:13,040
holding things lightly in relationship with others this

142
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:19,720
kind of holding things lightly manifests as a wish Desiring the

143
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:25,240
best for them and oneself in the

144
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:31,720
relationship of both it's bringing out the best

145
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:37,720
so this kind of empowerment I want to empower you to be in love with

146
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:44,599
meditation to desire what is in the moment and to be present with it

147
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:51,119
completely this second area of spiritual empowerment or second road to power as

148
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:57,079
there sometimes called is a sense of balanced energy and vitality balanced

149
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:02,560
effort Viria in the poly and this has a range

150
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:09,280
of intensity from heroic effort really strenuous effort like hiking up a big

151
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:16,000
hill or very kind of soft gentle persistence when you're walking down a

152
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,040
gentle slope maybe a great View and it's helpful to balance adapt

153
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:28,240
the amount of energy Life Energy and effort we bring to a meditation session

154
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:34,520
or situation the Buddha likened this to tuning a stringed

155
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:42,119
instrument and many years ago I lived in San Francisco and I cohabitated at the time with this beautiful baby grand

156
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:48,200
piano and we had to have tuners come kind of regularly because the tuning of

157
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:55,599
the strings changed with the weather they it changed with the seasons the conditions changed and the

158
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:01,440
totness and the strings needed to be adapted and it's just like that for us

159
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:08,078
in meditation conditions change and we attune a little bit

160
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:17,319
differently the next one here is to be aware of the overall State of

161
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:23,680
Mind the intentness or the distraction of our minds the chitta it's

162
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:29,599
called or chitt some people pronounce it the objective

163
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:35,200
experience of mood of being of concentration or

164
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:43,720
distraction it's like the overall weather report the overall landscape or Ambient sound around us it's the just

165
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:50,920
adal the whole and the instruction isn't to make

166
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:56,119
it be different instead it's to notice and

167
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:01,960
appreciate when helpful overall qualities of Mind are there or can be

168
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:07,440
invited especially to appreciate relaxed

169
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:15,680
intentness this kind of slow steady interest willpower that can be there and be kind

170
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:21,240
to any state of mind it's a huge

171
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:28,079
benefit and then this fourth area of empowerment is interest and experience

172
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,359
fermentation napali word for this is

173
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:38,880
viaa and it's kind of like being a naturalist for your internal

174
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:45,599
ecology internal Ecology of the body heart and mind I told this story at

175
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:51,800
Insight Santa Cruz recently of walking along a forest path and turning a bend

176
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,040
and it's like this kind of remote area beautiful Park area and the friend who

177
00:39:57,040 --> 00:40:03,280
Des Des cribes this story was walking and when she turned this Bend she encountered this young man just

178
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:10,319
completely bellied down across the path intently studying a little plant and she

179
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:17,280
said hi and he looked up at her and his smile just lit up his face lit up the

180
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:22,920
interaction he was a Bist and he was completely jazzed about finding the

181
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:29,640
details the little foliage differences and textures of of this plant in the

182
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:37,200
wild and it's that kind of just delighted

183
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:42,319
interest that it's helpful to bring to the details of

184
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:47,760
meditation like the breath like the like the

185
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:54,640
sensations like the mood itself like how the meditation is Flowing or

186
00:40:54,640 --> 00:41:02,560
not to notice get interested in the object of attention it's

187
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:09,720
called and there can be kind of an art a science to it in the sense of experimentation

188
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:17,800
too noticing inputs and outputs noticing oh I do this and that happens or this

189
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:24,319
arises and then that one away it's kind of like a young kid learning to paint

190
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:29,560
maybe in kindergarten or something and I put these together they do this and when I add

191
00:41:29,560 --> 00:41:37,119
that one it makes brown oh interesting or like a sailor when I

192
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:47,160
adjust the sail this way the boat does this when I adjust it that way it moves

193
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:52,960
core it's this process of adjusting core

194
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,200
shifting responding being responsive and a stepping back from time to time just

195
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,400
like a painter to see the overall

196
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:14,200
picture this interest experimentation this caring interest is helpful in a

197
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:20,559
meditation session and it can be helpful in interactions like how many times have

198
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:27,680
we walked by a neighbor or the postman and said hey how's it going but not really engaged just being polite or

199
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:33,920
casually friendly and that's fine but then showing up with real interest and

200
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:42,640
maybe stopping in the sunshine or the wind and having a deeper conversation with that

201
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:48,480
person the difference is the level of interest and sometimes that mutual

202
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:53,880
interest can connect and it's just like watering a

203
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:59,119
plant the relationship grows it begins to flourish

204
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:05,960
[Music] so this is a tiny introduction very

205
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:12,319
short introduction to the Buddha's teachings on spiritual empowerment

206
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:17,760

207
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:24,480

208
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,920
