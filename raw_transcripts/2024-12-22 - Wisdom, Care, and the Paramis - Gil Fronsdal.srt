1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:06,160
so good morning and

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:14,040
um so for this talk I want to start in a different way I would like to partly for

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:20,160
to make a point better maybe to do a little ritual with you uh some of you

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,760
who don't like ritual will call it

5
00:00:25,679 --> 00:00:31,840
theater a and for this I need h four volunteers

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:39,040
there are four envelopes here and in each envelope there's a question and so

7
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,879
you would read the question when the time comes so don't open the envelope until it's your

8
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:51,280
time use the mic maybe it's good to use the mic

9
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:59,239
yes and maybe the other mic is there yes

10
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:07,520
so up here in the front because uh what's your name moed mad is number one so each of you have a number so if you

11
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:13,159
once you have the mic Phil if you can bring it to Mad here or there

12
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,640
okay so so now you can open it and ask the

13
00:01:24,759 --> 00:01:31,159
question from where comes love from wisdom

14
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,039
so then number

15
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:48,680
two from where comes wisdom from

16
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:56,960
love number three who has number

17
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,320
three oh so she needs the

18
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:23,040
mic what is love to care

19
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:34,640
what is wisdom to care

20
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:46,560
well so the topic today is wisdom and but wisdom can seem abstract

21
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,720
it can seem heady it could seem like it has nothing to do with

22
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,840
love and um maybe that's the case sometimes but in the teachings of the

23
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:06,120
Buddha there's a distinction that he sometimes makes I don't know if he makes it but it stands out as I read the text

24
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:16,239
between wisdom and being a wise person wisdom can be found in a

25
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,560
book and as long as it stays in the book it doesn't benefit

26
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:27,040
anyone being a wise person is found in

27
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,080
living a life and that's what the Buddha was

28
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:39,799
emphasizing was how we live our life and so the purpose of wisdom is to live

29
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:47,200
wisely and so but what does it mean to live wisely what is this W was wise and

30
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,799
in that little question answer we did I'm uh I'm

31
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:59,959
putting love and wisdom closely together which they often are not

32
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:05,680
and so I want to read a quote of from one of my favorite uh teachings from the

33
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:14,040
Buddha I some of you have heard me do it before because I like it so much and it's uh the Buddha description

34
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,759
or definition of a wise person wise

35
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:26,280
people of great wisdom do not

36
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:33,320
think of harming themselves of harming in others or of harming

37
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:39,080
both rather wise people consider their own

38
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:45,400
welfare the welfare of others the welfare of both and the welfare of the

39
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,720
whole world in this way one is a wise person

40
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:57,680
of great wisdom so here the wisdom that's being emphasized the way of being a wise

41
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,880
person is to have your heart have in your in your field of

42
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:10,360
concern uh the welfare of self the welfare of others the welfare of both

43
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,759
and the welfare of the whole world and uh that means to care to care

44
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:23,000
for the world to care for oneself and how do we care for ourselves

45
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:29,199
well that takes wisdom how do we learn how to care well

46
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:36,680
well that next love because here wisdom is not

47
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:42,600
apart from our relationship to other people sometimes when we focus on

48
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:48,360
Buddhism or the Buddhist teachings and Buddhist practice it can have at times

49
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,840
in appropriate way a kind of a very personal orientation but you said and

50
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,000
close your eyes and meditate and you're kind of like you know tuning the world

51
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:04,160
out and other out and you're quieting your mind so you're not thinking about

52
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:11,000
you know who you're going to give a gift to over the holidays you're just sitting here with your own breathing and the

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,880
kind the stereotypical criticism of people who meditate is that they're just watching their belly

54
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:24,120
button you know it really gets focused and um but um but it's there's a

55
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:31,120
way in which that's appropriate to do that and how it fits into this definition of wise person there's

56
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,919
something profound that can happen when the attention gets

57
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:42,960
organized uh unified collected here in the present moment so

58
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,120
that awakens within us a feeling of holess feeling of wholesome wholeness

59
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:54,720
that can happen a a feeling of sombody that uh is a whole a holistic

60
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,759
state of phenomenal well-being now it's possible to be

61
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,199
focused on that for the purposes of just being your own pleasure or your own

62
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:11,840
relief from the difficulties of life but in the Buddhist teachings this deep

63
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,919
experience of samade of wholeness really kind of going Inward and is to be turned

64
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:23,560
inside out you have to go in but then you get turned inside out so that uh the

65
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:30,319
focus now is uh becomes how do we care how do we meet the the world how do we

66
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:36,440
meet ourselves in a caring way and so the inward Focus that is part of

67
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:42,240
Buddhism uh is not supposed to leave us isolated from the world or not attuned

68
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:49,199
to the world it's meant to do the exact opposite and uh just like if uh you

69
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,680
really want to care for people well and really have have people relax

70
00:07:54,680 --> 00:08:01,840
around you and just really feel like you're accessible and they're happy to sit next to you and be close maybe even

71
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:10,199
happy for you to give them a hug in the right circumstance it would be useful from time to time you really went into very

72
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,919
private into your own privacy away from all people and took a

73
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:26,440
shower so sometimes that's what you know meditation does you're just cleaning

74
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,879
up get getting cleansed on the inside side outs and and then you're ready come

75
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:39,279
out and you know you come out in a whole different way for the world

76
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,479
um so

77
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:57,720
um so the the development of this caring wisdom wise caring is to come to a place

78
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,040
where it's possible to care for the whole world and that

79
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:10,240
includes the people who are our enemies the people whove betrayed us and

80
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:15,920
the people who have offended Us in all kinds of ways that's a tall order that's

81
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:21,000
not easy to do it's easy it's not difficult I mean it's very difficult to

82
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:26,279
deal with one's own hurt one's own pain one's own fear to be able to have it

83
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:32,320
that big and that's one of the purposes of this inward focus is to really

84
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:40,160
address and meet all the barriers all the unresolved ways we are all the wounds we carry so that we can get

85
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:47,240
turned inside out and be able to have care for

86
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:54,720
everyone and maybe in this in this context we don't want we don't need to use the word love that kind of is a for

87
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,040
many people a high bar or it becomes something maybe to

88
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,440
hallm Marky but uh but the care is really much

89
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,440
more humble much more basic and I would say very profound to offer care to care

90
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:17,240
for the whole world no one left

91
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:23,720
out and um so to learn this wisdom to understand

92
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:30,040
this wisdom does not require books book reading

93
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,320
it doesn't require Dharma talk but but stay until the end

94
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:41,880
please uh it it doesn't require exceptional

95
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:49,040
knowledge it doesn't require mystical States or Supernatural

96
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:56,200
experiences and it doesn't involve metaphysical ideas abstract metaphysical

97
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,880
ideas what it involves is it deeper sensitivity in

98
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,000
oneself a deeper sensitivity to

99
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:14,160
wellbeing to where sense of your own welfare is because the more you have a

100
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:21,440
sense of welfare for yourself what brings you own your own goodness the more you two things will happen you'll

101
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,320
appreciate that's possible for other people and you'll have a profound

102
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:35,920
appreciation for uh what it feels like to care for others it feels good it adds

103
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:43,440
to that well-being it can done the right way and so in the some of the path

104
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,279
models of Buddhism like where you begins there's there's a number of different path models that have different

105
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:56,519
Beginnings but one of them um uh called the parames the 10

106
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:03,680
Perfections uh begins with generosity and uh and generosity is

107
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:12,519
relational you you you can be generous to yourself but it's too very easy then to be selfish but it's possible um but

108
00:12:12,519 --> 00:12:21,560
generosity is generally considered to be something we do for others and um for the world and uh and

109
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:28,760
the idea of generosity is it's non-obligatory so it has to be the the

110
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:38,000
source inside from which it comes cannot be logical or reasoned out because then

111
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,639
it's not quite generosity though reason and rationality can have a role and it

112
00:12:43,639 --> 00:12:49,680
certainly as I said can't be obligatory can't be a duty because generosity is this

113
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:55,440
something that's freely given from some uh generative Source inside some feeling

114
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,600
of openness some feeling of delight some feeling of care for the person that you're giving it to you want that

115
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:07,279
thought this person would like it if we have cultivated capacity of mindfulness for

116
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:15,720
ourselves we can feel uh the joy the Delight the the pleasure that this kind

117
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:22,800
of generosity can be if there isn't some kind of pleasure in being generous it probably isn't being generous it has a

118
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:29,480
good feeling this lightning and offering and freeing of something and offering it out

119
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:37,160
then we can feel how we're a better person because of it we can also feel that the joy

120
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:44,040
hopefully that it brings other people and so it can bring us joy and satisfaction the fact that we've you

121
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:50,079
know offered something to someone else and it affects our inter can affect

122
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:57,360
our interpersonal relationships with others it tends to create positive interpersonal Rel relations to be

123
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:03,680
generous chances are it's more likely to create positive personal interpersonal

124
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:10,560
relationships than uh being stingy and uh which doesn't usually held

125
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,839
up for good friendship and uh and so there tends to

126
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:23,040
be a field of mutual appreciation Mutual maybe maybe gratitude maybe even Mutual

127
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:29,639
gratitude uh I felt very grateful sometimes when I've been able to give something to someone because I feel so

128
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,920
lucky it it does me good it's so nice so I want to say thank you to them and um

129
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:44,040
but this gratitude and appreciation and there's something that I learned in Zen that when you give uh you you don't give

130
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:52,079
casually like look the other way and had it to them as nothing even if it's a small thing ITA is that relationship is

131
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:58,759
important the respect is important so you're supposed to in Zen you're supposed to give something with two hands and you're supposed to so it's

132
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:06,440
really like you're you're all of you is present and you're present for the other person that you're giving to and so so

133
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:11,759
because that relationship is important the respect and care is important and so

134
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:18,720
it creates a kind of positivity in the interpersonal sphere some people use

135
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:24,560
generosity maybe maybe it's not generous always but use giving uh as a way of

136
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,800
healing interpersonal relationships that are strained or to shift the Dynamic

137
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:35,880
it's hard to uh you know to be angry at someone or be mean to them at work or

138
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:42,360
something if they given you a gift you know they came with cookies for you or they came and gave you something

139
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:47,560
or or maybe you came out of the parking lot at work and your tire was flat and

140
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:53,920
you didn't know what to do and the Very person you've been meeting with all day long kind of could they came over and

141
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:59,680
said oh I'll help you I know how to do T to change the tires or fix it and and like what

142
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:07,160
next day you know you're not going to probably start you know being mean again not right

143
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:13,399
away so generosity giving is sometimes used to kind of do something good for interpersonal

144
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:22,079
relationships so in terms of wisdom what was very important what I just described was all the good all the

145
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:29,759
good feelings that arose in that act of generosity something so softened inside

146
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:35,639
something warmed inside something uh relaxed maybe something some Joy or

147
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:41,560
Delight or pleasure arose in one way or the other in that act of

148
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:48,240
generosity and it's in the interpersonal relationship and in this path model that's where Buddhism begins if you want

149
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:54,079
to start practicing Buddhism don't start with meditation start with

150
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:59,360
generosity and um and uh so what does that do to you

151
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:06,678
to a person who has that feeling of well-being one one of the things that does to you the person is be become more

152
00:17:06,679 --> 00:17:15,079
sensitive to how that is diminished how that's broken how that is taken away

153
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:20,839
so uh so you you know you feel the goodness of something the generosity and

154
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:27,280
now you have a reference point for how what not to do because that would cause

155
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:34,440
harm you cause harm to yourself by maybe diminishing or breaking the relationship

156
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:40,480
breaking the kind of inspiration that you're coming from the goodness you're coming from that if you felt kind of

157
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:46,559
lousy and miserable and stressed out to begin with um you know it's it does it's

158
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:52,960
like not a big deal to do something with your middle finger like you know that doesn't that

159
00:17:52,960 --> 00:18:00,760
doesn't make anything worse you know so might as well but if you're feeling good and calm

160
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:06,200
and peaceful you can feel that a certain you way of using your middle finger

161
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:12,880
actually diminishes you actually harms you your welfare take something away and

162
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:18,360
so why would you do it so the more you have the sense of well-being the more

163
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:24,919
you recognize and feel that there's the difference between what brings harm and

164
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:31,960
what brings welfare and that is the key key aspect of this wisdom that I'm highlighting

165
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:39,520
today the wisdom to be able to see feel know experientially this brings harm this

166
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,120
brings benefit so then uh so the generosity

167
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:50,679
then sets the stage for that that's part of the function as part of the path

168
00:18:50,679 --> 00:18:57,400
model the second uh step in this path model is generos is U is uh virtuous

169
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:06,760
conduct and virtuous conduct is primarily defined by um in this early tradition uh

170
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:14,400
by um uh restraining yourself from causing harm so you would abstain from

171
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:22,520
killing people or physically harming them you'd abstain from stealing from people you'd

172
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:30,360
abstain from causing harm to people through your sexual behavior and you would avoid

173
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,840
lying and you avoid intoxicating your mind making your mind kind of confused

174
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:43,000
and maybe crazy and um and so these are these are consider The virt Virtuous conduct to

175
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:49,200
avoid these things why would you do that well if you one reason is if you

176
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:57,720
develop this warmer sensitivity to others through generosity you can feel how doing those unver virtuous things

177
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:03,159
diminishes The Joy it diminishes the quality of the relationships so you you

178
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:11,799
have a foundation for appreciating why it's important to be ethical where it no longer becomes a rule to be followed but

179
00:20:11,799 --> 00:20:17,840
rather an inspiration to maintain something good to avoid causing harm to

180
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,679
yourself and causing harm to to others because in order to intentionally cause

181
00:20:24,679 --> 00:20:31,039
harm to others it involves a fracturing of the wholeness of self it involves

182
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:37,200
diminishing the wholesome kind of joy and well-being that the Dharma practice

183
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:44,120
is kind of developing in people and growing in people now it's considered in the

184
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:49,280
teachings of the Buddha that do avoiding those five things not killing stealing

185
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,960
sexual misconduct lying and intoxication is a gift we give the

186
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:02,720
world and uh and maybe usually we we don't think of it that way but it doesn't take a lot of analysis to

187
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:09,880
appreciate how much killing stealing sexual harm lying intoxication goes on

188
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:16,520
in their society it's tremendously damaging and uh and the only thing it

189
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:24,159
seems to benefit is politicians and uh and so and newspapers

190
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:29,679
who right about it but uh but if you know what would the news be alike if PE

191
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:36,159
if the whole world stopped doing those things it would be dramatically different than what we consumed now in

192
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:42,840
the in the you know in the main news of the day and so um so it's a gift to the

193
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:49,159
world for to for you to meet someone who you feel their ethical Integrity is so

194
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:54,520
good that you feel like you you feel safe with them is

195
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:00,039
remarkable I've met transformed people

196
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:07,440
who I trusted deeply I trusted them in a certain kind of way to my son when he

197
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:14,919
was 18 and the people who was transformed uh uh had been actually were

198
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:20,880
still lifers in prison who had murdered someone I mean that's considered some of

199
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:28,559
the worst of the people but they had gone through this the the grip program that we've had presentations here about

200
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,559
in such a thorough and transformative way that it was remarkable to

201
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:40,799
feel how that transformation in them so I was able to bring my son when he was

202
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:46,919
18 just just old enough to get Clarence to go to S Quinton and sit in a room of

203
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:53,039
30 lifers who were there because of murder and I was a little bit

204
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,520
worried but uh it was remarkable to feel how they've been changed it's Poss

205
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:04,120
possible to change people can be transformed and

206
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:10,559
um and so um um so this idea of ethics and how

207
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:17,159
good that is and in classically in Buddhism that uh being ethical by

208
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:22,679
abstaining from these five things is meant to be a source of joy and this is

209
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:30,080
something I couldn't understand when I first came to Buddhism I thought it was weird that people felt Joy because they

210
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:38,039
were ethical because that was I had done nothing in my background that made sense of that and um and then uh when I went

211
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:45,279
to Thailand and uh and my first Retreat there was 10 weeks long and 10 weeks was

212
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:53,120
a long time to be in silence and to practice and uh and in the course of that Retreat something shifted inside

213
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:59,480
some kind of settling relaxing calming opening a sense of well-being a sense of

214
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:06,039
I remember feeling very very clean on my inside remember the shower so very clean

215
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:12,120
on the inside and uh and lo and behold I felt

216
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:18,360
this joy for not being inclined to doing

217
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:25,399
anything unethical and uh it came up a little bit in the course of that that um there had

218
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:31,559
been uh before I went there I'd met this woman woman that I had a certain

219
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:38,320
um you know I hope this doesn't offend anyone something that bordered on

220
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:43,760
lust probably not lust but something bordering on

221
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:50,679
it and uh and uh and then when I was sitting in that Retreat uh I could feel

222
00:24:50,679 --> 00:24:55,760
that that I had no inclination in that direction that having that actually felt

223
00:24:55,760 --> 00:25:03,440
like I was going to harm myself and I felt this Joy not having that kind of unhealthy relationship to another

224
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:09,799
person and so um so again to live an ethical life

225
00:25:09,799 --> 00:25:15,039
creates a different reference point for wisdom because it shows

226
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:23,440
us what causes harm and what causes benefit in ourselves in others in the

227
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:29,440
relationship between others between self and others and then maybe to the whole world

228
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:37,760
so then the third step of uh then we're getting to What's called the Perfection of wisdom so we're building here so the

229
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:43,240
third step in this path model is uh a topic I talked about a few

230
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:50,480
weeks ago which popular is at least thought to be unpopular is uh

231
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:59,679
renunciation and uh but the thing is that it's after these first two so uh there's a now the practitioner

232
00:25:59,679 --> 00:26:07,760
has gathered a lot of information they've learned a lot about what feels good they a lot not just good

233
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,919
in some H hedonistic way but what feels good ethically what feels good interpersonally what feels good coming

234
00:26:14,919 --> 00:26:21,799
from our heart coming from a deep generative place inside and so from

235
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:29,760
there um it makes sense to begin letting go of of

236
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:35,360
course uh I remember I would when I took my kids to school when they were young

237
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:42,760
uh I would get up and meditate and then they and usually they would I try to

238
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:48,200
meditate because they'd get up early and then I had this great idea that this

239
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:53,760
fantasy will be so great I'll be meditating and they'll come and and really young they come in I have them

240
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:01,559
sit on my lap and I put my I had a Shaw and I put on and it'll be such a wonderful

241
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:06,919
conditioning for them influence on them they'll just feel the goodness of that and meditate together and so sure enough

242
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:12,000
they wake up early sure enough they'd be willing to sit on my lap and it lasted

243
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:20,360
half a second so I never I was never fulfilled in that area of

244
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:25,640
parenting but I would feel kind of good and uh anyway just been sitting a little

245
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:32,640
bit or whatever I did and and um but by the time I made breakfast for the

246
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:37,880
kids got them dressed did drove the carpool to school I was ready to come

247
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:44,360
back and take a nap and and one but one of the things I said this this is exhausting this is

248
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:53,440
stressful what's going on this is back in the old days in the ancient times where um they had something called

249
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,519
newspapers and so it turned out every morning I wanted to read the newspaper

250
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:04,519
but that was what made the whole morning stressful because it made much like I didn't have enough time for all the

251
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:11,840
other steps so I had to renounce the newspaper and I was so much

252
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:18,679
happier because I knew there was happiness I knew there was well-being I knew there was harm and this so

253
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:24,200
something that I enjoyed doing had to go for the greater good so that was a

254
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:29,240
renunciation so so that no good goodness

255
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:34,320
to know that being stressful stressing out is is you're losing something when

256
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:39,679
you get stressed the Dharma question is

257
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:46,200
why be stressed why agree to being stressed why go along with the forces

258
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:54,120
inside that cause you stress some of you will have brilliant answers to that why you should be

259
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:59,799
stressed what I'd like to encourage you is don't argue with

260
00:28:59,799 --> 00:29:05,960
me uh but uh uh engage those mental

261
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:11,799
lawyers that are justifying stress and really question them really

262
00:29:11,799 --> 00:29:17,240
engage in a deep conversation with it is it really better is it really worthwhile

263
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,720
to allow yourself to get stressed I've known for example at times

264
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:28,159
that um I've been stressed and trying to do something and then I had to do it

265
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:35,960
over again it would have been faster if I had done it calmly uh the first

266
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:42,159
time so um but anyway the sense of caring beginning to care deeply for

267
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:50,880
yourself care enough to not be stressed care enough not to sacrifice your own well-being for greed for hatred care

268
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,480
enough so that uh you do the kind of things that nourish and support a

269
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:02,880
profoundly inspire ing inner life so your inner life inspires you wow can you

270
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:11,200
believe this there's something here which is maybe not me but it's better than me which is this generative place

271
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:16,600
of goodness or warmth or wholesomeness that can live inside of us and so

272
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:24,519
renunciation is part of that training and part of that learning we learn to let go and then renunciation

273
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:30,919
brings even more sense of well-being that's the point of it it's not meant to be

274
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:36,919
deprivation and in the in this teaching that I'm uh kind of relying on for this

275
00:30:36,919 --> 00:30:42,399
talk it um uh uh renunciation is uh

276
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:47,720
includes the practice of meditation that's where it kind of fits in there's

277
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:54,200
a lot of Letting Go in meditation there's a lot of letting go of thoughts letting go of impulses motivations

278
00:30:54,200 --> 00:31:01,559
learning to sit quietly and peacefully letting go of all the ways that we're harming ourselves and one way of

279
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:08,880
understanding meditation is a progressive lessening of self harm and it's hard for people to believe

280
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,200
and know how much we're actually harming ourselves by the ordinary stressful ways

281
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:21,279
that we're thinking and caught and fixated in thoughts and feelings and what we do in ordinary life but we start

282
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:32,000
seeing that and relaxing and softening and part of the function of meditation is to soften let go of all forms of self

283
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:37,919
harm and um that's the purpose of the for Noble Truths which are really they

284
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:46,080
usually use use the word suffering there to address it to talk about it so meditation then produces a sense

285
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:52,880
of wholeness deep peace deep sense of well-being and again it becomes an even

286
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:58,200
deeper reference point for wisdom now we know better and better and

287
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:06,799
better what it means to avoid harm what it means to not harm

288
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:13,720
others what it means to benefit self stay close to the inner welfare and

289
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:19,360
happiness what it means to to benefit others how to really benefit others in

290
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:24,399
some good way and um and it might be

291
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:29,639
that you know you give someone cookies at work and that might be nice but it

292
00:32:29,639 --> 00:32:36,720
might be that how you give it might actually make all the difference in the world and so there's some

293
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:43,519
inner movement in how you give that is more than just you know throwing it on

294
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:49,880
on their table and so so it's based on this now

295
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,159
that in this path model I'm talking about moves into discussion of wisdom

296
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:02,519
wisdom here is not something you learn first and foremost the practical wisdom

297
00:33:02,519 --> 00:33:10,720
of the Dharma is gained through these first three steps many people in the west begin

298
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:17,559
their path with meditation and so that's where they learn this eventually and then they feel and from that they learn

299
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:24,320
oh it's good to be generous or maybe first they learned it's good to be ethical and then they learn it's good to

300
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:30,639
be generous so they kind of do it backwards sometimes in the West because they start with we start with meditation

301
00:33:30,639 --> 00:33:38,760
I mean how many of you would you of you would come to a course at IMC five we introduction to mindful

302
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:46,799
generosity you might you might some of you might come but but you know uh you

303
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,760
know our our introduction here is 5way course in mindfulness

304
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:59,679
meditation and so um so these deeper reference points that

305
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:06,360
we have so that that's what we're trying to look for in this practice and

306
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:13,520
um and how do we learn this reference point how do we

307
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:21,280
learn this kind of way of living by living it action is needed action in Body

308
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:28,200
Action in speech and action and mind there's activity this is an active path to the Dharma even though Med meditation

309
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:35,079
can look kind of passive it's actually kind of active also it's actively doing

310
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:42,079
less and um and this is a path of action of how you live your life and in living

311
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:48,679
it you then learn the feedback loops that you recognize and feel and know

312
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:54,919
what causes harm and what brings benefit and in doing that then you have the

313
00:34:54,919 --> 00:35:00,520
basis for wanting to care care comes out of

314
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:06,680
that care is a deep place inside where we

315
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:13,040
feel um uh we have a concern we have empathic concern we have a sense of

316
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:18,760
shared Humanity we have a sense of it's important to that humans humans and

317
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:26,000
their well-being their inner life are invaluable that everyone has the same kind of basic building blocks of an

318
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:33,240
inner life that you do building blocks that uh where there can be a completely

319
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:42,680
natural instinct or impulse to care for the world it's not an

320
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:49,400
obligation one of the most beautiful little uh stories I like in

321
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:56,680
zenel someone asks the Zen master in China uh what is it like to be the

322
00:35:56,680 --> 00:36:02,680
embodiment of compassion there's a day called the Quan embodiment of compassion

323
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:11,280
and his Z Master says oh uh it's like uh uh rearranging the

324
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:18,160
pillow when you're sleeping at night I mean it's like

325
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:23,240
what the idea being that it's completely done

326
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:28,839
unselfconsciously of course if you're uncomfortable something inside of you kind of re the pillow to make yourself

327
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:36,280
more comfortable to sleep better there's almost no thought going into it that's the source in which the embodiment of

328
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:41,760
compassion cares for the world it's just no there's no thought exactly it's just kind of a

329
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,359
course you know if um if you have three pillows and the person sleeping near you has none and

330
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:56,640
they're uncomfortable here take a pillow take two um you know how do we share how do

331
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,800
we this this this deep kind of caring Instinct that we

332
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:07,359
have and I was really touched when my mother was in um the memory care home

333
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:14,800
here in Redwood City um to watch people who in conventional way of using the word love

334
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:20,880
didn't didn't love my mother but it was remarkable the care that they offered

335
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,520
her it was as if they loved her and their professionalism their calm their

336
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:33,720
dedication their their unwavering this for the year and a half or two years he was there was phenomenal to watch and

337
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:40,200
see the level of care they had and um and this is the possible for all of us

338
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,240
we can live in the world with care and

339
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:48,240
um

340
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,280
um

341
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:03,160
so so I'll read that quote again and then I'll make a statement to close more

342
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:10,160
theater so just wise people of great

343
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,800
wisdom do not think of harming themselves of harming others or of

344
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,400
harming both rather wise people consider their own

345
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:28,560
welfare the welfare of others the welfare of both and the welfare of the
