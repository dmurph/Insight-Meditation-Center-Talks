00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,680
maybe ima imagine yourself arriving

18
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:21,120
at a quiet temple a temple of this body

19
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,960
allow some a gentle

20
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:41,000
setup-ness as you settle in into the space

21
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:52,960
i remember going to the temples in kyoto japan

22
00:04:52,960 --> 00:05:00,240
it's as if i am walking into the temple almost like a tiptoe

23
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,120
it's quiet

24
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:13,199
here arriving here

25
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,479
i have a little care

26
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,840
care for this body

27
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:31,280
the space it's in

28
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,479
taking your seat

29
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,319
right here and now

30
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,639
and temporarily we can leave behind

31
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:05,639
any thoughts about the future and the past

32
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,840
arriving here in this moment

33
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,319
the sense of arriving may be expressed

34
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:48,919
as bringing mindfulness front and center

35
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,599
becoming president

36
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,720
available

37
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:10,880
available to the sound sound of my voice

38
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,160
and be in sound

39
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:27,520
being available to the movements of the breath

40
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,880
without sense of the sitting posture

41
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:38,840
or whatever the posture you may be taking

42
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:59,639
aligning aligning from ground up

43
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,240
being supported by earth

44
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:16,960
also being supported by the grand of a wholesome intention

45
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:25,840
my teachers sometimes use this term resting on the ground of a wholesome

46
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:28,840
intention

47
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:47,200
aligning with our aspirations our values

48
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,760
integrity within

49
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:14,959
maybe you have a sense that you've arrived here home

50
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:21,480
in this body the temple of this body

51
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:44,800
inviting the felt sense of earth element to come in

52
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,839
however it may be for you

53
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:09,279
maybe you're feeling the pelvic bones making contact with earth

54
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,480
right underneath of us

55
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,959
the hardness of the teeth

56
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:39,560
weight of the shoulders and arms

57
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:04,639
being available to the experience of the earth element

58
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:11,560
right here in this earthy body

59
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:34,800
sitting like a redwood

60
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:46,040
rooted uplifted

61
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,560
maybe a sense of stability

62
00:12:30,639 --> 00:12:36,839
steadiness can come in

63
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,560
earth element is stable

64
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:53,600
and some small and big degrees unmoving earth element

65
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,519
as in nature to settle

66
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,519
if you feel a hint of stillness

67
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:10,920
as you sit in the bones

68
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:14,360
letting go of the tendencies to try to figure it out

69
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:22,240
let the body let the body

70
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:27,600
does what it does body knows

71
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,160
body feels

72
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,720
mindfulness of the body in and of the body itself

73
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,680
not in the head

74
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:15,519
with the steadiness and stillness

75
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:20,800
in the earth element as a backdrop

76
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:29,279
making ourselves available to the movements

77
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,839
the contrasting movements of the winged element

78
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:43,279
air chi in chinese

79
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,040
movements of the bride

80
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,480
rising and falling of the belly

81
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:06,990
expansion and contraction of the torso

82
00:16:06,990 --> 00:16:10,049
[Music]

83
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:27,839
receiving the felt sense of the wind element

84
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,440
flowing through the whole body

85
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,240
maybe you feel vibrations tingling

86
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,480
winged moves

87
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:44,000
the felt sense of the stillness may still be in the backdrop or the

88
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,840
foreground of your experience

89
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:58,440
as you experience the movements of the air element

90
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,760
you may feel aliveness

91
00:19:07,039 --> 00:19:11,480
as you breathe in and out

92
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,360
there may be a vivid sense of a vitality

93
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:53,120
and stillness and movements can co-exist

94
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,240
right here in our experience

95
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:36,880
i expand to include the felt sense of a water

96
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:41,120
element today

97
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,919
notice the moisture inside the mouth

98
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,520
maybe in the palm

99
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,880
maybe moisture in the eyes

100
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:46,159
water takes a shape in whatever the container

101
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:48,720
they're in

102
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,799
you're sitting a water element takes the shape of sitting

103
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:08,000
lying down water elements take the shape of lying

104
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:14,240
down fluid

105
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:22,919
permeating throughout the body

106
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:57,919
the body is still quiet

107
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:10,880
it may feel like we're sitting in a quiet lake

108
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,240
i'm moving

109
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:38,480
the body has energetic wavy

110
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:45,120
experiences may feel as if there are ripples and

111
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,158
waves in the body

112
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,360
for the rest of the meditation

113
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:19,080
feel free to stay with whatever may be prominent for you

114
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,440
the arriving sequence earth element

115
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,559
winged element or water element

116
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:40,278
are the combinations of all of this

117
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,640
dropping out of the concepts and ideas beliefs

118
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:28,720
of what all this are

119
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,600
let the body speak for off

120
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,080
feel into the body sensing

121
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,559
into it

122
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,679
the tempo of this body provides a shelter

123
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:35,440
and protection from getting caught

124
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:43,640
in endurances grasping aversion and delusion

125
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:06,880
this last a few moments of our sitting together

126
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:14,480
we offer an inner bowing to the temple of this body

127
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:20,720
and this mind this heart we're offering shelter

128
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:25,599
protection and safety

129
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:34,320
safeguarding inner integrity inner virtual

130
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,800
inner goodness

131
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:57,400
uh

132
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:28,960
hmm thank you all for

133
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:34,800
meditating together i felt the sense of uh goodness from

134
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:40,079
just being here with you all and practicing together

135
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,320
what a fortune great fortune

136
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:50,320
so today i wanted to continue our

137
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:56,160
reflections on sila and today i will be

138
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:02,720
extending this to the third precept

139
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:08,640
we've been going through this one by one and the third precept is

140
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:17,680
undertaking the training rules abstaining from misconduct related to sexuality

141
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:26,079
and again i wanted to invite all of us to explore this from an inside out

142
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:33,760
framework and using this framework of a triple a aware abstinence

143
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:40,720
and a line aware of the inner forces

144
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:48,960
and becoming clear of the cons consequences of hosam are

145
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:55,359
unskillful and then we learn to abstain training to abstain

146
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,160
from those that are unskillful and wholesome

147
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:08,000
and then we allowing ourselves so what that is a wholesale and that is a skillful

148
00:38:08,079 --> 00:38:14,160
and so this particular training set uh a training precept

149
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,160
the direct poly translation of one of the terms significant term in

150
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:26,240
this precept comma refers to sensual pleasures

151
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:32,160
and so maybe the literal translation of this precept is

152
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:39,119
more like undertaking the training of abstaining from misconduct

153
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:45,880
in regard to essential pleasures and sexual desire

154
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:51,839
and so this has a broader implication than the common interpretation

155
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:59,720
which is usually abstinent from misconduct in sexual relationships

156
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,680
and so today i wanted to explore this maybe a from a

157
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:12,960
broader perspective they are not exclusive of each other in any way

158
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:20,480
but i would like to include a broader perspective as well

159
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:28,320
as we cultivate mindful awareness i like all of you have been doing this right

160
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:34,240
and we can begin to see how essential desire

161
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:39,680
arise out of um sense context

162
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:45,760
may be related to seeing seeing some beautiful

163
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:52,640
appearances clothes hearing some sound or voice

164
00:39:52,640 --> 00:40:00,320
that somehow attract us i remember on hearing many stories about

165
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:07,119
the personal romance on retreats i think some of you may have heard of this as well i may have even

166
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:14,640
experienced this you know our retreats right and there's not much else to going on

167
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:21,040
on retreats so our mind can get caught up

168
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:27,520
just by watching a person somehow the way they take a cup of tea

169
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:32,800
or drink a cup of tea we can get really caught up

170
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,599
by some romantic fantasy

171
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:44,560
it's not until the end of the retreat when the person begin to speak or do

172
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:51,839
something different and then we kind of all of a sudden it hits us

173
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,520
what happened here right

174
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:02,880
so um so the forces are common and potent

175
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:08,640
within us if we are attuned

176
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,400
with our awareness and those momentary essential desires

177
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,880
it's just kind of like a ripples and then big they ponder for water

178
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:26,480
but they come and go and they ripple outwards they kind of settle

179
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,319
without getting manifested into anything significant at all

180
00:41:32,319 --> 00:41:37,440
and yet without clear awareness and clear knowing

181
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:45,440
this kind of a forces can get an upper hand now we can get caught up

182
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:52,640
and we can write out this kind of desires and and manifest into

183
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,760
un-wholesome bodily and verbal actions

184
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:08,240
and so as we began undertaking the training of cultivating awareness

185
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:13,279
we can become become

186
00:42:14,839 --> 00:42:19,760
aware we can know this forces

187
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:28,000
and then from externally uh we may take under we take this training um by undertaking the

188
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:34,318
training of abstaining from sexual misconduct

189
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:41,280
we don't want to play with the fire right and it's kind of like um [Music]

190
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:47,119
we don't want to get it burned so being aware has a lot to do

191
00:42:47,119 --> 00:42:52,640
with how we have how we can cultivate capacity to undertake this training

192
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,640
rules

193
00:42:58,079 --> 00:43:04,160
so it probably and i wanted to just name how potent this force is

194
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:10,319
it probably goes uh and the kind of harm they can have

195
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:17,040
on human beings and there's no denial to this

196
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,800
um and we all know that the misuse of this kind of forces

197
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:31,200
sexual energy essential desires lead to deep trauma deep pains distress

198
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,880
for ourselves and for others and i was looking up at some statistics

199
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:43,440
yesterday and in one of the statistics statistics i googled and

200
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:50,960
i don't know how how true the information is but it feels uh reasonable and so it says

201
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:58,640
40 40 plus percent of the women in u.s has encountered sexual violence

202
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:03,920
and 20 of the males in america have been the victim of

203
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:07,318
sexual violence

204
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:15,200
isn't that amazing and i i thought this might be low

205
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:20,280
growing up with a sexual body

206
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:31,520
and there much harm can be done as i was stunned by the statistics

207
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:38,560
and those are probably more reported and i'll report it might be even higher

208
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:46,319
so just imagine you know one out of maybe close to two women

209
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:52,319
might be uh might have encountered the sexual violence

210
00:44:53,599 --> 00:45:01,599
and yet those are deep forces within so when we are hurt and harmed

211
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:07,920
so much dukkha can happen some people have a lifetime

212
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:13,599
kind of a hurt and harm buried within

213
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:25,599
and yet because of the potent force um it's also easy for us to get caught

214
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:31,359
i recently read something from sharon salzberg one of the pioneer

215
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:38,000
teachers in the terrible western tarabata tradition she shared about a

216
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,760
uh an encounter and she said and that

217
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,000
in her article a friend once was in at a community meeting at which a member

218
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:56,800
was being rather self-righteously denounced for their sexual misconduct

219
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:02,400
and my friend's comment was who in this room has never made a fool

220
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:10,160
of themselves over sex in fact no one raised their hand

221
00:46:12,640 --> 00:46:16,480
isn't that kind of stunning

222
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,760
so sexual forces are very powerful forces

223
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:31,119
i wanted to say a few words about how we relate to this forces inside of us and

224
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:36,640
whether it's essential desires misconducts

225
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:44,960
in relationship to this kind of forces and maybe unskillful actions that we

226
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:53,040
[Music] experienced and taken in the past i invite you to all

227
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:59,040
also engage in the practice of not shaming ourselves or others

228
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:04,480
not blaming ourselves or others because we all know

229
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,760
that shaming and blaming are only adding thoughts and

230
00:47:09,760 --> 00:47:17,200
wounds right and this applies to all the other

231
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:22,640
precepts the whole training of vasila

232
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:30,000
shaming and blaming is unskillful and unhelpful

233
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:40,079
i instead the very fact that the sealer is a training it's pointing to how we can learn

234
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:45,359
through coming to know these forces coming to know the implications and

235
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:51,520
consequences of this forces and so we can train

236
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,960
and learn to not get burnt again and again

237
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:03,119
and this is the gradual training takes the patience

238
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:08,640
lots of care and gentleness kind attention

239
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:13,119
a wailingless willingness to learn

240
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:21,200
just think about it kind of how you might treat your children if they make a mistake we know they have

241
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:26,319
potential to correct them we don't just tell them that's it you

242
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:31,599
know you're a bad boy bad girl forever right

243
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:36,720
instead we all know that children has potential to grow and mature through

244
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:42,640
learning in the same way

245
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:48,160
we are ever growing and maturing too even though physically we're kind of you

246
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:51,599
know a doubt adults

247
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:59,359
unless the forces a sexual energy and sexual forces

248
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:05,920
are also life life caring they feel the love

249
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:13,680
of our partners and our families motherly fatherly love we usually don't associate this with the

250
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:21,200
sexuality because somehow i guess nowadays sexuality gets

251
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:27,680
reduced to appearances and sensuality only

252
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:33,200
and it's undeniable though that the sexual forces are also life-giving

253
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:41,040
caring so in practicing this training rule we have

254
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:48,079
a choice to honor and respect care love for life

255
00:49:48,079 --> 00:49:55,839
and not to diminish life so this speaks to how we align align

256
00:49:55,839 --> 00:50:03,119
ourselves to respect and care for our own bodies and others

257
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:09,839
so i want to end uh with again this coat that i've been coating from

258
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:15,359
this mangala suta the sitter of the blessings and i'll share this

259
00:50:15,359 --> 00:50:23,680
link maybe in a day or two and it says caring for mother and father kindness to

260
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:30,880
children and partners and this is the highest blessing

261
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:38,480
so may we all respect ourselves and others and may this cultivation benefit all

262
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:44,800
beings so enjoy your practice and

263
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:52,400
whatever the activities that you take today and so we'll meet here again tomorrow

264
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:59,559
thank you everyone and take good care bye
