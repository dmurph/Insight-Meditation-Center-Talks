1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:08,639
so uh here we are um we're at the uh

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:15,199
fourth um kind of I know Force step and

3
00:00:15,199 --> 00:00:26,439
force uh movement of um this week's a Siri and uh today uh we're going to move

4
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:32,398
through uh the grounding uh enlightening

5
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:39,640
enriching and then uh today we'll be adding a component which is

6
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,960
um expanding and so I will be using the

7
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:53,760
metaphor of um the Inner Mountain and to expand a bit more and so that's uh what

8
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,719
we will be doing together so we'll start with the sound of a bell

9
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:08,150
[Music]

10
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,399
arriving here and

11
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,920
now taking a few long deep breaths as you breathe out

12
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:42,078
settling down maybe resting down towards

13
00:01:50,280 --> 00:02:00,719
Earth mindfulness front and center and maybe all the way around

14
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,000
and heartfulness may be here

15
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:16,080
too and the body

16
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,560
fullness sensing this body sitting

17
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:49,519
releasing the weight of the body towards

18
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:04,440
Earth allow this earthy body resting on Earth

19
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:36,640
sensing ground

20
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,959
underneath

21
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,000
studying grounding

22
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:08,720
releasing

23
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,360
preoccupations

24
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:31,720
plans let yourself be grounded

25
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,360
sitting like a

26
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,960
mountain and a life Mountain Within

27
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:10,240
quiet

28
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,560
still and steady

29
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,759
the movements of the breath May naturally come

30
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:59,600
Force like a breeze in the mountain

31
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,039
sensing

32
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:23,840
aliveness the breath flows throughout the body

33
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:37,560
en liening the Inner

34
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:53,400
Mountain you feel the sensations on the

35
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,440
feet relax

36
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:17,919
hands

37
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:27,759
shivering swaying janto s

38
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:55,919
receiving the felt sense of a life

39
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:02,479
breath coursing through the whole body for

40
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,800
the waves of emotions may come in

41
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,800
thoughts a rich part of a Being Human

42
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:12,680
just simply open to receive the felt

43
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:23,160
sense of emotions and texture of the thoughts

44
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:43,279
like the weather systems in the mountain

45
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:09,600
expanding the field of awareness around the edges of the

46
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:19,480
body and open to include the space all around

47
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:42,880
just like the mountain surrounded imbued by the

48
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:46,360
spaciousness all

49
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:55,279
around and you expand to include the

50
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,279
spaciousness that's right here e

51
00:11:51,320 --> 00:12:01,240

thank you everyone I feel like I'm navigating this

93
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:36,039
a YouTube World a little bit cuz the video for me is a bit Frozen but um I

94
00:30:36,039 --> 00:30:46,000
feel a little relief to see some chat messages from you all uh hopefully it all has been going

95
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:54,320
okay um so I'm going to switch gear and

96
00:30:54,320 --> 00:31:00,559
um offer the third simile uh in this um

97
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:08,000
Sut that I've been sharing this past week Sam nikaya

98
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,279
22101 and um uh this um last a cup of uh

99
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:23,559
similes the chicken and eggs and uh uh the ass handle kind of offered

100
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:29,159
some different aspects of a highway practice and this last last

101
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:36,840
simile uh is that of uh the rope that ties the ship kind

102
00:31:36,840 --> 00:31:43,039
of you know docking the ship or something so it's got yet another

103
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:49,240
different flavor so let me read this assimile to you

104
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:55,880
first Suppose there was a sea fairing ship

105
00:31:55,880 --> 00:32:02,600
bound together with ropes for 6 months they

106
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:11,880
deteriorated in the water then in the cold season it was a hauled up on dry

107
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:18,799
land where the ropes were weathered by wind and the

108
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:28,240
sun when the clouds soaked it with rain the ropes would readily collapse

109
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:34,039
and a rod away in the same way when a practitioner

110
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:40,200
is committed to development their feathers or you can

111
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:45,440
say defilements their tins readily

112
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:54,480
collapse and rot away I this is very Vivid simile you

113
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:01,840
know this ropes tying the ship and the ropes soaked in the water for a

114
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:09,480
long time and then in the cold season when the ship is not

115
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:15,960
going uh they're hauled up in dry land and the ropes are under the weather in

116
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:23,240
the sun in the wind and then the cloud soaked with rain

117
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:28,840
I guess rain clouds soaked the ropes more

118
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:34,240
and then eventually the ropes readily collapse

119
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,320
and Rod away in the same way

120
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:51,240
that uh the practitioners when we develop and the tins Fade Away In This

121
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:57,559
Way um for me it has a very different flavor

122
00:33:57,559 --> 00:34:03,600
um that this simile captured when we compare it to the

123
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,639
previous uh two similes

124
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:17,200
um you know with the assimile of the egg eggs and the chicken and it's

125
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:24,320
highlighting that's one way to understand it that it's highlighting that one would uh needed to practice a

126
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:30,240
sincerity and properly um um and when the hearts and

127
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:35,320
minds are cultivated that way the chicks would

128
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:42,358
hatch and the second simile uh the simile as handle you know

129
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:52,118
the cing T are holding the the handle for a long time and highlights that uh the release

130
00:34:52,119 --> 00:34:58,599
of the strong deep Tendencies of grasping um

131
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:06,920
is not to be measured you know evaluated but we stay

132
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:13,680
cultivating now with this simile

133
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:21,320
uh first uh you know just to feel that sense of the ropes being soaked in in

134
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:28,599
this weather different Weathers in different times of the day and the sense

135
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:34,520
I have is that the long Arc of our practice

136
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:43,839
Journey we will surely go through all kinds of seasons and meet all kinds of human

137
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:50,280
conditions the gains the loss uh the gains of the different kinds

138
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:58,440
material immaterial and the loss of all kinds loss of loved ones loss of

139
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,480
physical mental capacities unfortunate Unfortunate

140
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,440
Events um uh experiencing uh uh things that are

141
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:17,160
individually to us and the collectively and so it's like this

142
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:23,200
different weather systems uh different phases of Our

143
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:28,520
Lives um whether we prefer or not

144
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:37,920
but the practice continues no matter what the conditions and situations we're in kind of like the

145
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:46,599
the ropes you know keeps on so getting soaked in in all the different

146
00:36:46,599 --> 00:36:54,119
conditions and our willingness and the dedication to stay in the practice field

147
00:36:54,119 --> 00:37:01,000
in the practice stream no matter what situ situation we're in is how our

148
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:08,640
practice matures and this is certainly not easy

149
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:16,800
to do um and not just not just easy but at

150
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,839
times it can feel really really

151
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:28,000
difficult and through the practice um we learn to gradually little

152
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:36,520
by little um whether it's in the difficult situations or in kind of um comfortable

153
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:42,920
situations we learn to choose whether to become

154
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:52,359
reactive which leads more stress and Dua or we choose something that is a kind of

155
00:37:52,359 --> 00:37:59,440
release of reactivity and not add more to

156
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:08,359
and for me a lot of our reactivities feels more like tying nods

157
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:13,800
on of the Rope you know rather than releasing the Rope let the ropes loosen

158
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:21,560
up and soften let the thread be softened kind of released and not tied up but the

159
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:26,599
reactivity gets us knotted up

160
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:37,720
and so this particular Sali reminded me of a teaching that a sum sometimes would

161
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:44,040
say that uh in our practice we choose to stand under

162
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:50,839
dukka we choose to stand under dukka we're not running away from

163
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:57,839
different situations and conditions uh in our lives

164
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:06,800
um but rather we choose to stand under duka we learn from it we need it we

165
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:14,520
explore them we understand it and then over time we learn how to

166
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:21,200
empower ourselves to choose not add more

167
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:28,680
stress and since we've uh done all three similies uh in uh this

168
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:34,960
sequence I wanted to just summarize a little bit the overarching flavor of

169
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:40,480
this uh three similes I was struck by the fact

170
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,599
that uh all of this similes together if

171
00:39:46,599 --> 00:39:55,240
you feel into it there is no sense of a kind of brute force of pushing our way

172
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:01,640
through in the cultivation process right you know first we don't

173
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:08,160
Tinker with the eggs to kind of somehow uh break the shells

174
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:16,040
prematurely nor do we try to do something crazy about uh the ass

175
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:22,880
Handle by force and we just kind of keep holding it and keep working with it and

176
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:28,240
there is a kind of a timelessness uh in the practice

177
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:34,319
and in this assimile nowhere in the sutta it would say oh let's kind of I

178
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:44,960
don't know cut to the Rope up doesn't work like that but rather we let ourselves meet

179
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:51,760
the situations of life as they are and the

180
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:59,200
Rope kind of rots on its own naturally

181
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:06,720
and so in this way I can say maybe we can say that we

182
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:12,400
are being practiced uh by the forces of Our Lives

183
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:18,000
by including all parts of one's life in the practice

184
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:23,160
field and gradually freedom is born our

185
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:30,280
freedom naturally come forth and so you know the Notions like

186
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:36,599
shortcuts efficiency speed and those are not the

187
00:41:36,599 --> 00:41:43,000
orientation of the the Dharma practice and so this kind of a patiently

188
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:50,000
showing up but be really curious to learn in all the

189
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:57,680
situations and there is a kind of um compassionate and kind attitude to to

190
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:03,680
build in in here and you may be able to feel this right right

191
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:12,880
there and I wanted to uh read um in Gil's new book uh everything

192
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:20,559
is practice even though it's speaking about um Retreat practice but I would

193
00:42:20,559 --> 00:42:26,760
say it can be extended to practicing uh in our life in

194
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:32,559
general in the forward of this book uh iness one

195
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:39,839
of our IRC teachers IMC teachers said this uh in this book and

196
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:48,359
she said Gil points to um mature practice that includes every aspect of

197
00:42:48,359 --> 00:42:54,960
ourselves with nothing left out fostering a deep sense of

198
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,000
self-acceptance and understanding a practice that both

199
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,240
provides for the Solitude of deep meditation and the connection of a

200
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:13,160
practice in community with others he emphasizes a practice that

201
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:18,359
points to Freedom possible in every aspect of Our

202
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:23,559
Lives including in our wider

203
00:43:23,559 --> 00:43:29,280
world so may that be an aspiration to all of

204
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:35,280
us so thank you everyone have a wonderful rest of the

205
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:43,760
