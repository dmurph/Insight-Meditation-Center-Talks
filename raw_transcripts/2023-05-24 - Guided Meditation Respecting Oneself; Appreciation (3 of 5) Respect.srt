1
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,959
so good morning everyone and or good day

2
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:20,279
and happy to be here with you and and I'm also happy to be here

3
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:28,619
with myself at the appreciation of our ability to

4
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:35,760
be present for ourselves is a wonderful appreciation

5
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:40,920
and to about value that and to

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,920
um

7
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:55,620
feel like we are worthy we are valuable we are

8
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,500
we are worthy of attention

9
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:08,220
and for people interested in being compassionate we have a lot more compassion or the

10
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:16,979
compassion is Fuller or maybe even cleaner if the agent of compassion namely each

11
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,799
of us holds ourselves or sees ourselves

12
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:28,938
with a certain value and worthiness and dignity

13
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:35,280
if we kind of inhabit ourselves fully or

14
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,780
appreciate ourselves as a Simplicity of being a human being

15
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:49,020
maybe not necessarily for our accomplishments or all kinds of worldly

16
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,640
values but just a deep appreciation of our value as a human being

17
00:01:55,799 --> 00:02:02,340
if we have that kind of respect for ourselves then when we are bring compassion to

18
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,060
someone else we bring that along and it conveys more

19
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:16,080
value The Compassion conveys more value there's like a fuller compassion the

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,379
person who's offering compassion then is more present more the person is there

21
00:02:22,379 --> 00:02:28,739
a person's not apologizing for themselves or not hiding themselves not

22
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:35,280
uh doing things kind of half-hearted because they don't think that they're important enough to do something

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,860
it's easier to be a wholehearted fullness of presence which brings more

24
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,099
presence into the compassion brings a lot of different wonderful things into the compassion so

25
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:54,860
this idea of respecting ourselves

26
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,080
respecting this human being that

27
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:08,519
we have the role of inhabiting living with for this lifetime

28
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,200
so to begin our meditation

29
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,220
with the care respect for this human being that you are

30
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:27,260
being careful with

31
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:34,200
the posture you take so that the posture you kind of spend

32
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:40,019
some time moving around a little bit wiggling swaying

33
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,420
looking until you find the posture that seems aligned and

34
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:52,680
balanced and feels right for you to inhabit

35
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,480
to live in the embodied posture

36
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:12,200
gently closing your eyes

37
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:31,580
and perhaps with care respect for yourself to take a few long slow deep breaths

38
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:39,860
we feel our body more fully when we breathe in deeply

39
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,780
and as we feel our body feel it with respect

40
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:56,540
exhale with care and respect

41
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,380
and letting your breathing return to normal

42
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:31,020
and as a form of respect and care as a way of

43
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:34,580
becoming more whole

44
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:45,199
as you exhale continue to relax the face the eyes

45
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:56,000
relax the shoulders

46
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:09,320
relax the belly

47
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,020
letting the breathing return to normal

48
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,880
and one of the meanings I like for respect

49
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:40,680
is to look again we if we respect something

50
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:46,400
it's worthy of a second look further connection

51
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,979
and as you're present for yourself breathing

52
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,240
each moment of awareness

53
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:05,180
each thing that you're aware of is worthy of a second look a deeper look

54
00:07:20,819 --> 00:07:24,919
to respect each breath

55
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:35,099
is not just be aware of an inhale once but each and nail almost as if you're

56
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:41,360
giving yourself a second look a deeper connection

57
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:47,539
a second look a deeper connection to exhaling

58
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:24,199
if the Mind begins thinking to have respect for oneself

59
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:31,259
is to not only know that you're thinking

60
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,000
but to give it a second look

61
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:44,279
I haven't even further mindfulness of the phenomena of thinking

62
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:49,580
almost as if you respect it without

63
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:57,019
participating in it just seeing it more deeply the phenomena of thinking

64
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:05,700
and then respectfully allowing the thinking to fade away like

65
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,260
a thought bubble floating away

66
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,620
and begin again with your breathing

67
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:54,679
might your mindfulness become a little Fuller or

68
00:18:55,020 --> 00:19:01,279
it'll ignore available in a stronger way

69
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:09,419
if the mindfulness is supported by respect

70
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:12,259
for yourself

71
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:25,159
even if you don't feel you deserve respect

72
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:34,940
offer the respect anyway as you might for any other person

73
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,480
if there was a occasion to support them and

74
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,679
in times of great need

75
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:39,140
and then to bring this meditation to an end

76
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:45,899
to consider how a certain

77
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:54,299
self-respect might translate or make possible greater

78
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:57,500
respect for others

79
00:31:00,299 --> 00:31:07,340
and in with resp with our respect for others respecting others

80
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:17,640
to care for them for their welfare and happiness to care for their dignity and autonomy

81
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:25,799
to care for their success in life for their

82
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:29,720
deep spiritual fulfillment

83
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:39,320
and to wish them well May others be happy

84
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:46,799
May others be safe May others

85
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:52,260
be peaceful May others

86
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:55,220
be free

87
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:03,659
and with our with respecting then in with respect to them respecting them

88
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:11,840
may we in our own way small or large contribute to that possibility

89
00:32:17,890 --> 00:32:25,000
[Music]

90
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,799
thank you

91
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:52,159
so for this week discussing the different

92
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:57,240
aspects of appreciation

93
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:03,539
I think appreciation can be a food for people I think people benefit tremendously from

94
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:11,300
being appreciated and I would say that a lot of people are not appreciated enough

95
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:17,700
and something Smiles inside something lifts and delights when there's appreciation

96
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:24,419
and if there goes a long time without appreciation especially if we're doing something for

97
00:34:24,419 --> 00:34:29,700
others something begins to sink something feels a little bit off and not

98
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:38,059
quite right we live in a world where there's a mutual give and take a mutual

99
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:43,858
kind of a reference point we use for being with each other

100
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:50,520
and we might have tremendous generosity and offer things to others but if if not

101
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:57,660
even appreciation or gratitude comes back then at some point the feeling of generosity begins to become less and

102
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:03,180
less um but if it's a simple appreciation people understand what we're doing and

103
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:10,320
value it then it could be a smile and happy to do it and maybe easy to do it

104
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:16,339
so appreciation is a really important ingredient and

105
00:35:16,339 --> 00:35:22,500
appreciation has these different elements to it and today I'd like to suggest that uh

106
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:29,040
important element is respect and respect is I just let you many of

107
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,480
you know I love the Latin root of the word which means to look again and when we respect something we're

108
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,660
willing to take a a respectful look again where we value

109
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:49,079
something enough we're not afraid of it enough to look again where that can happen but we

110
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:56,460
respect it we value it enough that yeah this is something we want to be connected to or to see or to understand

111
00:35:56,460 --> 00:36:03,900
and so but the respect carries much more respect carries the idea that um

112
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:09,000
the person we're with has value has worth is um

113
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:15,119
is granting some someone a certain degree of dignity and um

114
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:23,099
and many people in our society don't feel valued they feel marginalized they feel relegated to the edges and maybe

115
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:29,700
overlooked and so but they have no one overlooked to have everyone worthy of

116
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:35,160
being seen again being seen clearly and appreciated and valued

117
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:42,960
it may be even more than valued to be delighted in and to be grateful for even

118
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:48,480
if people don't do anything for us the Gratitude can simply be we're

119
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,119
grateful to be delighted in another human being we're grateful to the chance

120
00:36:54,119 --> 00:37:02,280
to be connected or to see and all these ideas might seem like we

121
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:08,099
don't have time for it it might seem a little bit superficial or or you know there's important things to do so we

122
00:37:08,099 --> 00:37:13,619
can't stop and look again and Grant people's dignity and value Maybe

123
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:19,680
but the source I'd like to propose the source of respecting others is to

124
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,020
respect oneself and to respect oneself is to Value oneself

125
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:31,740
and value yourself not because what we're going to accomplish and so we have to do a lot but value something here

126
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:36,780
that's present value ourselves in this present moment manifestation

127
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:42,180
and this is very important because the Future Self

128
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:48,240
may not exist at all we don't know how long are we going to be alive the future self might be very different

129
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:53,339
than who you are today any future self ideas you have is just a

130
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:59,280
prediction a fantasy an imagination it might be a reasonable prediction but we

131
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:07,680
don't know the past is receded into memory receded into maybe

132
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:13,859
the residue of past experience in us but the past itself is just a kind of a

133
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:19,200
virtual reality of sorts and uh and memory of the past is not

134
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:25,500
always accurate the uh maybe maybe frequently is inaccurate and sometimes it gets more

135
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:33,119
accurate over time when a certain selection process and a certain kind of Storytelling begins to shift and change

136
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:38,160
and um and so the present moment is something very different than the past

137
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:44,460
and the future very different than fantasy it's the only place where our lived

138
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:51,900
experience can be the only place that our lived Humanity can manifest and be

139
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:59,040
this is a very important time and place um to really experience life because

140
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:05,160
everything else in life is not quite life it's uh kind of virtual or

141
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:12,359
something to pass in the future but here and so to respect what's here to Value

142
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:18,720
this these moments of Consciousness the value of this the heart beating and his

143
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:23,839
chance to experience and be in this life and to value

144
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:29,940
our well-being and to respect their autonomy and our dignity and

145
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:34,980
our efforts to try to make make our way through this difficult life

146
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:42,420
so to respect ourselves is uh maybe not always easy but the more

147
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:48,480
we have the self-respect then the more respecting others carries

148
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:55,560
value and it carries strength in it if we diminish our value and kind of

149
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:03,240
half-heartedly or on the sly or on the side or offer respect to others offer generosity

150
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:11,160
to others it could be wonderful but it's not received maybe as fully as it would

151
00:40:11,160 --> 00:40:16,500
be if a person shows up completely there and there's a fullness because we

152
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:24,119
respect ourselves there's a fullness of embodiment here I am and this person here all of this person here is present

153
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:32,040
for you for a few moments with respect with care with appreciation so and that that carries a lot more

154
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:37,380
strength maybe power more more value for the person

155
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:42,839
and uh that we offer respect to we offer appreciation

156
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:50,460
and so offering having respect for oneself is not um you know it doesn't have to be an

157
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:58,140
overly self-focused phenomenon it's a it's uh it it's a important phenomenon

158
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:03,780
important way of being that allows us to convey and care and respect and love for

159
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:09,060
others in a greater way and it's almost as if you want to love

160
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:14,339
others if you want to care for others Begin by respecting yourself and with

161
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:22,020
that comes a tremendous amount of healthy care for others

162
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:30,300
a lack of respect for others can simply also be not because we disrespect ourselves but because we don't think

163
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:36,480
we're have time to take care of ourselves we don't have time to eat and sleep and

164
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:42,960
exercise and maybe meditate so that the best of us has a chance to come and meet

165
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,720
the other people so respect is an important element of

166
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:54,060
appreciation and and this is certainly the minimum

167
00:41:54,060 --> 00:42:00,780
that is to really see that it's appropriate to bring our attention to really see and understand who's there

168
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:08,880
but it also involves seeing people as valuable as important some people might say precious that some

169
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:15,000
people might say that others are Treasures um but so not not just a lover not just

170
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:22,200
a family member do we kind of offer our wonderful love and appreciation and Delight but we can do it in an

171
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:27,240
appropriate way even for strangers and for people who are difficult in our

172
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,599
lives sometimes offering respect to people who are difficult

173
00:42:32,599 --> 00:42:37,859
appreciation to people finding ways to appreciate them finding ways to respect

174
00:42:37,859 --> 00:42:44,900
them is the ingredient for how to overcome some of the conflicts we can be in

175
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:52,260
so uh respect as a foundation

176
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:59,460
one of the foundational elements for being able to offer compassion in a full

177
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:05,520
and effective way if we offer compassion without respect

178
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:12,300
then we're in trouble I think people can feel that and uh and maybe then the

179
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:18,720
compassion sometimes might not even be accepted because the people don't feel somehow

180
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:24,380
that they're recognized in in any important way

181
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:30,200
so for some of us maybe the concept of respect as an ongoing

182
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:37,400
orientation might not be familiar might not be something we do but at least for this day

183
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:44,880
maybe you can do a meet again maybe you can carry with you the the notion of

184
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,000
respect and to see how you how that lives in you do you have respect for

185
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:57,960
yourself do you have respect for others if you were going to respect the people you're with what what form would it take

186
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:03,079
if that's appropriate for you how do you

187
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:08,579
embody respect how does that that the movement of respect to move through you

188
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:14,880
in your own way because for different people maybe different things would be considered

189
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:22,079
respect um and uh so for you what's a clean healthy form of respect for self for

190
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:28,619
others and what happens when you begin embodying that in your relationship to other people

191
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:35,760
and I use the word embodiment intentionally as a kind of wholeheartedness a whole bodiness a

192
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:41,400
whole wholeness you know really bringing ourselves into it in a more

193
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:47,339
full way than maybe usual so it's the intentional and purposeful and and

194
00:44:47,339 --> 00:44:54,960
really really has this kind of a center stage uh for what we how we go about

195
00:44:54,960 --> 00:45:02,760
so thank you and uh I value very much that you're listening to

196
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:11,160
this and maybe practicing with these things and I have a chance to teach them and thank you and I look forward to

197
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,940
continuing tomorrow
