1
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,960
so good morning everyone and i appreciate very much the

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:15,400
many greetings on the chat and

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:23,439
and for the familiar names that i see it's nice to feel like i'm come back after be gone for two weeks

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,400
and it is nice to be here

5
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,519
so for this uh guided meditation

6
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,399
i would like to evoke equality uh impulse or

7
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:51,600
that maybe isn't evoked that often in buddhist practice

8
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:58,640
and that is um a strong desire

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:05,760
for practice to do this practice often the reputation buddhism has

10
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,159
sometimes in as a caricature it's about not having desires that desires are bad

11
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,280
and we should have no desires we can let go of them

12
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,759
and that's not true there are particular kinds of desires to be let go of

13
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:30,479
and other kinds of desires to live by to engage in

14
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:37,759
and we undermine ourselves short short week

15
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,720
um limit ourselves by not appreciating healthy desires that

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:52,640
we have and the desire to become free of suffering the desire to

17
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:59,840
let go of the ways in which other desires limit us

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,759
and bring more suffering to us the desire to overcome those

19
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,560
doesn't have to be limiting doesn't have to be a source of suffering it's the movement out of suffering we

20
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:19,440
need to have it and to have a strong desire

21
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,200
and learning how to have strong desire that's not stressful that's easeful

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,000
that makes the heart sing and feels great and yes this is what i want to do

23
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:40,720
so so to assume a meditation posture

24
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,440
and

25
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,680
perhaps sitting up a little bit straighter than normal so that the chest is maybe

26
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:05,120
without being strained or puffed up the chest is a little more open

27
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,200
to the possibility of confidence

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,280
being confident

29
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:23,760
and then lowering your gaze to about you know

30
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:30,720
down towards the floor perhaps or in some way having your gaze if your

31
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:36,239
eyes are open be soft and relaxed

32
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:46,920
not looking at anything in particular maybe even the eyes are gently

33
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:52,000
moving about but not really looking at anything

34
00:03:55,360 --> 00:04:01,159
and then if it's comfortable to gently close your eyes

35
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,920
and gently let your body relax

36
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,759
almost as if there's an invitation from your body

37
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:23,120
to release the holding that's throughout your body

38
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,960
maybe in the micro muscles

39
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:43,080
softening the shoulders

40
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,639
softening the belly

41
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,840
maybe relaxing the muscles of the face

42
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:19,080
around the eyes cheeks jaws

43
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:34,800
maybe the area around your lips and your mouth can be more relaxed if you let your lips

44
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,400
fall fall apart slightly

45
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,240
and if you want them touching gently float them together again

46
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,840
taking a few long slow deep breaths

47
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:19,240
and relaxing again throughout your body as you exhale

48
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

49
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:00,840
in whatever way it's available to you nothing

50
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:07,759
dramatic to feel the stillness or the quiet within

51
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:20,400
and within and within that stillness and quiet

52
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,400
say the word yes y-e-s

53
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,599
and see what in that quiet

54
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:45,160
what gets evoked in a simple yes

55
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:59,440
and then say again yes to this meditation period

56
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,360
to the practice of meditation now

57
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,479
yes

58
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:19,919
it may be a yes again for being mindful being aware here and

59
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,479
now yes this is the practice

60
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:39,518
perhaps yes that doesn't disturb

61
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,800
whatever degree of calm or quiet there is inside

62
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:52,240
but it does gently animate it energize it

63
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:58,240
with a sense of purpose sense of

64
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:06,200
willing to engage to practice

65
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:20,760
and then if you're going to be with your breathing during the sitting

66
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:31,360
maybe your label your note for the exhale can be yes

67
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:39,040
or for the inhale gentle quiet quieting yes

68
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,760
that keeps you on track keeps you here

69
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:53,120
a certain heightened

70
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,279
attentiveness to just this moment of practice

71
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:06,880
here now yes this is the place to be to practice

72
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,959
in this body at this time

73
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,839
an affirmation that gives some

74
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,680
weight or intenseness

75
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,839
to being here and now with a quiet attentive mind

76
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,079
so

77
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,798
so

78
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,760
so

79
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,799
so

80
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:59,000
so

81
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:11,240
so

82
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,960
so

83
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,360
so

84
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:33,120
it is all too easy to say

85
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,880
maybe unconsciously yes to a distracted mind

86
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,919
instead say yes to being here and now in this practice

87
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:54,960
of mindfulness let that yes

88
00:23:54,960 --> 00:24:01,200
that affirmation of the practice the desire to do it

89
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:08,520
emerge arise out of the depth of your being

90
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:41,640
so

91
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,080
so

92
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

93
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:32,559
to turn the attention outward into the world the world that is filled with both

94
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:35,840
suffering and happiness

95
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:44,240
filled with potential for greater suffering and greater happiness

96
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:51,600
and the look upon that world with a yes

97
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:59,919
to meeting it caring for it valuing all the people and beings of

98
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:03,158
this world

99
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:12,720
and saying yes to whatever movement of heart you might have

100
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:19,120
that wishes for the happiness and welfare of others for everyone

101
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:25,759
may all beings be happy

102
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:32,158
may all beings be safe

103
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,840
may all beings be peaceful

104
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,760
and may all beings be free

105
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:51,039
and may the wholesome desire to

106
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:57,120
work for this possibility may it live in us

107
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:05,278
for our own welfare and happiness as well may we become freer

108
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,960
through the desire to bring freedom to others

109
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:20,680
[Music] so

110
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:30,770
[Music]

111
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,919
you

112
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,640
um

113
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:33,520
so hello everyone and greetings on this beginning of the week

114
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,640
and this week what i'd like to do

115
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:45,360
is to pair up for these five days

116
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,919
teachings about five things that tie us down five things which bind us

117
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,919
with five things that untie us which unbind us

118
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:06,000
and i think often um this tradition of ours

119
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:11,120
tends to have a lot of lists for things that are the attachments and

120
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:18,159
the defilements and what brings us suffering but to clearly uh link these to their

121
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,679
opposite that which moves in the other direction i think we'll clarify

122
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:32,278
some of what this buddhist practice is about so the first so these five will be um

123
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,120
raga dosa moha

124
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,360
the moment i can't remember the pali for the fourth

125
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,720
conceit and ditty views and

126
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:55,279
the um so these are sometimes translated into english the first one is greed but

127
00:31:55,279 --> 00:32:01,600
there's another word that's a better fit for greed and the word raga

128
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:08,480
is often translated into english as lust or passion and then there's

129
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:14,799
aversion or hostility delusion and conceit

130
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:21,360
and speculative views being caught up in stories and opinions

131
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:28,000
and the opposite of those because a variety of things but ardency and determination

132
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:33,360
is a kind of desire healthy desire restraint and avoiding

133
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,880
is a healthy kind of aversion in a sense and a

134
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:46,080
and instead of delusion there is insight and understanding instead of conceit there is a powerful

135
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:51,519
form of confidence that we might almost say self-confidence

136
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:56,720
and then in instead of speculative use being caught up in

137
00:32:56,720 --> 00:33:03,200
opinions and all that there is um a real understanding

138
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:08,960
um so um so the first one raga

139
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:14,559
pairing that up with ardency with determination perseverance engagement a

140
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:20,080
desire to practice and here we point out that

141
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:25,519
there's often assumption that buddhism is critical of desires that all desires

142
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:30,880
are somehow wrong and the problem of life is that we have desires and

143
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:36,080
the ending of desires is the whole point of all this

144
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:43,600
um what we're ending is unhealthy desires desires which keep us limited uh in

145
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:50,240
bondage caught up in themselves and uh and we're awakening within us within

146
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:57,360
us desires for freedom desires which are healthy and healing and beneficial

147
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:02,640
and that it not just simply awakening healthy desires but also

148
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:08,878
letting become strong uh you know a real sense of

149
00:34:08,879 --> 00:34:15,440
ardency of ardor of dedication getting oriented and organized like this

150
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:21,440
is important and really doing it putting our some some of us put some

151
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:28,720
people life and our life energy behind this this is what we're doing no question about it

152
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:36,638
and um and this difference between desires that bind us and desires which untie us that

153
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:43,760
free us is such an important distinction and that plays itself out in all five of

154
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:48,800
these that we're going to talk about this week that it's a distinction we want to learn to

155
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:55,440
be wise about to recognize the distinction between um

156
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:05,760
that which brings strain brings stress brings despair brings contraction

157
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:11,920
brings feel kind of limited and narrow versus that which helps us to feel

158
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,240
expansive and open and happy and free and and uh

159
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:24,400
one uh then narrowing contracting does reinforce conceit that tightening up the

160
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:30,320
inward focus of suffering um that that suffering brings is is a

161
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:38,000
birth or a certain kind of very tight kind of self-preoccupation whereas the expansive movement of uh of

162
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,400
the path of the practice of possibility of freedom tends to free us from excessive

163
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:51,760
self-preoccupation from this tightening around self and with that it it gives room

164
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:58,480
for there to emerge all kinds of wonderful qualities of heart inner qualities of

165
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:05,359
love of compassion love of freedom love of truth that love of peace all kinds of things

166
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:11,720
that come that are freeing of self speaking of the self-preoccupation

167
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:17,599
so um on one hand for this for today we have a raga

168
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:23,680
and raga as i said is often translated as lust sometimes as

169
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:30,800
passion and there is a raga which is the lust or the passion

170
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:37,440
for the senses and there is the lust for

171
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,880
raga the lust or the passion for views and stories

172
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:52,960
what it is is a strong intense form of compulsive desire

173
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,720
it i think of it as a driveness that desires which has us by the nose

174
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,480
and we have almost no cho no choice but to follow follow it or be pushed around by

175
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:10,560
it or give into it it's a very very compelling

176
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:16,320
and uh so compulsive passion so sometimes in modern english the word

177
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:23,440
passion is a very positive quality and when it's used to translate text

178
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:29,040
buddhist texts it's it's really a strong very strong

179
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:36,520
compulsive um force where there's no freedom in it a comp

180
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:41,839
compulsivity that involves suffering which is the original i think latin

181
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:48,160
meaning for the word passion the passion of christ was a suffering of christ

182
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:56,400
and um and so and raga is one of the fundamental sources for

183
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:04,400
suffering for bondage it is one of the one of the ways that three poisons

184
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:10,160
are listed that they're raga is something which is poisonous

185
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:16,480
and um so you might protest a little bit that but you have to appreciate that the

186
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:21,599
definition of whatever raga is is that it's a poison

187
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:27,839
is it it's a it's a uh it's something which hurts something has

188
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:34,720
has barbs and thorns in it that are often not seen because the promise of compulsive

189
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:40,079
desires of different kinds the promise is a promise of pleasure that

190
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:46,079
comes along with imaginations of pleasure and how wonderful it will be and how much good it's going to do us

191
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:52,480
and so we're tricks sometimes about the imagination and

192
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,480
by the by the future what's possibilities are so that we're not really present for the

193
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:04,079
cost of these compulsive desires in the present moment

194
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,800
and and but it becomes clear and clear these kinds of this kind of study this

195
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,400
kind of exploration when we meditate to argue about

196
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:22,320
desires without meditating probably is not going to be very productive

197
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:29,839
but as we begin meditating and getting quieter and stiller more mindful then we start seeing

198
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,520
the cost of what happens in our minds and something that to seem defined in

199
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:41,119
daily life because we're not really that sensitive as we go about daily life

200
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:47,760
we see that meditation is actually quite limiting it's quite not only limiting but it's

201
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,280
quite undermining of ourselves or brings a kind of stress and tension

202
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:58,880
that is very different from a calm quiet meditation where the mind is open and

203
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,119
relaxed and present and so in meditation it's a wonderful laboratory to see

204
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:11,040
when that the shortcomings of um

205
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:17,680
of uh compulsion shortcomings of of passionate

206
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:24,720
cravings and clingings the passion for power the passion for money the passion for the lust for money

207
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:30,560
the lust for power exactly the english words we want to use

208
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:36,839
to translate raga is not so clear but the raga uh all

209
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:42,960
uh it is not something that goes away quickly it's also something which slowly over

210
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:48,560
time fades away and uh one of the meetings of raga is a die

211
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:54,480
and the movement of the practice is v raga which is a fading of the day

212
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:00,000
so fading of of lust of this drivenness and how does it fade away

213
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:05,119
well partly by the opposite there has to be a strong desire

214
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:10,160
and it's the desire for freedom can be as strong or stronger than any

215
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:17,359
compulsive desire we have provided that there is not compulsion in that

216
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:24,560
there's not tension or strain in that desire the buddha emphasized a lot of words

217
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,720
for having strong desire for practice ardency ardor

218
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:38,079
sometimes it's translating to english the word striving a word which really is resisted by western english dharma

219
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:45,599
teachers even myself i hesitate to use the word striving because english speakers will often feel

220
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:52,319
tense from that and like straining if they're striving it's kind of synonymous synonymous with strain

221
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:57,920
but the the determination

222
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:03,920
the perseverance a big yes that's why i like the word yes

223
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:08,960
because it has this uplifting and opening quality to practice with a yes

224
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:16,720
this is what i'm doing i'm practicing on the path of freedom practicing yes to be present here

225
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,839
and so i uh we are allowed in buddhist practice

226
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,520
to have a strong dedication strong devotion to

227
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:33,040
the path of freedom and which might mean that we give it a

228
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:38,400
big priority in our life we maybe clear the table clear our lives

229
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:44,160
a lot of things which distract distract from that some of them might be worthwhile in

230
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:49,280
their own right but we have you know really an important thing to do

231
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,880
uh this path of freedom and to feel that desire to feel that awaken and

232
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:01,760
and to heed it to listen to it yes this is what i'm going to do

233
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:07,760
and certainly that would be nice to make that yes as a counter

234
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:14,240
to the ways in which we desire limit us constrict us

235
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:21,520
undermine us drain us or bring us in immeasurable suffering of

236
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:28,079
all kinds to have another path and to feel

237
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:35,920
the possibility of saying yes to it in a strong determined way this we're allowed to do in buddhism

238
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:41,200
a message with some peop some people don't hear

239
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,480
they hear the opposite uh almost like you just accept and be present and

240
00:43:46,480 --> 00:43:52,160
in some kind of gentle soft way but to um

241
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:57,280
and um don't try a lot but trying

242
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:03,040
with this healthy desire is one of the great pleasures of life so

243
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,880
the pleasure of practice with enthusiasm the kind of enthusiasm that helps the

244
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,079
mind quiet and become peaceful and as i said

245
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:23,200
the laboratory of meditation is one of the great places to discover how there can be strong healthy desire

246
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:29,040
in a way that helps bring greater peace greater calm greater settledness

247
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:36,000
calm peace and strong order can go hand in hand

248
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:41,599
and so thank you

249
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:48,960
for this and i hope this has given you something to consider and for you to spend some time the next

250
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:55,520
day to see if you can find out the physical emotional mental

251
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,720
distinction sensations experience the difference between

252
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:06,640
a compulsive desire and freeing desire and if you can see that difference

253
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:13,520
maybe you can set your freeing desire free to support you in your life

254
00:45:13,520 --> 00:45:16,760
thank you
