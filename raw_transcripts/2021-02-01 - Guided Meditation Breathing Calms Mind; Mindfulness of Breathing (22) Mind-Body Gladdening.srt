00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:11,120
this weekend i learned that in a south african

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:19,119
country uh in south african con language that the word for hello

3
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,480
is i see you and the

4
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:34,640
african person who told me this speaks the language i said that i see you has a kind of opening

5
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:43,440
impact it's kind of a different way of connecting to people than saying hello and and then this idea to be seen

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:50,239
and it is little you know a little bit odd too i can't see any of you that i'm i'm speaking to but i do see the

7
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:56,879
chats and i so much appreciate the greetings and the connection and i sit down here and

8
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,079
delighted to begin the mornings this way

9
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:12,720
so maybe in a figurative way i see you and offer you my greetings and uh

10
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:20,640
so um in important ways

11
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,920
the breathing how we breathe the experience of breathing is a reflection of what's happening in

12
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:34,000
the mind the mind is tense the breathing is tense

13
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:39,840
certain emotions in the mind or in the heart stimulate the breathing in one way and

14
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:46,159
other emotions do it a different way it's also to some degree true of the body as a whole there's something about

15
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:52,240
when we sit down to meditate some way in which we experience the body which does in fact

16
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,680
express or mirrors what's happening in the mind and it's kind of a profound thing to

17
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:05,680
appreciate this or to actually see how this works it's not obvious maybe in on the surface but then the

18
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,480
it works in the other direction that as the breathing changes it changes the mind as

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,520
the mind as the body somehow changes it changes the mind

20
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:24,319
and i say this as we begin as we often do with relaxing the body as a way of

21
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:30,319
entering into meditation and but relaxing the body and adjusting the

22
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:37,360
breathing are not just done for the sake of physically settling in and being here

23
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:43,920
it also is a kind of a an influence a healthy good influence on the mind or

24
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:51,440
the heart so for example as we relax the body perhaps that has a maybe we feel a

25
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:59,120
little bit safer maybe we feel a sense of safety or at least less fear or less anxiety

26
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:05,040
or less tension less and that as feeling less tension in the

27
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:12,800
body uh allow that to translate or to weft or influence the mind feeling less

28
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,480
tense as well and so the relaxing the body is

29
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:25,200
part of also preparing the mind for meditation and i'll talk more about

30
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:30,959
this during the talk so to take a to assume a meditation

31
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:39,280
posture and gently close your eyes

32
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:49,120
and with your eyes closed to spend a little bit of time rocking back and forth swaying back and

33
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,000
forth to see if you can find just kind of stretch and kind of awaken your body a little

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:03,840
bit and have a sense of your body in space and then maybe feel the contact with

35
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,360
your sitting bones if you're sitting against your cushion or chair

36
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,799
and then come to center looking for a way of sitting that feels like your

37
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,160
weight of your body is balanced in some way if you're sitting upright

38
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:29,280
that the weight of your body is centered over the sitting bones you're not leaning forward or or not um

39
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:36,000
you know your center of gravity is not behind you but because you're leaning backwards

40
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:45,919
and then to take a few long slow deep breaths

41
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,199
not only to feel your body more fully but to establish the connection between

42
00:04:55,199 --> 00:05:01,040
the mind and the body more consciously

43
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,880
kind of create open the channels the communication between the mind and

44
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,840
the body

45
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:25,360
feeling the rib cage stretch and expand as you breathe in and feeling the same rib cage maybe

46
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:32,240
collapse or contract as you settle in when you exhale

47
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:43,520
and then as you exhale long deep exhale see if you can relax and soften

48
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,160
your body

49
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:57,520
shoulders belly and as you take a long exhale

50
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,680
and relax the body let that have an influence on the mind quieting of the

51
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,840
mind relaxing of the mind

52
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,840
and then letting your breathing return to normal

53
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:29,440
and see that if we also do some more relaxing and see if there's some way maybe subtle

54
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:34,479
way that relaxing the body

55
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,720
has an influence on relaxing the mind as well

56
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:49,840
so beginning by on the exhale relaxing the muscles of the face

57
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:17,840
as you exhale softening the shoulders releasing them to the pull of gravity

58
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:27,039
maybe the weight of the arms encourages the shoulders to release a

59
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,840
little bit

60
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:45,840
perhaps relaxing your hands any tightening in the fingers

61
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,120
and as if the mind participates in the relaxation

62
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:10,840
relax the chest the center of your chest your heart

63
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,840
center

64
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,680
softening the belly

65
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,840
and as it softens the softening in the

66
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
mind

67
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:10,560
softening in the lower waist and lower back

68
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,640
and relaxing the thighs

69
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:37,839
and then to feel your body in some global way

70
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:51,839
and then as you exhale to relax the whole body

71
00:09:53,279 --> 00:10:05,839
easing up in any way in which you're bracing yourself against life

72
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:23,760
and then bringing your attention to your forehead

73
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,839
behind your forehead and the area of the brain

74
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:36,160
feeling any tension or holding pressure that might be there

75
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:44,880
agitation and as you exhale

76
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:47,839
relax

77
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:57,920
let the thinking muscle relax the tensions and pressure associated with

78
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,320
thinking associated with worrying

79
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:15,839
associated with wanting

80
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:29,360
and then once again feel the global body

81
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:37,839
in whatever way that's easy for you to the degree to which it's easy

82
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,839
perhaps you feel subtleness or a tingling or

83
00:11:45,839 --> 00:11:53,839
aliveness warmth some energy

84
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:57,839
coursing through your body

85
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,320
maybe even you can notice some feelings of contentment

86
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:11,839
or peacefulness in your body

87
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:25,839
and then within the body as part of the bodily experience become aware of breathing

88
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:39,200
and gently maybe slightly at the end of the exhale

89
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:45,920
relaxing the breathings maybe you breathe

90
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,720
exhale a little longer

91
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:59,760
at the top of the inhale a subtle relaxation releasing

92
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:07,839
maybe the inhale continues a little more

93
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:34,639
and then can you make some small adjustments to the breathing so breathing is more

94
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:42,240
pleasant more enjoyable not dramatically but just a little bit more

95
00:13:42,240 --> 00:14:03,839
breathing a little slower a little faster a little longer or shorter

96
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:10,320
looking for whatever subtle pleasure there is

97
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:17,839
in your breathing

98
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:42,560
and quieting the thinking mind

99
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:59,839
so there can be more intimacy with the experience of breathing

100
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:39,240
and if there could be if there is any coziness

101
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:46,639
contentment just being here in your body

102
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,839
or satisfaction

103
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:58,160
being connected to your bodily experience directly

104
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:05,839
even if it's uncomfortable

105
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:11,520
maybe you can allow the mind and heart

106
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:23,199
to share with some of that contentment or coziness or satisfaction

107
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:47,840
content just to sit here breathing in this living pulsing body

108
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,240
there is an intimacy and deep connection between the mind and the

109
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:46,840
body that functions more deeply or more

110
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:53,440
clearly when the thinking mind is quieter

111
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,360
gently letting go of your thoughts

112
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:07,679
appreciating the ways in which the mind can be quieter stiller so

113
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:17,039
there's a richer connection awareness of the body breathing

114
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:25,200
and the goodness of breathing where the relaxation of the body

115
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:45,840
can have a nice influence on the mind

116
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:56,640
perhaps there's a way you can soften your belly more relax it

117
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,440
to settle your breathing further

118
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:08,400
and to reassure the mind and heart

119
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:21,840
breathing in and breathing out

120
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:05,360
and then when we breathe

121
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,279
we breathe together with all breathing life

122
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:18,398
we share it with all of everyone else who's breathing

123
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:27,039
it's our common humanity that we all require breathing

124
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:34,799
to not only to live but for their whole inner life to be

125
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:41,840
functioning well

126
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:54,960
and while we might wish at the end of the sitting for all beings to be well and happy and free

127
00:29:54,960 --> 00:30:02,880
we could also wish them to have an easeful breath

128
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:09,840
for their breathing to be easeful and comfortable

129
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:15,278
relaxed open breathing

130
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:24,559
because this way of breathing is deeply connected to being happy and

131
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,760
safe and free

132
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:37,840
may all beings have an easeful breath

133
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:46,080
may all beings breathe with reassurance and safety

134
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:54,159
may all beings feel delight

135
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,120
with their breathing as they breathe

136
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:09,440
and may it be that we live together with other people

137
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:14,960
so that we do not we're not the cause and condition

138
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,840
for their breathing to be tense

139
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:29,279
shallow tight may we be a condition and a cause

140
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:35,679
to support others to breathe at ease happily and peacefully

141
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:44,320
and perhaps we can coexist with an easeful breath

142
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:53,278
and the best in all of us has a chance to come forth may all beings

143
00:31:53,840 --> 00:32:01,840
breathe peacefully

144
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:09,859
[Music]

145
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:51,919
so i'd like to make a couple of announcements before giving the talk

146
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:01,760
i mentioned some time ago that i'd like to offer you a chance to have some longer meditations

147
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:06,880
in the morning like we're doing here we've been doing this for a long time and

148
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,200
some of us together and some of you are ready for sitting for more than 30 minutes some of

149
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:19,279
you are yeah you're ready and it'd be actually be helpful to have a little longer sit

150
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:24,799
and also for this topic of anapanasati i think that mindfulness of breathing having a little

151
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:29,840
more more practice with it and a little longer sitting would be good as well

152
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:37,279
and so what i like to do is in two weeks i think i believe it's uh the 15th

153
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:45,440
of february on the 14th i begin a retreat and and so i'd like to

154
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:51,200
integrate the morning sitting with the retreat and the retreat with the morning

155
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:56,399
sitting and have our sitting start at 6 45 california time

156
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:02,240
so 15 minutes earlier than we usually do so we can have 45 minutes together and

157
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:07,919
and and i still still do the guided part but there'll be more time for silence from

158
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:15,040
settling in and i think this will also be very good because of the topics we're coming to um the

159
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,800
uh by then i think we'll be maybe at steps

160
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:27,679
9 and 10 which has to do with aspects of really really experiencing

161
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:33,200
the mind and so anyway so that's coming up

162
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:40,320
and you can certainly join us at 7. there's no problem with that i think but if that's what your schedule allows

163
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,320
but that's the plan we'll do that for one week and

164
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:52,800
and so i'll announce that a few times or so make sure people know about the change and the other is

165
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:58,480
that um the retreat that i'm doing at that time and the following retreat at insight

166
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:04,640
retreat center the um we've kind of arranged to have

167
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:11,680
uh it's full the retreats but for but we have arranging to have spots for auditors and if some of you

168
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:18,079
would like to participate in the retreat and happy especially if you've been on a retreat before and know the you know the basic routine of how to

169
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:25,920
practice that way you're welcome to sign up to be an auditor and and uh in doing so you might we have

170
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,440
auditor teachers we have a teacher for it that is available to have uh drop in

171
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:36,880
group discussions with it with the um the auditor so they feel a little bit supported

172
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:42,839
and but that auditor teacher won't give any teachings they'll just be there to support the auditors

173
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:50,000
so um so anyway so some of you might want to do that and participate and i think that

174
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:56,320
the theme for that retweet starting on the 14th of february is refuge and so we'll go through the

175
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:01,520
idea of refuge as a as a wonderful topic itself but also as a

176
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:13,838
support for the deepening practice of meditation on retreat

177
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:18,000
so

178
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:29,280
so last week for ana panasati talked about the steps

179
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:36,560
five and six five is um breathing in experiencing joy breathing

180
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:43,280
out experiencing joy and then six is breathing in breathing in

181
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:50,240
experiencing happiness breathing out experiencing happiness and uh the movement from joy to

182
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:57,040
happiness is a move towards tranquility the mind the body becoming more tranquil

183
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:02,640
where the joy factor is a little more energetic and the and the happiness

184
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:08,880
quality is more subtle more peaceful tranquil kind of sense of well-being

185
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:15,839
and that movement from something is a little more energetic to this more tranquil is characterizes

186
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:21,280
the whole process of deepening meditation in buddhism that we're going from coarser states to

187
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,200
more refined subtler states of being we're going for more active ways of engaging

188
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:34,400
and as the mind settles down we're moving towards a clarity and an alertness and a

189
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,440
peacefulness that where there's things become

190
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:45,440
the mind becomes less active more peaceful more softer and so the quieting of the mind the

191
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:51,839
requiring the activity settling and settling is kind of the movement we're going here

192
00:37:51,839 --> 00:38:00,560
and and that's kind of like so the principle of going from coarse to refined or more active to more tranquil states

193
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:06,000
and tranquil doesn't mean that we go sleep or that we become dull the movement is to a

194
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:13,440
tranquility that's quite alert or has a lot of clarity to it um but there's less activity and it's

195
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:18,880
fascinating process to see this and one of the things we start seeing is this relationship between the

196
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:24,480
mind and the body and and

197
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:32,880
so the first tetrad steps one to four are kind of about the body and

198
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:39,359
and but it's not the physical body in and of itself it's more the body that um that we

199
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:44,960
experience with experience is very much

200
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:50,400
influenced by what's going on in the mind and there's a reciprocal relationship

201
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:56,079
that as uh the mind as the body settles down we get more focused on the body and it

202
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,280
relaxes more the fourth step is to relax the body that also has a

203
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:07,760
relaxing effect on the mind and other effects beneficial effects in the minds it's reassuring for the mind it

204
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:14,560
brings a sense of safety to the mind peacefulness to the mind subtleness focused in mind it's easier

205
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:20,079
to be in the present moment and and then we go into the second tetrad

206
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:25,520
now with steps six seven eight five six seven and eight

207
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:33,359
that um now we're beginning to enter into the world of the mind uh that is not separated from the body

208
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:40,960
these two are inter interlinked but we're moving into the area of the mind and the qualities of joy and happiness

209
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:48,079
are a bridge between this because the joy and happiness is felt in an embodied way

210
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:53,440
and uh and but it's very much influenced by the concentration level of the mind the

211
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,920
focus of the mind the peacefulness of the mind and and then there's a reciprocal relationship as there's more joy and

212
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:05,280
happiness that courses through the body then that reassures the mind more and allah

213
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:12,400
and reassure a reassured mind will feel like it doesn't need to think so much and ruminate so much and

214
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:18,480
can get quieter so kind of this bridge with joy and happiness between

215
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:24,319
the kind of the body and the mind is really worth lingering with and developing and

216
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:31,200
and uh and i know it's a little hard for us from oftentimes to feel joy and happiness and short notice

217
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:37,599
and just will it up like that but um even if you don't feel this during this

218
00:40:37,599 --> 00:40:42,960
time when this section of the of the practice um it maybe just

219
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:49,119
imagine it or not imagine you're having it but but develop a kind of a intuitive sense

220
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:54,319
of it or learn these teachings and sooner and later hopefully you'll recognize a little bit this

221
00:40:54,319 --> 00:41:01,680
meditative embodied joy happiness well-being that can happen as we as we practice and some people are

222
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:07,200
surprised or delighted that they're given permission to feel pleasure in meditation

223
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:14,560
permission to feel joy and happiness and um and definitely this is really the

224
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:19,599
considered to be very important foundation for moving forward

225
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,720
um in many many places in sutas the buddha actually describes a process

226
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:32,480
of of steepening practice that is called the gladness the gladness

227
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:40,400
sequence or the gladness pentad because those are five steps and these are acquiring gladness

228
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:46,800
in meditation and then it the description is is very kind of intransitive or passive it's

229
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:53,119
like from we're not doing the next steps they just flow as one becomes

230
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:59,200
mature it flows into the next flows into the next we do our practice and the practice

231
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:04,720
begins practicing us something begins shifting and changing and we don't have to be so responsible

232
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:11,200
except to be really present for the experience so with the gladness there arises

233
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:19,920
joy with the joy when it's mature there arises a tranquility of the body

234
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:27,520
with the tranquility of the body there arises happiness and with the arising of happiness

235
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:34,800
they're there with the maturity of happiness there rises uh concentration unification

236
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:40,480
being really unified and sitting and feeling very whole here in the present moment and this

237
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:46,319
wonderful kind of pattern the gladness sequence gladness joy tranquility happiness and

238
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:52,800
concentration unifi samadhi now what's interesting and what i want to emphasize today is

239
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:58,480
the the first step is feeling a sense of gladness

240
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:04,800
and the gladness comes from being inspired by something and this uh the buddha really

241
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,319
understands the value of becoming inspired being glad and being delighted

242
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:16,800
by some aspects of what's happening in our practice or in our lives so that it kind of that certain kind of

243
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:22,640
gladness that we don't get lost in our thoughts and stories and imagining over and over again what happened

244
00:43:22,640 --> 00:43:29,359
but we use our imagination just enough to have that gladness begin settling us

245
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:34,480
into the present moment more and more settling us into them into the body

246
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:41,920
and this use of the imagination to help us to not make us go wandering away but using the imagination

247
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:49,920
to allow us to be inspired is one of the supports for meditation practice

248
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:57,200
and and how that inspiration can be not forced not imaginary not

249
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:03,440
an avoidance of the present moment but really a support for really connecting in a deeper and deeper way

250
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:10,400
in an honest way with what's really happening in our lives what's really present is one of the great benefits of dharma

251
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:18,880
practice to be able to be present even for difficult things with some form of well-being

252
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:25,520
some form of may sometimes joy delight gladness that holds it all not to be

253
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:32,560
removed from this challenges and suffering of the life of life but to really in some sense be receptive

254
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,240
to it in a really deep way and not be a victim of it not be oppressed by it

255
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:43,440
but to have compassion and love as a possible response

256
00:44:43,440 --> 00:44:49,680
so what i'd like to do for the next maybe a couple of days and we'll see how far we go is talk a little bit more about the

257
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,599
buddha's emphasis or use of imagination focus on teachings on imagination

258
00:44:55,599 --> 00:45:01,520
both as what gets in our way for meditation interferes with it but also in ways in

259
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:08,880
which it supports meditation and and and this seems like a very nice

260
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:14,480
bridge between the mind and the body this part we're talking about joy and happiness but

261
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:22,720
because this imagination is very much to do with this happiness and joy qualities and and to how to

262
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,480
evoke joy and happiness with gladness with uh what inspires us

263
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:35,760
through by thinking about it or something so that's a topic and and uh and hopefully you'll get a sense

264
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:40,800
as we go through these teachings that how it's useful in connecting you

265
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:48,480
to uh this steps uh five and six joy and happiness and creates a very good foundation

266
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:54,800
for the continued settling uh becoming more tranquil the mind becoming

267
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:00,880
more peaceful it's a preparation for that so we can look and start looking more deeply at

268
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:08,400
the mind itself and the and the quieting settling pacifying of the mind so that it becomes

269
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:15,280
an instrument of awakening so um that's the introduction for

270
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:25,040
this week and i look forward to our time tomorrow and and um delighted to um

271
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,839
to share this time with you thank you
