1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:11,280
so it's nice to be here and see all of you is the sound okay you hear the okay

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,600
great so I'll start this morning with a

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:24,539
proposal and it's something that can be verified with mindfulness

4
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:31,519
and that is that the human mind has a lot of desires

5
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:40,379
so what I'm calling desire here is quite broad let's say that it refers to any

6
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:47,040
kind of wanting whether gross or subtle so you know we have a desire for food

7
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:52,140
when we're hungry we have desire if we're

8
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,539
hoping to get home in time to get to an important Zoom meeting

9
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:04,320
or I had the desire to drive to Redwood City this morning at some level otherwise I probably

10
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,420
wouldn't have gotten here and sometimes desire comes in the form

11
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,960
of not wanting something right we maybe we want the neighbor's dog to stop

12
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:24,360
barking or also this morning while I was driving here there was a squirrel crossing the

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,520
lane in front of me there were no other cars coming but halfway across the road

14
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:36,060
it changed his mind and came back and and so I slowed way down it wasn't clear

15
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,939
which way it was going to go and I definitely I felt my mind narrowing which it does through desire but I

16
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:48,060
didn't want to hurt the squirrel I had a strong desire not to hit the squirrel with my car

17
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,780
and luckily it headed back into the grass so you know there's a lot of desires and

18
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,820
then there can be more subtle desires like while we're while we're sitting

19
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:05,960
often it's hard to sit in the same position for a long time we actually will subtly shift our weight

20
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:13,560
even when we're meditating sometimes but also on the computer and that's just because you know there's a desire to

21
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,020
move or shift the body isn't meant to be in the same position for a long time

22
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:24,959
or we can sit in meditation and subtly be holding on to a state of calm for

23
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:31,620
example we want that to continue now that we've got it so

24
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,959
there's a lot so let me ask a question then how many

25
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,120
of you would agree if I say that the second Noble

26
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:49,920
Truth of the cause of suffering says that the cause of suffering is desire

27
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,640
yeah that's often what we hear I see some hands not not not all the hands

28
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:04,200
so you know there's a lot of wanting in the mind and what's going on with that and so another

29
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:10,080
proposal that can also be checked is that at some level we tend to think that

30
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:16,920
fulfilling our desires is going to bring happiness or at least it's going to make things better than it is now so we

31
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,080
fulfill desire after desire to try to get things that we like or get things

32
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:28,319
that feel Pleasant so that we can sustain a sense of some kind of happiness or ease or safety or

33
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,739
well-being whatever word we use for it so it's actually not such a ridiculous

34
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:39,959
idea to to want those things in our life

35
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:46,440
um but it may not be complete have the idea that we need to keep

36
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:52,560
wanting things and getting them in order to be safe or happy or have well-being

37
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,319
and if we practice mindfulness we will start to see more of the picture

38
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,739
so if we keep looking with mindfulness there's a couple things we might see there's a lot of things we might see but

39
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:10,980
I'll just highlight a couple of them one of them is that it is not entirely

40
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,019
the case that we can become Happy by fulfilling desires

41
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:23,280
how many would agree with that yeah so nearly all the hands went up for that one so you know it's it's tiring to

42
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,180
constantly be going from thing to thing to thing and we have to keep at it right because each one lasts for a while but

43
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,840
not forever so there's always and then there's always one more thing coming one more refinement one more next thing that we

44
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,440
want and all of this is not entirely in our control is it you know at some level we

45
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:48,960
understand that the things that we want we don't have complete ability to get

46
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,419
some things it's easy sort of it's pretty likely you can take your

47
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:59,580
next breath but not always right but that's pretty

48
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:06,240
likely that one's pretty likely but other things that we try to get that we have to buy or that we have to go and

49
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,340
acquire or get from somebody else there's a whole other set of conditions

50
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:18,540
out there that are not in our control about whether we can get that right if we start looking more clearly

51
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:24,419
so we may not be able to get what we want or get rid of what we don't want

52
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:31,020
how about that what does the Mind do with that so our quest to find happiness by

53
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,840
fulfilling desires gets more and more suspect as we practice mindfulness

54
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:44,220
and then maybe the second thing that we would realize is that not all desires are actually harmful for

55
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,440
us not completely I deliberately painted a little bit of a complex picture at the

56
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,440
beginning with all the things that I pointed toward so some desires might be

57
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:03,419
useful on the spiritual path maybe right and some of the very real happiness that

58
00:06:03,419 --> 00:06:10,380
we get from fulfilling desires because there is a kind of Happiness we get from that some of that might be good for us

59
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:16,199
you know how about the peace that you get from coming to IMC or watching on

60
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:23,759
YouTube you know that seems useful doesn't it settle the heart and mind better than doing something else with this hour hour

61
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:33,300
and a half so we're gonna have to look more carefully at these issues of desire and wanting

62
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,660
so I'll just say clearly so it's so it's stated are all desires bad

63
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:46,020
no no but we have to have a lot of wisdom about that

64
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:52,139
so yeah the Buddha was actually quite nuanced in his teachings on desire he

65
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:58,620
taught in different ways at different times he taught different people differently knowing where they were on the spiritual path

66
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:05,880
but basically he noticed I think he was brilliant that he noticed that there is in the mind a tendency to move toward

67
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:11,280
things also a tendency to move away which is related you know we're here and

68
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:16,500
we want to move toward there let's broadly call that desire and so he

69
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:23,580
thought well you know people have this tendency of wanting to move toward and away which is to some degree equality of

70
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:29,039
the unawakened mind but we have it so why not use it why not use it on the

71
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:35,039
path to move toward things that are actually helpful so I want to talk about this

72
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:40,620
desire that we have this movement toward I like

73
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:46,800
to say that there's a broad range of Desire or a diversity of Desire

74
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:53,520
kind of like a spectrum of Desire but it's not really linear it's not really a linear sequence it's more like a space

75
00:07:53,520 --> 00:08:00,060
so I'm going to frame it today as five aspects of Desire or five classes of

76
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,160
Desire this is not a canonical list from the Buddha but all of them are talked

77
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,699
about in the teachings and I've just kind of gathered them together you can see if it's I hope it's a useful

78
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:16,919
way of classifying things so as we get in touch with these I'm

79
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:23,520
going to talk about each one you might just sense for yourself oh okay is that present in me how does that operate in

80
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:30,780
my life how does that resonate for me so the first kind of Desire clearly in

81
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:37,680
the unwholesome part of the space is the one that's called a tanha that's

82
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:43,260
the Pali word tanha and it literally means thirst but it's usually translated

83
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:49,680
as craving this is a kind of grasping kind of Desire that is obviously painful

84
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:55,080
obviously harmful you know it it's a gripping essentially it relates to lust

85
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,180
or greed or kind of extreme wanting that we have and you know we've we've

86
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:05,399
probably we've all experienced this actually uh and when this kind of craving is

87
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:11,279
about the world of the senses which it often is we call it comma comma tanha

88
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:18,000
which means it's desire for sensual things sense desire or sense pleasure

89
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,760
like the Kama Sutra you may have heard of very much about sensuality

90
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:29,040
and so um kamatanha is strong grasping of sensual

91
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,800
objects it's not really about the object itself it's in the mind you know so we

92
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:40,980
might have strong grasping at ice cream at a certain time and not at another

93
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:48,240
time right it's not about the ice cream it's about how much we wanted at a given time or we might be caught up in how we

94
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:54,899
look you know our clothing our hairdo or various sexual fantasies and desires

95
00:09:54,899 --> 00:10:00,899
a particular form of this kind of Desire is addiction to alcohol or drugs

96
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:07,019
so tanha generally causes trouble for us and it's

97
00:10:07,019 --> 00:10:13,260
a clearly a Troublesome one it can also relate to things that aren't sensual I emphasize that one but there are other

98
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,380
things we can have lust for power or for having a certain identity being a scene

99
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:26,279
in a certain way that can also be the realm of tanha so it's obvious that these kind of desires

100
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:31,980
don't support the path to Liberation right they are themselves binding for

101
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:38,640
the mind and then maybe a second class of desires

102
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,120
basic desires that are related to bodily needs we all have these to need to eat

103
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:52,860
the need to drink they need to use the bathroom so these desires are not usually seen as

104
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,920
inherently harmful but they are somewhat stressful aren't they

105
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,920
how we relate to the desires and needs of the body influences how happy or

106
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:11,760
unhappy we are even awaken people still feel physical hunger and they still have the need to

107
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,459
pee that still happens um there's one suta that says that even

108
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:24,240
arahans who are fully awakened beings feel Sensations that are according to

109
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,480
the suta dependent on the body and conditioned by life so there you go you don't you're not

110
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:36,300
going to overcome those basic things even the Buddha had back pain you know they're not all Pleasant these things

111
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:43,620
related to the body but there is some distinction between beings regarding whether or not these

112
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:49,339
bodily desires bring any dukkha any suffering

113
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:55,560
then there's a third class of Desire very big one that's related to the

114
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,720
desires that it takes to fulfill a human life you know trying to live a typical

115
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,760
human life among other humans we have desires that go with that the desire to

116
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:11,040
find a livelihood may be the desire to have a partner the desire to be part of

117
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:18,000
a community to secure a place to live and have access to food that we like all

118
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:23,220
of these desires this is the world many of us live in from day to day these

119
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,040
desires take a lot of energy a lot of our attention and effort

120
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,760
and they're Myriad I can't even name them all I just named a few relationships politics family life all

121
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:40,920
these worldly desires uh Gill sometimes says that we should call ourselves

122
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:47,339
instead of human beings we should be called human desirlings which I think is that's always struck me

123
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:54,899
I've heard that from him years and years ago and it stuck with me so these kinds of desires are very

124
00:12:54,899 --> 00:13:03,240
interesting for the spiritual path because they're the ones that we tend to defend as normal and even necessary you

125
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:10,740
know if I didn't have those desires what would I do I just sit on the couch all day I'd be you know I'd be a couch potato I wouldn't do anything I couldn't

126
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:16,620
accomplish things I couldn't help people I couldn't serve my family so we tend to

127
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:22,740
mark these desires off as off limits this is necessary we don't even you know

128
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:30,540
how can we even question those the Buddha asked us to put a few question marks on those

129
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:37,320
as to whether or not we have to pursue them with any kind of grasping

130
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:42,779
so it's a big realm for Dharma practice because this realm of desires occupies

131
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:48,000
much of our day these are the ones that we go from one to one to one throughout our day right

132
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,720
so many of them are mild forms of what I call comma before the world of sense

133
00:13:54,720 --> 00:14:02,100
desires and sensual Pleasures not all of them are tanha that grasping kind of Desire but their comma this this world

134
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:07,860
of the senses and we don't have to have deep pathological grasping in order to

135
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:13,500
be somewhat enslaved to our desires and the Buddha asked us to question that

136
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:20,940
enslavement and see if we could find other ways to live our life such that it doesn't have

137
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:26,540
that inherent stress associated with all those things

138
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:33,959
so then continuing with the five classes of Desire with a fourth one I would call

139
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:39,360
our more elevated human wishes um

140
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:44,579
there are various words for this wholesome skillful refined elevated

141
00:14:44,579 --> 00:14:52,079
spiritual choose the word that works for you but these include wishing to be ethical

142
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:59,579
wishing to be kind wanting a peaceful and happy life where we are able to care more about how we're

143
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:06,420
living than about money or status wanting to learn to meditate wanting to

144
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,940
learn the spiritual teachings desire for the well-being of others

145
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:17,279
These are nice desires these are generally very good desires these are

146
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:22,920
the kind of wishes that can serve our Spiritual Development if we engage with

147
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:29,040
them right so the these are the ones where the Buddha used are let's call them elevated

148
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:34,139
desires as part of the path he encouraged us to do these kinds of

149
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:40,860
skillful wishes in order to uplift us or Draw us along the path

150
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:47,339
so when we allow these wishes to be felt in our heart they encourage us towards

151
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:52,620
skillful and wholesome action and the happiness that comes from

152
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:59,160
fulfilling these kinds of desires this fourth class are nourishing they bring a nourishing

153
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:07,019
kind of Happiness to us so these are the wishes that can support confidence ease brightness a certain

154
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:12,360
kind of refined Joy not a bubbly kind of Joy more associated

155
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:18,060
with the sense world but a tranquil kind of joy and that's the kind of pleasure that the

156
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:25,560
Buddha approved of this is from this is actually repeated in several sutas

157
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:30,839
this is called the Bliss of renunciation the Bliss of seclusion the Bliss of

158
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,660
Peace the Bliss of Enlightenment I say this kind of I say of this kind of

159
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:43,860
pleasure that it should be pursued that it should be developed that it should be cultivated and that it should not be

160
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:50,639
feared how about that the Buddha says there are kinds of pleasure that should be pursued

161
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,160
so there's also you know the famous story of the Buddha realizing that all

162
00:16:56,160 --> 00:17:02,279
of the efforts he had done up to now this is the bodhisattva before he was the Buddha realizing that everything

163
00:17:02,279 --> 00:17:09,360
he'd done hadn't brought Awakening yet and he was frustrated all of his aesthetic practices all of his practices

164
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,400
of the formless genres uh and then he thought back to a time in

165
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:19,558
his childhood where he entered meditative absorption as a child sitting

166
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:25,020
under a tree peacefully and how easeful and joyful that felt and he recognized

167
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:31,919
that that was the way forward that was the path this kind of meditative pleasure that he had first felt somewhat

168
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:38,280
spontaneously he then cultivated that under the Bodhi Tree and was able to awaken

169
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:45,539
so these kinds of pleasures and happinesses are part of the path

170
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:52,160
it's important to note that even though that quote I read included the Bliss of Enlightenment these are not the goal

171
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,840
actually so this kind of meditative pleasure that we get that comes kind of

172
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:03,480
as a fruit or a byproduct of calming the mind and calming the body and having

173
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:10,740
bright awareness that is not actually Freedom yet there can still be some

174
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:17,460
delusion in there such as a sense of self or Pride but if we keep up with the mindfulness

175
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:23,700
practice that will be those kind of side points will be seen and addressed at

176
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:28,740
some point and this uh this happiness this meditative happiness will allow us

177
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:37,320
to awaken so that's the fifth class of desire which I think is worth separating out is specifically the aspiration to

178
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:44,160
awaken to be free to be liberated that can take various forms you know

179
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:49,440
what kind of wanting is that so it's wanting to know to discover to

180
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:56,280
investigate to see to touch into to realize to release

181
00:18:56,280 --> 00:19:01,559
these kinds of wishes often these desires and aspirations feel

182
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:08,460
very beautiful very clean very wholesome a little bit distinct from that fourth

183
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:13,559
class where we want to be ethical we want to be kind Etc

184
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:19,320
um sometimes at certain points on the path this fifth kind of desire to awaken

185
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:24,960
can get very strong and then it's called Samuel or some Vega

186
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:32,640
which is often translated as spiritual urgency and maybe you felt that one also

187
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,700
um for some people there's a resonance with the Western idea of a calling a calling

188
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:46,320
to practice a deep sense of wishing to be free sometimes it can be a little bit unpleasant even so at least desires feel

189
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:52,740
beautiful and clean and wholesome and then there can also be get me out and that's part of the process too

190
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:59,059
sometimes this wishing to be free can come really Straight From the Heart

191
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:06,660
so we have these five we have tanha grasping kind of Desire we have basic

192
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:12,539
desires related to fulfilling bodily needs we have the desires that accompany

193
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:20,640
living a human life among other humans we have our more spiritual wishes for

194
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:28,740
kindness for ethics for meditative development and then we specifically have the aspiration to be liberated

195
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:33,960
so they're not quite a linear Spectrum I hope you see they kind of Define a space

196
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:39,720
but nonetheless there is a clear division between unwholesome and wholesome right between unskillful and

197
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:46,620
skillful some of them are blatantly painful you know and those are the ones that we can

198
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:52,919
feel that contraction other ones we tend to make a trade-off you know we say I want this and the

199
00:20:52,919 --> 00:21:00,179
benefits of it are going to be better than the detriments so I'm going for it you know like when we're working a

200
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:05,520
certain job that has some stress associated with it but we need the income so we make these trade-offs in

201
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:12,179
the kind of the middle realm and then um you know there's some of them that are really quite

202
00:21:12,179 --> 00:21:17,940
beautiful and we can fulfill those as much as we want clearly helpful and that

203
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:21,379
will support us on our path

204
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:29,100
so I want to delve now a little bit into

205
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:35,820
that realm that I called the skillful desire because it's not talked about as much as

206
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:41,580
in that way so I hope you're seeing at this point that you know there's a lot of different kinds and we're going to

207
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:48,720
need to be careful about you know which one which side we're on we'll talk about that so what about these skillful desires

208
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:56,760
these wishes that can support the path so in that scheme of five they were the fourth and the fifth but actually I'm

209
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:05,100
going to take a step back into that Third Realm and say that it's important to realize that in order to support our

210
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:12,120
more elevated spiritual refined kind of desires we have to do some work in the

211
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:18,000
realm of the Third Kind of Desire the everyday wants and needs of creating a human life

212
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:23,760
we have to do some Preparatory work in the realm of our life in order to

213
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:29,100
bolster our ability to fully develop these more refined kinds of Desire

214
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:35,039
so in other words we have to set ourselves up we have to set up our life everybody in this room and on YouTube

215
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:42,840
you have set up yourself such that you could be here this morning that's not bad that's already an accomplishment a

216
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:49,740
lot of people haven't done that so we can work in the very ordinary Realm of the sensual world the stuff of

217
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:56,700
our life in order to create conditions that will be able to move forward on the

218
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:02,039
path with the more refined kinds of happiness so there's a couple things I want to say

219
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:09,659
about that first of all we need to simplify we need to simplify our life in certain

220
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:15,059
ways in order to support practice so this is aligning with our our lifestyle

221
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:22,380
with that and I want to read some lines actually from the metasuta

222
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:27,720
from the Buddha's discourse on on meta on loving kindness or good will

223
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:35,100
that are they're right at the beginning and they Point toward a way of being that has an air of

224
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:41,039
Simplicity to it that I find quite touching a way of being that's kind of

225
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:46,860
straightforward and uncomplicated so this is from the armor avati translation of that suta

226
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:54,299
some of you may recognize it because it's done in a chant this is what should be done by one who

227
00:23:54,299 --> 00:24:01,400
is skilled in goodness and who knows the path of peace let them be able and operate

228
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:08,520
straightforward and gentle in speech humble and not conceited contented and

229
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:13,679
easily satisfied unburdened with duties and Frugal in

230
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:21,539
their ways peaceful and calm and wise and skillful not proud and demanding in

231
00:24:21,539 --> 00:24:27,059
nature doesn't it feel nice just to hear that

232
00:24:27,059 --> 00:24:33,179
people who are like that are really nice to be around and this has to do with generating the

233
00:24:33,179 --> 00:24:39,179
conditions for loving-kindness in our life but it points toward a simplification

234
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:44,340
of how we are simplifying our actions simplifying our speech to be

235
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:50,820
straightforward and gentle probably even simplifying our thought processes so that we're not always caught up in a

236
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:57,360
million theories and speculations and anxieties about what other people are thinking about us

237
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:03,720
ah not necessary and not so supportive of our practice

238
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:11,039
so we want to live in a way that has some spaciousness to it to the degree that we can

239
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:17,400
that can be I I support creating some outer spaciousness if we can reducing

240
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:25,919
the amount of running around that we do simplifying our activities bringing in more spiritual friends into our life

241
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:32,820
um but even if you you know those aren't your life conditions you have busyness you have many people you have

242
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:39,840
work that's complex there can be an inner spaciousness in relating to that you know this phrase unburdened with

243
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,059
duties there's a lot to be said for not having too many duties

244
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:50,820
um and if you do there's a way of being unburdened by them right there's a way

245
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:59,580
of relating to them such that they aren't heavy and difficult and stressful for us if we

246
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:05,520
create inner spaciousness around those so if we want a life of practice that

247
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:10,559
includes a life of meta and Good Will and kindness these are these words that

248
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:16,400
I offered give us some touchstones straightforwardness gentleness humble

249
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,559
contented unburdened frugal

250
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:30,600
and so then that leads in to finding ways to relate to the sensory

251
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:37,260
world the material world skillfully so that we can create a sense of Refuge you

252
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:43,500
know of all the vast realm of skillful and desires and wishes I'm talking about

253
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:49,260
just one here but the the desires that help us find refuge and some of those

254
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:55,320
actually come from the sensory World from the material world so the five

255
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:01,020
physical senses seeing hearing smelling tasting and touching can be used or

256
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:07,020
related to in ways that nourish our heart and mind these are often Associated of course the

257
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:14,159
sense realm in Buddhist teachings is often associated with the need for restraint that's the word used and

258
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:21,360
I would agree with that generally because often we're not restrained in that realm and that only leads to stress

259
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,299
and so forth but not all sense stimuli are to be

260
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:32,520
avoided how can we and we we have these sense organs

261
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:38,460
so we don't have to avoid everything we can use the sense World in ways that

262
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:44,520
evoke faith that evoke Refuge that evoke nourishment for us when we're properly

263
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:50,880
attuned we can even use the Sixth Sense which is our cognition our mind in ways

264
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,240
that are nourishing sometimes people have the idea about spiritual practice that anything related

265
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:03,179
to thinking is bad anything related to you know cognizing is very suspect it

266
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:10,140
should all just be kind of I don't know coming from the heart coming from emotions but it's not the case we can

267
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:16,740
use our thinking mind we can use the fullness of our of our mind and heart to

268
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:21,960
nourish us so I want to name a number of ways that

269
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:27,500
we can use the ordinary stuff of our life our six senses

270
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:34,799
as to encourage refuge and a sense of faith and ability to

271
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:41,880
go forward with our practice to align our life with Dharma practice I guess I'll say them somewhat quickly

272
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:49,620
not with a lot of elaboration with the idea that you might just kind of feel which ones resonate for you and maybe

273
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:56,220
you'll also get some new ideas if you let me name a lot of them you'll get some new ideas and say oh you know I'm

274
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:01,440
not really using that realm using that form in a way that could be helpful for

275
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:08,940
me so for some seeing seeing

276
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:14,880
certain objects such as you know the Buddha Rupa for example or images

277
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:22,740
even monastic robes going to see monastics can be deeply nourishing

278
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:28,320
that's interesting there's a way in which our visual senses

279
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:33,360
can um resonate with something in us the

280
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:39,059
posture that the Buddha is in when sitting in these Buddha rupas I don't

281
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:45,360
know if you can see from where you are but there's kind of a elevation of his chest and this is actually deliberate

282
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:52,140
it's meant to evoke a sense of confidence that posture has an uprightness to it you remember that word

283
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:57,960
from what I just read in the metasuta and there's a way in which we can you know we're not going to necessarily

284
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:03,600
literally imitate what a stone figure is doing but there is a way that if we sit

285
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,360
up straight or feel the mirror between us and this Rupa

286
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:15,539
um there's a way that we can actually feel some of that confidence in ourself the posture of the body is not

287
00:30:15,539 --> 00:30:20,760
Irrelevant in how we feel so

288
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:26,039
there's that and then there are there's the beauty of a retreat center it's not

289
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:31,500
an accident that the aesthetic in this room is simple there's this meant to evoke simplicity

290
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:38,059
so that we have Simplicity in the mind also that doesn't mean our mind is simple when it comes here but we can be

291
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:44,460
inspired by that it can be uplifting there's a subtle sense of calm

292
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:52,020
and it might also be that you can feel if you have a certain sensibility when you walk into a room like this can you

293
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:57,360
feel the Stillness in this room because a lot of people have meditated in here

294
00:30:57,360 --> 00:31:04,320
it's been a lot lot of hours of meditation in here and so there's a way in which that I

295
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:12,919
mean that's a sense coming in through our sense doors and yet it can be nourishing for us if we open to it

296
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:20,640
hearing the Dharma has long served as a gateway to profound insight and at a

297
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,159
more ordinary level it's inspirational so you know being here this morning to

298
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:33,059
hear the Dharma and there's also you know a vast number of talks and guided meditations available online and in

299
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:41,940
other forms so listening can be a ready source of support for our practice

300
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:48,659
is that a sense desire to want to hear the Dharma yeah but it's it's um it also

301
00:31:48,659 --> 00:31:54,779
goes in that elevated Realm reading the Dharma is also good you know

302
00:31:54,779 --> 00:32:01,679
reading using the Mind using the cognition I recommend reading the original texts

303
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:08,640
if you're drawn to them of course in English translation there are good English translations available now and

304
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:15,440
there are also some very good modern interpretations by teachers Dharma books of various kinds the Buddha encourages

305
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:21,179
reflection on the teachings you are allowed to think about what you've read

306
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:28,260
think about whether it makes sense to you think about how it might apply in your life have questions about whether

307
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:35,100
it's really the case what that really means you probably wouldn't want to do a lot

308
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:41,880
of long thinking while you're sitting in meditation just because we want to separate those but you know outside of

309
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:47,520
sitting on the cushion please do think about the Dharma reflect on it um

310
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:53,760
for some practitioners the first re-taste of kind of real confidence in

311
00:32:53,760 --> 00:33:01,320
the Dharma comes when we read something that is exactly like what we've experienced you know we've been sitting

312
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:08,100
for maybe even just a short time but we've experienced something or we've felt something or our mind shifts in a

313
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:15,179
certain way and then we pick up a suta or a teacher quote something in a talk and we realize ah Buddha said exactly

314
00:33:15,179 --> 00:33:22,740
what I've experienced and that was 2600 years ago maybe this guy did know something about how the mind works so

315
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:29,340
I'm joking a little bit but there's really can be a profound resonance when we see that some of at least some of

316
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:36,720
what's in the suit does reflects what we see in our own mind and body right here in the modern world

317
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:42,120
and we also understand oh the mind can be trained the process works when I'm

318
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:47,519
even when I meditate it's not an exception I'm not the exception oh it works for everyone else but not going to

319
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:54,679
work for me but it does when we see that it does so that can be very nourishing

320
00:33:54,720 --> 00:34:03,659
and I think it also helps at a more emotional level it's really nice if we hear stories about people who

321
00:34:03,659 --> 00:34:09,839
overcame their suffering you know in the sutas there's a a wonderful story about

322
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:18,060
the a woman named Kisa gotami who was very distraught because her her baby died and

323
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:25,080
she carried the child around she just couldn't grok the death and brought even you know

324
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:31,440
and everybody was like you know not able to help her really and she came to the Buddha with with her dead child and he

325
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:37,378
said okay uh you know there's help there's help for you if you

326
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:44,220
can get a mustard seed from a house where no one has died so she's set off on this Quest brilliantly skillful

327
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:51,118
teaching on the Buddhist part because house after house after house was willing to give her a mustard seed

328
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,339
tiny little thing but there wasn't any house where nobody had died

329
00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:01,920
so she got it you know she got it over time and we can be inspired by these

330
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:09,380
more subtle ways that the Buddha taught people he didn't always just talk about the five kinds of Desire

331
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:17,040
but there were you know he really could touch into people's deepest emotions and

332
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:24,599
find ways to connect that into the Dharma so you know we can learn from this also

333
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:32,060
we can resonate with her grief and also with her wisdom in understanding through that practice

334
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:39,240
Buddhist compassion and then also being in nature

335
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:45,119
that's a decidedly sensory experience but being in nature can give us a

336
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:51,420
glimpse of the Dharma in certain ways but sometimes can penetrate more deeply than things that are explicitly

337
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:58,680
spiritual sometimes you know just seeing the trees the bees the clouds

338
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:04,800
the streams did you guys see the blooming Dogwood on the way in amazing

339
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:10,579
so you know these things tell us about him impermanence impersonality

340
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:15,599
conditionality in a very straightforward way we see the cycle of Life happening

341
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:23,339
and we understand how we're part of it this too is the Dharma the truth of nature can heal and clarify

342
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:28,680
things for us and then there are certain devotional

343
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:35,400
actions this isn't for everyone but if you've never tried it you might certain devotional actions that can

344
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:41,760
uplift our heart and mind that maybe make it more easy for us to

345
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:48,720
connect in with these refined forms of happiness so for some people bowing you know maybe

346
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,540
before you start meditation or chanting or ritual these things can

347
00:36:54,540 --> 00:37:00,060
connect us in with the spiritual dimension of life

348
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:06,480
I guess there's a fortunate resonance in the uh in that this afternoon at IMC

349
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,240
there's going to be a session on chanting and talking about some of the

350
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:17,700
devotional practices of Asia with a wonderful scholar and that's his

351
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:24,720
profession is to be a Buddhist scholar but I would say he's really quite a deep practitioner who has studied this so

352
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:30,540
fear at all interested one to three o'clock this afternoon there will be and I think it's online also I think it's a

353
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:36,320
hybrid so even for those of you on YouTube it's possible

354
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:43,940
so that's not everyone's cup of tea but for some Skeptics like me originally

355
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:49,980
some Skeptics have been stunned at How Deeply these kinds of simple devotional

356
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:56,839
actions can go they can really touch the heart um

357
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:06,260
so are there ways that you could express

358
00:38:06,260 --> 00:38:12,720
your spiritual desires through your material life it's a question for all of you just to

359
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:20,579
consider you know is there some way that you could shift maybe take some of the energy that's going into ordinary desires like

360
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:25,980
food Comfort various Pleasures I mean we devote a lot of our attention to that

361
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:33,960
how am I going to get this or that or that get the next one that's going to be good how could we convert that into elevated

362
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:39,240
desires for simple surroundings that support practice

363
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:44,880
for trust and confidence in practice for learning the teachings for Spiritual

364
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:52,140
Community there's a way in which we can Elevate our wishes along the you know

365
00:38:52,140 --> 00:39:00,060
toward the upper end of those five classes of desire and sometimes we're able to literally kind of convert the

366
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:06,240
ones that are a little bit more worldly focused oh it would be even more nourishing if I could want

367
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,300
these deeper things these things that are part of the path

368
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:18,599
so we started by talking about how desire first of all is very prominent for us

369
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:24,480
but also that it has some subtlety to it clearly a lot of the desires that we

370
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:30,960
Chase don't really help us they're exhausting we don't have control over them they're pretty temporary when we

371
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:39,300
get them they don't you know they don't last and we have to do the next one and yet some things are good to want

372
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:45,839
I don't know if you can get awakened without wanting that at some level it's not going to just happen so we have to

373
00:39:45,839 --> 00:39:52,619
do something we have to want something along the way so you know these spiritual wishes for

374
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:59,839
goodness in meditative development are good ways to direct that movement toward in our mind

375
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:07,560
movement toward to be movement along the path eventually I think we will move into the

376
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:14,040
complete release of maybe all kinds of Desire except for those bodily ones but definitely we move

377
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:22,260
into the release of tanha the grasping part of Desire that is the cause of suffering in the

378
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:27,359
second Noble Truth it's not desire it's tanha it's the

379
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:34,500
grasping kind of Desire but then that leads to a natural question how do we know

380
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:41,000
how do I know if I want something is that a good want or a unhelpful want

381
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:47,760
it's a little bit of a trial and error there's a need for discernment there we have to keep checking we can check

382
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:55,260
our wholesome states in the mind increasing and on wholesome States decreasing or the reverse you know if we

383
00:40:55,260 --> 00:41:02,520
want kindness we will tend to not increase our tanha when we do that if we

384
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:07,880
want to be kind it can still creep in we can want to be kind and then we can say

385
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:14,760
I'm really a kind person you know we take it on as an identity and that's when it becomes unskillful

386
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:21,599
slips into that but if we just keep checking you know is there wholesomeness is what I'm wanting helping me to be

387
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:28,619
calm more wholesome more skillful that's probably a good kind of Desire

388
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:34,320
and also we can check if we're more you know felt sense meditator we can

389
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:40,020
check if there's tension associated with a certain desire if we want something that's

390
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:46,079
you know grasping or you know more in the sensory realm tends to bring some

391
00:41:46,079 --> 00:41:51,359
tension some stress with it whereas other kinds of wants have a more open

392
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:56,880
feeling to them there's still a little bit of tension maybe but it's more subtle

393
00:41:56,880 --> 00:42:01,920
and we can also check whether what we're wanting will help others or only us

394
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:08,480
that's a good clue if it would help others then it's more in the realm of skillful

395
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:15,900
so developing this kind of discernment is part of the path also we are not perfect at first at knowing whether

396
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:22,578
we're having skillful unskillful desire so we'll have to develop that over time

397
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:29,160
but one implication of thinking in this way is that the whole world becomes our

398
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:34,740
realm of practice you know every moment every encounter every

399
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:41,040
wish that we have in our mind right here in the tangible world

400
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:47,960
is a doorway to taking a step on the path if we can see it in that way

401
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:56,940
so there's a completeness there's a fullness to our relationship to life and

402
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:02,579
especially when we've undertaken a spiritual path then we start to see the ways in which

403
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:10,380
some of what we do supports that and some of what we do doesn't support that and we can start to prioritize move

404
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:17,280
toward this movement toward move toward the things that are actually helping us that are then propelling us along the

405
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:23,760
path part of the subtlety of this knowing about which desires are helpful and not

406
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:31,140
is that it shifts over time so something that was helpful for a while might become unhelpful later you know we have

407
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:37,319
to let go of certain desires that we're okay at the beginning but then they become burdensome

408
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:42,079
so be prepared for those shifts over time

409
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:50,700
so I hope I hope what this has done is maybe clarified a little bit this

410
00:43:50,700 --> 00:43:56,280
realm of Desire so that we don't have an automatic sense of oh it's all bad I've

411
00:43:56,280 --> 00:44:01,560
got to get rid of all my desires and then the reaction against that but I don't want to get rid of all my desires

412
00:44:01,560 --> 00:44:07,020
and I shouldn't have to and blah blah blah we can sweep all of that aside and

413
00:44:07,020 --> 00:44:12,660
consider Instead This dimension of wholesome unwholesome skillful unskillful which desires are supporting

414
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:19,319
the path and moving more and more toward having more of those in our life and then letting letting the mindfulness

415
00:44:19,319 --> 00:44:24,540
take care of the rest of it letting the ones Fall Away moving us toward that

416
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:30,720
aren't helpful moving us toward that final movement into Freedom into Awakening

417
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:36,260
freedom from all those movements of mind

418
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:39,200
so thank you

419
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:47,640
I guess we would have time for one we're pretty much at the end so um

420
00:44:47,640 --> 00:44:54,260
I'll stay a little longer if anybody would like to come up and ask anything but thank you
