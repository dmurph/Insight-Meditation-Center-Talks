being inspired it being casey's birthday tonight

35
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,680
the theme that i like to invite us to to practice with to

36
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:44,480
work with is opening up our perspective opening up

37
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:50,560
our perspective as if you were sitting on the top of a proverbial

38
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:56,799
mountain and looking at the entire entire trajectory of your

39
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,560
life not just this moment yes we will be embodied

40
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,319
in this moment um but sometimes actually if we're too much

41
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:13,519
in this moment and if our vision is too narrow not in an embodied way but in a

42
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,720
heady way you're just thinking about all the problems and the issues and all what i'm going to do

43
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:27,520
about this and this is terrible this is never going to end this is awful but that that tightness of vision

44
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,320
which you might be familiar with that tightness of vision

45
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:40,400
can um create a sense of

46
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:48,960
contraction a sense of tightness contraction and even sometimes meta might be hard

47
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,960
to be accessible in in that state and i trust i'm sure you have

48
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,800
experienced what i'm talking about we've all experienced um i should ask anyone not ex have not

49
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:08,400
experienced this tightness where you just your vision is so

50
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:14,320
narrow nor so narrow really as if you're just swimming in

51
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,520
what the problem or or the the most recent

52
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,240
drama might be whereas the invitation tonight

53
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:32,560
ah even just talking about that that tight vision kind of

54
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:39,440
gets my heart clenched it feels so contractive so letting go of that

55
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,199
view and instead instead having a sense of a sense of

56
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,880
openness and openness of vision and openness of vision

57
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,360
that here is this being who is you living this life

58
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,960
this being has been born has come into this life this being someday

59
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:10,160
will leave this world of course of course and this whole ark this whole art so

60
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,639
many things that have happened so many beautiful surprising

61
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,880
amazing and so many challenging things that have happened that you've grown through and

62
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,240
this road will continue so this this expansiveness of vision

63
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:35,600
including both you and including other beings and this expansive vision

64
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,360
can be with with the right invocation can be a perspective of equanimity

65
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,800
equanimity that things come things go

66
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,960
ah it's okay it's okay this is an interesting

67
00:06:52,960 --> 00:07:01,120

68
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,800

69
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:14,160

into the present moment

110
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,320
just taking a moment of refuge taking refuge

111
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:34,639
in the breath in the body [Music] and as much silence in their silence

112
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:38,839
as is available

113

and if thoughts arise it's okay they will they do not a problem

114
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:55,920

just here now deliciously here

123
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:17,720
in the body embodied

124
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:34,000
being in the body can help expand our vision not being in our heads

125
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:39,000
so come come back to the body

126
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,679
spending another minute or two just arriving

127
00:18:52,559 --> 00:19:00,919
with the breath with the body before we turn open our hearts to mental

128
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,840
this

129
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,919
and now i would like to invite us

130
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,360
as if we were watching a movie of our lives still staying in

131
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:04,640
body feeling the breath being the feet on the

132
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:10,430
floor her hands her bottom and the cushion

133
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:13,489
[Music]

134
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:24,799
not getting heady but staying embodied and yet in this movie theater

135
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:32,000
we see with our heart not with our head with our heart

136
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:39,360
with our bodies we perceive the arc of our lives

137
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,720
the ark

138
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,840
having been born

139
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:58,639
a sweet sweet newborn

140
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:08,480
finding themselves in the world

141
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:18,979
maybe all smiles feeling of tenderness arises [Music]

142
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,320
feeling of tenderness

143
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:40,799
this being this being who is me and yet not me

144
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,840
this precious child

145
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,360
as if he were a newborn not thinking so much about what happened

146
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:18,640
or was she either loved or

147
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:24,559
challenging challenges even through none of that if those come up please drop them

148
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:32,158
not the door we're entering tonight but as if you were that newborn

149
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:40,640
embodied wow in this amazing miraculous world mystery

150
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:49,158
wow incredible everything new everything fresh

151
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:01,520
the sun clouds

152
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:11,200
the green grass butterflies

153
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,480
water

154
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:35,039
now bowing to that little newborn

155
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:42,720
and now let's move forward in time and for the purpose of this practice

156
00:23:43,039 --> 00:23:49,440
of course life is so uncertain and we don't know what is going to happen when

157
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:56,159
and how long our lives might be we could be ahead by a bus and die tomorrow

158
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:03,559
and yet for the purpose of this practice this

159
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:09,919
let's imagine ourselves perhaps years from now

160
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,960
so there's a sense of spaciousness perspective

161
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:24,960
looking looking at the world from the perspective of let's suppose a life well lived by that

162
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:30,080
whatever needs to happen needed to happen did happen

163
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:37,360
or not just at the state of peace and equanimity letting go

164
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:47,559
now looking at the clouds from that perspective

165
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,640
of the end of life again

166
00:24:54,640 --> 00:25:01,840
not knowing what it will be like but just for the sake of this guided imagery for a moment

167
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:08,720
clouds sun maybe sunset

168
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:14,679
trees butterflies

169
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:20,240
whatever images of nature

170
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:25,158
soothe and calm you maybe it's the ocean

171
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:33,679
maybe gratitude arises thank you

172
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:41,559
wow this miracle that i was a part of

173
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:56,600
maybe even saying goodbye to the body this miracle that was my body

174
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:08,000
this body that is me and also not me

175
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:16,559
this being is so much more magnificent

176
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,880
with so many dimensions

177
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:36,720
maybe a sense of warmth tenderness arises for this being

178
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:44,000
who is you and not you parting partying

179
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:48,679
thank you goodbye world

180
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:07,320
now bowing bowing staying embodied feeling your body your heart

181
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:16,080
feed your hands your bottom on the cushion bowing to this image

182
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:22,760
now letting your vision be expansive

183
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,519
including all these versions of yourself

184
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:37,200
so many versions so many ups and downs

185
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:44,960
between the moment of birth moment of death and this moment here

186
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:51,360
so many moments of joy bliss

187
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:58,720
so many challenges so much growth it's just all

188
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:06,398
beautiful mysterious

189
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,840
unique

190
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,759
letting your heart inviting perhaps inviting gently

191
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:39,679
your heart to include all of these

192
00:28:39,679 --> 00:28:45,840
beings all these slices of this being

193
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,559
through time

194
00:28:55,600 --> 00:29:05,760
the old movies there would be reals all these different images these slices of life

195
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:13,840
don't have to think about them all just letting your heart open up

196
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:23,799
oh sweetheart this being this being who is me

197
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,600
loving unconditionally offering love good will

198
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:45,039
to all their beauty their divinity their buddha nature their foibles all

199
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:50,559
their mistakes all their pain their sorrows

200
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:56,398
unconditionally loving it all

201
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:05,480
not picking and choosing

202
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:51,360
thank you maybe appreciation gratitude arises for

203
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,520
this being who is you doing their best

204
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:28,278
be warmth good will love

205
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:45,799
as if you're expanding your arms stretching wide far and wide

206
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:59,240
loving this being

207
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:10,240
given what seems unlovable at times

208
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:16,240
loving that too loving that especially that

209
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:24,000
especially that because often what's what appears to us as unlovable really

210
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:32,840
is suffering really is dukkha especially loving that

211
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:21,279
and maybe one of the images of the reel comes up there a moment in time

212
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:28,240
maybe maybe not that attracts you attracts your heart specially

213
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:38,440
wanting calling to be loved to be held unconditionally in love

214
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:53,840
maybe it was a time when you went through [Music] challenging time

215
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:57,840
valiantly courageously

216
00:34:00,399 --> 00:34:05,799
or anything at all

217
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:40,440
living there beyond conditional love and acceptance

218
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,720
do

219
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:26,560
and now bowing to that image coming back to this body

220
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:34,720
this moment in time that is also one tableau an image

221
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:40,240
out of this reel of this movie reel

222
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:48,160
of this life expansiveness of vision including

223
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:54,480
loving yourself unconditionally for whatever is arising

224
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,880
in this moment

225
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:09,200
this being who is you and also not you

226
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:17,520
an expression of beauty goodness

227
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:23,920
divine buddha nature whatever words we

228
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,838
like to give it

229
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:39,720
to love and to be loved

230
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:46,240
by so many dimensions of this here

231
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,960
this being

232
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:59,760
as if we're looking into a mirror mirror looking into a mirror passing back and

233
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:09,240
forth infinitude loving this being and being loved

234
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:18,000
stretching into infinity all these images in the present moment

235
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,680
so many dimensions our humanity and divinity loving and

236
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,000
being loved

237
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:02,480
and as we bring this sitting to a close

238
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:09,280
maybe in your mind's eye bowing to yourself your divinity bows to

239
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:14,880
you you do you bow to

240
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:24,160
your inner buddha who is borrowing to whom

241
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:31,560
thank you keep going keep loving

242
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:53,040
may all beings including ourselves open up

243
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:01,838
our hearts with full love unconditional love to ourselves

244
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:10,040
to our own inner goodness may all beings be free

245

274
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:53,280
the space what did you notice what came up for you

275
00:42:53,280 --> 00:43:00,240
what happened curran says i found it so interesting

276
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:07,119
and mysterious to reflect on how i am and also am not the same self at

277
00:43:07,119 --> 00:43:13,920
different ages i could probably think about that for a long time yes

278
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,280
pretty mysterious and magical current yes it's yeah

279
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:24,400
so appreciate that that reflection has been ignited for you

280
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:30,800
so the invitation i have is actually um drop that in because it's already been

281
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:38,240
dropped in through this meditation so take it with you see

282
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:45,440
it don't don't so much think about it because many of these reflections don't lend themselves to thinking about

283
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:51,119
but as it's been dropped in carry it carry it with yourself when you

284
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:57,920
go to bed tonight just open to it not thinking about it but just kind of let yourself soak in it

285
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,040
tomorrow maybe when you go for a walk outside kind of take take it for a walk

286
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:08,800
with you and uh and see what might arise yeah and see

287
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,560
more more dimensions of this mystery might might open up for you this is lovely

288
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:21,359
thank you wayne i see your hand is raised please

289
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:29,119
um i i've been it was helpful for me to sit with my i was not looking at

290
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,319
anything but just to almost not quite completely close my eyelids

291
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:40,640
but just keep them slightly open but my eyes unfocused and it just helped me

292
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:47,280
stay a little alert enough sometimes for these 6 p.m sittings

293
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:54,800
my when i completely closed my eyes i wander off and and my mind often runs more when i'm

294
00:44:54,800 --> 00:45:00,640
yeah yeah great i am so glad you've discovered that and and also sharing it

295
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:07,520
with others because that uh opening the eyes was just a slight slit to let light

296
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:14,640
in that's a fantastic tool to be used when the mind is foggy or sleepy very

297
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:19,920
gently just it raises the energy of the body beautiful i'm so delighted you've

298
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:25,520
discovered that lovely barbara please

299
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:37,359
still muted oh there um

300
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:43,440
thank you nikki i appreciated what you said about the arc

301
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:49,760
of your life and i thought of my life like a rainbow you know

302
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:55,200
beginning little and then getting older and now you know sort of

303
00:45:55,200 --> 00:46:03,160
kind of getting towards the end and it i found my mind went to

304
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:10,119
visualizing myself as as a a young child

305
00:46:10,119 --> 00:46:16,160
exploring uh the beach where i i grew up near the beach

306
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:24,400
and i don't know it was just a lovely a reflection on

307
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:30,960
sort of where my life is gone at different parts

308
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:37,520
and ending up here where we are um

309
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:42,760
i know just a reflection on the

310
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:50,000
totality of the life experience yeah and i want to thank you

311
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,799
because it was it was a good it's been a good life it's hard now

312
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:05,200

313
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:12,160

316
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:32,800
that looking at the arc of my life and um it's helpful to not get too caught up in

317
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:38,480
whatever is disturbing wrong that's happening right now

318
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:45,359
but also you've made mention of seeing ourselves when we were courageous

319
00:47:45,359 --> 00:47:51,040
when we stood in the breach when we stood up for what was

320
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,480
true and and didn't desert ourselves and uh i

321
00:47:56,480 --> 00:48:02,400
appreciated that thank you abraham thank you so much for

322
