1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:07,080
so exciting here we're in a storm here

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:15,780
in the walking meditation Hall at IRC and the Acoustics here that is

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,980
sound bounces quite a bit and I think maybe tomorrow we could go back into the regular meditation Hall

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,019
there were people there who were meditating earlier we were setting up

5
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,719
and um small Echo gives a cathedral feel that's

6
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:42,300
very nice so welcome uh to our Monday morning to this

7
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:48,600
uh you know to IRC instead of an IMC for

8
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:56,160
these two days and uh tomorrow I think we'll set it up differently so maybe it could be a nicer

9
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:01,980
than this color we have here in this room and um

10
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:09,479
so the uh I want to start uh briefly the

11
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:18,900
meditation with a a story it's probably a Mythic story about the Buddha and that is that um

12
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:27,299
he was uh the night of his Awakening uh he was challenged quite a bit and uh

13
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,880
and maybe one of the biggest challenges he's had in his practice

14
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,100
and he found that he didn't he couldn't rely on himself anymore he done all the

15
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,640
work all the efforts that any individual could do risk practice but it wasn't enough to

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,240
just do his own effort and so the story goes that he

17
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,880
reached a hand down and touched the Earth and called upon the Earth or the

18
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,700
goddess of the earth to support him to uh

19
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:08,280
affirm that it was possible for him to become awakened

20
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,980
and the Earth responded with an earthquake that probably a gentle

21
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:20,220
earthquake but a message yes and that all these challenges that the

22
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:27,360
Buddha had kind of vanished with that so it's a little bit more elaborate than Mythic story that goes but the important

23
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:33,480
point is here is that sometimes in doing this practice we rely on something outside of

24
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:40,080
ourselves which I'm beyond our usual sense of self and that's expressed in the Buddhist

25
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,720
language going we go to something for support and the going for Refuge

26
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,300
and so when we do this meditation practice it's possible to do it a kind of

27
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,580
it's kind of certain kind of degree of just I'm the one who's doing it and I'm going to

28
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:05,580
happen puff or focus and manage and it's also possible to do it in

29
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:12,540
relationship to uh something that is more than your own efforts maybe it's

30
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,680
something within yourself even but something more than you're an effort that you rely on for support

31
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:27,180
and a day will come when you are only relying on your own efforts and

32
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:34,500
it's not enough and there's a kind of humility or kind of openness or willingness and to go

33
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,019
or something something else for support and the simple way for our Buddhists is

34
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:47,280
to go to the Dharma we'll go to the Buddha darma Sangha so for this meditation

35
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,299
I would like to uh if it works for you to for you to consider that as you do

36
00:03:54,299 --> 00:04:01,319
your meditation that um you have a support for being present for being really here

37
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:08,459
in the moment that there is lots of support that the few hundred people who are here

38
00:04:08,459 --> 00:04:16,260
on YouTube watching here and meditating along our support for all of us to be present

39
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:23,160
that those of us who are you know and we're supported by the

40
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:30,860
Earth by the natural world in many many ways our life depends on it and uh in a sense life is here

41
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:37,560
supporting us to be present so to sit and meditate with a sense of

42
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,680
support to call on that support that is not just your own efforts

43
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,939
but there are supports for you to be present

44
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:55,520
so to take a meditation posture

45
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,919
and to gently close your eyes

46
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:09,440
the first to feel the support of

47
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:18,120
whatever it is that supports your weight gentle pool of gravity against your

48
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:26,100
cushion your chair all of us are supported

49
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:32,000
I could say by the Earth and we never fall through

50
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,280
foreign

51
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:59,180
take a few long slow deep breaths

52
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:07,199
certainly our life is supported by the life processes of this planet

53
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:14,220
the plants that make oxygen to make food

54
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:18,800
are supported here just in the breathing

55
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:29,220
without breathing there's no life for us and to check they take a few long slow

56
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,319
deeper threats

57
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:46,520
and as you exhale to relax relax into a sense of support

58
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:59,000
you're supported by the Dharma you know all the meetings I've done

59
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:06,479
supported by 2500 years of people who meditated

60
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,060
you are meditating you're not alone

61
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:18,259
the dedication to show up can be present

62
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,039
for our experience

63
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:41,720
breathing normally

64
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:50,300
going to support in your own care for yourself

65
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:56,660
simple care of relaxing your body

66
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:10,580
the care of relaxing your minds

67
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:23,699
the practice of being present here and now is a supportive practice you're not

68
00:08:23,699 --> 00:08:31,099
alone to rely on the sense of support

69
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:42,680
that reality wants you to be present for it here no

00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,869
[Music]

90
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:09,360
this Dharma practice there's a mutuality or reciprocity

91
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:16,759
of going for a refuge account for support and protection in the Dharma

92
00:21:17,059 --> 00:21:22,740
that we are supported and then there's the other side which is

93
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:29,820
that we become a refuge for others may become someone is safe supportive

94
00:21:29,820 --> 00:21:36,740
for others as well we don't just receive support

95
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:44,340
we also offer it and in that reciprocity

96
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:51,480
we end up receiving more support we don't lose support by supporting

97
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,240
others in the Dharma the two go hand in hand to support each

98
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:02,700
other and that's why at the end of a meditation session

99
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:09,179
it's often Builds on the meditation kind of

100
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:15,000
expands the value of it to spend a moment of time

101
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:23,940
dedicating the Merit the benefits to to transform turn around the way

102
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:31,020
we've been supported and to intend and wish support for

103
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:38,299
others may it be that our practice together

104
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:43,620
it's maybe maybe some over 400 of us meditating with a lot of people

105
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:49,260
collectively that as we go through our day

106
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:55,620
that we offer support to others who care our love

107
00:22:55,620 --> 00:23:02,120
may it be that we make other people's life a little bit easier today

108
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:09,659
may all beings be happy evil beings

109
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:17,159
be safe may all beings be peaceful

110
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:24,840
and may all be free so thank you all

111
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:32,640
doesn't really work to ring a bell on Zoom so they bow in the city

112
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,900
thank you for it

113
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:13,440
so so most of these warnings that come down

114
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:20,880
to IMC for the last three years technology is mostly worked nicely

115
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,820
sometimes there's been those challenges and uh

116
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:34,320
and it's mostly working today the standard of what works and doesn't work is you know is uh you know

117
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:42,620
optional what we consider the standard but you know I'm sorry they're a little bit late and here we are at IRC

118
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:49,740
and now there's also there's some wonderful coincidence that uh we were a little more I was

119
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:56,460
challenged we were challenging we see some help here at IRC and other places with Kevin setting up the zoom room

120
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:02,940
thank you um because what I want to talk about are

121
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:10,500
challenges and uh our lives are full of challenges

122
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:17,460
and I think I'd like to do that for a while now in this uh these uh teachings morning teachings

123
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:24,240
here um last year I went through

124
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:30,659
um last year I did and then the year before that I

125
00:25:30,659 --> 00:25:37,580
it's Sati patana and there's a way in which those uh often the teachings of the Dharma

126
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:43,580
can easily kind of just give the presentation that it's just an easy thing to do

127
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:50,039
some of the classic models of the path the practice that the Buddha gives doesn't really say anything about

128
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:57,539
difficulties sit down and just go through concentration States and things just unfold very nicely

129
00:25:57,539 --> 00:26:03,900
but in fact for most people maybe a lot of people this practice that we do and

130
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:11,659
the life we live has challenges lots of challenges the Buddha has this wonderful

131
00:26:11,659 --> 00:26:16,860
kind of metaphor for the human suffering

132
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:23,700
he said that um um all the tears that you have shed

133
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:31,320
in all your many lifetimes is greater than all the water in all the oceans

134
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:37,380
so that's a powerful statement about uh the nature of this life of ours the

135
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:43,320
challenges the suffering that this that the losses the griefs so so much

136
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:50,220
goes on this life this difficult and the Dharma practice has been

137
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:56,460
designed in order to meet that to work with it to heal it to move

138
00:26:56,460 --> 00:27:04,860
through it to be discover freedom in the midst of this difficult world and so I would like for a while now to

139
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:10,200
talk about the Dharma practice

140
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:17,400
um in addressing the challenges we have and if I can do this well I think I'd

141
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:25,080
like to do this a little bit like a progression that the building a foundation for really looking at what is

142
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:33,419
most difficult in our lives and what's challenging in our hearts because uh in the assume that most

143
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:41,159
people are carrying their hearts deep challenges that sometimes are buried for

144
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:47,820
a long time sometimes are very well known and uh and to become really free in the

145
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:54,240
stomach practice is not to override those or to push those aside but that he

146
00:27:54,240 --> 00:28:01,140
has to discover our freedom in all free everything within us

147
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:07,440
against a lifetime Journey but it's a wonderful journey to be on

148
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:13,279
so last week I talked about uh five different meanings of Dharma

149
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:22,500
Dharma as relatedness dharma's action dharma's truth dharma's

150
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:30,779
teachings and Karma as transformation and I'd like to use those same categories of the Dharma to talk more

151
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:36,440
generally inductory fashion this week about working with challenges

152
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:43,799
and uh and uh so for today the it's the topic of Dharma has

153
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:50,400
relatedness that uh Dharma points to not so much to

154
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:57,720
um things not too much to the suffering as a suffering but rather always asking a

155
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:03,840
question where is the relationship here how are we relating to it how is it related to us

156
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:09,779
uh the first Dharma talk I I gave on an Insight Retreat when I was still in

157
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:16,220
training to be a teacher was a Dharma talk about

158
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:22,200
the uh the importance of looking at our relationship that we have to our

159
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:30,000
experience rather than fixing experience rather than focusing on the experiences from the issue to really take into account

160
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:36,120
how we relate to it sometimes I've said that um there's only

161
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:42,240
ever two things there's what's happening and how we relate to what's happening

162
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:49,440
but for today I want to say there are three things there's what's happening there's how we relate to it and then

163
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:56,340
what is it that supports us to relate to it what do we go to for support so that we can relate to things

164
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:02,700
in an effective uh way in that in a

165
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:07,740
useful way to healing weight beneficial way

166
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:13,740
this idea of relatedness what is how am I related to this so if you have

167
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:20,120
um some challenge in your life it's easy to get pulled into the Dynamics of the challenge and the

168
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:26,039
relationships and the issues and what has to happen and what the concerns but

169
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:33,299
we can also step back and see how am I relating to this challenge and if we do that we find out that we

170
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:38,880
might be relating to it with fear and the fear is different in that challenge

171
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,580
but if we don't see that then the fear kind of gets entangled with the

172
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:50,039
challenge and it's separable from it that it makes it very much more difficult to deal with because there are

173
00:30:50,039 --> 00:30:55,740
these two things going on there's whatever the challenge is and then there's the fear and then where do you

174
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:01,020
put your attention you deal with the the issue of you to deal with your fear

175
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:07,279
so for example maybe you know a great example of something very silly not silly but

176
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:13,919
simple is um if you're out driving you have a flat tire and you're able to

177
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:20,820
pull over safely inside of the road and so the challenge is how to get the tire repaired

178
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:26,820
but if there's fear that you can't do it you'll be stuck here and it'll help you then

179
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:32,399
um the the Practical question what to do about the tire has not become entangled

180
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:40,620
with the fear we have towards it and the fear might be reasonable to have but there are two different things and

181
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:48,059
so to ask yourself the question what's the relationship I have to the flat tire oh the relationship is fear is that the

182
00:31:48,059 --> 00:31:55,860
most useful relationship to have it it's another relationship that's more useful to have maybe the better relationship is

183
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:03,179
um pulling off your phone and calling for help or something but but uh when you

184
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:09,720
ask when you answer the question answer the question what is my relationship to it then you have a chance to question is

185
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:15,179
this the relationship I want to be acting on is this what takes predominance or is

186
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:22,620
there another relationship that might be more useful If instead of being afraid maybe I

187
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:29,520
should be mindful maybe this is a time in my mindfulness practice really comes to prepare to

188
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:36,059
really be mindful and present for the fear so that as they balance in the fear

189
00:32:36,059 --> 00:32:42,480
rather than reducing my balance with it so the question is what is the relationship to the challenge

190
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:48,980
can reveal a lot and can begin to tease apart

191
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:56,700
The Challenge from how we're experiencing what we're doing with it and not a few times

192
00:32:56,700 --> 00:33:03,000
a large life challenges are made much more difficult because of

193
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,200
how we're relating to it and sometimes we relate to things wonderfully sometimes there's a sense of

194
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:15,000
being counterphobic we step towards the difficulties we have so we're curious we

195
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:21,059
say let's find out what's Happening Here um let me look at let me let me use this challenge as a place to understand

196
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:27,960
myself better to learn how to be more patient to learn how to be more compassionate to learn how to be more

197
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,120
wise or Discerning or less caught and so then we're bringing the

198
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:41,760
relationship of practice to it so how am I relating to this and uh you can point a figure to point

199
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:47,340
ourselves back to how I want to relate to it is I want to take it on its practice

200
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:53,640
and then the practice I trust so then in the government practice we

201
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:59,220
talk about then going for Refuge so um there's some so there's a third thing

202
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:07,200
there's what's happening how relating to it and then what is it that we want uh to support us what's

203
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:12,960
relating to us and the DAR Milo sense is available as a

204
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:19,220
support in order the clearest ways of that is the practice

205
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:24,960
to practice supports us where the practice has a relationship to us

206
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:31,138
which maybe is a little bit counter-intuitive because I can feel like I'm the one who's practicing I'm

207
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:39,419
the one who's applying myself and um and that could you know that's true but when you apply yourself in

208
00:34:39,419 --> 00:34:46,020
practice um the practice and response something inside responds to honesty to truth to

209
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:52,740
presence to care to compassion that we bring as we practice something response

210
00:34:52,740 --> 00:34:59,060
and that responsibility is something that's coming that's going to support us

211
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:05,700
and uh there are times in life when we can't figure out what we can do

212
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:12,660
for ourselves everything seems so difficult so hard and that's a time when Buddhists

213
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:19,500
sometimes will go go for Refuge we'll go and show the support of the

214
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:27,060
Dharma and it kind of can take the shape of this is hard I'm not sure I can manage this but I

215
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:32,160
trust the practice I trust the Dharma and so I'm going to go for a refuge to

216
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:37,859
it I'm going to rely on it and it doesn't mean that we become passive

217
00:35:37,859 --> 00:35:43,220
it means that we still are for our practice to it but we don't we're not

218
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:49,740
caught in the in the OR Frozen by I don't know how to

219
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:58,380
do it or I don't know what's supposed to happen or this seems impossible we trust there's an enlargers holiness

220
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:03,480
and it's not always obvious what that larger Dharma

221
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:09,720
support will be and sometimes there's many many different things depending on the

222
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:17,280
circumstances but uh it's phenomenal that uh for me in my life how often I've been challenged

223
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:25,560
where I didn't know what to do didn't know what to say and I I took refuge in the practice I

224
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:32,339
took refuge and mindfulness to show up and be present so much so

225
00:36:32,339 --> 00:36:37,680
that one of the greatest gifts time for me of doing this mindfulness practice

226
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:45,000
inside practice is the phenomenal trust that I have in my close practice itself

227
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:53,520
I trust the practice more than my own mind's ability to understand something or to figure things out or to uh

228
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:59,760
solve all the problems but uh I'm certainly do my best but mindfulness

229
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:04,800
means I'll show up and stay present I'll stay with it and try to be honest and

230
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:11,760
try to feel and be present and recognize what's happening stay in the present moment with this

231
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:17,460
really uh take it in what's happening don't turn

232
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:25,140
away from what's happening but also don't attack what's happening don't shut down don't despair don't collapse the

233
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:31,200
darknesses show up and uh trusting it trusting the

234
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:38,220
mindfulness and so to say you know related with the relatedness as

235
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:43,920
part of the Dharma practice we're in a relationship we're in relationship to ourselves

236
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:50,760
relationship to our challenges we relationship to The Brighter world and it's in relationship to us

237
00:37:50,760 --> 00:38:00,420
in something like the Dharma the Buddha Masada or that's language you don't care for the mindfulness practices itself

238
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:05,880
um there's a reciprocity there where we offer ourselves to the practice and then

239
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:11,400
the practice supports us and uh it's a very fortunate thing here

240
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:19,380
because uh it was all up to our own abilities our own intelligence or it'd probably be

241
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:26,760
impossible for most of us to really work work with some of the huge challenges of life and

242
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:33,560
death that this will this uh human life brings us

243
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:41,339
a degree of loss betrayal

244
00:38:41,339 --> 00:38:48,660
that we go through in this life it can be huge so how to practice with it

245
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:56,520
so how do I so what's our relationship to it and what do we go for for support so we

246
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,820
can relate to lesson supports so that's this word of the world of relativeness and it's a protection

247
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:08,099
against getting against getting kind of solidified or frozen in the notion it's

248
00:39:08,099 --> 00:39:14,160
all up to me it's all happening to me it's all about me it's all about them and what they're

249
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:19,859
doing there's something bigger going on here that belongs to the world of

250
00:39:19,859 --> 00:39:25,500
relativeness in interrelatedness that we all live in

251
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:31,320
so um if you have challenged today

252
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:38,220
yeah whether it's small or large even if it's small don't overlook it even it's so small that you can just kind of

253
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:44,339
bypass it and not think about it but if you have some challenges today ask yourself the question

254
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:51,140
how are you relating to it that's not really part of the challenge

255
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:56,339
but what's the relationship to it and even if the challenge is internal to

256
00:39:56,339 --> 00:40:03,720
yourself how are you relating to it what are their beliefs what are the attitudes what are that desires that are

257
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:10,680
coming to play in relationship to it the emotions and then is there something that you can

258
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:16,140
that will support you it's relating to you maybe the practice

259
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:22,079
and mindfulness may be the Dharma it is Earth something else that supports you

260
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:29,040
that makes it easier for you to go through it because you're not doing it alone you have the support of Buddha Dharma

261
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:37,560
Sangha so um I call upon all of this for myself today

262
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,800
and a little bit because uh I felt a little bit uh

263
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:50,940
confused sitting down here making all this work but uh trusted that the Dharma here and

264
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:56,780
we'd find her way so here we are so um thank you

265
00:40:56,780 --> 00:41:01,980
we'll see if we can make it a little bit nicer to easier tomorrow and if not

266
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,859
we'll just do it this way again and uh then Wednesday I'll be should be back at IMC

267
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:10,759
thank you all
