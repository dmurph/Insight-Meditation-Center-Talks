1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,720
so hello everyone hello and welcome to happy hour lovely to be with you dear sa

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:14,920
it makes me happy to see you and for today's practice I'd like to invite

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:23,199
us to excuse me tickle in my

4
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:30,800
throat like to invite us to sit with um with embodiment

5
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,840
tonight and with with trusting that embodiment

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:43,079
coming to our bodies bringing the awareness bringing knowing to our bodies

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,399
to the breath can bring can cause can bring

8
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:55,719
forth a sense of stability and resilience I've mentioned this before

9
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:06,000
that often um we find ourselves being um overwhelmed by Thoughts by fears by

10
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,759
Future oriented uh Reflections and we become like um

11
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:22,280
topheavy um uh uh blow up dolls I might I probably have mentioned this uh before

12
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:27,439
here but I love this this simile of a popup doll these pop-up dolls you might

13
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:33,240
have seen them that they have sand on the bottom and if they fall down whoop they stand

14
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:41,159
up again because they have sand on the bottom so if you have mindfulness of the body the sense of resilience here here

15
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,799
here together with kindness and compassion sweetheart here here there

16
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:54,119
can be a sense of stability as the storms of Fortune as the storms of the

17
00:01:54,119 --> 00:02:00,399
world come and go there can be a sense of stability here here I can understand

18
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:07,600
this I can withstand this but if the sand is on the top top heavy and we get

19
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,120
overwhelmed by thoughts and fears and stories and what's happening in the

20
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:20,160
world Etc and you know what I'm referring to we get we get toppled over

21
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,800
ah it's really really hard to write our write ourselves it's really hard to

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:34,640
write ourselves because we are so overwhelmed by the story so again um

23
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,720
very helpful to be embodied to have to be have the sense of stability as we

24
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:46,519
move through through the worlds there there will be plenty of storms we have already weathered plenty of Storms and

25
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:52,319
there will be more storms that is that is what is to be human on this on this

26
00:02:52,319 --> 00:03:00,680
Earth lots of storms can we have stability can we cultivate sense of calm

27
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:06,239
presence to support ourselves to be present for the sake of ourselves and

28
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,360
all beings whose lives we touch so that is our practice tonight and I'm going to

29
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:17,640
invite silence presence embodiment kindness

30
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,680
compassion um and keep it pretty light not too many words light I hope so that

31
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:31,280
we have time to settle together okay so with that preamble

32
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:36,439
like to invite us to arrive and settle in our seat and if you need to shift

201
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,440
know joining us for the first time because you know I've been doing this

202
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:23,960
continually for a year and usually I was with people that have been doing it for

203
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:30,160
a long time right and so this time I felt like I could be the one that

204
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:36,079
brought the you know experience of practicing this wholeheartedly for a

205
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,680

yay thanks Noella see I thought I saw another hat

216
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:59,520
and a couple of Reflections in chat to which I'll get to in a moment Diana

217
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:12,880
oh still muted asking you to unmute there you go

218
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,119
you're unmuted now I I have felt a true shift

219
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:24,839
today uh last last night as I went to bed but uh this morning I woke up with

220
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:31,440
it and then I really noticed it tonight and in the meditation it really

221
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:38,920
um uh gave expression to it the the physical idea of stability a St I forget

222
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:45,800
the words a stable stance the the body really planted the backr and I felt that

223
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,359
but I have felt that all day today mentally and the shift comes from a

224
00:37:51,359 --> 00:37:58,040
couple of weeks ago going around with true fear and my heart and anxiety just

225
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:05,359
uh nervousness and fear and I um so I began

226
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:12,640
to a little bit Peak and cheat and start to look at NE uh numbers today and and

227
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:18,119
after a while I could see that there were some big numbers here and there

228
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:23,400
whatever what and the shift was I began to have a real curiosity and it's still

229
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:29,720
there with me it was more like I was looking like this stage or that St I started to thinki wonder who these

230
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,880
people are in this state I wonder what they're like what their causes and

231
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:43,280
conditions were uh they voted by couple hundred thousand this way as opposed like that I

232
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,359
I wonder what that's about and it was just quite simple it wasn't with any

233
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:54,800
judging it was just more I wonder yeah I wonder what's there and that other St I

234
00:38:54,800 --> 00:39:01,319
wonder I wonder who everyone is it was more like that but in in a open Curious

235
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:06,480
way I don't have an answer but um I I

236
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:11,760
just felt just open that was the change on yeah

237
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:18,920
wow thank you for sharing this this is exactly it Diana beautiful because when

238
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:25,760
judging or you know with judging mine we're judging oh othering others they're

239
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:30,800
different they're this they're this bad you know whatever you know the mind can

240
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:37,880
come up with lots of um uh judgments and yet to be curious to be C bring

241
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:43,440
curiosity well human beings just like me I wonder what is their causes and

242
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:50,319
condition just like me cause this curiosity this stance o it it softens

243
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:58,400
the heart and really that is that is the way to um heal heal

253
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:11,040
because I think you spoke yesterday I'm going to go to Serena first so pulling back pulling forward hearing more voices

254
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:16,920
Serena please thank

255
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:23,839
you actually I show the practice I've been coming here for a year I think at

256
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:32,440
least a year now pretty pretty continuously and um I really uh saw the

257
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:38,839
fruits of the practice this morning and I was so grateful what arose within me

258
00:41:38,839 --> 00:41:45,880
was um first I was a I was a a bit upset to

259
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:51,040
hear the news because I worked at polls and I was so tired last night and we

260
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,160
hardly had any breaks I was so exhausted I woken up at 4 in the morning worked

261
00:41:56,160 --> 00:42:03,839
until 8:30 or or thereabouts pretty much no nonstop and um when I heard the news

262
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:09,440
this so I didn't stay up all night last night so I just went to sleep and when I

263
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:14,480
woke up and got the news I

264
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:21,160
um I um I first felt a little bit upset and

265
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:27,240
then I felt a l a lot more upset when my nephew sent me a a text related to this

266
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:34,839
which was really um difficult test text and uh so at a certain point I said

267
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:40,920
you know I drew a um a line and I said I'm not having this conversation with

268
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,160
you by text I'm sorry I'm not doing that and so that was kind of the turning

269
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,200
point for me it was the turning point and

270
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:58,200
um I got this Tranquility because I saw that this was

271
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:05,680
causes and conditions in other words instead of instead of being kind of uh

272
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:12,480
you know uh just kind of entangled by all the these ideas about why this

273
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:17,920
happened and this and that and the other thing it was

274
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:23,319
like causes and conditions the conditions were such what this got to

275
00:43:23,319 --> 00:43:29,200
happen and somehow I got some equinity and some

276
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:37,119
Serenity and I was able to just you know have my um have my courage

277
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:43,200
back beautiful yeah I have the courage to say well what is my purpose in life

278
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:49,599
what is it that is it what is am I suppos what am I supposed to do in you know in any situation not only in this

279
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:56,680
situation and I gave me the courage to just go and do what I needed to do to remember what to remember what my

280
00:43:56,680 --> 00:44:04,599
beautiful remembering what's important I love it thank you Serena thank you so much for sharing this is this is quite a

283
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:22,280
rabbit hole with a family member of like getting it and and then oops pause stop

284
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:29,960
not not this is not skillful I will not do this and this is what the Buddha teach is there four wise efforts the

285
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:36,240
four wise efforts one of the four wise efforts is abandon abandon UNH wholesome

286
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,960
states that have Arisen and you abandoned a UNH wholesome state that was arising in text with with your family

287
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:48,440
like abandoned we're not going there and when you abandoned it you um there was

288
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:55,160
this understanding of you know there causes and conditions that had because of this that arises because of that this

289
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:05,160
arises and this is what has arisen and then what I love at the end you shared is connecting with your um values what
