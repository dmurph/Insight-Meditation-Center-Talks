00:00:02,820 --> 00:00:07,980
hello everyone welcome

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:14,099
and those of you who are greeting on chat thank you it's very nice those of

3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,760
you who are not those on chat are doing it for all of you I would like to thank

4
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,980
you so so the insight

5
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:31,320
pentad the focus being on

6
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:40,739
the inside part of it how inside works and one of the important

7
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:47,940
places to have insight to really see clearly is the difference between

8
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:54,899
what we know what what for example what we have insight about what we know

9
00:00:54,899 --> 00:01:01,260
and how we know so there's what we know and there's how

10
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:07,200
we know and many things that we though what we

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,900
know many things and what I'd like to suggest uh for this

12
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:21,540
for today that uh to have more attention to something that's often uh not noticed

13
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,580
often when we focus in meditation on what we can know like the it's usually

14
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,860
something tangible something that we can the senses can take in that we can in

15
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:38,460
the present moment something we can know because it's a rising or it's occurring in the present so breathing Body

16
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,920
Sensations feelings thoughts sounds Sensations

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:51,060
and um but one of the things that are very very important is insight deepens

18
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:56,840
is to be aware a little bit of what is absent

19
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,119
and uh and certain kinds of things that are absent uh we can feel when we know

20
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:09,539
recognize their absence there might be a short period of time where we can recognize the relief

21
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:15,720
of it not being there so for example before we rush headlong

22
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,959
into mindfulness of breathing and body here we might take a little bit of time to

23
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:27,480
notice that if there's any relief

24
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:34,020
that you might evoke sitting in your meditation posture

25
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:39,900
maybe you don't have to there's things you don't you're not doing and responsibilities you put down for these

26
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:45,360
30 minutes and and things that you don't have to

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:54,480
address things that don't are not present right now for you and it's just not so nice not to

28
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,000
have them here and um and so um

29
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,480
and so the absence of them can have a little bit of a nice effect I

30
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:12,360
thought this is good and to feel that goodness to feel that oh this it maybe allows for a different

31
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:20,640
kind of relaxation to happen a different kind of settling in and then we can take one step further

32
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,239
and that is uh in the knowing of the relief

33
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:33,000
is that knowing Pleasant or unpleasant does that knowing carry with it some of

34
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:41,459
the characteristics of the relief there's that knowing I feel spacious or at ease is it

35
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:48,180
or is it in a hurry ready to go on to the next thing and is it kind of pouncing or is it pulling

36
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:56,459
back or filled with some kind of desires or aversions or doubts about

37
00:03:56,459 --> 00:04:04,280
what's going on and how simple can The Knowing be

38
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,500
to keep the knowing super simple there's what is known and then the

39
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:17,220
knowing so simple that direct knowing of what's here or sometimes what's not here

40
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:25,380
the relief of the what's not here that the The Knowing is so simple

41
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:33,240
that it's welcomed there's a good feeling it's it's appreciated to know this way

42
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:41,000
so there's a knowing and what is known so assuming a meditation posture

43
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,220
and gently closing your eyes

44
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:00,240
and

45
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:12,720
and take a few moments now to feel if there's any relief

46
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,740
of just being here in this way maybe identifying two or three things

47
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:27,479
that are not present maybe the regular part of your life and

48
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:32,580
not they're not here in the moment as you're sitting here

49
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:37,639
and that's maybe part of the goodness of being here

50
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:34,500
and if you feel some relief of being here what's it like to know that relief

51
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,319
the simplest clearest kind of knowing of absence

52
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:45,539
of relief without commentary without

53
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:50,880
judgments just knowing the relief knowing the absence of whatever

54
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:58,979
is normally present especially the absence of the stress

55
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:06,419
that you might carry the preoccupations that you normally

56
00:07:06,419 --> 00:07:08,900
carry

57
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,240
the impact that life events might have normally

58
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:25,259
to feel the relief and then also to recognize

59
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,300
a simple way of knowing that

60
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,819
in that Simplicity of knowing

61
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:50,780
knowing that it has no stress within it

62
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:58,819
there you will find the path to Freedom

63
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:06,020
stay close to knowing

64
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:11,880
in a way that feels relieving

65
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:20,340
that feels releasing no matter what you know

66
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,960
it's how you know

67
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:30,500
that you'll find the path to liberation

68
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:10,260
foreign

69
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:07,160
whatever degree of calm or subtleness that you might have

70
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:15,980
can you know that calmly and said and subtly settled away

71
00:21:21,419 --> 00:21:27,980
can you know whatever is happening from a calm and subtled place

72
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:36,860
so that there is qualities of freedom

73
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,179
in the knowing

74
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:52,279
maybe some quality of knowing which is not something you do

75
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:59,659
but the kind of knowing that arises by itself

76
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:03,140
when we're present

77
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,919
thank you

78
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:56,059
sometimes mindfulness practice

79
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:03,299
is to bring ourselves to be so present

80
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:08,059
and available for our experience

81
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:15,320
that knowing arises on its own

82
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:25,039
and it can be challenging to do this

83
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:32,000
because this way of being present can feel vulnerable

84
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:45,620
but to be present in a relaxed and full way

85
00:25:45,779 --> 00:25:52,919
so that knowing can be at ease relaxed

86
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:03,679
maybe knowing the relief of not asserting ourselves or

87
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:12,840
defending ourselves or judging and commentary about ourselves

88
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:20,120
just present knowing the freedom

89
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,779
of how we know

90
00:26:45,059 --> 00:26:51,380
and when we allow ourselves to be this fully present for others

91
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:59,340
without defensiveness or assertiveness just fully present and available

92
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:07,820
to know them with a relaxed open awareness relaxed easy knowing

93
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:16,260
maybe something like kindness

94
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:24,840
good will will well up inside

95
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:30,240
will vibrate well radiate

96
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:41,039
maybe there's a good will love a care compassion

97
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,960
it's not a doing

98
00:27:47,460 --> 00:27:51,500
but an arising

99
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:00,440
when we're fully present open presence to what is

100
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:07,520
kind of a good will

101
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:16,039
which is expressed in these sentiments

102
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:21,440
May others be happy

103
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:30,140
May others be safe

104
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:40,400
May others be peaceful May others be free

105
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:48,980
and may this good will that I feel

106
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:59,779
may it be known by others May others know

107
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:07,700
that they're held in Good Will fight friendliness kindness

108
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:15,860
and may we know each other that way may all beings be happy

109
00:29:24,890 --> 00:29:29,249
[Music]

110
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,399
thank you

111
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:47,520
so we come to the last Fifth and last talk on the insight pentad

112
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:51,020
and these are the

113
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:59,840
five qualities including Insight that that flow together that rise together

114
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:06,799
not as something that's constructed or made to happen but something that um

115
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:12,299
conditions each other or one leads to the other awakens to the other

116
00:30:12,299 --> 00:30:17,580
triggers the other and um

117
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:23,460
you know many people would think that it would ends with Liberation the fourth of

118
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:29,399
these Insight pentats five qualities and um shouldn't that be enough

119
00:30:29,399 --> 00:30:36,720
liberation but the Liberation itself uh is a condition for the arising of a fifth

120
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,960
quality and that's the knowledge that one is liberated knowledge that the mind is

121
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:49,679
liberated and um there are people who have some degree of

122
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:55,580
you know realization Liberation something that really sets them free

123
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:03,120
and they kind of know that they've had something significant but they don't really know it they don't

124
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:09,840
understand what's happened and this knowing of it is to understand something profound about it

125
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:17,820
and uh and uh as uh so many times for the Buddha it's uh uh it's a know

126
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:23,460
something specific it's not some generalized vague idea of

127
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:30,360
what Liberation is what freedom is because some people will have some profound feeling of peace or calm or

128
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,460
some letting go that happens that feels so relieving and releasing

129
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:41,520
but they don't understand what they've let go of they don't understand what they've opened up into and you know

130
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:47,760
what's really this experience like and without knowing that it's hard to

131
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,659
find the PATH there again it's hard to know what this path is really about then

132
00:31:53,659 --> 00:32:01,980
some people will have some kind of wonderful experience of peace and and think well that's the point and

133
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:08,460
kind of try to get back there but they don't understand the conditions that led to it and they don't understand what it

134
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:13,500
is at the particular that that was experienced or came along with that

135
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:19,080
piece so they know kind of what they're working towards what it's about what the

136
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:24,480
kind of the um the the uh the North Star is that

137
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:30,240
they're kind of working for and um so I want to read to you what I started

138
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:37,380
talking about yesterday uh the Buddha uh gives a list of 17 specific

139
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:43,860
psychological States that can be known they can know that they're there these

140
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:49,919
are painful States and we can know when we're free of them when they're absent

141
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:55,440
and seeing that specificity of it or this is this was afflictive this was

142
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,279
painful and now wow it's no longer there it's been released

143
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:06,960
this is a part of the insights and it's also part of Liberation that shows the

144
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:12,740
kind of circular nature of it the spiral perhaps and so as we

145
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:20,700
experienced some real clear sense of the falling away the ceasing

146
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:27,600
of say hate and really experience ourselves take time to know that this is the absence of

147
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:34,320
hate not just know that it's peaceful but really no this is the absence of hate then we start getting the

148
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:40,080
information about what hate is about and the alternative that we become

149
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:46,080
increasingly disenchanted with hate we've increasingly

150
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:51,600
um uh it's up to start the underlying tendency to hate which is uh starts to

151
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:57,480
fade away and then there's a again a qualitatively different way of releasing hate

152
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:04,019
and then we know we've released it and then that's a kind of an Insight that the whole thing can develop further and

153
00:34:04,019 --> 00:34:10,260
further so I want to read this list of 17 specific States

154
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:15,898
that the Buddha talks about that one could know their present and we could know when they're absent and for the

155
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:20,940
Buddha this is very significant it's in a discourse called the simile of the cloth in the middle length

156
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:27,599
discourses um the the list is

157
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:33,839
um Covetous covetousness

158
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:39,000
unethical greed ill will

159
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:45,419
anger resentment contempt insolence

160
00:34:45,419 --> 00:34:52,378
Envy avarice deceit fraud obstacy

161
00:34:52,379 --> 00:35:01,920
rivalry conceit arrogance vanity and carelessness

162
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:08,880
and uh or negligence so some of these

163
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:14,520
translations to English might not be exactly what there is in Pali so you

164
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,619
know we can maybe find other words that are a little bit a little bit more meaningful for us

165
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:27,119
but uh the idea is that if a person when we practice we can know that these they're

166
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:32,760
called afflictive because they hurt to have these present one can know that they're there

167
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:37,980
and feel the pain and um and it's possible that they can be let go of

168
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:43,140
either we let go of them or somehow they fade away they disappear they're not

169
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:49,680
there and if we know that they're there first really no wow

170
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:58,260
and sometimes you know this uh this is bad news to know that I have contempt but in the Dharma you want to know that

171
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:04,440
so-called bad news in an open non-reactive way it's really important

172
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:09,480
to feel to know the states of mind that are afflictive that are causing pain and

173
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:15,420
not to pretty them up or deny them or ignore them oh this is I'm living with

174
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:23,400
you know contempt with their resentment with greed

175
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,680
and then because we know something about knowing that's there the clarity of that

176
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:36,119
then allows the mindfulness the awareness practice to make room for it to fade away for us to be disinterested

177
00:36:36,119 --> 00:36:43,320
and for it to fade away that won't happen if we ignore it and haven't really admitted to ourselves or these

178
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:48,920
are there so here we find the example that Buddha being you know in modern terms

179
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,540
psychological about the discussions of the path he's very specific about

180
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:59,700
psychological states that are being addressed so this is what we we can know

181
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:07,020
and then we can know when they're let go of when they're absent and that knowing of their absent in this

182
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,420
text if there's a way of knowing it which is inspiring

183
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,880
it's inspiring to know it's possible to be free of these things even if it's

184
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:24,480
temporarily to have the experience of the Mind wow I've been with this for my lifetime with

185
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:30,000
this for decades for a long time and I had no idea how there can be a

186
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:36,180
qualitative experience a good quality experience of it not being there

187
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:42,960
so this allowing shelves to know that we're liberated and really recognize that where the absence the freedom of

188
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:48,900
something that can give birth to an inspiration and to confidence

189
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:57,240
the Buddha calls it a verified confidence it's uh we have or verified Faith it's

190
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:03,839
verified because we know for ourselves that this is possible it's and even if some of these states come

191
00:38:03,839 --> 00:38:10,140
back the confidence is there the trust is there that this is valuable this is a

192
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:16,140
direction to go this is important and then the Buddha in this text goes on

193
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:24,900
to say that this confidence and inspiration this is possible this is the Catalyst for the gladness

194
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:30,960
pentad the five qualities I talked about last week that also have this natural

195
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,599
flow to them that when there's inspiration there's gladness when there's gladness there can and we're

196
00:38:36,599 --> 00:38:44,880
present for it and allow for the practice and practice with it in the context of it that uh morphs or changes

197
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:51,180
into joy that changes into a Tranquility physical tranquility and peace and that

198
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:57,000
can open up into a kind of a deep subtle feeling of happiness or contentment

199
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:03,060
that is a foundation for becoming unified for samadhi

200
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:10,560
and that's unification of samadhi that has that Focus that clarity then uh

201
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:16,920
Begins the insight pentad the insight

202
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,200
disenchantment fading away Liberation and then today knowledge of Liberation

203
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:27,240
knowing it so as I said before they kind of go to

204
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,640
spiral they support each other and move on and on and how Liberation is of some

205
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:37,800
kind even if it's very temporary of particular mental States so this is

206
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:43,079
something we can identify and know for ourselves um otherwise you know some people have

207
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:48,660
such a vague idea of what enlightenment is or freedom is that you know it's just

208
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:56,400
always kind of a Mythic event it's kind of like maybe not so relevant for me and it's good for the you know the you know

209
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:03,359
for the great meditators who go live in caves but what about my life in everyday life here where I'm dealing with you

210
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:09,720
know getting the kids to school and the work and all kinds of things

211
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:15,839
but uh by naming the psychological States the Buddha is kind of maybe making it really Irrelevant this is

212
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:21,960
what's important here and then he goes on in this text this

213
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:27,440
phenomenal text it talks about this natural flow of arising he talks about

214
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:35,119
from the inspiration comes the gladness pentad and from that the samadhi the the

215
00:40:35,119 --> 00:40:40,680
unification gives rise to loving-kindness to Metta

216
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:45,780
and so the whole meta and then the Brahma viharas are all part of this

217
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:53,520
natural flow this it's almost like these this is an almost like inherent qualities within the or capacities or

218
00:40:53,520 --> 00:41:00,599
potentials Within that um can be set free that can be open to be allowed to flow through us

219
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:06,960
so there's not something that's constructed or made to happen or engineered but something that we allow

220
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:14,760
for and that's the underlying theme of these uh two pentats gladness pentat and the

221
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:21,359
Insight pentad is that there are natural forces within us that can be Unleashed

222
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:27,180
and open up where we We Roll Along to what we open up to these wonderful

223
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:32,220
states of of deepening practice um

224
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:39,420
and um so it's insight

225
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:45,240
insight to what is insight to what is no longer there

226
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:52,200
inside the absence of afflictive states that have bothered us for a long time

227
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:58,440
and the absence of those afflictive States might give us a possibility to

228
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:05,460
become more aware of how we know how we're aware something so that how we're aware is not

229
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:11,339
afflictive so how aware doesn't partake or share with some of the greed or the

230
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:17,900
ill will aversion that's contempt to resentment that might

231
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:26,579
be with us but which influences how we know and so to begin finding a knowing which

232
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:33,060
is freeing and knowing which has qualities of freedom and ease and peace and then using that

233
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:39,000
to a way of knowing to know to practice mindfulness to be aware

234
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:44,339
and so that the very Act of knowing is part of the path of freedom is where we

235
00:42:44,339 --> 00:42:51,920
find the freedom and allows us to go seek more and more clearly what's have What's um

236
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:57,559
so uh the um

237
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:07,039
so Insight in the inside pentad then uh

238
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:15,540
May your mindfulness practice lead to Insight and may the insight

239
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:22,020
open this world up of the Dharma moving through you

240
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:28,260
so thank you very much and I look forward to seeing you or being with you

241
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:32,000
again on Monday
