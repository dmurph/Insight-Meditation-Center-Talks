1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:07,480
good morning welcome if you've arrived pleasure to be here with you all

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,519
today on this beautiful Sunday morning so

3
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:19,000
um going to offer some words to go into a little bit of a guided meditation for

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,599
this period and um by the time we come you would come out up probably have my

5
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:30,359
jacket off but I run a little cold so I have to keep it on for a bit

6
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:38,399
and um in going into this meditation I'd like to invite you to take a look at this statue right here

7
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:46,960
of the Buddha right next to us it's an instruction I

8
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:56,600
find it's an instruction of a potential a potential for a refuge

9
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:09,119
so in closing your eyes when you wish As You Wish if you

10
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:19,960
wish feeling welcomed here exactly as you

11
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:28,280
are fully accepted as you are however your mind is however your heart is

12
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:44,159
and knowing that we're here in a refuge and maybe with

13
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,078
time that Refuge takes hold

14
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:01,840
within witnessing the body Rhythm the rhythm of the breath

15
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:14,680
but being very curious about the breath like a gentle benevolent

16
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:22,280
parent who's looking coming into this body to say h how is this

17
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,160
breath a benevolent figure doesn't come and try to do or change

18
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:37,799
anything just kind of witnesses sees

19
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:46,680
connects there's inhale there's exhale there's

20
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:55,400
Rhythm how is it for you watching it like a benevolent

21
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,599
figure would participate

22
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,440
over time as we sit in

23
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:23,840
silence maybe we learn how to feel this Refuge

24
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:33,159
within from a deep place within from some place of some basic

25
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,319
satisfaction being here

26
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,000
now a simple place of contentment the

27
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,480
breath breathing

28
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:01,439
itself maybe a place of Tranquility with

29
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,799
wisdom that holds you as you

30
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,079
are in this body breathing

31
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:33,600
itself and with feeling feeling some sense of this loving

32
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,039
guide of a

33
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:45,639
refuge taking note if there's anything that's not

34
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:49,400
calm maybe a little

35
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:58,639
agitated and breathing noticing

36
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:05,039
if you can take that in from a tranquil place maybe there's some other tranquil

37
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:12,320
place here that allows you to be with agitation

38
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:40,960
and with breathing happening all in its

39
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,638
own from some deep place

40
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:56,160
within we can know and receive in Awareness in

41
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,638
mindfulness what's here

42
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:12,960
this body this fathom long body is

43
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:26,680
here sensing knowing the body from the very crown of the head down to the toes

44
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:30,680
to the bottom of the feet

45
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:50,560
maybe we can know an exhale or two it allows the body

46
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,000
to just rest here a little more all on its

47
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:04,960
own come down into its

48
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:26,840
weight and one of the things that we can know be aware

49
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:34,639
of is how are thinking

50
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:42,800
maybe sometimes thinking is going so fast that uh there is this feeling of

51
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,759
disconnection almost puts us out of bodyy a little

52
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:55,599
bit it's okay no problem with

53
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,720
it we can be aware of it

54
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:11,319
and we can be aware with aware of it from a calm

55
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:18,680
Place whatever it calm is here embodied

56
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,240
breathing and then it could be a little interesting

57
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:32,198
wow that thinking is of few steps

58
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:41,159
away there is this Global body

59
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,360
here to rest release

60
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,000
maybe we can give room to the

61
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:15,959
thinking feeling the sensation of any tension from the thinking any

62
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:31,360
pressure not no need to push it away try to stop it

63
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:40,920
sensing the body breathing and knowing whatever comes

64
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,399
into your awareness

65
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:30,320
we can also know that mindfulness itself is calming

66
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:38,320
awareness is calming awareness or mindfulness has its

67
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,320
own

68
00:10:53,760 --> 00:11:00,720
tranquility and it can be useful to know that there are different kinds of thinking

69
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:15,040
there is discursive thinking that's like a story or running stream

70
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:21,839
of verbal Expressions visual

71
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:28,519
Expressions ideas Notions all kinds of things

72
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,320
and with your calm

73
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:43,240
awareness noticing that ongoing commentary if it's

74
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:59,760
there we can maybe notice how that commentary

75
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,680
that ongoing story line of thought and

76
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:14,800
thinking it's a bit of a leak like mindfulness is leaking out as

77
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:21,319
opposed to being tranquil isn't that

78
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,160
interesting while you go and rest in your tranquil awareness to whatever

79
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
degree is there

80
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:58,399
there's also there's also thinking that's non-discursive

81
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:10,920
that's just simple a few words oh this is

82
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:16,079
thinking oh this is

83
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,480
tension maybe I should feel it

84
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:35,240
oh I felt that enough maybe I should begin to breathe

85
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:42,360
again very simple thinking that guides the

86
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:52,320
meditation quiet little thoughts of recognition of

87
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:00,440
understanding that are probably best when they are tranquil

88
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:31,040
and then and then the final thinking I'm going to offer

89
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:40,880
is nonverbal thinking just kind of a non verble

90
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:49,920
knowing these can be like wise thoughts from deep inside deep in your

91
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:56,399
refuge and knowing that makes thinking quieter

92
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:09,720
a knowing that knows maybe the story making discursive

93
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:15,560
thought is going on can go on in the

94
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:25,560
background but here in the wise knowing it just knows ah there that is

95
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:38,120
and then all along continuing to allow

96
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:45,959
relaxation resting with the rhythm of breathing

97
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:10,720
relaxing with any exhales that bring

98
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:23,920
relaxation opening with an

99
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:30,920
inhale like the body opens up from within and kind of Gathers

100
00:16:31,399 --> 00:16:37,079
than itself to relax and an ex

101
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:59,040
inhale maybe bringing a relaxation in the hips or the center of your core

102
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:27,640
and then for the remainder of this sit this

103
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,760
meditation let getting attention being rooted

104
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:39,480
somewhere maybe it's the rhythm of

105
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:49,480
breathing maybe it's some deep stability in the

106
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:59,679
center maybe a tension resting like that

107
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,320
can be like a calm hand on a

108
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,840
shoulder that

109
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,440
comforts supportively

110
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:37,080
a support that allows well-being to

111
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:51,120
grow a comforting hand on the

112
00:18:52,400 --> 00:19:00,720
shoulder that gives a sense of sweet tender ease

113
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
for e

114
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
for

115
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
for

116
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:31,559
e e

117
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
what

118
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

119
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

120
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

121
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

122
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

123
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

124
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
e

125
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,278
e for

126
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:11,880
and an invitation to feel and rest whatever

127
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:18,960
relaxation is available whatever relaxation comes from

128
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,880
your body resting here breathing

129
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:33,679
together inviting you to feel the that let the well-being

130
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,399
grow that comes with

131
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:57,159
relaxing maybe being steadfast letting the well-being fill

132
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:02,519
you up it's

133
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:13,639
good you deserve that your

134
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:19,120
Birthright to feel

135
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:33,440
well-being and if you're steadfast with it letting

136
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,158
it happen on a

137
00:28:39,399 --> 00:28:48,200
tone maybe it can fill you up like a big broad big broad

138
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:58,240
Lake and then your well-being spreads out Beyond you

139
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:19,080
and in the middle of it all you're in this can enter into the center

140
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:22,440
of your attention

141
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:43,600
entering to that Refuge that holds you as you

142
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,240
are receives you as you

143
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:00,880
are and maybe even a little bit bit over time

144
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:07,679
trusting resting being reassured by that center

145
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:11,799
of attention at Refuge

146
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:27,278
inside and there's no need to be thinking reacting responding right now

147
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:40,679
all the doing can just rest can settle in a reassuring

148
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:50,159
way like that hand on your shoulder on your heart your inner Refuge

149
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:05,519
an attention that's steadied still

150
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:11,360
quiet peaceful

151
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:29,919

172
00:36:16,599 --> 00:36:22,000
meditation you're so welcome pleasure to be here with all of you today on this

173
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,000
day

174
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,760
abut thank you so on Tuesday

175
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:45,520
evening I found myself I was at a retreat on a

176
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,040
retreat I didn't schedule it because it happened to coincide on that day it was

177
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:59,240
when the teacher was teaching that I wanted to be with and I was um

178
00:36:59,319 --> 00:37:04,560
by this Lake Shore looking at these mountain peaks at

179
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,880
sunset for about an hour I sat by the water looking at the mountain peaks

180
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:16,079
watching the water change into these amazing fabulous changes that water at

181
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:24,560
Sunset can do with 10,000 foot tall Peaks across this water the changes of

182
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,520
light uh on the water we mesmerizing

183
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:36,839
it was deeply relaxing and um deeply moving because I was aware that night uh

184
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:42,839
what was taking place that night I was not watching news of course I was in

185
00:37:42,839 --> 00:37:47,880
silence um silent practice and

186
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:55,800
um I looked at the Peaks the mountain peaks at one of the most beautiful moments of

187
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:05,720
light and um I started to sob deeply deeply deeply

188
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:11,880
inside because regardless of the

189
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:19,040
news there was no doubt that there would be a lot of

190
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:28,000
pain and um and so I made a small little gesture

191
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:35,319
just uh may all citizens of the United

192
00:38:35,319 --> 00:38:44,838
States be at peace may all be at

193
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:53,520
ease and may all be well and i' continue

194
00:38:55,480 --> 00:39:03,559
sobbing knowing that there would would be pain next to

195
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:13,040
Joy and so that's how that went for me that was probably one of the

196
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:21,200
highlights of the retreat for me there was a very challenging Retreat for me physically because of uh the weather

197
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:29,240
or where I was at so I'd like to share uh

198
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:36,680
not other words from that night um these are called a prayer for our

199
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:41,559
times they come from our co-identified

200
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,560
by side side by side regardless of our

201
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,599
differences where there is hate let us stand in Hate's

202
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:17,200
way with love where others offers offer care we

203
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:24,760
offer to help where others neglect to care we

204
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,560
offer what we can

205
00:40:30,119 --> 00:40:36,400
where there is respect we offer friendship where there is no respect we

206
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,838
offer

207
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:51,240
kindness this was posted on the IMC website on Wednesday morning I believe or maybe Tuesday

208
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,880
night and um and so here we are with Buddhist

209
00:40:56,880 --> 00:41:04,680
practice and I'll read one line from the statement that is

210
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:10,240
posted the greater our challenges the greater the value of Buddhist

211
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,560
practice rather than a practice to avoid challenges or to avoid

212
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:22,440
celebration it is a practice that prepares us to meet them wisely and

213
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:27,800
calmly we can meet all our inner life with honesty

214
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:34,240
and Good Will so we can be wise and

215
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:40,319
skillful so we can be wise and skillful in these

216
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:47,200
times that maybe deserve some prayer some good

217
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:55,400
wishes and some wisdom so we can be calm and strong and

218
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,240
Fierce and ready and alert

219
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:10,240
so I thought I would share some Reflections about um a

220
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:17,760
practice that is about I think offers a lot of nurturing

221
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:24,839
wisdom nurturing that may be needed more now for some and nurturing that's always

222
00:42:24,839 --> 00:42:31,920
needed and it's the practice of mind fness of the body mindfulness of the body is one of

223
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:39,040
the three great mindfulness practices one of the three great

224
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:47,280
sutas there's mindfulness the four establishments of mindfulness we all may be aware of the

225
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:52,640
Sati patana suta there's the mindfulness of breathing the

226
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:59,119
anapanasati and then there's mindfulness of the body in P it's k

227
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:05,359
Sati and um I'm going to share some Reflections

228
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:14,039
from gain in part from a retreat that I did uh in September for several weeks

229
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:19,920
um because this suta this way of building mindfulness building our

230
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:26,079
practice building our awareness is ladened and filled with these very

231
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:34,200
inspiring and softening qualities very nurturing I think because

232
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:40,480
right from the very beginning the Buddha is putting us into a

233
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:48,280
position that um has us to build alongside our

234
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:53,960
mindfulness concentration otherwise known as

235
00:43:53,960 --> 00:44:01,440
Samar so this conjunction of um there so there's a conjunction of

236
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:09,520
healing the healing practices of somebody all along this suta so your

237
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:15,240
concentration can be very healing because it gives gives us a

238
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:21,079
sense of wholeness it builds a sense of wholeness it can offer

239
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:28,160
Clarity because it allows us to be able to discern and see

240
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:34,599
and it also gives us momentum in our awareness

241
00:44:34,599 --> 00:44:41,640
so he says the Buddha says the instructions in the the beginning instructions the monks are all talking

242
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:47,559
as they do and he comes in and he then tells he they're talking about mindfulness of breathing and he said

243
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:55,200
this is of great fruit and great benefit and uh and maybe you'll think it

244
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:02,119
is I'd like to point to some of those fruits to see if they're helpful in

245
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:09,839
building our wisdom in coming to the wise thinking that wise place of

246
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:16,319
knowing where we can maybe act from in these days in these months and

247
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:23,200
these these coming periods is this new age that we are

248
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:30,280
in and it's um the first part is very much like the

249
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:35,319
Sati batana the four main practices of the body starts with mindfulness of

250
00:45:35,319 --> 00:45:43,480
breathing bodily postures the 31 body parts the elements

251
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:49,160
um and then the contemplations of the corpse and what's exciting is that right

252
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:54,559
at the beginning we're asked to cultivate

253
00:45:54,559 --> 00:46:01,000
calming in the first practice the Buddha instructs us to know the

254
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:09,800
breath know if it's long know if it's short and then to feel it to sense it

255
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:16,960
how it is in the whole body to sense your whole body to sense the

256
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:24,680
relaxation and then to linger on that relaxation so to linger on

257
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:30,640
calm I think it's a very encouraging ing way to start because when we can linger

258
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:36,240
un calm we connect to this

259
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:43,960
contentment and then our practice is founded on

260
00:46:44,839 --> 00:46:50,440
contentment and it's very supportive

261
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:57,359
to linger on contentment to have it as a reference point and to have a reference

262
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:03,400
point and then right after this um he says gives those four

263
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:11,160
instructions and then as one abides thus diligently steadfast

264
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:18,599
resolved the memories and intentions based on the worldly life are

265
00:47:18,599 --> 00:47:24,520
abandoned and with their abandoning the mind is become steadied internally

266
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:29,680
quieted brought to singleness and concentrated that is how one develops

267
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:36,920
mindfulness of the body so right away the Buddha is presenting us with as we come here like

268
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:44,880
we just did in this meditation what we were coming here to this meditation we were taking a moment to

269
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:53,280
put aside memories and tensions of the worldly life the non meditation life so

270
00:47:53,280 --> 00:48:00,800
for these moments to care for our our ourselves in this way to step into this

271
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:05,920
place and this invitation it's a respectful invitation because we do it

272
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:10,720
if we want to we do it if we choose

273
00:48:11,079 --> 00:48:17,440
to and the invitation to put aside discontent

274
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:25,240
fear dread for some moments is an invitation to go deep

275
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:31,920
inside it's an in itation to turn toward something else to turn toward the

276
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,960
practicing the cultivation and the developing of something

277
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:44,000
else the wise thinking that I mentioned that emanates

278
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:49,359
from a place that's much much deeper in all of us

279
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:57,880
than all words and all thoughts some essential quality of us

280
00:48:57,880 --> 00:49:05,839
in the discourses that's called the chitta the heart mind in more common vernacular people

281
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,160
use a term like the soul your

282
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:19,359
spirit the deep deepness within so that is our reference

283
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:26,960
point going towards this deepness within to care for it to cultivate it so

284
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:34,440
that it becomes a great fruit and a great benefit a great place to come

285
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:42,119
from and then I will jump to the end to give you the

286
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:50,160
punchline because I think you might um so the benefits of mindfulness of the

287
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:57,240
body I'll just share a couple after it's been practiced developed and cultivated

288
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:02,839
one becomes a conqueror of fear and

289
00:50:02,839 --> 00:50:10,280
dread doesn't that sound pretty good one becomes a conqueror of

290
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:19,240
discontent and Delight maybe not the Delight part um but um discontent to

291
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:26,280
conquer discontent and then there are many other

292
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:33,000
there are few few others the other one that is that one obtains at will without trouble and difficulty the four

293
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:40,280
absorptions that means that we have great concentration available to us to

294
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:46,400
whatever degree we practice mindfulness of the body and as I was saying the con the

295
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:53,720
samade the concentration part that's being conjointly developed

296
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:59,160
here is is very good for us

297
00:50:59,160 --> 00:51:05,319
because to reach toward calm and by concentration I'm referring to the whole

298
00:51:05,319 --> 00:51:10,839
family of Tranquility practices Tranquility is

299
00:51:10,839 --> 00:51:17,640
calm Serenity ease

300
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:24,040
joy happiness equinity

301
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:34,839
how does that sound so to have more of that right from

302
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:40,160
the very first instruction is what we're instructed and given the opportunity to

303
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:45,680
cultivate and invited to cultivate for

304
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:51,079
ourselves by putting aside for a few moments for the time as much as we

305
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:58,000
can the Fear The Dread of the outside world even the

306
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:04,000
Delight of the outside world to feel and

307
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:09,960
sense something and so there are six bodily

308
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:16,559
practices that we do and how this works is um is through the physicality of this

309
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:23,880
being so this this psychophysical system that we have

310
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:30,359
is amazing and it's full of nerves that go

311
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:38,079
everywhere and when as we are aware of the the touch the sense the feel of any

312
00:52:38,079 --> 00:52:45,359
touch that we are consciously aware of we're registering our Attention our attention

313
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:50,480
is registering and is coming alive we're

314
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:57,359
enlivening the attention and at the same time the tension

315
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:01,359
of the body can

316
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:11,799
dissolve and that's very good because there's a lot of energy that goes into holding tensions all the tensions that

317
00:53:11,799 --> 00:53:17,599
uh we make carry so to relax them to ease

318
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:22,760
them and we don't do this

319
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:28,440
alone we're given a reference point of

320
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:34,720
Tranquility so the contentment that

321
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:42,559
comes is like our guide our accompaniment so we hold this

322
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:48,160
contentment it's our reference point while we're going inside and doing

323
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:56,559
this Insight work of touching feeling the touch feeling the sense feeling all

324
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:03,838
the different manifestations of Sensations knowing

325
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:11,040
them with support resting with contentment that's the

326
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:18,319
great supporting thing that's happening in this discourse there's our Insight

327
00:54:18,319 --> 00:54:25,119
practice seeing Fai looking knowing sensing how things are flowing changing

328
00:54:25,119 --> 00:54:34,000
and how our awareness grows that way so we build our mindfulness and we're doing it with a

329
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:40,160
support because we need support it's much easier to do the practice if it's

330
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:47,520
supported if we have a helper like a guide like a companion along the way

331
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:53,318
that comes from within us that is us is our own

332
00:54:53,640 --> 00:55:01,000
contentment and so the body has a lot to teach and a lot to

333
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:08,359
show to mindfulness and it's very good because the Buddha in this um discourse

334
00:55:08,359 --> 00:55:14,359
has um these great similes for um the kind of mindfulness

335
00:55:14,359 --> 00:55:20,799
that we want there's a lot of water similes here and

336
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:28,000
uh water is very special when it comes to samadi concentration

337
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:34,160
because um these these similes sometimes teach us better what we're supposed what

338
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:41,119
we can feel in concentration in relaxation how we can experience

339
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:47,200
relaxing so the Buddha says that uh we want to build our mindfulness so that

340
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:52,240
it's not wet like a mound of wet clay

341
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:58,240
because the stone can come and squash the

342
00:55:58,520 --> 00:56:03,880
clay so your mindfulness we don't want it to be so

343
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:09,599
soft like wet clay that it can be just squashed by all the

344
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:16,920
externalities that come here he uses the term Mara for those external forces that are also

345
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:22,559
internal forces of all the fear and dread that comes and

346
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:30,839
squashes our mindfulness so we also um want to have a mindfulness

347
00:56:30,839 --> 00:56:36,680
that's um not like an empty jug of water we

348
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:41,798
want to have a mindfulness that's like a full jug of

349
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:49,599
water we also want to have a mindfulness that's strong like a door made out of

350
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:58,240
Heartwood heartswood is the core of a tree that's the hardest wood

351
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:06,280
so what does it take for you to have your mindfulness be like

352
00:57:06,359 --> 00:57:12,720
Heartwood what do you need what will what will support

353
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:19,559
you I asked this so that um you ask yourself and you know for

354
00:57:19,559 --> 00:57:27,400
yourself what do you need what do I need do I need more peace do I need more

355
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:33,920
calm do I need what kind of support do I need what kind of guide do I need what

356
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:39,119
kind of steadiness do I need I don't know what do what do you

357
00:57:39,119 --> 00:57:45,599
need what kind of benevolence do you need to hold you along the

358
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:52,039
way because it's a practice it says here over and over

359
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:57,599
again one practices mindfulness of the body we keep going back back to

360
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:03,319
experience the body from the inside experience the body how the body experiences

361
00:58:03,319 --> 00:58:10,079
itself because every moment that we are aware of a sense touch right there

362
00:58:10,079 --> 00:58:15,359
there's a sense touch I can be aware of that I can register that and my

363
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:23,240
attention is mindfulness is growing so we're full of nerves with

364
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:28,599
sense contact to build mindfulness from the

365
00:58:28,599 --> 00:58:35,400
inside with the body and through the

366
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:41,520
body and uh as we keep doing this as we keep doing this along the way we're

367
00:58:41,520 --> 00:58:46,640
moving toward more and more

368
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:56,240
concentration the practice here after goes through all the body parts then moves into the the four absorptions

369
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,760
these great States of uh meditative calm and serenity and

370
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:09,799
concentration and um what's really really exciting for me is what happens

371
00:59:09,799 --> 00:59:15,799
along the way because this discourse traces the gradual development of the

372
00:59:15,799 --> 00:59:22,400
whole Buddhist path the whole Buddhist path can be understood as CA

373
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:30,160
ethics Samar concentration or meditation and Pa

374
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:36,880
wisdom and so we're being asked we have to as we do mindfulness as we know we we

375
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:42,799
look at our ethics we look at what is wholesome and what's not

376
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:51,559
wholesome in our thoughts in our realm right um because the more we align with

377
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:57,920
the wholesomeness The More We Get true with the whol

378
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:03,160
ESS the more we can actually have our

379
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:08,480
concentration and so before the absorptions usually

380
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:17,079
there's this um process of the hindering forces the

381
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:23,839
fear the dread the classic hindrances if you know those sensual desire and

382
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:32,480
restlessness and sloth and aversion not in that order and

383
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:38,680
doubt and one of the most interesting things about these hindrances I have

384
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:45,000
found is that hindrance of Doubt to

385
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:53,160
have no doubt of wholesomeness Doubt is doubt of

386
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:59,920
wholesomeness can be seen in the teaching in as doubt doubting

387
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:05,558
wholesomeness so to not doubt

388
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:17,079
wholesomeness to take that as a stand is tremendously

389
01:01:17,079 --> 01:01:23,039
healing tremendously strengthening it is one of the fiercest

390
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:29,200
things I have found to make

391
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:34,599
wholesomeness front and center of

392
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:43,599
everything it Powers this mindfulness in a way that nothing else

393
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:50,400
can for me so far because it just allows the flowing

394
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:57,119
of what wants to emerge to emerge and it doesn't just doesn't Veer

395
01:01:57,119 --> 01:02:06,160
into things that are not useful not helpful that hurt me because it's my own

396
01:02:06,160 --> 01:02:13,960
thoughts this is all happening inside of me when I allow the UN wholesomeness in

397
01:02:13,960 --> 01:02:20,960
here it's here that mindfulness is being

398
01:02:20,960 --> 01:02:28,880
contracted I'm not it's not flowing it's not being aware it's not it put putting

399
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:36,200
walls so it's really a wondrous things once these hindrances Begin to Fall away

400
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:43,119
and the the teachings are encouraging us to be mindfulness of the body right so

401
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:48,240
to be paying attention to senses

402
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:54,160
and it's like when you know that aversion from a

403
01:02:54,160 --> 01:03:00,319
few days ago stops is not here anymore maybe there was

404
01:03:00,319 --> 01:03:05,880
some nice angry sad thought you had last

405
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:13,319
week that's not here in the same way so that

406
01:03:13,319 --> 01:03:19,240
absence can be felt that as absence is something to

407
01:03:19,240 --> 01:03:27,599
linger on as our hindering forces go away fade away

408
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:32,920
there's like this room to feel goodness from that and it's a goodness that's

409
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:38,440
really worthwhile to feel to cherish and to let

410
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:46,799
increase that's how deep concentration deep calm comes when we allow that when

411
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:53,839
we rest in that when we see that oh now I'm not thinking about that

412
01:03:53,839 --> 01:04:01,799
anymore ah that feeling of relaxation that's like a

413
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:08,400
cheerleader so all those moments are like cheerleaders like go go keep going

414
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:15,480
keep letting go keep releasing keep going this is good this is the

415
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:23,839
way this is the way to be completely free in here

416
01:04:25,839 --> 01:04:33,960
so that's what happens as we let ourselves go into concentration and seek

417
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:41,920
concentration so I'll just briefly mention kind of the verbs that I associate with the E this absorption

418
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:47,640
States because there are these um meditative states that require a lot of meditative

419
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:54,079
skill so there's this welling up welling up as we get more concentrated there's

420
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:59,520
just a welling up that happens after there's a saturation like the saturation

421
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:07,279
of those Feelgood moments of release when we're no longer being held back by

422
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:12,920
the thinking process the emotionals emotional emotions that were

423
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:18,920
that were really darkening us that were really aversive when those go away when

424
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:27,920
those Flow Away the practice is come notice take that in really rest in that really let

425
01:05:27,920 --> 01:05:34,599
your body be full filled with that and these absorptions um are examples of

426
01:05:34,599 --> 01:05:39,680
being filled up by this wholesomeness and they they met their

427
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:48,200
water metaphors um saturation welling up um being

428
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:54,640
contentedly satisfied and then ease and a bright

429
01:05:54,640 --> 01:06:03,558
mind those are the things that await those are the things that are Ava become available through mindfulness of the

430
01:06:08,039 --> 01:06:16,359
body and so we have this then and what what does what do we gain

431
01:06:16,359 --> 01:06:24,960
from this to talk about that I'm going to mention these um two metaphors uh two

432
01:06:24,960 --> 01:06:30,279
water metaphors for that the Buddha uses in this discourse so remember about the water

433
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:38,279
jug I mentioned so that water jug

434
01:06:39,279 --> 01:06:47,359
when mindfulness has been fully developed it's an an example is that it's like a jug full of

435
01:06:47,359 --> 01:06:52,559
water so what the Buddha says here that

436
01:06:52,559 --> 01:06:59,000
jug is tipped over and the water is set

437
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:08,920
free water set free maybe water needs to be free maybe water is free in the world

438
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:16,000
and so it's a it's a metaphor for our mindfulness our awareness when our awareness is able

439
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:22,000
to is developed then our awareness is set free

440
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:28,640
to have deep insight has access to deep liberating

441
01:07:28,640 --> 01:07:33,880
insight and for our purposes here it's to to really look at what happens to

442
01:07:33,880 --> 01:07:40,960
suffering when we have a settledness to have a insightful

443
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:47,960
connection and contact with suffering as suffering

444
01:07:48,279 --> 01:07:55,960
is we learn these amazing things about suffering we learn that suffering is not

445
01:07:55,960 --> 01:08:02,480
constant right and not only is it not

446
01:08:02,480 --> 01:08:09,880
constant there's a gap that opens up when we can see that suffering

447
01:08:10,839 --> 01:08:18,359
ends and it's like we can just become that Gap we are no longer we know that

448
01:08:18,359 --> 01:08:24,480
there's a place where there is no suffering that can become a reference

449
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:30,640
point the inner eye opens up to there is no

450
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:35,920
suffering or if there is suffering there is an end of suffering

451
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:42,520
it it's in constant and I can cultivate my way

452
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:48,758
there by resting this way in my

453
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:56,278
body in the awareness and then turning the awareness to see how suffering ing

454
01:08:56,279 --> 01:08:58,838
actually

455
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:07,920
is and as we do that we tap into that place that I

456
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:15,159
mentioned in the guided instruction that I mentioned before that nonverbal

457
01:09:15,159 --> 01:09:21,920
place there's a place beyond all the words all the

458
01:09:21,920 --> 01:09:29,318
constructions all the thoughts all the ideas ideas that's just a

459
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:34,359
deep place of knowing in us and so we

460
01:09:34,359 --> 01:09:43,000
can come from that place to look out to the world to be with this

461
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:49,159
world to be with this world first and then to be with the outer

462
01:09:49,159 --> 01:09:55,880
world and that can be a beautiful place literally a beautiful place

463
01:09:55,880 --> 01:10:04,520
because that's a place where we can choose from a place of self assurance of steadiness of

464
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:12,159
calm Happiness joy Clarity and it's really important at

465
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:17,320
this time more than ever maybe for us in

466
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:23,520
this age because we can choose what actions we

467
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:33,400
want to take and we can look at the consequences of those of those actions and choose actions that are

468
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:38,840
wholesome wholesome actions are beautiful

469
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:46,679
Karma we can give beautiful Karma which is another other way of saying Good

470
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:54,280
Karma not bad karma and we can bring this out into this world to meet this

471
01:10:54,280 --> 01:11:00,400
world if you're friendly others may be friendly but if you're hostile others

472
01:11:00,400 --> 01:11:08,640
may be become hostile when you demonstrate care for the welfare of others they may care for

473
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:14,800
you let's make a better world for everyone who faces Prejudice hostility and

474
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:20,520
disrespect Let's help everyone Prosper with the necessities of

475
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:26,719
life and let's build a society where everyone respects respect each other

476
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:36,239
without demeaning anyone so to do this so to meet our

477
01:11:36,239 --> 01:11:43,320
world from our deepest place of goodness and wholesome by aligning ourselves

478
01:11:43,320 --> 01:11:50,920
completely and utterly with wholesomeness all the

479
01:11:51,639 --> 01:11:59,719
time all the time it's amazing to do

480
01:12:02,639 --> 01:12:09,480
that thank you very much for your attention and for your presence here
