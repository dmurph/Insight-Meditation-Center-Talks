3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,699
and um just checking in to make sure

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,160
I can be heard so maybe a sound check

5
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:39,360
yes great okay thank you we've got a little bit of a lag as I'm sure you figured out from the many mornings with

6
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,640
Bill so it's a delight to be with you again

7
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,760
so nice to see familiar names popping in

8
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:57,719
seeing in my mind faces of friends and sangamates so good morning Sango welcome

9
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:02,820
from wherever you are and this morning

10
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,479
as you greet each other I just want to mention that we are in the second of a series of five on

11
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:17,700
a teaching called the idipada which is factors or Bay seeds or roads to

12
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:24,500
meditative success and spiritual power and

13
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,000
we are going to today talk about Chanda

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:38,040
which is a form of Desire form of wish a wholesome form in this case

15
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:44,939
so as you are settling in perhaps even looking at the chat

16
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:51,240
I just wanna invite you if your eyes are still on the chat feeling the warmth or

17
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:58,799
Delight or wish for connection and engagement that inspires you to look at it or to

18
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,780
engage with it and just feel that in your body

19
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:16,080
and then when you're ready take your meditation posture and maybe

20
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,319
close your eyes and turn your attention inward

21
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:31,879
and feel that wish or connection

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,560
that wish to meditate to be with yourself connect

23
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,220
with yourself

24
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:54,080
[Music] feeling whatever that feels like maybe it's in your heart or your belly

25
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:00,319
maybe that wish is in your whole body

26
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,959
just feeling into it

27
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,280
and if it feels right maybe silently naming

28
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,180
whatever that wish is that wish for your practice what motivates you

29
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,659
to meditate here together in this virtual Sunday

30
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:45,260
can name it in words our mental image

31
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,220
maybe even it's just like a felt scent it's almost like a gesture

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,180
but tuning in tuning into the wish to be here

33
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:05,220
to be in connection to practice

34
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,879
meditation

35
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:31,759
and allowing that wish to clarify into an intention

36
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,080
to include an intention to keep mindfulness awareness

37
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:46,440
at the Forefront of your attention for these few minutes we meditate

38
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:48,680
together

39
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,860
perhaps breathing out any excess tension

40
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,680
um settling in

41
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:19,699
the sense of open interest even devotion

42
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:28,639
inviting in whatever anchor of attention works best for you

43
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:36,560
might be a state of your heart mind right now

44
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,280
maybe ambient sounds Wherever You Are

45
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:53,479
perhaps a sense of your whole body present grounded in the moment

46
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:01,759
who are for so many of us

47
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,780
Sensations in the body

48
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:17,699
Sensations of this body breathing it will be the instructions I'll focus

49
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,479
on them story

50
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:42,479
bringing a sense devotion

51
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:50,580
interest even love

52
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:58,280
to the inquiry into what this breath feels like

53
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:05,240
is it long or short

54
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:16,880
is it deep more subtle like a sip

55
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:30,139
because it's smooth and pleasant

56
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:46,940
whatever way your life's breath is

57
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:54,860
tuning in allowing the attention to rest

58
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:04,280
in the gentle waves of your body breathing

59
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:40,700
you'll meditate in silence for the next while

60
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:45,959
towards the end of the meditation I'll drop in perhaps a suggestion or

61
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:54,260
invitation or two bringing that sense

62
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:57,500
of Interest

63
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:07,100
love devotion to each moment for each breath

64
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,320
each arising

65
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:23,600
um this last moment of our meditation together

66
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:33,419
imitation is to tune in tune in

67
00:26:33,419 --> 00:26:39,720
to the heart to the wish

68
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:44,240
at the core of your meditation practice

69
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:55,399
bringing in any sense of appreciation

70
00:26:56,940 --> 00:27:03,679
for the intention there kindness

71
00:27:03,980 --> 00:27:07,760
devotion or love

72
00:27:09,320 --> 00:27:17,480
feeling that feeling bad in your body and your heart

73
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:21,919
in the mind

74
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,520
allowing it to Ripple through

75
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:41,840
all the corners of the heart the mind this body

76
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:31,039
and then sensing into any larger wish or intention

77
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:41,640
to consider the people in your life

78
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:48,740
all the ways each life touches so many other lives

79
00:28:55,500 --> 00:29:01,140
and if it feels right to share that wish that goodness that comes from this

80
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:10,100
practice allowing it to animate you

81
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:16,940
and trusting trusting that it will Ripple out

82
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:24,200
through the lives your life touches

83
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:32,159
and some of that goodness will Ripple out through the lives their lives

84
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:35,960
but someone

85
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:45,559
dedicating the benefits of this practice

86
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,360
far and wide

87
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:02,899
may all beings all people be safe

88
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:08,480
may they be happy

89
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:20,279
may they be peaceful and may all of us all beings everywhere

90
00:30:20,279 --> 00:30:23,840
be free of suffering

91
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:41,470
[Music]

92
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:48,140
foreign

93
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:08,559
[Music]

94
00:31:52,600 --> 00:32:00,419
[Music] good morning Sangha before we start with the little talk

95
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:06,899
the dormette I have an announcement Gila asked me to announce

96
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:14,399
that there are two year end sessions for the black identified mindfulness Circle this

97
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:20,880

year to embrace the present and to set intentions for the future

104
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:08,039
and the collective wisdom in the room will allow practitioners to reconnect

105
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:14,460
and celebrate who they are reaffirm resiliency and vulnerability

106
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:22,159
amidst impermanence so please feel welcome if you are

107
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:29,840
identifying that way or if you have friends who you think might benefit from it please invite them

108
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:41,460
so today's talk is on Chanda c-h-a-n-d-a

109
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:47,580
the poly word for a desire which has a number of other translations that I'll

110
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:54,120
talk about but first I just want to get a little context this is

111
00:33:54,120 --> 00:34:01,320
um one of the bay seeds for Spiritual power and meditative prowess or success

112
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,899
that the Buddha used to take good effect before his Awakening and many other

113
00:34:06,899 --> 00:34:12,200
practitioners including myself have found it useful in our Journeys

114
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:18,240
desire often gets a bad rap in tarabada

115
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,240
Buddhism ancient Buddhism and um

116
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,740
so I want to make a differentiation Chanda this kind of Desire is actually neutral

117
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:37,020
good or bad but in the context of these teachings it's good it's definitely

118
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:43,679
differentiated from which is thirst or craving

119
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:48,898
instead Chanda desire is

120
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:54,839
healthy or unhealthy because of what's desired and

121
00:34:54,839 --> 00:35:01,700
um we'll give I'll give a couple of examples so if what is being desired runs counter to

122
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:10,820
interferes with Spiritual Development meditative development then it's considered akusala or

123
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:16,140
unwholesome unbeneficial one could even say unhealthy perhaps from a spiritual

124
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:22,800
perspective this is preoccupations with externals that

125
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:30,060
distract from developing into the best of Who We Are

126
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:36,480
so that could be things that um just don't lead to our overall

127
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:42,480
well-being and they can be innocent enough sensual Pleasures that's fine but

128
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:51,060
um the way we relate to them gets a little bit maybe out of hand or distracting or has

129
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:59,099
unhealthy consequences the word Dharma and Paulie is Dharma and

130
00:35:59,099 --> 00:36:05,099
Chanda together refers to a kind of virtuous desire a

131
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:10,560
beneficial skillful sometimes called wholesome desire

132
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:15,420
kusala in the poly language k-u-s-a-l-a

133
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:22,280
so wholesome desire is the kind of Desire that is talked about in this teaching

134
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:29,400
it's onward bleeding it helps to energize the practice

135
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:36,300
and it fits in as I talked about last time with kind of two other legs on the

136
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:41,880
tripod beneath this basis for Spiritual success

137
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:48,260
two that are always there are samadhi often translated as concentration

138
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:54,359
collectiveness I like to think of it as immersion in this context

139
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:59,780
amen which is wholehearted engagement

140
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:07,380
sometimes called exertion so these three things together form the

141
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:12,900
spaces the desire the wholehearted engagement and the

142
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:17,539
immersion the samadhi the collective tentness

143
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:26,820
well some desire has a sweet taste to it or flavor to it and it um

144
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:31,859
it's kind of a sweet feeling in your heart right maybe some of you tasted

145
00:37:31,859 --> 00:37:36,140
that in the past or in your meditations

146
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:43,079
there is another distinction to make though even a wholesome desire

147
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:50,640
can to a lesser extent be co-opted or accompanied by an

148
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:57,119
unwholesome motivation so it's also about how something is

149
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:02,339
wished for and I'll give an example here so when I was in um

150
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:08,880
graduate school for Buddhist studies I had a colleague friend who had come from the activist Community beautiful man did

151
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:15,599
a lot of good work in the world but he described over years how

152
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:23,040
him and this small group of others they have these lofty intentions to the world but it was accompanied by a lot of

153
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:29,940
judgment and anger and diversion and eventually a sense of alienation and he

154
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:35,640
described remembering seeing the people around him slowly drop off one by one

155
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:40,920
alienated burned out and how they weren't bringing other people into their

156
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,740
cause because the way the desire was manifesting

157
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:53,960
had this grasping and judgment and

158
00:38:54,119 --> 00:39:00,359
unwholesome type of constriction to it you can see it in my hand movements those of you who

159
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:06,200
are watching me so

160
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:13,099
another facet of skillful desire is that it's open

161
00:39:13,099 --> 00:39:18,359
expansive rather than constricted or obsessive

162
00:39:18,359 --> 00:39:24,240
uh John Shaw a very famous teacher in the kaiforce tradition describes

163
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,339
suffering as root burn clinging too tight to something

164
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:37,619
so is the desire a grasping hand an open hand or is it more arms thumb

165
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:44,280
wide in the arms spawn wide hints at a dimension

166
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:50,460
a virtuous wholesome desire or wish which is that it's aspirational

167
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:56,240
uplifting so

168
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:05,820
uplifting open the opposite of fanatical because it is

169
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:15,440
allowing whatever outcome to be will be but tuning into a wish for goodness

170
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:23,520
so less expectation less grasping

171
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:30,420
is more helpful that said if one looks at one's mind or

172
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:36,660
heart and I have deep in meditation there's usually a little bit of grasping

173
00:40:36,660 --> 00:40:44,160
even in the gamachanda The Virtuous desire it's a holding on to the practice

174
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:51,240
one translator calls this the one fortunate attachment and that that is the kind of attachment

175
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:56,480
that leads to the end of attachment right

176
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:03,300
so it doesn't have to be perfect I can repeat that it really doesn't have to be perfect

177
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:10,200
we don't need to get snarled up in our own intentions as long as the bulk of the intention for the practice is in the

178
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:16,320
right direction and we notice notice the parts that aren't helpful

179
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:24,019
and the beauty of mindfulness practice is that the mindfulness self-corrects

180
00:41:25,079 --> 00:41:30,560
so some ways to cultivate and nourish

181
00:41:30,619 --> 00:41:36,140
this wholesome wish um

182
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:42,240
to recognize it as it arises and so I'm going to give kind of a word cloud of

183
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:47,640
meanings all of which are different nuances of translation from the poly

184
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:55,560
because no poly word really translates perfectly into one English word right there's always a range

185
00:41:55,560 --> 00:42:01,740
so as I explore the meanings feel in your body how it feels

186
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:07,940
as I speak from the first is that Chanda is close to the

187
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:13,140
Sanskrit root I'm forgetting what it is I think it's

188
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:21,359
um that means to jump I like to think of it as to sort of jump or hop with joy that kind of enthusiasm

189
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:27,420
so feel that in your body maybe imagine a skillful basketball player

190
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:32,579
totally immersed and engaged in the game jumping to make a perfect Shot Through

191
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:40,099
The Hoop there's desire there there is

192
00:42:40,099 --> 00:42:47,160
immersion complete Focus collectiveness there's intentness engagement there's

193
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:52,560
flow it's how these factors pull together

194
00:42:52,560 --> 00:43:00,680
it's enthusiastic participation must play to win

195
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:07,940
so feeling that wish animating you to practice

196
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:15,180
Maybe listening for these words excitement

197
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:21,060
enthusiasm love zeal

198
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:26,119
eagerness appetite for

199
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:33,900
delighting in animating impulse intention devotion

200
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:40,079
so this cluster hints at a continuum a Continuum from excitement and

201
00:43:40,079 --> 00:43:45,780
enthusiasm on one end through a heartfelt wish and all the way

202
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:52,079
to quiet devotion even contentment on the other end because really this

203
00:43:52,079 --> 00:44:00,619
this is a Continuum to contentment the wish that leads to wishlessness

204
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:08,640
one really beautiful way I've found to cultivate Donald Chanda which I'll close

205
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,359
with cultivate visible so much and really Turbo Charge the practice

206
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:21,599
is to appreciate the wish itself appreciate that even that you want to

207
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:28,560
have the benefit beneficial wish to practice to walk in the world with

208
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,619
more kindness mindfulness whatever it is

209
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:40,260
that begins to create a positive feedback loop a beautiful feedback loop

210
00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:47,119
that grows that desire and grows enthusiasm for the practice and engagement

211
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,400
and over time is the practice deepens and many of you are already very

212
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:59,760
experienced even at the very beginning you might notice this that

213
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:06,240
this meditative development is the process of continually Trading coarser

214
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:11,460
maybe less hopeful desires for more and more refined ones

215
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:17,838
one very erudite Teacher Calls this trading candy for gold

216
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:24,839
so this this Dharma desire is the wish that leads to wishlessness

217
00:45:24,839 --> 00:45:30,200
to letting go and eventually to Freedom

218
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:38,099
so thank you thank you friends in the next 24 hours I just want to

219
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:44,760
invite you if it feels right to notice the desire that animates you to do

220
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:51,180
certain things to practice or maybe engage in other activities and make a distinction for yourself is it

221
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:57,000
beneficial or unbeneficial does it help with immersion

222
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:02,579
in what's beneficial if it feels right talk it over with friends I don't know

223
00:46:02,579 --> 00:46:07,920
