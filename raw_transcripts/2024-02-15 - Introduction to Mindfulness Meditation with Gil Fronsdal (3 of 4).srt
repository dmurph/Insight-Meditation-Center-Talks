1
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:08,800
so good evening everyone this is maybe a little bit Loud Let's see if uh so how's

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,599
that let's see now this okay okay so

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:22,199
um maybe we can start a little bit slowly and it is because of the weather maybe some people still coming and one

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,279
way to start a little slowly is see if you have any questions if those of you are here for the first two weeks do

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:33,520
anything that came up for you in your meditation practice or if you tried it at home or questions from the

6
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:38,000
instructions last week or

7
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:47,079
anything yes yeah if you speak loudly for my sake

8
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:53,199
be here it comes okay um I was wondering about we talked

9
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,840
about like your body and Sensations in your body and going towards things that

10
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:08,200
are uncomfortable in your body and what I wanted to know was I found myself

11
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:13,240
um sort of bargaining with myself like well if I pay attention to it long

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,159
enough and go deep into it it's you know it'll will dissolve and won't make me feel so miserable anymore and then when

13
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:26,119
that doesn't happen I'm I find myself you not knowing what to

14
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:32,200
do yeah so so the wiser so sometimes that can happen we go into it and it

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:38,360
changes and something relaxes but to spend too much time wanting that is a distraction from the mindfulness

16
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:45,000
practice right because what we want to dissolve is not the pain but our reactivity to the pain right and it's

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,920
just so hard to separate that yeah so so today we'll talk about that cool and be able to separate that because that has a

18
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:57,039
lot to do with the emotional relationship we have to things and uh and so what we do is that uh we

19
00:01:57,039 --> 00:02:02,079
certainly learn to stay we learn how to be present present in a kind of calm way

20
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:08,399
with pain and discomfort if that's what happens and that's a life skill that's really good for all kinds of situations

21
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,319
you find yourself in in the world where that it's unbearably seemingly unbearably uncomfortable but now you

22
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,800
know how to be with it rather than freaking out or something and um but at

23
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:25,560
some point as we learn to stabilize our attention enough on some difficult thing

24
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:34,120
like difficult pain at some then what we do is to turn the attention around 180Â° and see how am I relating to this

25
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:40,040
and then you might discover I'm afraid or I'm angry I'm aversive I'm you know I

26
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:45,560
hate it or I really want to have I thought meditation was about being on

27
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,879
cloud n and just kind of like better than going to Cabo and and you I want

28
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,319
the pleasure and uh so you get to see what your operating operating principles

29
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,720
that's behind the re reactivity and then you can start questioning it or or if

30
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:08,319
you want to do mindfulness it's very interesting then to bring mindfulness to that reactivity which means that you you

31
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,519
see it clearly without buying into it and just look at it like you your

32
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:18,760
head a little bit I see you you know my my old friend and and sometimes we get

33
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:26,959
to see the patterns that we have you say oh I I've been doing this for a while it seemed like my go-to is is um you know I

34
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:33,400
get bored and that's the way I shut down or how I a little bit aversive or my go-to is to be aversive and blame

35
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:40,439
someone and uh anyone but me or something so so so and and that begins

36
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:46,239
so then we it's easier to develop find a calm place if we really have seen the

37
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:52,680
reactivity directly and clearly because then we don't necessarily have to unconsciously go along with it which is

38
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,920
what many people do is that yeah thank

39
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:04,280
you there was a if I if you maybe you need to forgive me there was a joke many

40
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:10,599
years ago of an executive who um um had

41
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:17,079
this problem when he got nervous in front of big speeches that he peed in his pants so this was not really a good

42
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,880
thing so um the company paid for him to go really really you know highend very

43
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:31,000
expensive therapist he did that for a while and said all he came back and say I'm good now and

44
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:39,280
um um oh don't tell us you no longer pee in your pants and he said no now I don't

45
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,120
care so his reactivity went

46
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,560
away so that's not exactly what meditation is

47
00:04:53,560 --> 00:05:02,560
for so anybody else yes I think i' I've had to this if you can wait for this mic

48
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:10,800
please so I think what I'm what I'm having uh challenge reconciling

49
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,400
is um there's an innate there seems to be kind of this

50
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,479
conflict between Detachment and like desire for example

51
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:27,759
like I in my day-to-day life I do desire to be the best at what I do yes

52
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,240
and look to achieve aeve um and there seems to be kind of a

53
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:38,840
conflict between that sense of Detachment yeah and that pursuit

54
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:44,080
of I don't say perfection because that doesn't exist but um Perfection or

55
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:50,440
pursuit of improvement yeah um so I'm having a tough time reconciling yeah

56
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:55,720
those two great well well the fact that you can ask this question is really good the fact that you're seeing there's a

57
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:02,319
distinction that you have trouble finding in in in practice is really a good thing so you're on the right

58
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:07,520
track and with M with with one of the benefits of mindfulness is not solving

59
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:14,520
our problems but seeing them more clearly so we can tease apart the different elements of it and so that

60
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:21,160
we're not caught up in uh in uh so as we see see the different parts of it then

61
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:28,400
we can start choosing the parts that are healthy and put aside the ones that are not healthy so being good at what you're

62
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:36,880
doing in my my book you know that's a good thing to do but there can be a lot

63
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:44,160
of extra with it it could be there's a lot of needing to prove yourself to someone and get approval from someone or

64
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,599
status but other people's eyes and those kind of things on top that that's more

65
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:57,039
complicated and that some of that not might not be so healthy and necessary um uh it might be that you

66
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:03,199
want to do your best you can with what you do but you measure it by the uh by

67
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:09,360
your success and who you are as a person by the results and since the ancient times a

68
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,360
lot of spiritual Traditions emphasized uh don't be so concerned about the results just give yourself

69
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,720
wholeheartedly to what you're doing so so there's there's all these distinctions that can be made and when

70
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:27,919
you're when you're calm and settled and not caught up in the reactivity and the desires then you can step back and start

71
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:34,919
seeing that different people pieces of it and start sorting out that which is useful and not not useful does that make

72
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:40,080
some sense for you enough sense that you have your work to

73
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:47,199
do thank you it's a good question so one any more one

74
00:07:54,479 --> 00:08:01,319
more so any more questions because if you don't ask questions that means we're going to miss

75
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,280
meditate which it hopefully isn't that bad so we do

76
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:14,720
it okay so um so the way this meditation is going

77
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:20,400
to unfold is we'll start with the breathing which we did the first week

78
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:26,840
and then we'll expand out to include the rest of the body and then we're going to in this

79
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:32,518
field this I we call it a field sometimes this this in this container

80
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:40,959
the body is will then start including the emotions that we have and um and you

81
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:49,040
you what you normally what you in your in your vocabulary what you might call an emotion um might not be occurring so

82
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:55,360
you know but it's a mood a mind State um certainly emotion some generalized

83
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:02,320
feeling that you would some someone says how you're feeling and you say oh I feel tired or I feel calm some positive

84
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,399
States like calm people don't think of it as an emotion some people do but a mind State the General State the way the

85
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,519
state of being the how you are is kind of the territory we're going to go to and it's going to be very simple very

86
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:24,200
very simple and and it's it's okay if what you have is very very subtle um it's okay if it's powerful and

87
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:30,000
for this purpose just this just we're going to kind of touch into it kind of uh just gently

88
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,880
and not do a lot with it but get a sense of what it's like to do that um on the foundation of settling on the breathing

89
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:45,040
opening up to the body and then the context of having those two as a foundation then becoming aware of

90
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:52,399
emotions as opposed to for many people they have might have strong emotions but they're just focusing on that entirely

91
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:59,160
by itself and it has no support there's no no container to hold it or be with it

92
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,279
which this uh practice can provide so hopefully that makes sense

93
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:13,079
enough so to U assume a meditation posture that gives you a balance between

94
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:18,720
being calm and relaxed and alert with your

95
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,760
body so if you're tense coming here maybe you want to emphasize kind of just

96
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,640
settling back in the chair and relaxing if you're sleepy and tired at

97
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:38,560
the end of the day you might want to sit up a little straighter than usual so there's a little more alertness in your

98
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,320
spine maybe in your

99
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:49,639
chest and then gently closing your

100
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:02,279
eyes and noticing your

101
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:07,680
breathing just take we'll do a three breath journey to begin with that we

102
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:12,600
talked about the first class just three

103
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:33,800
breaths and

104
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:40,839
now take some long deep breaths to really connect more fully with your

105
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:46,600
body and as you exhale relax your

106
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:57,920
body maybe 3/4 full doesn't have to be as full as

107
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,079
possible and it might feel if it feels nice

108
00:12:03,079 --> 00:12:08,120
extend the exhale so that the relaxing can be a

109
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:10,480
little

110
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:28,240
more breathing in deeply and maybe beginning the relaxation in the

111
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:34,600
shoulders but then let it relax wave of relaxation go down from the shoulders all the way

112
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,959
down to your belly to your sitting

113
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
bones

114
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:15,839
and then letting your breathing return to normal and continue for a few breaths on

115
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:20,720
the exhale softening in your

116
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:26,720
body gentling yourself as you

117
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,760
exhale

118
00:13:58,199 --> 00:14:05,800
also your might see if the your thinking the thinking mind if

119
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:14,920
there's any tension or agitation associated with it if it's easy enough as you

120
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:19,240
exhale Relax The Thinking

121
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
mind

122
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:04,279
for and then a c few more

123
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:12,000
breaths on the exhale let the you relax from the place

124
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,759
in your body where the top of the inhale is in the chest up near the shoulders

125
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:27,160
maybe or and as you exhale relax downward a wave of relaxing down

126
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:34,440
into the stomach letting the belly become

127
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,040
soft maybe the belly hangs forward a little

128
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:52,360
bit on the exhale at the end relaxing the belly so the weight of

129
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:57,600
your torso settles towards your pelvic

130
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
area

131
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:20,720
then becoming aware of the breathing in and the breathing

132
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,120
out the rhythm of inhaling and

133
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,839
exhale as it experience by the

134
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:03,519
body maybe letting go of your thoughts as you

135
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:12,240
exhale and letting go into the exhale itself the physical experience of

136
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
exhaling

137
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:39,000
feeling the rhythm of breathing in and out in your

138
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:46,039
torso the rib cage the

139
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:54,120
chest the belly noticing how that area some parts

140
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:59,280
of that area expand as you breathe in

141
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,480
contract as you

142
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:29,600
exhale and imagine your breathing is in the middle of your body kind

143
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,559
of and as you inhale let your

144
00:18:35,559 --> 00:18:42,120
awareness expand outward throughout your

145
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:51,520
body maybe it grows on the

146
00:18:54,679 --> 00:19:00,320
inhale Global Experience of the body

147
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:08,600
and on the exhale return to maybe some Center within the

148
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,240
end of the

149
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
exhale

150
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:42,159
almost as if your breathing is giving your body a massage where the influence of breathing

151
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:45,559
spreads throughout the

152
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
body

153
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:33,640
and now as this rhythm of breathing

154
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:42,720
continues as your awareness spreads through your body and become aware of how you're

155
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:49,000
feeling what your emotional state

156
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:53,240
mood inner state of

157
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,520
being you don't have to know exactly what it

158
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:10,158
is but let it be leave it alone let yourself be as you

159
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:18,600
are and allow it to be in your body as you breathe with it breathe

160
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:27,279
through it almost as if your state your mood how

161
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:32,080
you're feeling is also being

162
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:41,120
massaged by the expanding and Contracting of breathing in and

163
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
out

164
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:15,480
as if your breathing and your body is making lots of room for how you

165
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:30,720
feel allowing yourself to feel the way you are without any judgment or

166
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:38,320
reaction and without any getting involved with it just allowing it to be

167
00:22:41,799 --> 00:22:48,000
there with the breathing breathing through it breathing with

168
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
it

169
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:28,679
and then to end this meditation

170
00:23:28,679 --> 00:23:33,080
you can take a few long slow deep

171
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:43,000
breaths healing your body more fully feeling the contact with your

172
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:48,520
chair or the floor your cushion and

173
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:56,880
then when you're ready you can open your [Music]

174
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
eyes

175
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:27,880
so our emotions are important part of our life and there are few places in life

176
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:33,760
outside of meditation or maybe being alone somewhere that we give complete

177
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:41,159
permission for us to feel whatever emotions we're having you might have murderous

178
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:48,360
Rage which we hope you don't act on in the world but it's okay to sit and in

179
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:55,120
meditation and feel it you might have the most beatific Angelic

180
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,240
wonderful feelings of love and peace peace and you know it's just

181
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:07,320
like you're allowed to feel that some people are have a lot of

182
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:14,240
trouble feeling happiness and one of the things I in my role as meditation teachers is it's

183
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,399
surprised me the first time I got to do this was told someone they had permission to feel Joy when they

184
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:26,360
meditated because some some religions it's not really quite okay and

185
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:32,520
um so this is a very unique place we're not trying to repress any emotions we're

186
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:38,840
not trying to deny any emotions but we're also not celebrating them we're

187
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:45,080
also not expressing them we're neither for them or against

188
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:52,240
them while we're meditating so that's a radical thing to do because in ordinary life we're for

189
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:58,080
and against our emotions we have good ones and bad ones some which we're ashamed for having some that we we feel

190
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:04,120
like unacceptable some which we think we're supposed to be having but we're not having them and some we have and we

191
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:11,640
think that we're This Is We I have it made I'll never be depressed again and that lasts for 10 minutes you know and

192
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:18,799
so we have this complicated relationship with emotions some of us and uh we have expectations of how we

193
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,039
should be feeling and so some of this comes from our society some of it comes from our family some of it comes from

194
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:31,679
our life experiences and uh some of them are very painful I've had I've expressed some of

195
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:37,760
my emotions to friends when I was a teenager and the way that I they responded to me were such that I felt

196
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:42,799
something in my heart closed just boom okay I'm not going to show that ever

197
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:48,679
again and it took a few years of meditation to come to a place where that

198
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:54,320
part that was closed would start opening up again and I the whole capacity to feel certain

199
00:26:54,320 --> 00:27:01,080
emotions came back over time so our emotions are in integral part of what a

200
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:08,039
human being is and to have a safe place where you can go and really take time to

201
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:14,279
feel and be as you actually are without any of the extra judgments and ideas

202
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:21,200
that we might have received from growing up from our society or anywhere is a gift to ourselves and meditation is

203
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:29,679
meant to be one of those places some people think that Buddhists uh repress their emotions because they're just too

204
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:36,200
equanimous you know you're supposed to just kind of like be calm all the time well there is something to that that

205
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:42,559
their Buddhists tend to be Cal and equanimous but many people find when you do this meditation the range of

206
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:49,320
emotions and their familiarity and the way they learn and and uh tap into the

207
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:56,200
wisdom of emotions is uh become so much greater what happens is that the r the

208
00:27:56,200 --> 00:28:02,519
this pendulum doesn't swing as far because if we're if we just like hang on

209
00:28:02,519 --> 00:28:08,120
or ready to celebrate and think this is the I'm the best thing since apple pie

210
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,880
because I have a little bit of Joy the excitement kind of will St will go into

211
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:21,200
like too far if we have some fear some people are afraid or their fear and then they get

212
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:27,519
more afraid and that produces even more fear and so they're reacting to it and it the

213
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:32,760
the fear pendulum goes really far the anger Pendulum The Shame pendulum goes

214
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:37,919
really far and so some of the great range that some people have is not

215
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:44,480
actually so healthy for them so as we do this practice I would

216
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:50,720
say our capacity to have emotions grows but we don't swing so far with

217
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:56,000
them so it looks like maybe we're calmer with it all but it's richer and more you

218
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,519
know it can be richer and emotions are actually very important part of Buddhist practice and and the growing as a kind

219
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:08,320
of as a this path of Buddhism is is to have an emotionally rich

220
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:13,799
life but what happens with practice as it with mindfulness is that mindfulness

221
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:21,000
tends to dissipate the reactive emotions it dissipates the unnecessary

222
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:28,000
swings it dissipates the emotions that uh are somehow or other connect Ed to

223
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:33,080
attachment to clinging the emotions that are have no

224
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:40,919
attachment part of them those are not part of reactivity those grow and the ones that are not attached

225
00:29:40,919 --> 00:29:48,919
uh connected to attachment and clinging are things like love happiness compassion generosity

226
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:55,039
calm peace all these wonderful things and so there's a kind of there's

227
00:29:55,039 --> 00:30:02,320
a sh as we we make room to feel and give permission for us to feel as we actually

228
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:08,080
are no matter what it is we start having the better and better understanding of

229
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:13,519
what's happening and we begin to shift what we are

230
00:30:13,519 --> 00:30:19,960
feeding and we're no longer feeding supporting

231
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:25,600
participating in the kind of emotional reactions which are actually harmful for

232
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,080
us and we learn how to feed in a nice way those which are

233
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:38,919
beneficial this is not just but but to make that distinction between harmful and beneficial

234
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:44,919
emotions is not meant to push the harmful ones away when you meditate or

235
00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:52,399
feel shame or you know or think that if you're a good Buddhist you're not supposed to ever be angry

236
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,760
again medit the mindfulness meditation is the safe place to be who you you are

237
00:30:57,760 --> 00:31:03,799
what's happening and it might seem strange to say this that this as a place but it's a

238
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:11,960
radical to have disability and one of the benefits as I'm kind of repeating myself is it gives us a chance to see it

239
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:18,600
much more clearly and as we see it more clearly wisdom is born as we see it more

240
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:25,080
clearly we understand better how to relate to it how to be with it we can find the wisdom we can find the way

241
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:31,720
forward in a much better way than if we just kind of live in in it

242
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,279
all so uh so this meditation we did just now

243
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,760
starting with breathing feeling the body and then opening to the emotions in some

244
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:49,519
way or other how was that for some of you was that do you find that interesting or different than to a way

245
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:54,320
to be with it and anybody willing to say a few

246
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,159
words

247
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,518
there then got

248
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,440
it um when I was trying to kind of just wait wait a moment while the the volume

249
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:26,080
goes up okay is that better um when I was kind of opening

250
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:33,360
to emotionally what was happening I found to kind of get a sense of that I was

251
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:40,039
going to physical sensation I was going to thought to kind of assemble

252
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:45,399
emotion and yeah so I guess kind of sharing that

253
00:32:45,399 --> 00:32:53,480
experience and curious like if that's um a helpful way to kind of approach

254
00:32:53,480 --> 00:33:00,440
getting in touch with emotion and was it helpful for you to do it that way I think maybe I got caught up in

255
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:07,080
the like the second layer of trying to figure out if that was a good approach or not okay yeah so that's the second

256
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,960
layer so you were thinking yeah yeah that's next week yeah you're a little bit of a prodigy

257
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:20,559
you're ahead of us and uh and so one of what the what

258
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:27,519
what I'm going to try to convey today is to to be aware of emotions um if without

259
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:35,120
thinking much about them be before the thinking the analyzing the predictions the stories that are connected to them

260
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:40,440
so that's uh so to keep it really simple and some people find it to be such a

261
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:48,399
relief to be with their emotions without having to evaluate them believe them solve them

262
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:53,720
figure them out um and so just keep it really

263
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,000
simple anybody else up

264
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:11,118
here um it may be pretty much the same thing she was saying but I guess I don't

265
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:18,320
know how to separate thinking from feeling like I'm trying to feel but

266
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:26,638
I'm yeah I'm trying to evalue trying to find where the feeling is yes yes uh

267
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:36,320
yeah this is hard but that but it's it's uh we'll do that next week the the thinking sorry but uh some people um uh

268
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:42,679
I I am therefore I think therefore I am it's almost like who we are as our thoughts and for some people thinking

269
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:48,200
and emotions are inseparable they can't really tease them apart they come together there's a very strong

270
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:54,079
connection to thinking and certain certain kinds of emotions and so that'll

271
00:34:54,079 --> 00:35:00,760
become clear as as this continues to deepen this this what I'm you know what we're doing here so I think just I think

272
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,920
just the fact that you see that is great that's that that's kind of the beginning

273
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,760
to understand what's

274
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:20,359
happening um I I kind of noticed in myself that maybe the the pattern goes the other way um rather than the

275
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:25,400
thinking causing the emotion like the emotion causes the thinking yes um and

276
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:32,440
for me it's this kind of low seems to be this low low underlying current of fear

277
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:38,160
or anxiety or something that drives a lot of the have I thought about this did I do that thing I got to plan this and

278
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:44,960
so I just I notice a lot of the thoughts great seem to come from this underlying thing

279
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:52,079
feeling and sometimes I'm able to identify that feeling and kind of

280
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:58,079
meditate with it um put my attention on it and hold it as a feeling rather than as a thought and then other times I'm

281
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:03,480
thinking about stuff sure sure um but in terms of feelings that seems to be the

282
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,839
one that comes up for me most of the time when I'm sitting so that's considered a very important uh

283
00:36:08,839 --> 00:36:16,560
understanding to get to and some people when they meditate regularly start Dawning upon wow the fear is pervasive I

284
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:22,920
had no idea but you need to be quiet enough and still enough so you're not distracted from yourself most people

285
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:28,400
live distracted from themselves and so for I don't know if this represents you

286
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:35,440
accurately but if if fear triggers a lot of thoughts the thought train can be really

287
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:41,880
long and you're so involved in the thoughts and theide ideas that we've lost touch with the

288
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:49,119
fear and uh so we're distracted from what's really happening so um uh there's

289
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:54,960
one one way of understanding the connection between thoughts and emotions sometimes emotions are first Sometimes

290
00:36:54,960 --> 00:37:01,079
thoughts are first but one interesting way of understanding it is that uh

291
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:08,400
thoughts are just a messenger don't spend a lot of time with the messenger get the message the

292
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,440
message is the emotions the emotions are the factory for a lot of thinking and so

293
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:18,680
we have to we want to learn how to be in a useful way mindful of the

294
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:25,000
emotions before or instead of spinning out in the stories of it all and so

295
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:30,920
that's what we'll talk a little bit more about now so maybe one more here is that that was that clear enough to end

296
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:38,040
response okay so I think I'm actually a week behind so because I I don't can't

297
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:44,800
remember if it's if it's a sympathetic or parasympathetic reaction but I found just in meditating I came in with the

298
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:50,480
tightness in my back and just being able to

299
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,800
meditate I don't know if I Let Go something or if it just I feel a help a

300
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:04,960
lot better fantastic and so so feeling hell of a lot better that's a feeling so

301
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:13,200
how did that feel not in your mind but how did it feel in your body not just in the place where you relaxed did it's a

302
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:20,839
strong statement to say hell of a lot better how how actually did that feel in your body do you feel lighter or glowing

303
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:27,440
or kind of happy or well like I let go of something I just

304
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:33,200
and the tightness that was there was released it was just but was any did

305
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:40,480
that released that you you seem to appreciate it that appreciation did it boil you up a little bit or inspire you

306
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:47,839
or did you feel kind of uh well I I felt I mean I just I feel just I don't yeah

307
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:53,640
maybe lighter maybe just um I feel better feel better fantastic so you feel

308
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:59,040
better you feel lighter so one of the things we do in mindfulness practice is we allow ourselves to feel those feeling

309
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,800
betters some people can feel better but we have all these things to worry about

310
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:10,040
important things to think about so so like okay you know I don't have time to feel

311
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:16,599
that let's you know let's go off and worry about the next thing and then it back tightens up again so one of the

312
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:22,720
things we do with mindfulness we stop and really stay present for things so when something is healthy like that take

313
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:29,040
time to let that register how how you feel good from it and what shift it might be very subtle but it's good to

314
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:35,119
take it's good to let it register deeply and that's one of the things we're doing in mindfulness is taking the time to

315
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:42,319
really let it register how we are what's happening even when it what what we're feeling is doesn't feel good because

316
00:39:42,319 --> 00:39:48,800
there's something about the deeper connection to it that allows something to shift one of the interesting things

317
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,160
about the English word emotion is it has the word Motion in it

318
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,560
and the E the prefix e in Latin means out it turns out that all emotions are

319
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,800
in movement they're processes that are moving along and they mostly want to

320
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:11,800
work themselves out or spread out um but we tend to block it we tend to lock them

321
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:17,400
up we tend to lock onto them or push them or or get tight around them or get

322
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:25,079
afraid of them or something and sometimes these emotions get kind of stuck in us for a long time but uh part

323
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:32,359
of what mindfulness does kind of we it begins to unstuck us we're making room for it so that it can start

324
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:39,440
moving and it's fascinating to watch how emotions start to move and change and shift that's what they want to do if we

325
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:46,760
can give them space to do it so in that meditation we did I was trying to give you a little feeling for what it's like

326
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:52,240
to have your emotions with more space for them in your body and more kind of

327
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:57,440
not not being caught in them because you are breathing with them if you give your

328
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:03,280
uh uh awareness over to the breathing and breathe with it there's less uh mind

329
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:09,800
space available to be thinking about it or reacting to it and and so you know

330
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,640
that if the think of awareness as

331
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:21,480
space and if that space is filled with thoughts very little awareness is

332
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,599
available to really feel and be present for other things one of the reasons that

333
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:32,079
quiet the mind is so you can be more

334
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:37,359
aware of what's happening to you without drowning out or dominating all the space

335
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:42,680
filling all the space with everything so as the think thinking mind quiets down

336
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:48,079
or as our priorities shift in the mind we become more interested in staying with the

337
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,560
breathing then awareness no longer is caught up in the mind and then we can

338
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,119
start feeling other things more fully I hope this makes some sense to you does

339
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:06,119
it okay so emotions and

340
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:14,359
um so one of the reasons why we do this in the third week is that is that um uh

341
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:21,760
if we just started the first week feel your emotions we'd probably all be mess right away because we don't have the capacity

342
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:28,920
we haven't studied learned how to be with them in a wise way but uh the breathing is caling it's very

343
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:36,559
it's a very well-known technique that people who are stressed uh can relax if they just breathe and just hang out with

344
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:42,480
the breathing tune into the breathing and part of the reason for that if all the mental

345
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:51,520
space is filled by thinking and the thinking is stressful that's going to stress out the body but if we no longer

346
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:57,920
if the mental space is not only filled with thoughts but now we're starting starting to fill it with breathing and

347
00:42:57,920 --> 00:43:03,920
the body then um there's less of the energy going to the stressful thoughts

348
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,800
and the stressful thoughts have you know tentacles that reach into our muscles that you know get us all tight so we're

349
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:16,000
kind of Shifting um and so to start breathing

350
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:22,240
and especially with difficult emotions to breathe through them breathe with them is a way of not being caught in

351
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:27,280
them it's a way of doing something different with the mind with the Mind

352
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:34,480
space with the Mind awareness doing something different that doesn't feed them doesn't react to them but at the

353
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:40,599
same time doesn't ignore them you know some people if they're really stressed out around their

354
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:46,880
emotions will distract themselves eat watch TV do all kinds of

355
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:52,680
things we don't want to distract ourselves but we want to create a different way of being with them so

356
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:57,920
we're not caught in their grip and so the breathing is one of the ways to

357
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,520
breathe with it to breathe through it shifts a little bit makes makes things a little more

358
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:10,000
relaxed if in addition to that we are stabilized in the body we feel like oh

359
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:17,720
I'm really here in my body there's a lot of people in our culture who are not in their bodies and uh they spend much of

360
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:23,839
the day from the neck up and uh kind of spinning their thoughts thinking about

361
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:29,680
things and again what I'm if the Mind space is filled with Just

362
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:37,720
Thoughts there's very little room to really feel the body the body is a delicate

363
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:45,000
instrument I'm pretty confident that this body of ours is much more

364
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:51,960
sensitive and has a lot more uh fascinating instruments in it than your

365
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,800
smartphone it's an amazing thing and it works so so much better if you're

366
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:03,160
present for it if you're not present for it because you're on your smartphone all

367
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:09,319
the time you're really short changing yourself dramatically for the

368
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:16,559
intelligence the information the sensitivity the possibilities that are here in this body and so to slow down

369
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:25,200
and be mindful and be start being aware of your body then you start creating space and room to feel your emotions

370
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,240
that's uh be with them with something different than just being them with your

371
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:37,319
thoughts and If all we're doing to be with emotions was our thinking thinking about them telling stories over and over

372
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:43,720
again and trying to you know um it's very limited human thing to do if we

373
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:51,079
want to expand out to the much more the greater capacities we have as human beings the range of intelligence we have

374
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:56,960
that operate within us uh you have to uh bring online

375
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:04,160
all these apps that you have that have been turned off we're full of apps you know and uh

376
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:11,280
and uh they're really good but they have to be turned on and um and so and so if

377
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:17,400
the Mind space is filled with thoughts you can't really feel what's going on here but as you start feeling your body

378
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:22,839
getting more embodied more embodied then it's a lot easier to feel emotions like

379
00:46:22,839 --> 00:46:27,960
the stability the steadiness of the body the the the strength that the body

380
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,400
provides makes it easier to feel what's going on maybe not automatically not

381
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:40,000
quickly but that's the direction the practice goes and then um what we're trying to do

382
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:46,800
here in mindfulness is to learn a very simple but simple doesn't mean easy very

383
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:54,160
simple capacity to know we're having an emotion when we're having

384
00:46:54,160 --> 00:47:00,319
it as opposed to to no we're having it and be upset no we're having it and be

385
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:06,240
afraid no we're having it and you know that jerk deserves everything he can

386
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:13,520
everything I'm going to you know do to him you know we we're involved we're kind of caught in it as opposed to

387
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:20,880
oh there's an I'm angry let me feel the anger no no no you

388
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:28,160
have to kind of tell the person in piece of your mind he deserves it wait a minute slow down take a deep

389
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,960
breath relax just feel what's happening oh anger my stomach is in a

390
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:39,640
knot my jaw is tight but but I have to kind

391
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,800
of he deserves to be no no later that

392
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,559
can be for later now just be here feel it be with

393
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:57,119
it and then something begins relaxing you're breathing with it

394
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:03,280
the tension in the belly begins to soften as you breathe with it you notice when you start going into those thoughts

395
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:10,240
but he deserves it that the belly gets all tight again and then you

396
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:16,839
relax and then you start seeing that when every time you go to your head your thoughts some other kinds of tension

397
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:22,480
begins when you come back and then slowly the anger maybe dissipates and

398
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:30,040
you find out after a while that low and behold underneath the anger you're

399
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:35,559
afraid the Genesis the source of the Fe of the anger is how afraid you are

400
00:48:35,559 --> 00:48:43,200
threatened you feel and now you're in a different world now you can kind of maybe feel

401
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:49,160
that maybe that's what really needs your attention and so what we're trying to do

402
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:54,200
in mindfulness is um we're not actually

403
00:48:54,200 --> 00:49:02,280
trying to figure out how to be as we

404
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:09,559
are as if we can accept ourselves as we are we're trying to be with

405
00:49:09,559 --> 00:49:15,200
ourselves and the difference between being being as you are versus be with

406
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,400
yourself is a difference between um uh

407
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,240
it is like if if you're really having a hard time in your life and you're upset maybe you're angry you're afraid you're

408
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:33,839
whatever grieving who knows what's happening to you and you know this person a friend

409
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:40,119
who whenever you're with them they like to go for a walk with you and accompany you and they'll sit in their park bench

410
00:49:40,119 --> 00:49:47,119
with you and just they're not going to fix you they're not going to judge you they're just going to be with you and

411
00:49:47,119 --> 00:49:53,720
listen and it's so good to be with that person who has that ability a lot of friends don't have that ability this

412
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:59,920
person just seems to care listens

413
00:49:59,920 --> 00:50:05,480
well but you feel you know like this person's not judging me it's not

414
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:10,680
condemning me it's not this person's not participating I need to I need to

415
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:16,359
express how angry I'm at that guy but the I go to some friends and

416
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:21,680
they kind of like get angry too and they get more Angry than I do that I am

417
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:29,839
that's not so useful but there's one person just sits the person's with me and I feel like I'm being held I feel

418
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:36,720
like I'm cared for I feel like there's this calm presence and something inside of me begins to relax because the person

419
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:45,680
is with me not for me not participating but also not judging so this is a basic

420
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:52,280
good you know good friendship kind of skills to have so we're doing that for

421
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:57,960
ourselves we're trying to be with how we are as opposed to

422
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:07,079
being so try be with the anger not be the anger to be with the fear but not be

423
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:14,920
the fear and that's a huge step to make it's a very respectful thing to do

424
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:21,119
it's much more respectful for your emotions to be with them than to be

425
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:26,200
them and some of the more difficult emotions we have

426
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:31,400
uh some of the reasons people feel shame is because they think they are the

427
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:38,040
emotion I have so much anger I feel so ashamed of myself I shouldn't do that I'm not supposed to be

428
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:46,000
angry we're defining ourselves by the anger but if we're not the anger there's

429
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:52,680
anger but now we're going to be with the anger as opposed to be the angry

430
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:58,599
person does it make some sense and so mindfulness is this capacity just

431
00:51:58,599 --> 00:52:04,440
to see and be present with what's happening without being pulled into it

432
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:11,240
without being caught by it just allowing it to be there and seeing it more clearly breathing with it feeling it in

433
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:18,440
the body so um uh so to to be with your

434
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:24,559
emotions not don't be your emotions and I keep repeating this so that you can

435
00:52:24,559 --> 00:52:31,799
try to experience expent on your own to see what is it what's the difference when you're in your emotions versus when

436
00:52:31,799 --> 00:52:37,440
you're with them and if you're with them how can you be with them as a good

437
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:43,680
friend the one who listens the one who really makes space who doesn't judge

438
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:49,920
doesn't have to fix right away um and just feel what's going

439
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:55,880
on so uh there is a uh

440
00:52:55,880 --> 00:53:02,200
an acronym that we use here at IMC sometimes that uh hopefully isn't too

441
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:08,280
much teaching but it's it's a forw acronym that has four different elements

442
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:15,640
of how we are mindful of emotions and the acronym is raft R A ft

443
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:23,240
and one of the teachers here who is really specialized in developing this raft simil to is Tanya Wiser who teach

444
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:28,400
th teaches usually on Thursday nights she loves the fim and is the the

445
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:35,079
metaphor the acrm and is really she teaches a lot of the raft and

446
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:43,480
um so um for me she has a little different way of doing it than I do so raft so the

447
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:50,240
first step is recognize when you have an emotion take

448
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:56,680
the time to recognize what it is and it might be

449
00:53:56,680 --> 00:54:01,839
obvious or it might not be but there some there something happens with our

450
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:07,680
emotional life if it's clearly recognized it's kind of like when some

451
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:14,599
when something is named something can relax I've been upset you know and angry

452
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:22,839
and didn't know it and my some friend has come up to me and say Gil you seem to be angry and oh yeah I didn't know or

453
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:30,280
Gil you seem to be stressed oh yeah oh yes I think I am now that you tell me someone names it for me there's

454
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:35,480
something powerful that happens when we recogn oh just recognize oh that's

455
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:42,960
what's happening it's part of this it's part of the beginning of stepping far enough

456
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:48,520
away from the emotion so that when we can come back and be with it if we're in

457
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:54,079
it we're not with it and so oh I'm

458
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:59,760
sad maybe you need to say it a few times to yourself oh this is

459
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:07,720
sadness and you feel yourself collapsing into it or collapsing into no sit up

460
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:15,839
this is sadness and then um and then uh so that just recognize it

461
00:55:15,839 --> 00:55:24,000
and if you don't know what it is uh start by just recognizing it as some as something a feeling I have a

462
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:29,520
feeling I remember once the I had a feeling that was the best I could do was

463
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,880
this is yucky and then as and I started there

464
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:41,240
and then as I just breathed with it and felt how what the sensations in the body

465
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:46,880
of it and just kind of was with the yuckiness at some point something in my

466
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:52,520
chest relaxed and I immediately knew what it was oh

467
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:58,799
depression but then the depression kind of lifted did it with at the same time there was something about recognizing it

468
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:04,200
that really made a big difference so first is to

469
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:11,319
recognize the second is to allow it to be there this is very respectful for

470
00:56:11,319 --> 00:56:18,880
emotions I mean if you're angry and you know and doing interesting

471
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:24,640
things with your middle finger to the other drivers and oh in IMC I was taught L

472
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:30,720
much allow my anger this is not what I

473
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:38,240
mean I mean allow like in meditation allow with some

474
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:44,400
Stillness allow it to be without acting on it allow the anger to be there but

475
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:50,359
don't act on it just allow it to make space this is the it's very respectful

476
00:56:50,359 --> 00:56:55,760
it's like your friend sitting on the Park Bench with you really respects you

477
00:56:55,760 --> 00:57:02,000
feel they care for you they're with you and um and uh now if your friend is

478
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,160
sitting on the Park Bench with you and you're telling them how sad you

479
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:15,038
feel and your friend is sitting next to you like this

480
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:21,799
oh you you probably think there's no hope

481
00:57:21,799 --> 00:57:27,520
my friend is like I've really done my friend in that's that's not going to help

482
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:34,079
you um but if your friend just sits upright and has a little bit of kind

483
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:39,160
upright maturity in their posture and they're there and then they feel oh

484
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:44,400
there's someone who's stable and there's a there's a grown-up in the room there's

485
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:51,319
someone who's not overwhelmed by what I'm talking about so can we do the same thing for ourselves this allowing is

486
00:57:51,319 --> 00:57:56,680
powerful but since we're trying to be with the emotion allow it and be with it

487
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:01,960
can you not collapse can you not pull away can you not push away in out of

488
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:09,039
anger can you just okay I'm going to show up here and this is why meditation is such

489
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:16,000
a fascinating place to do all this because you want to take a dignified posture when you

490
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:21,599
meditate and then don't move you know for your emotions don't

491
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:29,480
give into them we don't collapse no matter how how upset we are we don't make a fist no matter how

492
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:36,839
angry we are we don't run away no matter how afraid we are we just have this

493
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:44,640
posture okay and then we can be a good friend for ourselves then we can be with it and

494
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:50,839
some and allow it okay I'm allowing this it's easier said than done but this is

495
00:58:50,839 --> 00:58:56,400
what the practice is to learn how to do this and it can be learned for

496
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:02,680
sure and then um the F of raft is to

497
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:08,760
feel and uh those of you here last week you know remember we did the the um hand

498
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:15,440
exercise so find out where the emotion is being expressed in the body is it a

499
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:22,520
tightness in the belly is it some kind of rumbling in the chest in the heart area is in the shoulders is in the face

500
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:28,400
where is it most expressed where's what's most what part of your body is most activated by the emotion that you

501
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:33,799
have some emotions are more s diffuse and they kind of spread through much of

502
00:59:33,799 --> 00:59:39,039
the body some people say it's everywhere and then you ask your then you say is it

503
00:59:39,039 --> 00:59:46,039
in your little toe you this happens to me often enough people say it's everywhere and I say is it in your little toe and as soon as I say that

504
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:53,640
they'll say oh no no it's here and it's torso and now it's not everywhere it's here and then I'll say is it mostly in

505
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:59,640
the front of the Torso in the back of the Torso it's in the front of the Torso so again it's not everywhere it takes a

506
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:06,799
while to kind of for people to find where it is and then in the front of the Torso where's where is it the strongest

507
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:13,880
oh right here and so they need to help to kind of find where it's most

508
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:20,319
active and um and uh and then like we did the hand last week the idea is just

509
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:25,839
then just feel feel the physical

510
01:00:25,839 --> 01:00:32,400
Sensations associated with the emotion part of the advantage of this is

511
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:38,880
then you're with it by feeling it but also the physical Sensations are not the

512
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:44,400
story the physical Sensations are not the ideas we're spinning and telling

513
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:50,440
ourselves about it we're trying to step away from the stories to just feel the

514
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:56,000
Simplicity of the emot the emotion in the moment all all emotions believe it

515
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:03,640
or not they want to process themselves they want to move up they want to complete

516
01:01:03,640 --> 01:01:08,760
themselves if we can allow them to but if we're participating in telling the

517
01:01:08,760 --> 01:01:14,000
story and why we're so angry and how we were wronged over and over and over and

518
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:19,640
over again or if we keep telling ourselves you know you know you know boy

519
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:25,119
am I a jerk boy am I just a lousy no- good lousy person

520
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:30,400
boy I'm just like a failure as a human being boy I'm just if you keep saying

521
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:35,440
those stories over and over again it's debilitating it sucks the life out of us

522
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:40,559
it live in those stories over and over and over again so part of mindfulness to

523
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:46,839
be present for the physical Sensations is to learn to shift the center of

524
01:01:46,839 --> 01:01:53,079
gravity from the thoughts were spinning to just feel the

525
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:59,960
emotions and for for me I don't know if this will work for you but it's a very powerful gesture for how to feel how to

526
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:07,039
be with the sensations and that is to cup your hands together like this and just come from

527
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:12,279
underneath wherever you're feeling it the emotions in your body and just hold them

528
01:02:12,279 --> 01:02:19,000
there as if they can be there forever just just gently calmly just okay fear

529
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:24,960
here you are with fear to give you kind of

530
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:30,400
much easier to say than to do but it's I think it can be a quite powerful thing to

531
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:35,839
hear when we're afraid we bring mindfulness to our fear

532
01:02:35,839 --> 01:02:42,078
and we're with it we're helping our fear feel

533
01:02:42,359 --> 01:02:49,160
safe it's not the same thing as making yourself feel safe because then you've identified with

534
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:54,640
the fear but help that place that's inside to feel safe it's okay but if

535
01:02:54,640 --> 01:03:00,680
you're there poking at it and telling it you're lousy and you shouldn't be there and I'm going to fix you and we're going

536
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:06,000
to figure out how to make you go away uh then it's not going to feel

537
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:12,160
safe just like you wouldn't be if I came up to you and was clearly looking at you

538
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:17,400
and talking to you like how am I going to get rid of you you wouldn't feel

539
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:23,559
good I promise I won't do that but you just you know just you know

540
01:03:23,559 --> 01:03:31,680
it wouldn't feel good right so the same thing for your inner life your your fear needs your respect needs your care you

541
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:40,799
want to help it feel safe so that your fear can move along everything moves along if

542
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:46,079
it's given the chance so it is so first

543
01:03:46,079 --> 01:03:51,200
recognize then allow then

544
01:03:51,200 --> 01:03:57,359
feel and the the the um fourth one is a little bit more complicated to

545
01:03:57,359 --> 01:04:04,880
understand it's to tease apart so often emotions are seen as one

546
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:10,839
big hunk of stuff junk one big ball of something and it's very hard to get a

547
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:16,880
handle on it because it's just one thing emotions are Composites they're

548
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:24,240
made up of different things and there's a strong connection to story making mind so if we can set

549
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:32,920
separate out the story from the immediacy of how we're feeling physically that makes a world of

550
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:40,200
difference if we can tease apart the emotion and how we're reacting to it how

551
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:46,079
we're really so oh look at that there's you know I'm

552
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:53,160
feeling afraid but now I'm embarrassed that I'm

553
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:59,440
afraid I hope no one sees me I better hide it I better put on an extra jacket so no one

554
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:04,599
sees that I'm how tense I am so this means that we're we have a relationship

555
01:05:04,599 --> 01:05:13,480
to it that we're embarrassed so we tease apart the fear and the embarrassment

556
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:18,680
tease apart the liking from the experience the not liking from The

557
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:24,559
Experience teas apart the aversion teas apart the attachment oh

558
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:30,039
this is good I don't want to get let go of this so over time we're seeing all the

559
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:36,240
extra things we're doing and we're kind of becoming allowing things to be simpler and

560
01:05:36,240 --> 01:05:44,160
simpler so each of the parts can be seen for itself rather than seeing as one big

561
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:50,839
stew and people say I'm stewing but we don't want to Stew we

562
01:05:50,839 --> 01:05:58,119
want to we want to kind of let every respect ECT everything let see everything distinctly for what it

563
01:05:58,119 --> 01:06:03,680
is so probably this is a lot of ideas a lot of to say but it's it's meant to be

564
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:10,160
simple but um but maybe this idea of raft you can experiment with it

565
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:16,200
recognize allow feel and tease apart so let's do a little bit of it now in

566
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:23,400
meditation so I'll do another guided meditation like we just did and then I'll introduce the raft steps in the

567
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,160
middle of it and see how that works for

568
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:49,480
you so it's often good to think of setting yourself up for meditation kind

569
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:56,680
of doing the Preparatory steps and over time you learn what this beginning steps

570
01:06:56,680 --> 01:07:02,680
work for you again here I recommend that you just

571
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:09,960
start really simple and do a three breath Journey just do stay with three

572
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:16,680
full breaths keep it that simple but give yourself to those

573
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,920
three

574
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:47,240
and then maybe taking a few long slow deep breaths could be another three but this

575
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:52,000
time deep breaths relaxing on the

576
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:55,920
exhale

577
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:11,119
and then returning to a natural breathing just as you

578
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:18,359
are and maybe another three breaths but continue to do this relaxing on the

579
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:25,838
exhale

580
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:41,319
and then letting yourself just breathe and Center yourself on the body

581
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:57,080
breathing and so that you're not so much up in the control tower of the head see if you can notice more how your

582
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:01,000
body experiences the

583
01:09:22,719 --> 01:09:25,719
breathing

584
01:09:52,640 --> 01:09:58,560
as you come to the end of the exhale feel the weight of your

585
01:09:58,560 --> 01:10:06,158
body touching your chair or the floor to feel the

586
01:10:06,360 --> 01:10:10,520
stability of what supports your

587
01:10:14,360 --> 01:10:20,400
body as if you have a foundation that holds you

588
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:29,920
up maybe as you exhale relax relxing into that foundation so you feel more

589
01:10:52,640 --> 01:10:58,480
grounded and so that you don't fill your

590
01:10:58,480 --> 01:11:04,239
awareness with thinking so that there's more space in

591
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:12,480
Awareness to be aware of the body see if you can quiet your

592
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:22,560
thinking soften maybe even slow your thinking

593
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:28,800
down maybe thinking from a deeper place

594
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:41,678
within or maybe letting go of your thoughts as you

595
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:53,880
exhale and then writing on the Rhythm breathing in and breathing out for a

596
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,920
little while here in

597
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,480
silence

598
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,440
for

599
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:15,239
so now notice how you're

600
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:20,080
feeling anything at all could be you're

601
01:13:20,440 --> 01:13:25,360
tired could be that you're

602
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:35,760
calm could be you're agitated could be sad or

603
01:13:37,239 --> 01:13:41,880
happy irritated or

604
01:13:45,239 --> 01:13:48,239
content

605
01:13:51,880 --> 01:13:57,840
worried or feeling

606
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:08,679
safe maybe it's very subtle maybe it's just hints of what

607
01:14:08,679 --> 01:14:14,600
something whatever you're feeling start and see if you can

608
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:21,520
recognize it in some way doesn't have to be exact recognition but recognize that

609
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,280
it's there

610
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:42,040
where the act of recognition allows you to step away from it to be so you can be with

611
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:49,400
it rather than be in it like you you can say

612
01:14:49,400 --> 01:14:54,600
hi hi sadness hi High

613
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:58,800
Joy calm whatever it

614
01:15:12,960 --> 01:15:21,120
is and then to be with it as a good friend allow yourself to feel whatever

615
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:25,199
you're feeling

616
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:35,080
it's only going to be for a few minutes so for these few

617
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:39,120
minutes allow yourself to

618
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:47,600
be but the allowing is being with how

619
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:55,199
you're feeling you're not being what you're feeling

620
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:19,840
maybe it's easier to allow if you're breathing with your

621
01:16:19,840 --> 01:16:27,560
emotion breathing with your state that you're have breathing through

622
01:16:39,719 --> 01:16:46,800
it and then whatever way you're feeling whatever way what whatever you're

623
01:16:47,400 --> 01:16:55,079
feeling notice where in the body that feeling is most pronounced

624
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:08,080
and feel the sensations or the activation in your

625
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:14,600
body associated with the emotion or your mental state your

626
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:27,719
mood maybe imagining your cupping your hands

627
01:17:27,719 --> 01:17:35,159
of awareness and holding it gently in your

628
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:43,520
hands you're being with it as you feel

629
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:55,000
it

630
01:17:58,040 --> 01:18:01,239
and then teasing

631
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:09,080
apart noticing how the physical sensations of the

632
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:15,400
emotion is different from the thoughts the

633
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:24,600
stories different than how you're relating to it

634
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:31,039
there's the emotion your state and the reaction to

635
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:38,520
it the Judgment of it

636
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:43,159
preferences

637
01:18:46,320 --> 01:18:51,280
interpretations predictions of where this is

638
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:58,199
going there's the emotion and then how you

639
01:18:58,199 --> 01:19:05,920
define Yourself by it this means I'm this kind of

640
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:13,159
person tease those apart so that you can be with the basic

641
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:18,199
Emotion by itself so you can better recognize it

642
01:19:18,199 --> 01:19:24,840
allow it and feel it

643
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:42,440
and when you feel like that's enough then Begin Again with your

644
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:49,800
breathing return to breathing and just practice mindfulness of

645
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:54,840
breathing

646
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:28,920
and and then to end this sitting take some long slow deep breaths

647
01:20:28,920 --> 01:20:36,239
feel your body get yourself ready to to end it and

648
01:20:36,239 --> 01:20:40,039
when you're ready you can open your

649
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:51,719
[Music]

650
01:20:51,719 --> 01:20:58,120
eyes so there's a lot kind of instructions

651
01:20:58,120 --> 01:21:04,960
and ideas that were presented today it's always the the default if you

652
01:21:04,960 --> 01:21:10,360
if you have a choice always choose the simpler choice in this practice simply

653
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:16,440
being aware so the basic idea is to use breathing as if it works for you well

654
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:22,920
enough let that be the center of gravity for the meditation just going to be with your breath and some some days you can

655
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:31,199
be with a breath a lot it's really nice some days you can hardly be with it but be with your breathing until something

656
01:21:31,199 --> 01:21:37,040
else becomes more compelling and that'll happen sooner or

657
01:21:37,040 --> 01:21:42,880
later and so we don't only stay with a breath because then you set up a tension between the other thing that's happening

658
01:21:42,880 --> 01:21:48,800
that's compelling and your effort to stay with a breath so you can just let go of the

659
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:57,080
breathing and and then bring your mindfulness to this other thing that's happening so if it is your neighbor is

660
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:03,960
really loud then rather than struggling and judging that and being upset with it you

661
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:09,440
can go and just notice hearing being mindful of listening the

662
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:14,920
noise and just kind of see if you some people get really relaxed just listening to

663
01:22:14,920 --> 01:22:24,120
sound but what's really happening is not the noise from the neighbor is this is the th thousand time

664
01:22:24,120 --> 01:22:30,360
that you you know you've talked to them 999 times before about how they make too much noise and here they are

665
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:38,320
disrespecting you one more time and what's really happening is you're angry but you're

666
01:22:38,320 --> 01:22:45,080
meditating okay this is the chance to be mindful of anger that's what's the big thing that's

667
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:51,920
more stronger than the breath so then you so okay no doubt about it this is anger so

668
01:22:51,920 --> 01:22:58,040
you recognize it might you say that to yourself oh anger oh but Gil said to be with it but

669
01:22:58,040 --> 01:23:04,040
not in it so just step back how do I say anger to recognize it where I'm not

670
01:23:04,040 --> 01:23:11,360
glued to it what does that mean not you know so then you anger anger oh okay now

671
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:18,360
I'm a little bit apart from it once you're apart from it it's a gift because

672
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:24,639
now you can come towards it with as a friend if you're like this you you know

673
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:32,480
you can't do anything to it if you want to if you offer Respect by being separate and come together so oh anger I

674
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:37,840
see you and then um allow

675
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:44,520
it no this is terrible it shouldn't be it's

676
01:23:44,520 --> 01:23:52,880
my neighbor's fault and I got to do something I'm going to write a letter to the owners of the apartment building no

677
01:23:52,880 --> 01:24:00,080
no that's later now just allow just allow calm down calm down just allow

678
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:08,800
just feel it oh anger this is what anger is like you feel the heat you feel the tension oh okay and so so allow it allow

679
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:16,040
it and then feel it I don't want to feel it this doesn't feel good life is about feeling

680
01:24:16,040 --> 01:24:22,440
good just calm down just feel it just feel

681
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:27,960
feel like that I don't want to okay let's shift gears then what's really

682
01:24:27,960 --> 01:24:35,120
happening is you don't want to the resistance feel that resistance feel

683
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:40,239
that oh resistance recognize it allow it

684
01:24:40,239 --> 01:24:46,400
feel it don't make resistance bad just fold it into the mindfulness and then

685
01:24:46,400 --> 01:24:51,440
after a while the resistance dissipates and guess what now you're left with just

686
01:24:51,440 --> 01:24:59,760
the anger now it's easier anger without resistance so you hold it and feel

687
01:24:59,760 --> 01:25:06,440
it and then as you feel it then the tea of raft you can tease it

688
01:25:06,440 --> 01:25:12,480
apart oh yeah there's the story I tell myself the story every time

689
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:18,480
999 times now I tell the story that my neighbor disrespects me my neighbor

690
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:24,280
hates me the lame neighbor is trying to ruin my life

691
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:33,560
life and so what you don't know is your neighbor has gone deaf and this is almost de and they're

692
01:25:33,560 --> 01:25:40,159
desperately trying to hear something and they crank up the music and they feel so

693
01:25:40,159 --> 01:25:46,800
bereft but you don't know that so you think they're out for you and so you start separating out the

694
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:54,280
story from the actual experience some of your stories are true stories

695
01:25:54,719 --> 01:26:00,520
so then tell yourself yeah I think it's a truee story and then but this is not

696
01:26:00,520 --> 01:26:08,360
the time for the story that's that's let the story be later after meditation or let it be

697
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:13,880
later so I can just be with the my own experience so that I can take

698
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:19,400
responsibility for my part of it all really see what's going on so

699
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:25,280
there's teasing apart so when we did that in the meditation was that was that something

700
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:32,080
some of you could follow along with was it interesting and anybody want to say a few short words we're almost ready to

701
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:36,800
stop here but love to hear some comments

702
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:49,639
up um I was having trouble just staying is it on Fus can you hear me yeah okay

703
01:26:49,639 --> 01:26:56,320
um this commonly happens to me I'm feeling really cold in this room and it's very uncomfortable and so I can't

704
01:26:56,320 --> 01:27:01,400
stop thinking about it and I'm trying to like get I'm like why isn't anybody else

705
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:07,080
isn't anybody else like I feel it in my bones and so I'm like then I can't stop

706
01:27:07,080 --> 01:27:13,840
thinking about it but then I try but then I like tense up cuz I'm cold this happens to me with the weather in

707
01:27:13,840 --> 01:27:19,840
general when it's hot and when it's cold um so it was hard so I found myself like

708
01:27:19,840 --> 01:27:25,880
kind of trying to soothe Myself by like kind of rocking a little bit right right and then I'm like no I'm not supposed to be

709
01:27:25,880 --> 01:27:32,040
moving yes so yeah yeah so so that so this is an example of how I mean you

710
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:39,560
don't have to do what I'm about to say mean you know it's a usually a lot of times meditators have Shaws they put on

711
01:27:39,560 --> 01:27:44,840
you know just they tried to try to stay warm but what you can

712
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:51,440
do if you want to do what I was when I was studying in Zen moners in Japan where it was pretty cold some many times

713
01:27:51,440 --> 01:27:57,080
of the year and really hot in others I was told when cold just be cold when

714
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:05,239
warm just be warm when hot just be hot and so there's and I've done a lot of that where yes this is

715
01:28:05,800 --> 01:28:11,320
uncomfortable but I'll just be cold and and I I take the cold as the object of

716
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:16,840
mindfulness I just feel the cold and be with the fold try to relax with the cold

717
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:25,800
and um and uh the same thing with hot and uh it's possible to shiver and be at

718
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:31,880
peace but it's also possible to have such a strong reaction to it we're fighting it we're upset with it it has

719
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:37,320
to be different and we're kind of like getting all activated around it which sounds like what you've been doing yeah

720
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:43,679
no I do it all the time and I try I'm like no just be with the cold no I can't it's cold I don't like this at

721
01:28:43,679 --> 01:28:50,440
all so so so so it's something I need to work on for for sure yeah so so

722
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:55,480
um so one one of the things that I like to teach here at IMC and maybe I said

723
01:28:55,480 --> 01:29:02,920
this before in this class is that Buddhism has Lear about learning how to be free in the midst of

724
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:10,480
everything but uh if you're only free when you're comfortable you're not really free so what does it mean to be free

725
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:15,800
when things are uncomfortable we'll try to turn up the heat next

726
01:29:15,800 --> 01:29:20,960
week but uh but you but but uh it might be this might be a very interesting area

727
01:29:20,960 --> 01:29:27,600
for you to explore but may don't don't explore it when it's most difficult yeah maybe I'll try to be

728
01:29:27,600 --> 01:29:34,040
warmer I I always think I'm warm enough and no but yeah we'll try to keep it warmer for you but but but the uh but

729
01:29:34,040 --> 01:29:42,280
try to find some situation where you're mildly un just mildly cold and where it's safer to to experiment and see if

730
01:29:42,280 --> 01:29:48,280
you can experiment with the the raft and then judging it like I

731
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:53,719
shouldn't be so upset about how I'm cold right you know like the whole story that then goes along with that like I should

732
01:29:53,719 --> 01:29:59,280
be able to just be like with the c like you're allowed to be a cold person without you're allowed to be a cold

733
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:04,920
person without being a bad person being cold that that's I mean you didn't say

734
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:11,840
bad but you yeah yeah you're allowed to you're allowed to be someone who's you know that's nothing nothing no

735
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:19,960
shame just just be cold make it simple but if it's easy enough put on a

736
01:30:19,960 --> 01:30:27,119
blanket or something this is not supposed to be forceful aestheticism

737
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:33,920
here question yeah maybe one more and then

738
01:30:33,920 --> 01:30:39,600
we'll stop uh yeah hi so um when I'm doing a

739
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:46,960
meditation um you know I'm not getting too many emotions or anything like that unless there's a distraction uhhuh so

740
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:52,000
I'm not able to practice being with that emotion or even analyzing or you know

741
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:57,639
being getting into the emotion from a hold right in front of your mouth getting into the emotion from a

742
01:30:57,639 --> 01:31:04,040
disembodied way but in reality in in real life uh let's say I'm having a you

743
01:31:04,040 --> 01:31:10,679
know my boss is screaming at me or something like that I'm having fear and worry and all of that what do you do

744
01:31:10,679 --> 01:31:18,119
then is it that the technique should help you try and extract yourself from from those Pur you could do that uh mean

745
01:31:18,119 --> 01:31:24,280
at at work you have to take care of the work but you can take five minutes time

746
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:31,159
out say you're you boss did something and you're really angry and then you say excuse me I need to go to the bathroom

747
01:31:31,159 --> 01:31:36,560
you don't have to tell them what you're doing in the bathroom no one asks usually and um but what you're doing is

748
01:31:36,560 --> 01:31:43,600
going to sit on the toilet and just breathe and practice this with your anger for five minutes okay and then see and that you

749
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:49,800
practice there okay and so if you don't have much emotions when you meditate that's fine

750
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:54,920
you don't have to have emotions but uh if you can uh stay with the breathing

751
01:31:54,920 --> 01:32:01,920
stay present and come back over and over again from your thoughts you're building a capacity to be able to be with

752
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:07,440
emotions later so don't worry about it you know if you don't have it here but but take

753
01:32:07,440 --> 01:32:13,440
the opportunity at work if you can step away for five minutes and see what

754
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:21,280
happens okay thanks okay so I want to say that to

755
01:32:21,280 --> 01:32:26,480
open the arena of emotions sometimes is

756
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:31,800
opening Pandora's Box emotions are difficult very difficult for some people

757
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:37,800
and uh and and uh so it's possible that this has been tender for you some of you

758
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:43,360
to do this uh take care of yourself when you go home and be careful with yourself

759
01:32:43,360 --> 01:32:48,639
I'll stay up here a little bit and if you have questions or anything you want to ask Tom is Right sitting right there
