1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:11,120
hello everyone and happy to have you here as I

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,359
return from being gone for a week and um to be able to share this time

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:24,119
together and to uh begin kind of right

4
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:31,439
away I want to say that um meditation is often associated with becoming calm

5
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,559
and um relaxed and that when people sometimes show up to meditate they might feel

6
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,559
agitated they might feel all kinds of difficult emotions or spinning minds and

7
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,280
the idea that as meditation is an antidote for that and that we're trying to calm that down or settle something

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,000
and become more peaceful and that's all fine and it's actually part of

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,519
meditation but there comes a time when

10
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:09,720
uh what we want to do in meditation is not calm ourselves down is not make

11
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,040
things Pleasant for ourselves but rather learn to

12
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:23,720
be present equanimous present wisely present non reactively present for how

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:30,799
things are difficult if we always need to change how we are and change how we feel

14
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:36,479
we're not really finding the full Freedom that meditation mindfulness

15
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:42,720
meditation can provide us if we always need to make ourselves feel better then

16
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,640
we're still caught and uh probably still attached to something and thereby

17
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:54,320
setting up the conditions for us to get caught again if we're reacting towards

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:03,479
our tension and only calming down then we don't learning how to become wise

19
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:10,560
non-reactive kind of peace and maybe peaceful about being not

20
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:16,319
peaceful so we've been doing these 7 AMS many of us for over three three and a

21
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,000
half years now so I'd like to uh suggest that uh we

22
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:28,760
don't use this meditation to relax intentionally maybe unintentionally that

23
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,920
might happen but to assume a meditation

24
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:43,560
posture and either lower your gaze or close your

25
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,800
eyes and to begin directly without relaxing without settling

26
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:58,200
in to Simply recognize how you are right

27
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:05,280
now you might be sleepy you might

28
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,680
be a little bit dull you might be agitated you might be have some tensions

29
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,920
in your body don't automatically relax the

30
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,799
tensions just be present for how you

31
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:34,200
are and think of meditation as making room for how you

32
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:41,239
are creating space breathing room for

33
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:48,040
tension for agitation for an overactive

34
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,239
mind for sorrow and

35
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:01,680
grief for anger and

36
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,439
whatever whatever is happening and as we sit

37
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:14,920
this next 20 25 minutes or

38
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:23,400
so don't try to change anything don't try to let anything go

39
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:32,080
don't try to relax don't try to only change how how you are with

40
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:38,960
things so that you can be present for whatever way you are with an attention

41
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:45,360
and awareness which is nonreactive that allows yourself to be

42
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,159
just the way you

43
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,120
are to be able to have the inner strength to be present for how you are

44
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:01,560
even if it's not what you want

45
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,520
and then breathe with

46
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:17,199
that breathe so that you stay in touch with it and keep finding your way to a

47
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:22,319
non-reactive mode of awareness of

48
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:31,400
attention that doesn't need anything to change

49
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:37,360
except to be aware of how things are

50
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,800
directly and giving room for how things are to be just the way they are as they

51
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:58,160
exist in the present moment for this meditation past and

52
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:04,160
future are Irrelevant for the purpose of being

53
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,400
present here for how we

54
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
are

55
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400

for

65
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:30,880
sitting here being aware without trying to change anything

66
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:38,120
to improve on things to push something

67
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:44,720
away without giving into your preferences or

68
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,560
being pushed around by what you like and what you don't

69
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:56,079
like let how you you are be just the way it

70
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:03,199
is while being clearly aware this is how it

71
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:08,079
is finding a nonreactive

72
00:13:09,399 --> 00:13:16,480
awareness that is able to look at reality directly as it

73
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:27,160
is without being

74
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:31,160
agitated about being being

75
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
agitated

for

86
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:05,559
for not drifting off in

87
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,440
thought rather clearly recognizing that's what's

88
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:21,320
happening not reacting to what's happening clearly knowing what's

89
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:30,159
happening finding a kind of peace with how you are as you are

90
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:50,600
a peace which is only about the present moment here as you are

91
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:56,400
independent of What's Happen in the past what's going to happen in the

92
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:03,519
future just now peace with how you

93
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
are

94
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039

00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960

97
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
e

98
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
e

99
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

100
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:49,399
to know how to be present to

101
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:58,880
discomfort and be comfortable with being with discomfort

102
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,679
be at ease with being

103
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:12,640
uneasy being able to see clearly what is difficult without

104
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:18,880
changing it this is a kind of

105
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:34,360
superpower that can bring many benefits as we go into our

106
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:43,720
lives we can be a gift to others because we know how to be

107
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:50,320
present when things are challenging we know how to have a

108
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:57,120
nonreactive presence we know how to be comfortable

109
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:04,679
with disc Comfort when others may not know

110
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:12,840
that and so we bring with us a different way of

111
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:18,840
being that doesn't perpetuate the cycles of reactivity that

112
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:26,360
people can live in but rather demonstrates the

113
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:31,880
possibility of being

114
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:39,679
peaceful when there's conflict being

115
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:46,200
non-reactive when things are not to our

116
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:52,080
preferences may it be that our capacity to be

117
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:59,200
present for discomfort serves

118
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:06,360
our ability to care for the welfare and happiness of

119
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,919
Others May it provide us with patience may it provide us with the

120
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:21,278
ability to learn understand others

121
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:30,440
better may it provide us with the time so that we can be wise in how we

122
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,360
respond to the challenges of

123
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:46,240
life may nonreactive presence be a gift to ourselves and

124
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:54,200
others so we can connect to the deepest parts of ourselves and to

125
00:27:54,200 --> 00:28:01,480
Others May this practice that we do support the welfare and happiness of all

126
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:08,679
beings everywhere may all beings be

127
00:28:08,679 --> 00:28:14,360
happy may all beings be

128
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:24,559
safe may all beings be healthy and may all beings everywhere be

129
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
free

130
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:51,039
[Music]

131
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:53,278
thank

132
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
you

133
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
e

134
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:23,120
so so that meditation we just did I feel is phenomenally important to

135
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:31,919
learn and maybe it's not something that people who are beginners of meditation would focus on but sooner or later if we

136
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:38,919
really want to be free we have to be free even when we're uncomfortable even when things are not

137
00:30:38,919 --> 00:30:44,399
what we prefer them to be and if we want to be able to care for

138
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:50,760
the world well wisely uh uh we need to learn how to be

139
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:58,200
comfortable with the discomforts of the world so that we don't um

140
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:10,399
we're not reactive our reactivity doesn't override our ability to see clearly to think clearly to care carely

141
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:16,600
clearly and um the

142
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:25,120
um um it's a phenomenal skill to learn and so maybe this week that can be

143
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:32,320
the focus I know some of you may have a deep need for relief for relaxation

144
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:39,200
for some kind of um calm in the middle of your storm and

145
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,720
you're welcome always to practice as you see fit but I'd like to this week help

146
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:51,880
us kind of explore the um uh you know the the full benefit of this practice

147
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:58,760
that comes when we understand when we know how to practice with what's difficult

148
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:09,440
and um so part of the reason for this is that uh I want to talk about the central

149
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:14,398
Buddhist teaching on

150
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:21,279
nonviolence and uh nonharming an ancient teaching in

151
00:32:21,279 --> 00:32:28,480
Buddhism is that the primary characteristic of the Dharma is non-harming

152
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,600
and um and nonharming is very challenging

153
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:40,559
State and in order to be able to live wisely with a dedication to

154
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:46,919
nonviolence it's important to be able to be wise about the challenges that our

155
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:52,159
life brings us challenges of living this life in the world where there is so much

156
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:59,720
violence and um and it begins by knowing H how to be

157
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:05,480
present for tremendous difficulties and not being pulled into our reactivity

158
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:13,799
pulled into our fear or our anger our distress our alarm our um all kinds of

159
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:18,919
things that we get caught in and then if we get caught in those things and act

160
00:33:18,919 --> 00:33:25,840
from them then we're probably not going to act with much wisdom we're probably not going to act in ways that lead to

161
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:31,720
everyone's long-term benefit so in the teachings of the

162
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:36,760
Buddha there's a phenomenal emphasis on non-harming you see it scattered

163
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:45,240
throughout the importance of it and um it's uh so fundamental that uh it's what

164
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:51,440
brought me to the Dharma I came to the Dharma during the Vietnam war

165
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,559
time and I was of the draft age and uh

166
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:02,760
it was possible that I would when I turned 18 that I would they had a lottery for

167
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:12,200
the draft and it was possible that I would get a number that low enough number that uh I would be uh you know

168
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:18,240
called in to to the military and then maybe sent to Vietnam

169
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:25,118
to fight and I was a dedicated uh uh

170
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:31,919
pacifist it was I was certainly incapable of picking up a rifle and

171
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:37,398
fighting and killing other people so I I

172
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:46,079
assumed that I would figure out some way to be a conscientious objector or find some way to avoid uh going to fight but

173
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:53,000
it was still very active among those of us in the first year of college most of us were you know a draft

174
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:59,440
age and um and one of the things that um so we had a lot of conversations about

175
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:07,200
this and a lot of conversations about war and violence and and as those conversations went I was a person on the

176
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:12,960
kind of the most extreme kind of the one end of the spectrum that was dedicated

177
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:19,880
to nonviolence finding non-violent ways of dealing with conflict and um so then you know I had

178
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:27,480
to defend it I had to stand up for it in some ways and uh as I looked at myself with

179
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:32,560
this dedication this way that I was I could see that there was a problem I had

180
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,800
between there was a gap between uh the Deep kind of beliefs of that came out of

181
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,000
kind of felt like it came out of who I am rather than came out of just a belief

182
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:51,520
but this deep belief I had uh about nonviolent uh and there was not a belief

183
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:57,880
that you should be passive and do nothing it was a belief that um

184
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:04,880
uh that when there is conflict when there is war that uh a person who is

185
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:12,280
dedicated to nonviolence is a nonviolent Warrior would respond and deal directly

186
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:20,040
in some way with the violence in order to um stop the violence and there's lots

187
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:26,240
of phenomenal examples in the 20th century of people who have done this and

188
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:33,240
examples where it didn't work but uh I was inspired by the examples that did

189
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:41,319
work but the problem I had was I was afraid of dying and I could feel that whereas my

190
00:36:41,319 --> 00:36:46,640
beliefs were that that I should be able to uh be a non-violent

191
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:51,720
Warrior um uh I felt that my fear of death fear

192
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:58,800
of the harm that I could receive because of that got would gotten the way and I didn't feel good about this Gap and I

193
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:06,480
felt I had to address it and um and my first interest in Buddhism was uh

194
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:12,680
somehow I picked up in my teenage years this idea that Buddhist practice uh

195
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:19,240
address this fear Buddhist practice would somehow address this concern I had

196
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:24,960
that so that if the time came for me to be involved in

197
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,720
nonviolent civil disob obedience nonviolent action that I would

198
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:37,359
um be prepared be ready for it so that was kind of the beginning of my interest

199
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,200
in Buddhism and it didn't really get me practicing regularly it took a few more years before I started practicing

200
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:51,720
regularly but what it has meant is that I was very attracted then to the teachings in Buddhism for uh uh the

201
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:59,880
non-violent teachings the emphasis in in that and uh um and I knew that just you

202
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:06,280
know being dedicated to that was not enough that uh there had to be uh wisdom

203
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:12,200
about how to do that and I came across a book by a scholar academic named Jean

204
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:18,839
sharp it's a three volume little book called uh uh nonviolence and he was a a

205
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:25,200
a scholar of non-violence around the world and it studied it in its different manifestations and its techniques and

206
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,400
its ways and it was uh that

207
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:36,000
um uh and you know it's not enough just to be dedicated to it it's a

208
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:45,280
sophisticated strategy to addess the world this way and um and so I studied his book and

209
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:53,280
I was interested in more of this and but as I got involved in Buddhism I got pulled into this world of of practice

210
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:58,960
and um feeling very confident that this practice practice would make people

211
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:04,440
better able to live in the world in a nonviolent way to some

212
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:10,760
degree and um and uh but I always wanted to address it more and I did some

213
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:16,359
workshops on this topic of non Buddhism and non-violence the Buddhist teachings on

214
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:21,839
non-violence and um and it's always been a strong current that I've wanted to

215
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:28,440
address and talk about and so I'm going to take this week to talk about it a bit

216
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:34,319
um and I want to say first that um Peace

217
00:39:34,319 --> 00:39:39,839
is not is not the absence of

218
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:46,480
conflict that um conflict is an inevitable part of human

219
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:54,520
life however peace is knowing how to work with conflict work with differences

220
00:39:54,520 --> 00:40:01,319
works with uh disagreements in such a way that uh we try to benefit

221
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:07,000
both sides of the conflict and this might sound naive it

222
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:12,480
might sound like it's ridiculous and

223
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:19,319
um the um maybe if you if we

224
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:24,560
don't educate ourselves if we don't prepare for it it's not something we

225
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,440
jump into if we get out of bed and today we're going to address the violence in the world

226
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:38,000
non-violently maybe it takes years of dedication and practice and learning when I was uh I'm originally

227
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:43,800
from Norway and in Norway there's a mandatory military service for a

228
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:49,800
year and uh there is an option for being a conscientious objector and in which

229
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:56,920
case a person has to serve two years uh doing some kind of uh community service

230
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:03,040
maybe working in a hospital and as a hospital Aid or something so everyone in

231
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:08,880
Norway has to do back then it was all the men all the men men had to do some

232
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:14,040
kind of service for the country whether it was military or conscien objector

233
00:41:14,040 --> 00:41:19,839
some other way and some of the conscientious objectors objected to

234
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:26,400
this because at that time there was a feeling that uh Russia was a threat and

235
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:33,480
and uh there could be you know World War II is not so far not so long before and

236
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:39,280
Russia the Cold War was happening and uh some of the non-violent uh some of the

237
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:46,640
conscience obors wanted to have training equivalent to military training in

238
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:52,880
nonviolent strategies so that uh they could and and to develop themselves so

239
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:59,560
they could be prepared for uh engaging very actively in nonviolent ways if the

240
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,960
country was invaded Martin Luther King when he did his phenomenal civil rights

241
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,960
movement that was dedicated to nonviolence they just didn't wake up in the morning and just practice

242
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:16,400
nonviolence they prepared the non-violent protesters there was

243
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:24,640
preparation and training to be ready for what they did and I think in the long run there was some of those protesters

244
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:30,559
died some of them were severely hurt but probably um less

245
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:38,079
people got hurt that way than if there been a violent attempt to try to rectify

246
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:46,000
this uh unjust Injustice that existed then somehow we justify violence almost

247
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,960
like it's okay to die if we're fighting but it's not okay to die for

248
00:42:53,960 --> 00:43:01,319
nonviolence so peace being learning how to be with

249
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:06,920
conflict so that it supports both people so I'll talk more about this in the

250
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:14,920
course of the day of of the week and I hope you stay for this week uh I hope

251
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:23,240
that uh that that uh you your desire for pleasure for delightful meditations for

252
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:29,119
deep states of calm uh to learn inspiring teachings for you

253
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:36,920
know about joy and love or something um don't

254
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:42,359
uh uh cause you to be disinterested in learning how to be with

255
00:43:42,359 --> 00:43:48,599
conflict and how to be wise about it being with our discomforts in life this

256
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:54,680
is a phenomenally important part of Dharma practice to uh do

257
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:01,440
this um and so I want to read finally uh there's many many quotes from the Buddha about

258
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:09,000
this kind of thing but I I'll read some of them the course of the week but I want to read this one as we end

259
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:19,640
today the strong that those people who are strong seek the best for themselves and

260
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:24,920
for others understanding an other P other

261
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:30,079
people's anger they cultivate calm and

262
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:35,359
Stillness and thus they heal both themselves and

263
00:44:35,359 --> 00:44:41,319
others those who call this weakness do not understand the

264
00:44:41,319 --> 00:44:47,680
Dharma so that's in chapter 11 of the connected

265
00:44:47,839 --> 00:44:53,960
discourses so um so I'll talk more about this in the

266
00:44:53,960 --> 00:45:01,040
course of the week and in a sense this is also a response to the horrendous

267
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:09,440
violence that's going on in the world right now and um and it violence that's a

268
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:15,119
continuation of what's been going on in the world for thousands of years one with place or

269
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:20,559
another and um so um thank you for being

270
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:26,680
part of this this is a very important part of who I am and what I want to teach and so

271
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:31,558
um I appreciate the chance to do it thank

272
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:34,800
you
