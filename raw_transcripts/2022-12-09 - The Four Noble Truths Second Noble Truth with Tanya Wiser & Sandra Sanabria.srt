1
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:44,660
foreign hello yeah looks good

2
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:16,940
okay I think we're good

3
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:24,720
oh so welcome I thank you for

4
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:30,080
coming today so this is

5
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:36,600
yes please so this is the uh our second class in

6
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,640
the series of the Four Noble Truth

7
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:49,320
um last week we talked about the first Noble Truth and today we're gonna go the

8
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:54,779
second um therefore no one truths are kind of

9
00:10:54,779 --> 00:11:01,260
the the basis the

10
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:08,040
what we really need to understand and and see clearly our own practice our

11
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:15,360
experience our inner life our life in community

12
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:22,140
there is this a sentencing in the sutah so it's a sariputa to achieve disciple

13
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:29,640
of the Buddha he was talking to a group of monks and he said this

14
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:36,540
friends just as the footprint of any living being that walks can be placed

15
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:42,779
within an elephant's footprint so too all wholesome States can be

16
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:50,339
included in the Four Noble Truths for it's kind of from there we we start

17
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:56,880
and we go back and forth we may go deeper in other teachings and

18
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,339
things like that but the four noble truths remain kind of the of the basis

19
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:08,700
and you're listening to them now and maybe in the future to listen to them

20
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:16,320
again and something else comes up it's incredibly rich is a very

21
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:23,220
deep teaching it sounds very simple but there's a lot a lot to to reflect a lot

22
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:29,040
to learn a lot to understand in them so I would like to

23
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:34,800
to share some of the teachings from Sylvia Burstein the way she talks about

24
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,839
the four noble truths so she says we talked last week about the first

25
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:48,440
novel truth about Duca the suffering bit annoyed being stressed anxiety all

26
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:54,600
kinds different kinds of suffering different levels let's say of suffering

27
00:12:54,600 --> 00:13:00,240
and she says life is challenging for all beings

28
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,540
everybody our bodies relationships all our life

29
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:14,279
circumstances are fragile and are changing we are accommodating all the time we

30
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:20,100
just yeah that's kind of the reality of Duke in

31
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:26,940
her words the second Noble Truth The Castle the cause of suffering is the mind's a

32
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:33,899
struggle in responding to challenge and we'll go deeper on that one today

33
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:39,420
the third Noble Truth the end of suffering a mind that doesn't struggle a

34
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:47,339
mind that is at peace that is is possible and therefore Noble Truth is kind of the

35
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:53,399
medicine what is it that we need to do to be free of suffering and that is the

36
00:13:53,399 --> 00:14:00,899
the Eightfold Path so just with this short introduction

37
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:07,279
maybe we could start a meditation thank you Tanya

38
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:12,980
everybody okay if I take my mask off

39
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:22,740
that was great I just uh I'm just going to repeat those am I can

40
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:27,899
you make me a teeny bit louder I think how's the volume you guys is it loud enough

41
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:32,959
okay so

42
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:41,160
life is challenging for all our bodies relationships

43
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:46,699
all of life circumstances are fragile and changing

44
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,699
we are always accommodating

45
00:14:56,699 --> 00:15:02,160
a second Noble Truth the cause of suffering

46
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:07,680
is the mind's struggle in response

47
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:13,980
to challenge so feel your body

48
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:22,040
will go into a meditation fill your feet on the floor

49
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,060
maybe lift your shoulders and roll them back a bit

50
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:39,060
make sure your arms our hands are resting comfortably

51
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:50,540
with the next inhale let your body Rise Up Lift Up stretch up

52
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:04,199
feeling yourself rising up to the present moment

53
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:09,899
to meet right here just this just the space

54
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:17,699
this body in this moment with whatever emotions and thoughts

55
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:22,519
and Sensations that are happening here

56
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:42,139
so with this idea that we're always accommodating

57
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:46,579
and that life is challenging

58
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:56,100
see if you can bring to mind some small way

59
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,139
that life is challenging for you right now small

60
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:08,480
so on a scale of one to ten a one or a two maybe a three not a ten

61
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,339
so there's the challenge

62
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,220
and then there's our struggle to be with that challenge

63
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,900
see if you can feel into the struggle

64
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,500
and as you hold that struggle just notice the way

65
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:45,679
that you might struggle a bit in response to this challenge

66
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:02,179
and see if you can feel that struggle get a feel for the pattern the pull

67
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:10,740
three patterns I notice in myself are a pattern of

68
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:16,020
puddling or sinking in sort of like a

69
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:23,179
this is hard and every bit of me just falls into this is hard

70
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:32,520
that's one pattern another pattern is

71
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:38,100
this is hard and there's a refusal

72
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:47,960
or a distancing feeling so it's not puddling it's maybe armoring in response

73
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:56,360
there's a distancing or a repressing energy

74
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:04,980
these are two extremes that embody that struggle with whatever

75
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:11,340
it is that is difficult and there's everything in between

76
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:17,539
so just with that as a reference see if you can't

77
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:23,520
stay with the same struggle or maybe choose another one again

78
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:30,059
three or under on the trigger scale not big

79
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:37,340
tolerable and be curious

80
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:44,779
trying to bring to mind that struggle like I have a broken leg

81
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:54,179
just in that simplicity and then there's the reaction to it the

82
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:58,399
oh and that means I can't drive the car

83
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:05,700
or I can't believe maybe I'll never be able to walk again

84
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:14,720
hike run that's the struggle with the challenge

85
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,620
let's see if you can't feel into the energy the dynamic

86
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:27,380
of how you're relating

87
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:35,299
to one of the many little struggles in your life

88
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:42,660
and if the struggle starts to become a floor or a five or above on the

89
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,679
trigger scale

90
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:53,880
and sort of Imagine bowing to it and saying

91
00:20:53,880 --> 00:21:00,500
I'll come back to you I need to choose something little right now maybe open your eyes

92
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,559
maybe put your hand on your heart

93
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:12,799
this is hard

94
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:24,620
and notice that in a way sometimes the hard stuff is very magnetic

95
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:33,419
the mind just really wants to stay focused on it so just see that magnetic energy that

96
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:41,059
pull that draw the way it keeps pulling us back feel that

97
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:48,320
witness that without being it

98
00:21:53,340 --> 00:22:01,200
and see if you can't soften just like in a warm bath softening

99
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,500
around all of this that's happening in your mind no need to bring up anything else I

100
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:14,039
think you've probably done well enough just focus on

101
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:17,539
how to be soft

102
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,460
around it

103
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:33,260
breathe in softness and breathe out with softness

104
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:38,720
breathe in caring

105
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:43,940
and breathe out caring

106
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:58,940
and let's do a little body scan starting at the top of the head

107
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,080
just above the head

108
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:11,120
just first standing with him

109
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:16,520
alongside the body taking it in

110
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:24,140
the sense of caring and Wise Eyes

111
00:23:29,039 --> 00:23:33,620
and imagine a warm light

112
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:39,679
maybe golden like warm honey

113
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:48,240
imagine that the way that you are seeing and feeling the body is like warm honey

114
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:53,960
sweet gentle

115
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,520
sort of let it the awareness slowly

116
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:08,059
Glide down from the top of the head

117
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:17,400
down through the forehead and the side back of the head and the ears

118
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:24,620
the eyes cheekbones and jaw

119
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:32,600
ah taking some breaths down

120
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:41,600
and Chin the neck sides of the neck back of the neck

121
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:50,899
tops of the shoulders collarbone

122
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,340
down the front of your chest

123
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,240
down the back body

124
00:25:05,220 --> 00:25:08,960
just taking your time

125
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:17,658
scanning touching with this warmth the body

126
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:23,059
moving as slowly as you need

127
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:29,299
down the arms

128
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:38,100
and with each exhale just invite a little bit of softening a little bit of

129
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,820
relaxing

130
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:56,240
and the belly and the lower back

131
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,820
the hips and the bottom

132
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:12,539
the thighs knees

133
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,840
shins and calves

134
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,140
ankles and feet

135
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:36,120
breathing into the whole body now feeling it expand with the inhale

136
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,740
contract with the exhale

137
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:50,419
and feeling the Earth under your feet a sense of groundedness

138
00:26:54,419 --> 00:27:00,980
so being soft and relaxed but here

139
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,919
upright

140
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:19,220
and imagine in your mind's eye

141
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:28,220
what it would be like to stand tall and relaxed

142
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:35,299
next to whatever is difficult in your life

143
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:43,320
maybe imagine what it's like when somebody puts their hand on your shoulder or

144
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:49,039
just stands beside you with support

145
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,200
in this caring but upright way

146
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:08,400
in the sense that nothing needs to happen right now just being

147
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:15,000
and this way with whatever's going on is all that's

148
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,480
needed

149
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:39,080
breathing in

150
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:44,778
and breathing out

151
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:51,559
feeling the flow

152
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:59,000
the changing nature of your experience moment to moment

153
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:12,320
changing nature of sound

154
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:49,760
just allowing whatever comes up in your meditation now to come up

155
00:29:50,159 --> 00:29:58,278
just witnessing nothing needs to happen

156
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:07,820
just holding this calm and upright presence in the middle of it all

157
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:23,059
letting whatever comes into the Mind move through in its own way

158
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:31,799
imagine there's nothing sticky nothing no magnetic energy

159
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:35,600
it just can slide through

160
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:41,059
nothing to hold on to

161
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,779
and then when you notice some holding some tension

162
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:57,440
ah hmm

163
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,840
what am I trying to hold on to

164
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:12,740
a Feeling a thought

165
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,620
the way I wish it were

166
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:27,440
a memory can it be held on to

167
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:43,620
maybe it becomes transparent dissolves

168
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:57,500
and feeling the breath and the body right here

169
00:32:12,659 --> 00:32:15,659
foreign

170
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,140
the feet

171
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:38,000
the support of the Earth

172
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:22,580
and when you notice tension or stress in the body

173
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:28,100
in the mind in the heart

174
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:36,720
see if you can't stand at its side witnessing

175
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:43,440
with kindness and confidence

176
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,980
strength I can be with this too

177
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:10,339
right here right now in this moment I don't need to do anything

178
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:14,179
just be aware

179
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:31,220
and it's okay if it's not okay

180
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,940
here

181
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:05,359
everything's okay

182
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:11,599
it's done this moment

183
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:25,980
even the weird honking horn I'm just fine

184
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:34,220
so where does something I have alarm wow it's like a flat tire or something

185
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:04,859
again just noticing if there's any tension building up in the body

186
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:11,000
it just kind of keeps coming back in my body

187
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:18,619
the breathing in and inviting it to soften

188
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:23,660
inviting a little letting go with exhale

189
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:36,900
and over and over again just softening

190
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,900
allowing

191
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,559
and meeting standing up to meet whatever is happening

192
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:31,640
in the last few minutes of the meditation together

193
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:40,619
maybe just check in and notice reflect on your journey

194
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:45,660
you've all had a very different Journey than everybody beside you but you've all

195
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:53,940
been on a journey the different things that have come up The Feelings the energy in your body may

196
00:38:53,940 --> 00:39:00,119
have shifted and changed see if you can't just sort of get a

197
00:39:00,119 --> 00:39:05,960
feeling for where you've gone journeyed

198
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,220
what's different

199
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:23,460
when you think back to the difficulty you first thought of

200
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:26,300
the challenge

201
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,838
notice how it is to think of it now

202
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,210
[Music]

203
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:12,260
so we'll take a couple of minutes just to um reflect on how was that for you

204
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:20,900
anybody have anything that they're willing to say or share there's a mic there and a mic there

205
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:30,300
great

206
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:38,880
I I think I got hello Tanya hello Sandra good evening thank you hi Richard I was

207
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:48,180
very I was too comfortable obviously I never thought I would doze off so audibly but um it was um I have to say I

208
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:54,900
thought from last week's class to this week regarding the tone of voice that you had mentioned like what tone are you

209
00:40:54,900 --> 00:41:01,200
bringing in I I am more mindful of that and I think throughout well throughout

210
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:07,800
my journey and or my meditation journey I find that I've been needing to I've been wanting to sit longer in the

211
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:14,220
morning as opposed to the evening because it helps me start my day because I feel

212
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:20,880
like my days are I'm just trying to get ready for the day and so

213
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:25,920
so that's been so that that's this sitting was nice and um

214
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:32,540
even with the car horn you know that's happened before at IMC and

215
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:37,619
just trying not to get bothered by whatever so but but that's yes thank you

216
00:41:37,619 --> 00:41:44,640
thank you and Rose yeah great

217
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:52,400
thank you thank you for having us here

218
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:59,400
also thank you for your comment that all of us had a different Journey

219
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:05,400
and we are all here meeting at the same point um

220
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:11,040
there is uh some um poetry um

221
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:17,820
which I will try to make like a close English I mean essentially a couplet

222
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:24,800
um make a approximate English translation of that

223
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:30,300
the two hearts are beating but the

224
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:36,660
music is the same two hearts are beating but the music is the same the sound is

225
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:42,839
the same um and the

226
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:49,140
um um the the songs are different but thus

227
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:55,260
but the instrument is the same yeah so when you talk about the journeys are

228
00:42:55,260 --> 00:43:02,640
different but the instrument is the same yeah so I just wanted to present that

229
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:06,380
thank you thank you

230
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:20,819
um thanks so much for the the meditation I was surprised at the

231
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:27,240
when you invited us to pick something that was just like a one or two and then I think the invitation was to like let

232
00:43:27,240 --> 00:43:33,800
go of the struggle a little bit and wow I was so surprised how good it felt like a little struggle

233
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:39,180
and then also it was about my students that I work with and then just like

234
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:45,900
what came to me was just like I can let go and just trust that they're gonna figure out how to do this and that's so

235
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:51,480
much um it's just so much more loving than the other way that it could be of like this

236
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:56,940
like holding on we have to do it so anyway so thank you that felt really

237
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:04,560
good I also had this little thought pop in um about my family and I thought my gosh

238
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:12,540
there's such like worry carriers if that makes sense oh I love that term yeah and I love them all the pieces but um

239
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:19,079
but it's such a thing in my family to worry so anyway maybe when that comes up

240
00:44:19,079 --> 00:44:24,359
that invitation to let go of the struggle could be a really good just a good place to go

241
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:29,060
thank you Sandra

242
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:37,020
Okay so repeating from the second from Simply

243
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:45,920
upper stains the cause of suffering is the mind's struggle in response to challenge

244
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:53,819
thank you for the meditation I couldn't find the two I went to 10

245
00:44:53,819 --> 00:45:02,599
immediately like oh my gosh and I think it's the

246
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:11,480
the reaction to the struggle of the Mind is what they in Pali is called

247
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:17,160
tanha that literally translates as a thirst

248
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:24,480
is also translated as hunger desire craving

249
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:32,900
um thirst works very well for me now in this moment of my life

250
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:38,160
and and as you you'll find the

251
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:45,859
translation that relate that really expresses where you are how it feels for you

252
00:45:45,859 --> 00:45:54,060
so we have the challenge the minor struggles and then that thirst

253
00:45:54,060 --> 00:46:00,000
The Challenge and and in the three of them is kind of the way things are

254
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:07,079
really we cannot control the challenges in our life there's they're going to happen no matter what

255
00:46:07,079 --> 00:46:13,020
the way our minds work link because we're just humans is we're going to

256
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:19,859
struggle and it can take different forms and also like that desire for things to

257
00:46:19,859 --> 00:46:27,240
be well for we want to be we want to live in with ease at peace so it's that

258
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:33,319
that thirst that hunger in a way is kind of natural

259
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:43,880
um Gregory Kramer says that the the clinging the uh the grasping

260
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:50,760
is what makes the bridge between that thirst and the suffering

261
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:56,579
so in reality those three like okay that's the way things are that's the way

262
00:46:56,579 --> 00:47:02,160
your brain works that's part of our human nature isn't it but is that what

263
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:09,119
comes after that that clinging that I have to fix this this needs to be well

264
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:16,020
and we can see it in many aspects of our life that's really what brings the

265
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:23,040
suffering um I for me it works like to break things in

266
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:28,380
pieces it's just I'm a scientist so I guess it's just the way my mind tends to

267
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:34,020
go um but yeah and

268
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:40,079
and what we want to be at ease to be well there's really

269
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:46,740
nothing wrong with it the problem is that

270
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:53,760
I personally am I'm a doer and a fixer every time my mind's a struggle I want

271
00:47:53,760 --> 00:48:00,060
it to be like I that's my default to go

272
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:07,020
so we cling to things I wanted it to be perfect I wanted to be well I do I I

273
00:48:07,020 --> 00:48:14,819
don't want to feel bad I don't want to be uncomfortable I don't want to be called things like that and we also

274
00:48:14,819 --> 00:48:20,760
cling to what we do to achieve that

275
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:27,420
we cling we grasp even grasp the fear that we're

276
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:34,680
going to lose it when we get it and we even cling to the fear of not getting it

277
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:41,940
so it's a little like a convoluted so I'm gonna give you an

278
00:48:41,940 --> 00:48:47,700
example I was thinking of how can I convey so I'm going to bring an example

279
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:53,480
of my life and maybe you'll find something in yours

280
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:59,280
when for me going to college it was very difficult we were in very tough

281
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:04,500
economical situation so it was it was very hard I had to work and all that

282
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:09,540
and then finally I came to this country and I was able to find a

283
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:17,280
good job and found economical stability and I wanted to make sure that my kids

284
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:25,680
didn't need to go through the same struggle that I had to so I worked 24 7.

285
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:32,640
I burn myself to exhaustion and but it's like yeah because uh I need

286
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:39,900
to make it right for them they they so they don't need to go through the same so that in itself that that I wanted to

287
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:46,579
achieve I think it wasn't two parties and eight I think we won to provide the best

288
00:49:46,579 --> 00:49:54,359
but it became kind of um an addiction for me so I work it hard

289
00:49:54,359 --> 00:50:02,040
and I work it on the weekends and I work it late at night and but yeah I have to do this so like I got

290
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:08,819
addicted to to the way I was trying to achieve that and the fear of

291
00:50:08,819 --> 00:50:14,520
not being able to provide oh gosh like oh it's my motivation I

292
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:20,819
kind of let go of that oh and then the fear of not not being

293
00:50:20,819 --> 00:50:26,700
enough not not achieving enough because then it becomes very convoluted and it

294
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:34,859
is not only one thing we tend to mix a lot of things I'm a woman and I need to show that I'm I need the validation I

295
00:50:34,859 --> 00:50:41,280
need to show them that I can do this isn't it so I mean maybe a little too extreme but I

296
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:48,599
I can see like all these faces of what is clinging

297
00:50:48,599 --> 00:50:52,640
um in in that part of my life

298
00:50:54,839 --> 00:51:00,720
and then probably you you're gonna find your your own examples as well but I

299
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:10,319
think again it's not what we want that is wrong it's not it's the way we our attitude

300
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:16,020
how it becomes an obsession almost and um

301
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:21,599
we don't notice it very easily we because that's the way things are and

302
00:51:21,599 --> 00:51:28,079
that there are much simpler things and we just simply don't notice

303
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:35,339
um like when I I got here earlier and for some reason the thermostat was 72

304
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:40,680
Fahrenheit it was like oh my God she's so hot like I started going where is how

305
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:46,680
is it I was trying to remember how to like wow this is what is it that we're

306
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:52,380
gonna talk today so we see it it's every day we see it in

307
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:58,619
the Small Things um so yeah it was kind of interesting

308
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:04,740
so the that thirst that we feel that um

309
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:12,839
the Buddha gave us three main big groups the first one is the craving the desire

310
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:18,420
for sense pleasure the next one is hunger for being for

311
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:25,260
becoming and the third one hunger for non-being for non-becoming

312
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:31,920
um so I'm gonna try to More by example I want to make sure I'm I have the the

313
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:38,940
right time all right um so decipher sends pleasure who

314
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:48,119
doesn't love a nice meal who doesn't love a nice song looking at a beautiful landscape and

315
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:55,700
piece of art a pleasurable touch like a nice warm shower

316
00:52:55,700 --> 00:53:02,400
a pleasurable State of Mind feeling content and relaxed yeah who doesn't

317
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,680
love a nice relaxing meditation so it's kind of that sense pleasure

318
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:13,740
and again it's not in itself what the thing that we decide that is wrong that

319
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:19,079
is that we shouldn't be enjoying it or this sinful or anything like that it's

320
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:25,740
more how we relate to it that is gonna bring us that I want it I want and I

321
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:30,980
don't want to let it go and that's what bring us the suffering

322
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:38,119
um the I think something that's quite interesting is the desires is

323
00:53:38,119 --> 00:53:45,000
usually the way we engage with the world we come here because we want to listen

324
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:50,160
we want to I don't know cultivate our spiritual life we when I come to this

325
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:57,540
community where we feel okay welcome so yeah that's uh that's kind of the way we

326
00:53:57,540 --> 00:54:05,339
we go around in the world but is how are we gonna do it that is

327
00:54:05,339 --> 00:54:10,800
um that really bring us the the suffering in itself

328
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:18,960
and then what what is also in in with their desires for some sense pleasure is the

329
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:24,119
aversion that we have for pain it's like if you have some work to be

330
00:54:24,119 --> 00:54:31,740
done in your mouth at the dentist like that you're thinking for a week that oh gosh

331
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:39,119
that's gonna hurt like it it's also a little bit what's involved into that part of clinging

332
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:47,280
and now for the Hunger for being on for non-being rather than going into

333
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:54,440
um too much talk about it I'm maybe give you some some examples

334
00:54:55,380 --> 00:55:01,980
so you get to work and you have been

335
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:07,440
assigned a certain parking spot because you're an employee of the month and then you arrive at there's somebody parked

336
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:12,900
there oh what the lack of respect and we're

337
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:18,240
goodness they they don't know that I am the employee of the month like that

338
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:23,940
desire to be seen to be known isn't it or

339
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:29,220
um you want people the pain of our personalities isn't it you're very good

340
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:36,180
at making jokes and things like that and somebody is not laughing at you joke at the comment that you just did like oh

341
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:43,619
wow that I I'm that person like I you need to laugh at my jokes or things like

342
00:55:43,619 --> 00:55:48,780
that and even like we just had the elections in

343
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:55,700
November and you you think very you have very strong position about that

344
00:55:55,700 --> 00:56:01,380
proposition and you voted against it and rallied your friends and all that and

345
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:08,460
the proposition passed wow like all these my opinion my

346
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:15,180
political beliefs my religions belief we really is and we identify so much with

347
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:20,339
those one that I found quite interesting first

348
00:56:20,339 --> 00:56:28,200
one I when I came to this country is how some people feel offended when I

349
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:36,960
said happy holidays and not Merry Christmas for example he he was taken very personally it took

350
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:45,079
me a little while to figure that that one and then on the other end is

351
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:53,280
this desire for not being seen like that team building event and that

352
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:59,640
your all the group is invited and oh gosh it cannot end soon enough like you

353
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:05,520
don't like I I don't like those I mean I I end up enjoying it at the end but it

354
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:12,420
takes me like a week of preparation there's something about all those things I just don't want to be seen in that

355
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:21,780
context we don't want to be seen please Earth open up and eat me up is so is it

356
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:27,240
in a way is and I mean you can read more about it but I thought that maybe that

357
00:57:27,240 --> 00:57:35,160
give us a little bit of a sense sometimes we want to be seen and it's part of our nature isn't it we

358
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:41,520
we live in communities we belong in communities we want not belong and

359
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:48,780
sometimes we don't want to um yeah sometimes we just don't want to be

360
00:57:48,780 --> 00:57:54,319
we want to be there I want to be mindful of times

361
00:57:54,319 --> 00:58:00,240
okay whatever yeah so what I wanted to see sometimes

362
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:07,800
when we talk about the clinging and thirst and the hunger and

363
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:12,900
all that it sounds like like addictions toward desires it sounds like very major

364
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:19,800
isn't it but it's not we see it every day it's in our daily

365
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:24,839
life is I don't like this chair I wish I had I

366
00:58:24,839 --> 00:58:31,079
don't know what it's it's in it's the little things that sometimes

367
00:58:31,079 --> 00:58:39,299
can make a difference in a in a daily life in a daily day in our life

368
00:58:39,299 --> 00:58:46,619
um last week I was going the conference for work and I wanted to see the talks

369
00:58:46,619 --> 00:58:53,460
that day and our water heater broke so and so when they fix it and then they

370
00:58:53,460 --> 00:58:59,220
had to shut off the gas and then the area here the heating system in the

371
00:58:59,220 --> 00:59:04,500
house just died so I couldn't go to my it was like oh my

372
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:09,960
gosh she's like that does can I bring my practice into that and I think I heard

373
00:59:09,960 --> 00:59:15,660
them okay I was like okay I wasn't too miserable but it's in our daily life

374
00:59:15,660 --> 00:59:24,299
it's every day is in traffic is coming here is going home all it's yeah

375
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:29,700
so don't don't think that because okay maybe I don't have those addictions but

376
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:36,780
think little think in the Small Things what bothered you this morning where is

377
00:59:36,780 --> 00:59:43,440
where can I see those ideas those that clingy dancers what is

378
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:52,319
it that is coming from and what is the suffering it's not big big suffering still some I'm very annoyed by it and

379
00:59:52,319 --> 00:59:58,140
that doesn't feel good so I'll stop there

380
00:59:58,140 --> 01:00:04,680
thank you thank you so um one of the things I was thinking

381
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:10,680
about was um the what is clinging you know when it's

382
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:17,400
more subtle what does it feel like or when it's around something that's still sort of pleasant

383
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:24,599
right oh I'm gonna buy that thing and I you know

384
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:31,079
push the purchase button right and or I'm thinking about what I want to

385
01:00:31,079 --> 01:00:37,319
buy right and it's that that you know there can be something you like and then

386
01:00:37,319 --> 01:00:42,540
there's this like and you can oh it's pretty it's nice and then there's something that comes in

387
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:50,940
that's a little like sneaky and it it that kind of um puts you into

388
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:56,520
an automatic pilot mode I feel like I get disconnected from my

389
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:03,359
present moment when I get in caught in that kind of wanting something so there's there's the

390
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:08,700
hunger right for a piece of you know peanut butter rice cake or whatever it

391
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:15,180
is and I'm hungry and I need to eat and that's fine and that's great but

392
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:22,859
there's something then if I get clinging to it I get fixated on it it's like I the word that comes to mind

393
01:01:22,859 --> 01:01:30,059
is like being in an elevator right like I'm no longer really connected to my experience I'm more like on a ride

394
01:01:30,059 --> 01:01:35,099
does that make sense there's a way that we can get kind of

395
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:41,700
hot in it and we get disconnected actually from ourselves and from the present moment and even from the peanut

396
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:48,500
butter rice cake we might be eating it but we're not really tasting it because we're in this

397
01:01:48,500 --> 01:01:54,680
craving right so um

398
01:01:55,380 --> 01:02:01,260
I wanted to sort of you know talk about it in that subtle way too and how it

399
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:07,020
disconnects us you know when we get into that clinging we're we're grabbing onto

400
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:14,940
something and really there's nothing we can grab onto truthfully right we can't really grab make anything

401
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:21,660
permanent or stay the way it is or become what we wanted it will or it won't it's it's

402
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:26,960
sort of its own thing but there's that struggle that we get caught in that

403
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:32,099
brings us into relationship with the world that's actually really quite

404
01:02:32,099 --> 01:02:37,619
disconnected from the present moment the world ourselves

405
01:02:37,619 --> 01:02:43,079
so noticing what it is whether it's that

406
01:02:43,079 --> 01:02:48,420
tension or tightness right in our bodies when we're clinging it's that's a huge

407
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:54,480
cue to me but it also is a sense of disconnection that is acute to me that

408
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,700
I'm clinging so that's inherent

409
01:02:59,700 --> 01:03:05,339
that's inherent in the clinging so getting to know what how it manifests

410
01:03:05,339 --> 01:03:11,059
for you when you are grabbing on um

411
01:03:11,059 --> 01:03:17,220
so that's that's like get really curious about it in the subtle little Way start

412
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:22,380
to study it I think we all know pretty much the big ways I really want that job

413
01:03:22,380 --> 01:03:28,680
damn it that was my car you know what it whatever it is like there's the big ways

414
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:35,099
we know that right we get upset about it and but the little ways are subtle and

415
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:42,420
Insidious and they can just permeate our lives and pull us away with our

416
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:49,079
my phone's not out right but this constant hold to the phone to the phone and then

417
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:55,380
there you know it's like oh I'm lost again right it's that word I'm using today is the elevator

418
01:03:55,380 --> 01:04:01,980
feeling you get in an elevator you push the button and you're on the ride right and you're stuck but it's kind of like

419
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:07,319
that enveloping feeling of um being consumed by something and then you get

420
01:04:07,319 --> 01:04:14,880
out you know okay oh okay I'm off you know so get to know what that is for

421
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:20,059
you and these small small ways not just the big ways

422
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:26,640
be curious curiosity is your is your friend when it comes to working with

423
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,160
duka with clinging it's the you know understanding the

424
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:37,920
cause of why we're suffering that clinging we've got to be curious what am

425
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:44,160
I clinging to it might be that I'm clinging to the idea that I'm going to feel better because I don't feel very

426
01:04:44,160 --> 01:04:52,260
good for some reason or I'm anxious or I'm afraid right or I don't like myself today

427
01:04:52,260 --> 01:04:57,780
so that's that part we need to sort of

428
01:04:57,780 --> 01:05:03,359
you know get curious about and soften around be gentle with yourself

429
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:11,280
you're human and you know Sandra said this but it it is this is the condition

430
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:16,920
we wouldn't survive we wouldn't be alive if we weren't hungry

431
01:05:16,920 --> 01:05:23,160
it's part of life all life is consuming all the time little amiibos you know

432
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:28,680
amoebas you know everything is consuming and that's that's part of it but how do

433
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:35,760
we be conscious consumers of life how do we be awake

434
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:42,000
and not try and get more than we need take what we

435
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:47,839
don't deserve or you know get in this battle

436
01:05:48,420 --> 01:05:54,119
so a gentleness a softness a curiosity around it

437
01:05:54,119 --> 01:06:00,180
seeing that it's normal don't make yourself a bad person

438
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:06,180
around us and um

439
01:06:06,180 --> 01:06:12,839
really pay attention to the times your desire leads to well-being

440
01:06:12,839 --> 01:06:18,660
versus pain or more difficulty that's a huge cue

441
01:06:18,660 --> 01:06:26,760
to you to notice when we're kind of getting caught in an unskillful Direction versus a wholesome Direction

442
01:06:26,760 --> 01:06:33,660
but but we've gotta stay awake long enough we'll get on the elevator we're in the

443
01:06:33,660 --> 01:06:40,680
space we get off and then we're off to the next thing but don't run away so quick

444
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:48,240
pause check in oh how did I feel when I got on the elevator do I even remember

445
01:06:48,240 --> 01:06:55,579
and what's what am I how am I feeling now do I feel better do I feel more hungry do I feel

446
01:06:55,579 --> 01:07:02,760
disconcerted what you know what what's happening for me here before I run off to the next thing because it it is

447
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:08,099
relentless you know this

448
01:07:08,099 --> 01:07:14,960
consuming energy so let me um

449
01:07:15,420 --> 01:07:19,400
see if there's anything else I want to say

450
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:31,400
oh yeah I think that I'll just say moving away from suffering and toward liberation

451
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:36,680
requires us to let go of unskillful actions

452
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:42,200
unskillful thoughts and unskillful intentions

453
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:49,460
what helps us let go is seeing that they cause us suffering

454
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:58,160
that really helps us let go to see how it's hurting where it leads us

455
01:07:58,319 --> 01:08:04,980
taking the path toward freedom requires us to take responsibility for

456
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:10,859
our thoughts attitudes and behaviors it's really helpful to ask is this

457
01:08:10,859 --> 01:08:19,040
serving or harming myself or others is it serving or harming

458
01:08:20,219 --> 01:08:26,160
whom in the last moment before we moved to

459
01:08:26,160 --> 01:08:32,219
small group kind of conversation anything that I could say that would be

460
01:08:32,219 --> 01:08:39,980
clarifying or helpful was I clear

461
01:08:40,259 --> 01:08:45,258
yes and Rose just find a mic please

462
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:51,660
it's on so like the moment where you talked about Tanya the elevator like how

463
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:59,219
do you know when you're con because I know I'm I'm stepping into that elevator multiple times a day yes indeed you know

464
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:05,338
but I'd like to I'd like to get out you know yes

465
01:09:05,339 --> 01:09:12,960
yeah so um I think that the the

466
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:19,500
so you're asking how do I know I'm getting on the elevator essentially like you're asking for how

467
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:26,758
do I stop myself from getting on the elevator yeah well I think for me it's starting

468
01:09:26,759 --> 01:09:34,338
to wake up when I'm probably already on the elevator or getting off the elevator it starts late or not at the beginning

469
01:09:34,339 --> 01:09:39,960
that's what I would say for me not all the time but over time it's waking up

470
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:45,120
and then pausing when it's happened giving myself enough space to the mind

471
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:50,778
to consciously acknowledge oh I just did it again

472
01:09:50,819 --> 01:09:55,980
you know okay how does that feel okay and then in in when I have the energy to

473
01:09:55,980 --> 01:10:02,040
even go like okay can I go back another step what happened right before I I got

474
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:08,280
caught what was going on for me and I may or may not have an answer but being curious

475
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:14,820
about it actually starting to teach the mind to pay attention

476
01:10:14,820 --> 01:10:20,640
and so we start to grow our interest and our mind starts to just tune into these

477
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:25,800
things and then we start to combine and couple oh wanting this with the pain

478
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:31,739
afterwards because we've consciously connected the two does that make sense okay thank you

479
01:10:31,739 --> 01:10:37,520
thank you that um

480
01:10:37,980 --> 01:10:45,780
we we have habits we have patterns and yes we we have to

481
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:52,440
catch ourselves I don't know how many times when we're leaving the elevator but at least we're

482
01:10:52,440 --> 01:11:00,600
catching ourselves and then maybe we start identifying like oh I tend to do this so in a way kind of

483
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:05,880
start making mental no like a little pasta that when I get there I know I

484
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:13,380
need to pay attention it's like right now um holiday season shopping

485
01:11:13,380 --> 01:11:18,719
be very aware like you like you go to the websites

486
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:25,080
where you're gonna find your gifts it's like um order early because Transportation

487
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:30,480
blah blah I mean the world out there wants you to be

488
01:11:30,480 --> 01:11:36,000
very thirsty and very clingy so okay so

489
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:43,760
I need to pay attention when these things happen and we need to get caught many times before we notice that's

490
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:52,040
that's the way it is that's the only way we learn oh yeah I like that

491
01:11:56,640 --> 01:12:02,219
um when you were talking and something that you know a lot of people can relate to you're talking about like taking out

492
01:12:02,219 --> 01:12:08,100
your phone and being kind of like addicted to it and stuff like that and it made me think a lot about like

493
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:13,920
just triggers and how we like deal with triggers and not necessarily like it could be

494
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:21,000
like big triggers or even just like little things that trigger us down this like negative rabbit hole

495
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:27,000
um I guess my question is around like in some ways you know the advice is like

496
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:33,659
we should remove those triggers so like don't use social media for example is like the obvious one that we hear a lot

497
01:12:33,659 --> 01:12:39,420
or um I mean sometimes the triggers can even come from like books or like talking to certain people or like

498
01:12:39,420 --> 01:12:47,159
watching certain TV shows and stuff and um sometimes it makes me also wonder like

499
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:53,460
is removing all triggers like I mean obviously in certain cases where

500
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:59,880
there's more serious effects involved like PTSD and things like that is it I would say a different scenario but for

501
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:06,540
like smaller triggers is removing them helpful or is like

502
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:13,920
being able to not go down the negative rabbit hole when you see that trigger

503
01:13:13,920 --> 01:13:19,500
does that serve you better or is there like no right answer I don't

504
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:26,940
know yeah do you mind if I answer this one all right yeah it's a really important question

505
01:13:26,940 --> 01:13:32,760
um so there are times but this call this

506
01:13:32,760 --> 01:13:38,400
does call for discernment which is what you're pointing to there are times when removing the

507
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:46,080
triggers are possible and necessary but we can't do that with everything

508
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:51,300
it's not possible and and that one of the things that I

509
01:13:51,300 --> 01:13:56,460
had sort of suggested in the guided meditation was

510
01:13:56,460 --> 01:14:03,960
you know can we just stand next to something the trigger whatever it is can we

511
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:09,620
imagine being alongside it and not collapsing and not

512
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:16,860
rigidifying either and you know just sort of that's

513
01:14:16,860 --> 01:14:24,600
something to practice and that's what we're doing in meditation we're we're cultivating the capacity to

514
01:14:24,600 --> 01:14:30,719
to be uninvolved to allow things to come up and go and

515
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:37,080
move through us and just like realize actually it will all kind of come through and go on if I just can sit here

516
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:42,780
I'll be okay but it's getting up and running off and fighting with this and that and trying to do this and that that

517
01:14:42,780 --> 01:14:47,940
gets us in trouble so discernment is necessary we can't get

518
01:14:47,940 --> 01:14:54,179
rid of all the triggers in fact triggers aren't you know triggers are really just associations

519
01:14:54,179 --> 01:15:00,239
and our brain is an association organ prediction organ it just that's what it

520
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:05,760
we've got this you know library of experiences that our brain pulls on to

521
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:11,340
associate and so it's not possible but let me say one more quick thing here

522
01:15:11,340 --> 01:15:17,640
which is we can work on also adding what we're associating we can add things like

523
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:23,760
if we have a trigger we can start to build other experiences around that

524
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:32,040
resourcing experiences positive experiences empowerment experiences recognizing oh I can sit next to this

525
01:15:32,040 --> 01:15:38,840
and it's not going to kill me kind of thing okay

526
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:53,640
so oh I'm sorry oh you talk about this clinginess and

527
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:59,760
the um the elevator uh experience

528
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:05,100
um have you come across people who

529
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:10,620
um like in that same sense about who try

530
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:15,780
to be like God like or

531
01:16:15,780 --> 01:16:23,540
um like I can give an example that let's say who are always kind of in this

532
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:28,800
clinginess or elevator experience they are always measuring

533
01:16:28,800 --> 01:16:36,420
that this person uh did a sashtang pranam to me sashtang

534
01:16:36,420 --> 01:16:41,520
is essentially all it um you know

535
01:16:41,520 --> 01:16:49,159
body parts touching the ground that is a way of like bowing to someone

536
01:16:49,159 --> 01:16:55,920
whereas she or he did not even touch my feet or whatever that is like a one form

537
01:16:55,920 --> 01:17:04,920
of salutation um so uh and like uh so like I said this she or he does not

538
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:11,640
love or respect or whatever whereas this person so constantly like you know in

539
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:16,739
this like how I view this this is like you know in the massive pyramid that's

540
01:17:16,739 --> 01:17:24,600
like that low self-esteem like they're constantly evaluating in

541
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:33,179
this elevator sense or you know I I don't have this respect I don't have this that the

542
01:17:33,179 --> 01:17:39,920
eating thing or thirst or whatever the constantly looking for that

543
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:47,280
satisfying that have I presented my question or the I think you're talking

544
01:17:47,280 --> 01:17:52,380
about somebody who's hungry for being seen or feeling better or they're

545
01:17:52,380 --> 01:17:58,500
they're constantly comparing and and judging yeah and yeah and it's like like

546
01:17:58,500 --> 01:18:05,179
that you know it's like the uncontrollable tongue which is like

547
01:18:05,179 --> 01:18:10,760
uncontrollable you know the speech speech oh

548
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:16,460
there are many ways that those things happen

549
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:24,719
like always trying to be very well dressed and very nice hair and the last

550
01:18:24,719 --> 01:18:30,600
I mean there are many ways that we can express that and I think is

551
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:36,179
what we're trying to do ourselves we can do the work ourselves isn't it we

552
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:44,699
cannot do the work for others um and uh and it's hard to notice it it's

553
01:18:44,699 --> 01:18:51,659
there's a lot of conditioning that has gone into that so I think the best we can do is do it

554
01:18:51,659 --> 01:18:57,420
for ourselves [Music] try to teach it to other people I think

555
01:18:57,420 --> 01:19:04,380
you need to be there at the right moment probably will happen it could happen but

556
01:19:04,380 --> 01:19:11,940
um yeah it's like the person that doesn't want to be seen that wants to be invisible

557
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:19,440
and maybe I don't know so in some way I think we all may be

558
01:19:19,440 --> 01:19:26,219
able to relate to that there's been moments in our life where we we just don't want to be there we don't want to

559
01:19:26,219 --> 01:19:33,840
be put on the spot we want to be invisible oh so but it's hard to notice it it takes

560
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:40,080
courage to do it um yeah

561
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:46,400
that does that make sense yeah yeah well I mean it's essentially yeah I mean I'm

562
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:52,199
officially hold your makeup in smaller circles you know it kind of when we are

563
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:58,260
operating in a very small circle of people let's say we are like I mean we

564
01:19:58,260 --> 01:20:04,020
are I guess we don't have a choice of

565
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:11,040
uh not being far away and which means that so I have to be I

566
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:18,060
have been in Bali so I am more Superior to this person I have been in seeing

567
01:20:18,060 --> 01:20:24,080
this pyramid so I'm super well traveled and whatnot so it's

568
01:20:24,080 --> 01:20:31,679
uh it's I just wanted to make that presentation I mean because I am unable

569
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:41,400
to uh comprehend sometimes that that thirst or

570
01:20:41,400 --> 01:20:46,500
hunger to or that you know that

571
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:51,719
Godly status you know that it's it's really a

572
01:20:51,719 --> 01:20:57,120
clinging to an identity you know it's just we all it's whether you want to be

573
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:03,300
dressed up Identity or you want to be smarter than other people's Identity or you want to be better because you've

574
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:08,940
traveled more places like it's all identity those are it's very and we're trying to

575
01:21:08,940 --> 01:21:16,080
make ourselves create some self that's Elusive and vulnerable so it doesn't

576
01:21:16,080 --> 01:21:22,620
really work so we but we keep trying right and so it sounds like somebody's you're describing is very uncomfortable

577
01:21:22,620 --> 01:21:29,460
person and trying to make themselves better or trying to make other people feel bad to make themselves feel better

578
01:21:29,460 --> 01:21:35,360
I'm not sure which way it is but it's it's uh clinging to an identity right

579
01:21:35,360 --> 01:21:40,860
yeah and and also when we satisfy those

580
01:21:40,860 --> 01:21:48,060
desires when we achieve those things the satisfaction the the well-being lasts a

581
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:53,940
little bit is not it's not the happiness it's just a

582
01:21:53,940 --> 01:21:59,760
moment and when that clinging it's um

583
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:05,280
it keeps kind of reinforcing itself because we need more of it more of it

584
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:11,340
and more of it to be well so yeah

585
01:22:11,340 --> 01:22:17,120
so should we yeah let's go to the well I think we need to uh

586
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:23,280
consider maybe maybe you want to choose you know one of these things that we can

587
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:31,260
just discuss it here yeah maybe because yeah we can't really do the breakout groups exactly okay so what I would like

588
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:36,840
you to invite so yeah you know that's a good idea Richard he just suggested having everybody

589
01:22:36,840 --> 01:22:43,400
Circle up for this part yeah do you guys mind coming and we'll just do kind of yeah

590
01:22:53,820 --> 01:22:59,580
this day off the Blue Line because that's the camera just yeah there you go

591
01:22:59,580 --> 01:23:06,780
thank you all right so I'm gonna Maybe

592
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:14,280
read some things like ask you invite you to think of something in your life and see

593
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:19,860
what comes up and perhaps something that we didn't touch too much was

594
01:23:19,860 --> 01:23:25,500
um about the satisfaction that we get out of it so

595
01:23:25,500 --> 01:23:33,900
so think of a moment and try to maybe something recent today this week

596
01:23:33,900 --> 01:23:38,940
um so you so now you can see in retrospect

597
01:23:38,940 --> 01:23:44,400
that wow that was a moment where I felt that that thirst that hunger that

598
01:23:44,400 --> 01:23:51,420
craving for something and you were able to get it you got what

599
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:57,300
you wanted things weren't on the way you wanted it like that's the way you cut it

600
01:23:57,300 --> 01:24:04,860
so I would invite you to think about um how did it feel to get it

601
01:24:04,860 --> 01:24:13,860
and did it last and perhaps did it open you for more it

602
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:22,620
didn't make you thirstier for more so that's that's one thing

603
01:24:22,620 --> 01:24:29,460
and also so not to be so focused on the first part of the clinging Parts maybe

604
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:36,540
you can also think of a moment even a small thing where you were able to

605
01:24:36,540 --> 01:24:42,060
let go to let things be to be content to

606
01:24:42,060 --> 01:24:47,159
what was happening and how does that feel

607
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:54,000
even a small thing how does it feel how does how does it feel in the body

608
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:59,000
and like if you could contrast both

609
01:24:59,280 --> 01:25:02,480
what do you see

610
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:11,820
and see so let's let's take those two if anybody would like to

611
01:25:11,820 --> 01:25:18,360
anybody have an example I could share a little one I'll just to help you get started if you need the

612
01:25:18,360 --> 01:25:24,060
help so I I need new glasses

613
01:25:24,060 --> 01:25:32,520
and um you know my prescription changed right and um so

614
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:37,679
you know if you wear glasses it's like oh my God what frame what color what you

615
01:25:37,679 --> 01:25:43,800
know the wheat you know plastic or the nose things all these things right

616
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:50,580
and so um I I last pair of glasses this pair have been okay I don't love them but

617
01:25:50,580 --> 01:25:56,820
they're okay you know and so it's like and I've gotten a few pair that I really didn't like so I was like okay I gotta

618
01:25:56,820 --> 01:26:05,400
really try a lot of different glasses here and then I ordered some try on at home glasses and I ordered some of the I

619
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:10,560
actually ordered them and I didn't like them and I took them back and

620
01:26:10,560 --> 01:26:15,719
so all this like energy and trying on looking well taking pictures what do you

621
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:21,000
think of this one and then I was like you know I have this old pair of glasses

622
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:28,199
that I really like a lot and from when I finally settled on just

623
01:26:28,199 --> 01:26:35,059
using that frame and getting new glasses it was like oh

624
01:26:35,880 --> 01:26:42,179
that was contentment I was like such a relief rather than that seeking

625
01:26:42,179 --> 01:26:47,219
the trying to find the right pair so I don't blow it again right and end up

626
01:26:47,219 --> 01:26:54,840
with glasses I hate and hurt my nose or whatever but it but why didn't I think why why wasn't that the first choice I

627
01:26:54,840 --> 01:26:59,540
don't know but and then I got there thank God

628
01:26:59,940 --> 01:27:08,059
hmm anybody else wanna share something

629
01:27:08,940 --> 01:27:11,540
great

630
01:27:16,620 --> 01:27:25,020
um I don't know if I have an example oh sorry I don't know if I have an example for both um never mind but one thing that

631
01:27:25,020 --> 01:27:32,219
um so recently I've been taking a break from working and I'm taking some classes one of them I'm taking is in Ceramics

632
01:27:32,219 --> 01:27:37,980
which is something I love doing and is like um

633
01:27:37,980 --> 01:27:43,020
it's been great and I definitely have felt like a new feeling of like I'm

634
01:27:43,020 --> 01:27:48,480
excited to like wake up at 7am and go to class and on a weekday which is like I

635
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:56,340
don't think I've ever felt that way before um and so that's been great but I I think it's

636
01:27:56,340 --> 01:28:04,500
something about what we were saying where it's like we have the clinging even when it's something good and I find myself sometimes like in

637
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:11,520
class and like this is what I've been looking forward to like all weekend and I'm here and then I just get into this mode of

638
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:17,639
like I need to like do everything and I need to like like you know get as much as I can done and I

639
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:24,000
need to like make sure I finish all these pieces and then I'm like oh my God like stop breathing normally and I'm

640
01:28:24,000 --> 01:28:30,719
trying to get everything done on time even though it's like something I really enjoy doing yeah

641
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:36,540
um and I like don't let myself take a break and so uh I've been trying to be better about

642
01:28:36,540 --> 01:28:43,860
that and like stop and be like I don't have to get all this done right now and I should like make sure I'm

643
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:50,658
actually enjoying what I came here to do um so yeah

644
01:28:51,060 --> 01:28:57,300
I'm full of both you you notice and and he's like I need to enjoy this so in a

645
01:28:57,300 --> 01:29:04,020
way it's like letting go so yeah that's that's very good thank you

646
01:29:04,020 --> 01:29:09,239
yeah as you were talking I didn't I had that in you know in the airport they

647
01:29:09,239 --> 01:29:15,420
have those flat escalators where you know you get on it's like being on that

648
01:29:15,420 --> 01:29:21,420
thing right you're pulling your you know you're getting really fast and is that what you're describing right maybe

649
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:27,420
you're in this doing this great thing but somehow you're like crabbing reaching trying to get next next and you

650
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:33,420
lose it's like going by so fast you're not even there yeah you're not even enjoying

651
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:39,900
it anymore yeah because the mind this is where the mind that's why I feel like the elevator

652
01:29:39,900 --> 01:29:46,800
escalator thing it's like we stop being here we get in this head we're imagining

653
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:52,620
things we we're imagining what we want and then we're relating to that instead

654
01:29:52,620 --> 01:29:58,320
of what's this this yeah

655
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:04,260
it makes me think too of um the frame of mind so she stopped working in the

656
01:30:04,260 --> 01:30:12,540
company because she wanted to go more into cultivating her spiritual life and such and it was so confusing for her

657
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:19,620
because um like she was saying it's like when the work we do is we are so overwhelmed

658
01:30:19,620 --> 01:30:26,400
all the time than when we have a break like we all we only know overwhelm or

659
01:30:26,400 --> 01:30:32,400
vacation we don't know anything in between so she would say like she didn't know

660
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:39,239
what to like I have time I I don't know it was very yeah

661
01:30:39,239 --> 01:30:44,420
yeah and then like okay no little by little I mean it took time but yeah

662
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:49,800
it we we need to relearn to enjoy

663
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:55,980
maybe that was like also yeah that's also a good example we're like yeah when I left I was like I was not having a great time at the company I was working

664
01:30:55,980 --> 01:31:01,980
at and I was like once I quit my life is going to be amazing like all my anxiety is going to go away and I'm just gonna

665
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:07,860
live like the best life ever and at least like temporarily you know and then when I quit I was like why do I feel

666
01:31:07,860 --> 01:31:14,580
worse than when I did before because it's like now I have more mental space to worry about right all the other

667
01:31:14,580 --> 01:31:22,260
things in my life that I was like probably not thinking much about when I was working so yeah

668
01:31:22,260 --> 01:31:27,960
um I don't know if I understood the question correctly but I think the way I'm trying to interpret it is

669
01:31:27,960 --> 01:31:33,600
um not taking so much um like catastrophizing of things and just noticing that there's no permanence

670
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:39,719
whether things are really horrible or really great you know that will come to an end and I'm like you know sort of

671
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:45,000
transfer to one one extreme or the other and just trying to be okay with going

672
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:51,060
through the motions and knowing that it'll change either for the worst or you know for the best again and just trying

673
01:31:51,060 --> 01:31:56,580
to be able to like navigate that more more regularly and sort of contently

674
01:31:56,580 --> 01:32:03,420
yeah it's to avoid the the addiction for it I mean the desire the one they have

675
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:11,520
in it and okay it's calm you got it enjoy it let it go it's gone like no not

676
01:32:11,520 --> 01:32:16,679
fall into that cycle on that more and more like yeah so

677
01:32:16,679 --> 01:32:23,159
sometimes I'll notice myself sort of going down like a spiral of catastrophe oh this is so horrible now now I'll lose

678
01:32:23,159 --> 01:32:28,380
my job and my car will break down I'll end up on the streets and homeless and or something like that but I'm trying to

679
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:35,580
maybe more so find a way to if I have learned that behavior or mental way of thinking how can I become my best

680
01:32:35,580 --> 01:32:40,620
cheerleader instead of being my my worst critic and trying to cultivate that more

681
01:32:40,620 --> 01:32:46,739
into not having such a clinginess to either you know something catastrophizing or even something great

682
01:32:46,739 --> 01:32:52,620
that is going wonderful yeah and I think it takes courage for us to face those

683
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:59,639
things because it probably is coming from something that happened maybe when

684
01:32:59,639 --> 01:33:04,679
we were children's or something like that isn't it like okay why is that like

685
01:33:04,679 --> 01:33:10,620
I know my catastrophizing I know like but it's taken me a long time to even

686
01:33:10,620 --> 01:33:16,739
see in it like like why am I going like what where is this coming from and

687
01:33:16,739 --> 01:33:22,500
getting curious what Tanya was saying curiosity and but with that kindness

688
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:30,960
with that softness isn't it where where is this coming from and like naming the dragon so it loses

689
01:33:30,960 --> 01:33:34,698
its power in a way

690
01:33:43,520 --> 01:33:47,300
I'm not sure it's on

691
01:33:50,040 --> 01:33:58,020
you talk about the enjoying each moment or taking time to have be with each

692
01:33:58,020 --> 01:34:03,120
moment and since you talked about that you are a scientist I also wanted to

693
01:34:03,120 --> 01:34:09,060
talk about this concept of time dilation or sour like sometimes people even in

694
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:14,219
poetry they talk about you know time seems to have Frozen which means like if

695
01:34:14,219 --> 01:34:22,500
people are having a good time then they say that you know it's like the time has dilated our time has just

696
01:34:22,500 --> 01:34:27,659
stopped and they just want to be in that moment so I

697
01:34:27,659 --> 01:34:33,000
um can give two examples um one let's say going back to the

698
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:40,380
mountains uh like Swiss Alps which reminds me very much of you know James

699
01:34:40,380 --> 01:34:46,560
James spawn 007 and you know you're like Shelton and Lotter brunon and those

700
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:53,100
places and just I mean time I mean last the session before last I had also talked

701
01:34:53,100 --> 01:35:00,719
about like someone like Gregory Peck of Indian Cinema uh like there are some pictures from

702
01:35:00,719 --> 01:35:08,219
that though those places so when I have traveled to those places the time just

703
01:35:08,219 --> 01:35:13,739
seems to have stopped I I like Zurich and burn and all those places you know

704
01:35:13,739 --> 01:35:22,800
the uh I I still can feel that joy and happiness that I had

705
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:32,460
um and like in the immediate present uh I have to make some presentation for

706
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:38,120
some teaching some music talk about some music so

707
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:43,620
every small breaks I have so I I listen to some pieces

708
01:35:43,620 --> 01:35:49,860
I will prepare some um and then you know maybe make some notes or something

709
01:35:49,860 --> 01:35:57,840
ah for me those times you know they they just stop then and there it's like the time has

710
01:35:57,840 --> 01:36:07,440
stopped that those uh pieces I'm enjoying so much that uh whether now or in in my sleep or

711
01:36:07,440 --> 01:36:15,139
you know I'm I'm kind of enjoying that even if that moment of

712
01:36:15,139 --> 01:36:22,199
presenting to my audience has not yet come but even while I'm being prepared

713
01:36:22,199 --> 01:36:27,300
I am enjoying that moment so that comment about being happy in every

714
01:36:27,300 --> 01:36:33,420
moment or essentially um dilating the

715
01:36:33,420 --> 01:36:40,500
time even if the time is like only you know short duration

716
01:36:40,500 --> 01:36:47,400
but it can be prolonged that it can be like eons or Aegis or whatever

717
01:36:47,400 --> 01:36:55,199
so to to bring us to that conscious that is uh I don't know if I am ah that

718
01:36:55,199 --> 01:37:00,360
is how I I want us to feel and I I try

719
01:37:00,360 --> 01:37:06,540
to view things that way so I've given two examples one of like

720
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:12,260
you know the being in the mountains and

721
01:37:14,280 --> 01:37:19,800
I I guess I would just say this uh you know it's a very philosophical

722
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:27,239
question but also time is a concept and there are ways of stepping out of

723
01:37:27,239 --> 01:37:32,880
conceptual time to not be relating to life in that same

724
01:37:32,880 --> 01:37:40,620
framework in the practice I think it's possible to have experiences but the main thing is

725
01:37:40,620 --> 01:37:45,840
that I think the the the absence of clinging

726
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:51,560
the absence of clinging is a spacious feeling

727
01:37:51,560 --> 01:37:57,659
everything there's so much generosity in it everything can just be

728
01:37:57,659 --> 01:38:02,699
we don't want the tree to be closer or different or there's there's just so

729
01:38:02,699 --> 01:38:09,540
much generosity and and so that also has that timelessness feeling so I don't

730
01:38:09,540 --> 01:38:16,500
know how else to answer you but I think it's a great thing to question our relationship with time and and notice

731
01:38:16,500 --> 01:38:22,520
how we're relating to what's happening affects our sense of time

732
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:29,699
does that feel like enough I think we need to shift it's actually about time to end so

733
01:38:29,699 --> 01:38:37,860
um time to do our dedication of Merit yeah

734
01:38:37,860 --> 01:38:43,500
so um so coming here together with definitely

735
01:38:43,500 --> 01:38:51,719
I we hope that is of benefit for you but also to keep in mind that what we do

736
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:57,420
here benefit the people around us our families our

737
01:38:57,420 --> 01:39:03,000
friends the people that we cross in the street we we get out and like we're thinking

738
01:39:03,000 --> 01:39:09,179
about these things that has being here today has repercussions

739
01:39:09,179 --> 01:39:16,860
and um it's not only we we don't only do it

740
01:39:16,860 --> 01:39:24,719
because it's nice but really to maybe share this with other beings with all

741
01:39:24,719 --> 01:39:33,540
beings um and a practice that Tania introduced me

742
01:39:33,540 --> 01:39:39,239
to is we we forget it's easy to forget the the

743
01:39:39,239 --> 01:39:44,940
pain the suffering that is out there isn't it and sometimes if we can bring

744
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:51,179
some of it into our minds and maybe offer the benefit of the

745
01:39:51,179 --> 01:39:59,040
practice today to those people to those causes to those

746
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:05,880
countries to whatever it is that can open your heart

747
01:40:05,880 --> 01:40:12,120
so I don't think we're gonna circulate the microphone today but maybe bring it in

748
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:18,540
in your mind and bring it to your heart and May

749
01:40:18,540 --> 01:40:24,600
the benefit of our practice today be shared

750
01:40:24,600 --> 01:40:32,760
with every being that everybody every being is free of

751
01:40:32,760 --> 01:40:38,880
suffering and its causes and that every being may live

752
01:40:38,880 --> 01:40:45,990
