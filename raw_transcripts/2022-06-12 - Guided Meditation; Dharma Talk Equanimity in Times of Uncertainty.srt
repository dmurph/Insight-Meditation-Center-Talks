11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,560
is not to lead a long meditation but rather to invite you

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:16,799

13
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,400
just be here just breathe

14
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:29,920

00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:27,000
give yourself over to just sinking into this moment

19
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:55,040
as you sit here recall this is what it is to be this person

20
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,160
in this moment

21
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:09,200
this is this person sitting here

22
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:16,200
being here this person

23
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,200
this body

24
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:04,320
as you're sitting here bring together all the threads of your

25
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,799
experience into just breathing here

26
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,880
all the threads of your thoughts just here bring them into the center of

27
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:30,640
your body and feel this person this is what it's like to be this person

28
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:33,679

29
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:39,799
nothing else

30
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,679
just breathe

31
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:48,880
after this time there may be some stillness in your body

32
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:57,279
twitches pains irritations but the not moving through space

33
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:05,360
stillness be aware of that stillness

34
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:12,679
the body is still

35
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,000
no stillness

36
00:36:45,690 --> 00:36:56,078
[Music]

37
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:05,760
welcome welcome welcome welcome to now

38
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:09,400
welcome to here

39
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:18,640
what i want to talk about this morning is equanimity

40
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:26,240
and actually the original title of my talk was equanimity in times of uncertainty

41
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:33,119
and as i looked at that title this morning i realized that uncertainty was not in my thoughts

42
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:39,839
it really wasn't about uncertainty it was about what is equanimity

43
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,960
what is it what we mean when we say i would like to be equanimous

44
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:51,400
i would like to realize equanimity in my life

45
00:37:55,040 --> 00:38:00,079
before i begin i want i want to give a thank you

46
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:06,800
to the people that i have met who participate in the

47
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:13,359
online dharma practice groups because their questions and their

48
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:19,839
comments and inviting me into their practice in their lives stimulates

49
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:25,280
thoughts reflections their words reverberate

50
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,119
in my mind and in my practice

51
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:38,000
and i've thought about that in terms of equanimity when i woke up this morning

52
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:43,280
i thought what is it that i really really want to say

53
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,960
you know i had a private a long prepared talk with all kinds of things in it but what i really want is for everyone to

54
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:56,240
understand what equanimity means

55
00:38:56,240 --> 00:39:03,440
in life why why do we value it what is what's important about it

56
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:15,040
i'm going to give you a quote from gil it was um in an article he wrote about equanimity

57
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:23,200
equanimity one of the most sublime emotions of buddhist practice is the ground for wisdom and freedom

58
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:28,640
and the protector of compassion and love

59
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:36,079
one of the most sublime emotions of buddhist practice is the ground for wisdom and freedom

60
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:42,440
and the protector of compassion and love

61
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:50,320
equanimity when seen this way it's it's less a state to be achieved

62
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,560
but a way of being with our experience it it it is

63
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:03,920
a way of being and not something that smooths over

64
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:09,920
how we are what our experiences are there's there's a supplement a

65
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:16,640
suppleness to equanimity equanimity is not rigid

66
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:23,440
it is not defined in terms of these are the characteristics where you know okay

67
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:29,200
you're there it really is a way

68
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:37,440
of just meeting experience and what is it that allows us to meet experience and not be

69
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:41,838
blown away by whatever that experience is

70
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:49,440
one of the things we think about equanimity is that it's most accessible on retreat right you're going to get

71
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:56,480
calm you settle into your meditation and everything is beginning to get rosy

72
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:04,000
or not or you're experiencing an aversion retreat or but the equanimity

73
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:09,920
is what arises and you say aha now that none of this is bothering me

74
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:14,799
i can be in this state of evenness

75
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:22,880
but you know equanimity shows up in all kinds of buddhist lists you know it it's in the the seven

76
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:28,000
factors of enlightenment and the four brahmaviharas and the ten perimes

77
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:33,280
and it's the fourth giant factor of concentration

78
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:38,560
and the thing about equanimity is it comes after mindfulness

79
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:46,318
comes after concentration it comes after joy after tranquility

80
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:54,960
comes after all of these things we practice toward and the qualities of equanimity have to

81
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,559
do with presence with the experience

82
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:09,599
presence clarity and ease a lack of struggle

83
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:15,960
so of course it makes no sense to struggle to become equanimist

84
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:23,040
but what does it mean this presence and clarity and ease what do i mean when

85
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:30,079
i say that what do i mean by presence what is presence

86
00:42:30,079 --> 00:42:36,480
you know someone asked me who were the people who influenced me what teachers influenced me in my

87
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,280
practice this is really a marvelous question not only who were they but why was i

88
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,880
influenced by them what about them caused me

89
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:55,440
to be motivated in practice and presence was one of them but

90
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:01,200
surprisingly to me i hadn't thought of it quite that way one of the earliest experiences i had was going to a

91
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:06,880
bookstore and sylvia borstein was talking about her book that's funny you don't look

92
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:13,839
buddhist so that'll give you an idea it was 25 plus years ago and she uh what i

93
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:19,200
noticed about her she was talking about her book was that she had no wrinkles in her

94
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:25,920
forehead that she was totally at ease she did not seem to be concerned about

95
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:32,240
anything and i thought wow i want that i want that just

96
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:38,560
just here in the room another experience was going to see the

97
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:45,680
dalai lama he had there was a a large conference in san francisco over 2000 people

98
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:51,040
and it was on peace and the theme was for peace in the world you begin with

99
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,920
peace in your heart and then peace in the family and then peace in your community and then peace in the larger community and peace

100
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:03,040
in the world and that it all began with you and as i was listening to him over the course of

101
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:09,680
the week at how he exchanged views with people what became really clear to me was that

102
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:15,839
everyone in the room felt like he was looking directly at them

103
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:24,000
and seeing them his presence his being their nus was so strong

104
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:30,000
that you could feel it across a room with two thousand other people

105
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:35,920
and everyone thought that it wasn't a sort of projection of guru isn't on him

106
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,318
it was really feeling seen

107
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:49,040
feeling seen and and that presence when we experience presence

108
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:55,839
we are fully engaged in whatever the experience is that is happening here

109
00:44:55,839 --> 00:45:02,400
we this person this person who's showing up with these conditions

110
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:08,720
in these conditions this conditioning this person however it is

111
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:16,839
is fully engaged in this moment this this one this person

112
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:21,920
you you are in this moment this is what it means

113
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:28,640
to be alive normally we you know we we get lost in our thoughts and the thoughts are off over here and you know

114
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:35,759
the body is here and sometimes we're slightly aware of the body and what are we aware of

115
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:46,319
what is it that i actually know about this moment the presence of total immersion in just

116
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,720
this

117
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:57,119
this however irritating or sweet or

118
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:02,640
whatever emotions come up in the midst of it whatever twitches whatever bodily

119
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:09,440
twitches this this is totally in this moment this is the

120
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:15,920
experience this body is having and in conversation

121
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:23,040
the other person is contributing to whatever the experience is

122
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:30,480
are you there for that or is the mind off wondering what you're going to say in response

123
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:42,319
presence the absoluteness of just being aware of this experience

124
00:46:42,319 --> 00:46:48,078
this is presence to embody presence is to just be in it

125
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:54,079
the second item was clarity and i spend a great deal of my time

126
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:59,200
talking about seeing clearly and when i went through this talk that i

127
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,960
created and went down all the pieces of it i found seeing clearly i must have written

128
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,520
20 times and i thought okay so that means something to you

129
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:18,480
what does it mean to everyone else it reminds me of a zen teacher one time who he he always told this particular

130
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:25,280
story at least once a year i i sat with him for maybe 10 or 15 years and every year he told the story about the monk

131
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,880
that turned into a fox and i asked him one day

132
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:37,520
why this story was important to him and he looked really surprised and i said but you tell it all the time it has

133
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:44,800
real meaning for you and he told me what it was

134
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,880
but in the process of that i understood that the seeing clearly part

135
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:57,119
has to do with knowing the honesty of what's actually happening in this moment

136
00:47:57,119 --> 00:48:02,880
you know we we think we know what's going on and we apply a name to it we note and we

137
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:09,839
say oh it's this and then we dismiss it but the seeing clearly has to do with

138
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:15,440
saying what else is true about that

139
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:21,359
so so this becomes very obvious when you're talking to somebody and you hear what they say and you say oh well and

140
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:26,720
you form an opinion about what they say and then you no longer hear what else

141
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:32,240
they're saying because because you know already

142
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:38,400
or do you so so i've also inspired by a book of poems

143
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:44,400
that a friend sent me this is by ada limon and the book is a

144
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:50,640
new book of poetry of hers called the hurting kind let me see if i can find this page

145
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,640
the piece is called calling things what they are

146
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,680
seems fitting right i passed the feeder and yell grackle

147
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:07,599
party and then an hour later i yell morning dove after party

148
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:13,200
i call the feeder the party and the seed on the ground the after party

149
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:18,880
i'm getting so good at watching that i've even dug out the binoculars an old poet gave me back when i was young and

150
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:24,079
heading to the cape with so much future ahead of me it was like my own ocean

151
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:29,440
tufted tit mouse i yelled and lucas laughs and says thought so but

152
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:35,839
he's humoring me he didn't think so at all my father does this same thing shouts out at the feeder announcing the

153
00:49:35,839 --> 00:49:42,960
party attendees he throws a whole peanut or two to the steller's jay who visits on a low oak branch in the morning

154
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:49,119
to think there was a time i thought birds were kind of boring brown bird gray bird black bird blah

155
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:55,040
blah blah bird then i started to learn their names by the ocean and the person i was dating

156
00:49:55,040 --> 00:50:00,240
said that's the problem with you limon you're all fauna no flora

157
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,760
and i began to learn the name of trees i like to call things as they are

158
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:12,640
before the only thing i was interested in was love how it grips you how it terrifies you

159
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:18,160
how it annihilates and resuscitates you i didn't know then that it wasn't even

160
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:23,200
love that i was interested in but my own suffering

161
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:29,440
i thought suffering kept things interesting how funny that i called it love

162
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:36,400
and the whole time it was pain how funny that i called it love and the

163
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:42,319
whole time it was pain this is what seeing clearly is

164
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:48,640
about we have these ways of thinking about what's happening in our experience

165
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:54,400
and we get kind of entrained with that way of thinking oh yeah

166
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,319
love is glorious it keeps everything exciting right well maybe it wasn't really love maybe

167
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:06,480
it was something else and becoming enamored of one's own pain is not uncommon

168
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:12,079
it's familiar oh i'm this

169
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:17,680
life is so difficult and pretty soon everything falls into that

170
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:23,680
quarter of life is so difficult you know in in the last week there's been uh

171
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:30,319
the last week or two there's been a lot of trauma in my immediately immediate family health related issues

172
00:51:30,319 --> 00:51:36,960
for various people and and i myself was worried that i might have had covet and i was you know

173
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:42,319
waiting to i could take my pcr test there's all that unlimited

174
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:51,558
uh free thinking about oh my god everything's falling apart you have this feeling that everything's falling apart

175
00:51:53,359 --> 00:52:00,160
but it isn't falling apart it's just happening rapid fire appears to be like this

176
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:05,760
it appears to be like this but how is it really also during the week it turned out my

177
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:14,558
grandson had coveted and so he couldn't finish the last week of school which was very upsetting for him he's nine

178
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:20,960
and i got to read to him every afternoon by zoom for two hours which is a long time to

179
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:26,640
read a kid's book and sound you know enthusiastic and bright and carry on the meaning and the in your

180
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,760
tone of voice and how delightful it was

181
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:38,480
now it isn't that i was finding delight in the midst of pain and agony and sorrow

182
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:47,839
but rather that both things were present and that if i focused on poor malcolm

183
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:54,559
i would not be able to focus on the delight of telling this mystery story about these little kids in this book i

184
00:52:54,559 --> 00:53:00,160
couldn't have engaged in the moment because i would have been so worried about how is he feeling how is he taking

185
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,839
it in right which seems like a very compassionate act but is it

186
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:12,640
whereas the total engagement in just this proved to be just delightful for both of

187
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:18,160
us truly delightful he was very eagerly setting up the next

188
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:25,440
appointment well let's do it at two tomorrow no let's do it 2 30 because i have to finish my movie

189
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:30,160
just the the excitement of just this

190
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:36,400
and how exciting that is to be engaged in the moment

191
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:45,040
and not focused on oh what could be wrong or what might be wrong and needless to say my pcr was negative

192
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,240
or i wouldn't be here

193
00:53:52,319 --> 00:54:01,359
the moments where we believe we know what's going on are the very moments to say really

194
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:07,839
what is it that's happening it is this seeing clearly into

195
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:15,440
what my first impressions are and what what does that mean to me now

196
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:25,680
it's realizing that experience does not have to be tied into meaning

197
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:32,800
it doesn't have to be tied into meaning the mind wants to make a story of our experience you know it's a continuing

198
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:39,280
story but this is the only thing that's happening right now my life in the past has not happened to

199
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:45,119
me right now you know this morning i'm i'm planning to go up to seattle to

200
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:52,880
to visit uh another very new ill grandson and um it's at the university of

201
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:58,799
washington and so i thought of a friend of mine who works there is somebody that i went to graduate school with he was a

202
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:05,440
postdoc i was in graduate school and i thought wouldn't it be delightful to see him and thoughts kept coming up

203
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:12,480
of from 40 years ago which is are not about now

204
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:20,000
and i watched the mind go back to those stories and i wonder what he's like now and i reflected that i am nothing like i

205
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:26,640
was then but this person is totally different

206
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:32,400
really different however other characteristics may be true

207
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:37,838
equanimity is an intersection

208
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:43,920
of suffering identity with self and

209
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:50,960
ease and to see how they impermanence impermanence the ease of impermanence

210
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:58,319
when you when you really engage in impermanence you stop building meaning around every

211
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:02,119
experience you have

212
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:09,200
it's just the experience it's just the experience

213
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:15,079
and finally the other thing had to do with struggle and ease

214
00:56:16,799 --> 00:56:22,000
i was thinking about that this morning as i you know i was walking calmly through my house

215
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:28,240
reviewing in my mind what i was i had 10 minutes i was going along next thing i knew 15

216
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:34,400
minutes had passed and i thought ah i will arrive later than i attended to

217
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:41,520
arrive now there's a couple of ways of thinking about that one is i'm i'm going to be late and the other is i'm going to

218
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:47,119
arrive later than i intended and the difference between them is seeing this

219
00:56:47,119 --> 00:56:53,920
is what's happening and saying i need to move with alacrity

220
00:56:53,920 --> 00:57:02,000
versus i'm rushing rushing has that sense of urgency and i have to change what's true

221
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:09,440
i need to move with alacrity is ah time to move the difference between them has to do

222
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:14,640
with how much i am struggling with how things are

223
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:20,240
how things are what is the struggle with how things are it's not so so it's not

224
00:57:20,240 --> 00:57:26,640
saying that being later than i intended is good it's just how it is it's neither good

225
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:32,720
nor bad i don't even have to say it's okay it just is

226
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:41,838
that's all that that is what it is not to struggle that it's just like this

227
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:48,559
uncertainty can be unpleasant oh dear i don't know what's going to

228
00:57:48,559 --> 00:57:54,559
happen or it can be exciting oh what's going to come next it's still

229
00:57:54,559 --> 00:58:01,040
uncertainty the attitude that we bring to it that we impose on the experience

230
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:08,000
changes how we see it and how the experience then is conditioned into the next moment

231
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:13,119
the difference between loneliness and solitude usually turns up to be whether it was

232
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:17,078
your idea or not

233
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:28,720
equanimity arises out of clear seeing

234
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:34,400
and the absence of taking it personally the absence of saying this is about the

235
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:41,200
story of my life it's useful when you think about equanimity to consider

236
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:48,160
when equanimity is not present when do i not feel the stability

237
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:54,240
the stability of being in this moment because that is a key factor

238
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,839
stability of mind

239
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:05,839
what's generally true is that we get pulled around in life through the eight worldly winds you know the praise and

240
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:11,280
blame pain and pleasure gain and loss fame and disrepute

241
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:16,880
so this morning as i was sitting here there's a a new thing that has occurred in the

242
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:25,200
last few months in my sitting practice which could be considered annoying and that is as i settle in my jaw starts

243
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:30,799
doing involuntary movement it just moves quivers moves back and

244
00:59:30,799 --> 00:59:37,520
forth and the first time this habit happened i was just surprised and now i'm still

245
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:43,839
surprised i still go oh what is that and the mind wants to make meaning

246
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:50,000
around it it may be uh

247
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:55,359
i've been storing things in my jaw all my life the tension of life and it's slowly

248
00:59:55,359 --> 01:00:02,160
working its way out it may be i don't know something medical it may be

249
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:09,040
who knows what's true is it's quivers and as i was sitting here i wondered the

250
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:14,559
thought of royals what does that look like in a mask does that move back and forth does that

251
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:21,040
is that strange and then i thought ah working working on

252
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:26,480
on a fame and disrepute i'm going to look like i don't know what i'm doing up here

253
01:00:26,480 --> 01:00:32,640
i watched that like laugh that comment i laughed i said oh it's easy that comes up all

254
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,480
the time things like that come up

255
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:45,760
what's important is to be able to see when they come up that's the clear seeing part

256
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:51,440
oh i'm trying to establish blame for why this happened i'm going to blame att or

257
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:56,559
i'm going to blame you know pick somebody to blame

258
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:04,799
pick yourself to blame that's where self-criticism comes in it it's being blown to the side

259
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:12,799
what equanimity represents is the suppleness of mind the stability of mind

260
01:01:12,799 --> 01:01:18,079
that takes it in and stays here

261
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:26,960
takes it in it doesn't have to run off and fix it or change it or be blown away by it but just hear

262
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:33,920
there are two words that the buddha used when he talked about equanimity one of them was upeka the other one i

263
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:39,280
have to look up here because it's really something i stumble over

264
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:45,359
another word so upeka has to do with

265
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:52,960
seeing over it has the components of the word or seeing over so in equanimity there is a

266
01:01:52,960 --> 01:02:00,160
a broad view where you're not upset by the ups and downs you become very aware

267
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:06,480
of the coming and going of all things and that looking out over that

268
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:12,799
allows you to not be blown away by it i may not be able to find this word i apologize

269
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:20,079
but i am oh there it is it is tatra maja tata tata maja tata and

270
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:27,599
what it's a combination of words polly words and it means to stand in the middle of all this

271
01:02:27,599 --> 01:02:32,720
to stand in the middle so the standing in the middle

272
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:39,599
is not a rigid standing but it is a saying in order to be

273
01:02:39,599 --> 01:02:46,039
in equanimity everything must be included

274
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:54,480
it's not about being a better person so that you can be equanimous about having a better

275
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,680
practice so you could be equanimist it's about showing up with this person in

276
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:05,920
this moment and having the flexibility the stability of mind

277
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:12,160
to just say this is what's happening in this moment ah

278
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:21,280
and when you see clearly you can take the intentions that you have

279
01:03:21,280 --> 01:03:27,039
you can recall your intention in life and take the next step

280
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:34,000
it is about choosing as opposed to reactivity so yes equanimity and meditation is

281
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:40,000
quite lovely equanimity when you're out in the world with everything happening around you

282
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:46,240
is also quite lovely it's a recalling to

283
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:53,280
okay it's like this it's like this and that recalling

284
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:59,520
allows us not to be blown away by the eight worldly winds it allows us to be

285
01:03:59,520 --> 01:04:05,119
present for okay here's how it is now i am still here

286
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:13,838
the presence of i am still here and i can see this is what's happening

287
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:20,559
it involves integrity honesty brutal honesty it's seeing when you what you think is

288
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:28,720
love is really pain is just being really honest

289
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:34,000
i see things coming and going i understand that things arise and pass

290
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:39,839
away they don't have some specific meaning it is not about me

291
01:04:39,839 --> 01:04:47,359
it's just what's happening here and i have the stability and presence of

292
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:53,240
mind to allow that to be true

293
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:04,640
it turns out you know i i there's there are all kinds of prescriptions for how one cultivates

294
01:05:04,640 --> 01:05:11,359
equanimity but it seems to me equanimity is really

295
01:05:13,039 --> 01:05:18,720
a quality of practice when that practice is incorporated into

296
01:05:18,720 --> 01:05:26,720
the moment it arises by a fierce attention to presence and

297
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:33,280
seeing clearly and that ferocity has to come

298
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:39,119
with an open soft heart because otherwise

299
01:05:39,119 --> 01:05:46,799
we are rigid and unfeeling and uns insensitive to what's happening

300
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:52,319
so the very things that hurt us that rub our raw spots

301
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:57,440
are the places that remind us how alive we are how in

302
01:05:57,440 --> 01:06:03,359
the moment we are and needs to be included oh

303
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:08,880
this this is what's happening so there's a

304
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:14,799
uh there there's equinumerity of practice how many of you have heard of equanimity

305
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:20,559
practice it's similar to meta in which you repeat certain phrases

306
01:06:20,559 --> 01:06:27,440
that are intended to bring your mind into the space where you can actually experience what it is you're talking

307
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:32,559
about so i'm just going to briefly

308
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:40,079
i do this practice routinely routinely i have for many years because it reminds me

309
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:45,440
calls to mind the importance of the clarity of seeing

310
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:51,920
that is so essential things as they are so i'm just going to go through my phrases

311
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:58,160
i am heir to my own karma my suffering

312
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:03,359
depends on my intentions and my actions not what

313
01:07:03,359 --> 01:07:09,599
others wish despite what i may wish things are

314
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:17,920
as they are may i see things just as they are

315
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:24,319
may i meet the arising and passing away of all things

316
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:29,400
with equanimity and balance

317
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:38,079
i am heir to my own karma my suffering or lack of suffering

318
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:43,680
depends on my own intentions and actions not what others may think

319
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:52,319
despite what i may wish things are as they are may i see things just as they are

320
01:07:52,319 --> 01:08:01,119
may i meet the arising and passing away of all things with equanimity and balance

321
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:06,960
now those are just my phrases i've said them over and over and over

322
01:08:06,960 --> 01:08:13,280
for years i repeat them to myself when i'm doing walking meditation

323
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:19,278
to bring the mind in see clearly see clearly

324
01:08:19,279 --> 01:08:24,719
and what's happened over the years as i repeat these phrases to myself is i come

325
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:29,920
to develop a kind of insight which is a deep understanding of what

326
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:36,159
those words actually mean it was that that caused me to wake up

327
01:08:36,159 --> 01:08:41,278
this morning saying what is it about equanimity i really want to say what is

328
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:48,080
it you know i could go through all these lists do this do that cultivate it this way

329
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:53,120
but what's true is that we need to learn to experience

330
01:08:53,120 --> 01:09:00,400
and recognize when we are solidly present

331
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:08,798
when we are seeing clearly and we when we are not struggling

332
01:09:08,799 --> 01:09:14,960
so i started the story about the difference between rushing and not rushing the moving quickly and and

333
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:21,440
rushing and as i was driving along i thought this is really interesting i know the

334
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:27,040
difference between wishing i was further along and leaning over the steering wheel and

335
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:33,120
and i'm just driving i'm just going there and i watch the urgency come into my

336
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:39,920
mind and i let the urgency go and say this is not life or death

337
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:47,520
so i've become suspicious of urgency in my life when i feel like this has to happen now or that

338
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:53,758
really does this have to happen now

339
01:09:53,759 --> 01:10:00,640
what is happening now that this often happens in conversations

340
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:06,320
with my husband i'll be we'll be talking about something and i'll get enthusiastic about something and he will

341
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:13,520
be his mind is on something else he's thinking about i'm thinking about our upcoming road trip he's thinking

342
01:10:13,520 --> 01:10:18,560
about the paper he's writing on an ecological

343
01:10:18,560 --> 01:10:24,800
subject to support somebody's case with i think this is the uh the water

344
01:10:24,800 --> 01:10:31,679
sanitary district i don't know his mind is there my mind is here we're having a conversation he finally says

345
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:37,920
i really can't take in anymore and i can feel the urgency of just this

346
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:45,199
the end of the sentence i have to just say the end of the sentence and i just stop this is not urgent

347
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:51,440
it's just a sentence and to feel the ease arise in that

348
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:58,120
that is experiencing equanimity in the midst of triviality

349
01:11:01,520 --> 01:11:09,760
is what's important about equanimity is that it is not inaccessible to you

350
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:18,080
is it's totally accessible what's required is presence

351
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:22,960
seeing clearly and not struggling

352
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:29,600
i'm not saying that nothing comes up in life that we don't struggle against happens

353
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:34,880
daily it's to recognize the struggle

354
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:41,440
and to say how does this fit with my intentions and what's my next step not

355
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:46,640
two minutes from now or next week what's my next step

356
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:55,840
i'm going to finish my coffee and then move there is a patience that gets built in

357
01:11:56,800 --> 01:12:00,400
when you let go of urgency

358
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:10,480
just be here just be here

359
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:22,560
so i'm going to read you yet another poem to close this is called proof

360
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:28,239
everybody likes proof right a kestrel eyes us from a high thin

361
01:12:28,239 --> 01:12:34,560
branch and my husband is surprised it can hold the hunter's weight he's small i say

362
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:40,880
my husband says he's large obviously depends on what you compare him to

363
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:46,560
a hawk a white crown sparrow a ghost an abstraction

364
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:53,120
he looms not large to me but significant a standout something cool about him that

365
01:12:53,120 --> 01:12:59,520
says today is the day to test his medal in the mid-morning air flush with dead leaves and the

366
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:07,440
ongoingness of rusted mums a surge of relief comes like a check in the mail

367
01:13:07,440 --> 01:13:14,640
look i've already witnessed something other than my slipping face in the fog mirror the dog sweet seriousness

368
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:19,840
seriousness that being worshipped from nose to paw i have proof

369
01:13:19,840 --> 01:13:25,760
a nearly twig like branch can still hold a too heavy falcon

370
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:29,760
it's not much to go on i know

371
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:35,360
it's not much to go on i know

372
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:43,119
don't belittle any of your experiences

373
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:51,040
equanimity has built into it a piece of hope

374
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:56,719
it is the hope that comes from the ease

375
01:13:56,960 --> 01:14:02,880
of just this the end of struggle

376
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:06,320
is to let go of struggle

377
01:14:08,960 --> 01:14:13,800
it's not much to go on i know

378
01:14:14,159 --> 01:14:25,040
but the result is living a full engaged life it is about being alive

379
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:33,120
and this moment is what we have to be alive in this one

380
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:43,239
i wish all of you the ease of a supple mind

381
01:14:43,679 --> 01:14:52,880
a stable mind a mind that's able to come into the presence of now

382
01:14:53,840 --> 01:15:00,400
so that you can know equanimity not as an idea or an abstraction

383
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:07,440
but as a way of being with things as they are thank you

384
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:09,920
thank you
