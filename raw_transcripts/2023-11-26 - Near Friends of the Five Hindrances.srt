1
00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,000
so hello everyone nice to have you

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:14,920
here so begin with this talk with uh evoking

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,960
a simple maybe obvious idea that our lives are often

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:28,359
challenging that being a human being is challenging in so many different ways small ways every day and big

5
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:37,200
ways existential ways and sooner or later in life and um and then how do we respond

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,079
to those challenges and there are two ways that I'd like to

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,000
suggest uh one is a way that uh closes

8
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:55,879
possibilities that we narrow our Focus close down and the other way is we open

9
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:01,280
possibilities we create more possibilities we're open to things being different

10
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:08,280
one way uh closes our minds our hearts another way opens it one

11
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:15,680
way um um kind of uh Marshalls more

12
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:21,400
self-centeredness in the process that it kind of supports self-centeredness and

13
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:26,759
the other one supports kind of a a decrease in self-centeredness so there's

14
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,960
some other way of being in the world that's much more satisfying than

15
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,680
that and for these uh division between these two different ways I want to talk

16
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:43,479
about the hindrances and what I call their near

17
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:49,920
opposites or near friends to use kind of a Buddhist terminology and for those of you who

18
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,520
don't know the hindrances are very common teachings in the inside tradition World in

19
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,680
Buddhism and um people who want to develop this the Insight practice that

20
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:07,280
we teach and um you're supposed to become an expert on the hindrances uh this you know there's a

21
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:13,640
lot of things you know that these are really the primary considered to be some of the primary forces in the mind that

22
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:20,360
you want to be mindful of because they're the forces that um hinder

23
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:27,480
mindfulness and the principle is the more you can become aware of what hinders your ability to be present in a

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,720
clear open way the EAS e it is to be open in a clear open way rather than

25
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,840
running away from the challenges to being present we want to be present for

26
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:44,959
the CH very challenges of being present so that we can work through them or not have them be such

27
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:50,920
challenges and the five hindrances uh I'll give you a list in a few minutes is

28
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:58,200
are one of the primary strategies uh that people have that um

29
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,840
to cope with the human challenges in unuseful

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:11,680
ways and it's helpful to see them as strategies rather than just kind of innate things that how we are that we're

31
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:18,560
challenged and we kind of try to react to it in a way and the then there's the opposite of

32
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:25,879
the hindrances and there's many opposites we can call them the near opposites or the near friends are those

33
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:32,120
that resemble the very problem that we're addressing so things that resemble the hindrances

34
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:39,080
but are doing are not the hindrances they take us in the opposite direction and so it's easy to confuse the two or

35
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:46,480
to think that these near Friends of the hindrances are also hindrances we're supposed to kind of not have but if we

36
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:52,480
can appreciate that there's something that's very closely related that uh is actually has a very different effect on

37
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:59,120
us then we can maybe it's easier to kind of slide over from the hindrances to the

38
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:05,879
the near friends or it's easier to kind of just kind of feel our way maybe both are existing together sometimes and we

39
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,200
can find the beneficial one and avoid the one that is not so

40
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,000
beneficial so the five hindrances to give the simplest version of the list is

41
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,040
sensual desire uh ill

42
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:27,880
will and ill will and then um uh rigid I

43
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:33,080
call it rigidity and then

44
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:40,000
restlessness and doubt so we'll go into those a little bit more and um their

45
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:50,320
near friends the near friend of sensual desire is um uh is kind of a healthy

46
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,080
desire a wish that I'll talk more about there are healthy Desires in Buddhism

47
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,960
and sometimes the popular idea of Buddhism is that uh it teaches that

48
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:09,560
desires are the cause of suffering and so get rid of all your desires and uh this is not

49
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:14,320
possible U maybe not without becoming

50
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:23,800
seriously psychologically troubled the um and so there are healthy

51
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:30,199
desires the opposite their near friend of um of ill will

52
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:38,000
uh many people immediately go to Goodwill but that's kind of like the far opposite the near opposite of it is to

53
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,360
avoid because uh uh sometimes the ill will is called

54
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:49,720
aversion and um and so but there is healthy averting and so much so that one

55
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:55,400
Buddhist teacher I know in America has complained to us people like me you guys

56
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,560
are using the word aversion but aversion is good sometimes and then I've argued

57
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,080
back or say say no no in the English the way we speak use the word aversion has always as negative that's just the way

58
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,840
we use it it's it's a kind of a hostility little kind of like don't like something you're pushing something away

59
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:19,280
and he said no no it just means to turn away and so Latin means to turn away so

60
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:25,880
avert you avert yourself sometimes in a good way so but avoid so there's ill

61
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:32,479
will and then there's healthy avoiding of things that don't doesn't involve any

62
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:39,400
hostility there is this rigidity and uh and the opposite is a

63
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:47,639
relaxation rest becoming still without being rigid becoming still by relaxing

64
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:54,360
deeply and then there's uh restlessness and um and the opposite the

65
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,080
near enemy of that near friend of that is uh to be um en life

66
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:06,800
Vitality to be vitalized and those are good things to be have a sense of

67
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:13,400
wonderful calm but engaged flowing vitality and

68
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:18,840
um without being restless and then the opposite of

69
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:23,879
Doubt is questioning to question things to have

70
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:29,720
inquiring mind so so we find our way and to kind

71
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:36,240
of feel their way what's the difference between these two and as we Fe recognize we have the hindrances

72
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:42,280
operating uh and their strategies to somehow cope with unhel strategies of

73
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:47,400
coping with some challenge we can ask ourselves what is the way of coping with

74
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:53,199
a challenge that doesn't close us down that opens us up to possibilities that

75
00:07:53,199 --> 00:08:00,840
opens up the mind that doesn't overwhelm us doesn't have us kind of

76
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:09,560
um yeah so so um um so the first one and so sensual

77
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:16,199
desire that is uh it's can be so strong sometimes that we can call it sensual

78
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:21,720
hunger uh or thirsting for things and uh and we know that some people are

79
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,720
addicted to what could be called Pleasures uh and it makes a huge it's a

80
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:35,360
huge cost to people's lives to their families to their friends to their careers when the addictive approach to

81
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:40,518
sensual desires takes over but even way short of that people can spend an

82
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:47,640
inordinate amount of time being uh attached to comfort and seeking comfort

83
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:54,760
in as a way of of Solace as a way of uh feeling stressed feeling troubled by

84
00:08:54,760 --> 00:09:02,440
challenged by something and then using Comfort to not address the issue but rather to get away from it rather to

85
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:09,360
somehow you know one of my strategies that uh in my life that doesn't serve me

86
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,680
very well I call it the ostrich approach and so sometimes when things

87
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:20,519
are really challenging I kind of pull in and kind of get really quiet

88
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:27,839
and kind of like get involved in something and I just not notice the problem just like it's going to go away

89
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:35,079
it doesn't work so you never see me that way just G Gill you don't have to be an ostrich

90
00:09:35,079 --> 00:09:40,760
right now so this idea of you know so but Comfort is one of those ways

91
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:47,120
where some people eating a lot maybe or some people I've known people who um

92
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:52,920
watch uh I keep wanting to say TV who has a TV

93
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:59,480
anymore uh but they um you know to watch Netflix or watch a movie or something or

94
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,680
YouTube or something and um and they um

95
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:12,200
and now people can tell me you know I just like I binged watched and I just feel awful you know really feel bad stay up

96
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:20,560
late and uh and just you know just just kind of it it can drain one's Vitality to spend

97
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:27,760
too much too time too much time watching something on the screens but you know to be Comfort to

98
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,600
avoid some kind of chall we have the near friend of this is a

99
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:40,399
healthy desire but in particular one that I think is fascinating to think about that I learned from Zen practice

100
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:47,839
is uh has to do with uh the request and um and Zen they had the the

101
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:52,880
question what is what is a situation what is it what's being requested of me

102
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:59,079
right now so rather than being self asserting oneself what do I want here

103
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:05,560
what do I need here and Zen the question is what's the request of me from reality

104
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,800
so any circumstance and it was sometimes it was just a small thing like if you

105
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:16,480
had to put away a book that you were looking at I of people have books but

106
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,760
TVs books but um if you want to put away your shoes let's say

107
00:11:22,760 --> 00:11:28,000
that um and uh and so you um the

108
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:35,240
question would be uh what's the request of the shoes or what's the request of the shoe rack and that's a way of

109
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:41,000
breaking through kind of like just doesn't matter you know or I'm just going to put it anywhere I damn please

110
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:48,240
or you know and so but actually what's the request and you look at the shoe rack and you look at your shoes and you

111
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:53,880
look at who's coming and you say well if I put them over a little bit to the right there's a little more space for

112
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:01,560
more people who are coming that's the request of the moment so what's the request what what's being asked of me um

113
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:08,560
some people that what's being request what what we do that's beautiful what's the what's the thing that shows a kind

114
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,000
of mindfulness in what we're doing so that it spreads out from us to others because things are taken care of in a

115
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,040
way that supports other people to be present in a caring way to whatever they

116
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:25,519
do and so um uh I saw this with shx you know it's

117
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:32,399
interesting to study Buddhism if you if you do a sociological study of different cultures of Buddhism by how the

118
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:40,040
different uh places treat their shoes it's fascinating there are some places where

119
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:46,160
uh the shoes are just fanned out in front of the entryway and you have to kind of step over them to get to the you

120
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:52,040
know you put your shoes on the far end of the Fanning in other places like in Zen Japanese Zen where it's just so

121
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:58,279
orderly um that was really valuable for me to when I went into Zen Japanese

122
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:04,480
anden Buddhism was uh I learned to Delight in how I put

123
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,720
my shoes on the shoe rack it was like oh do this with care like this is important

124
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:16,120
as opposed to this is you know I have more important things to do than put my shoes on the shoe rack in Zen everything

125
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:21,199
is important and to learn this kind of presence okay here so what's the request

126
00:13:21,199 --> 00:13:26,800
here is what they say in Zen but to turn that around and you can also say what is

127
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:34,279
your request of reality rather than what is your desire what's the heart's request is there something

128
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:42,279
that if you take time to ask yourself what's what do what do I really want right now what's the request and I love

129
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:49,680
I love uh language you know words and atmology so request the spiritual

130
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:56,320
Quest the quest what's your life Quest what's your spiritual Quest and now what

131
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:05,399
is the request what's the deeper Quest here in this situation now and um what

132
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:11,120
do you really most want from the situation as opposed to censal desire so

133
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:18,639
if we have a sensal desire for something say we want to have sensual we have desire for comfort

134
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:23,720
food and we stand in front of the cabinets or the refrigerator and you

135
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:31,000
stop and say what's the request right now what is my deeper Quest how does this what I'm doing right now tie into

136
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:37,040
the deeper Quest purpose that I have for my life um what's my heart's deep deeper

137
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,920
request than simply Comfort to take that time and ask that question maybe you'll

138
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:50,440
see there's a different desire uh I've done that sometimes and said oh I don't need to do this but it

139
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:57,240
would be nice to meditate right now because that's a deep request that really Taps into something for me very

140
00:14:57,240 --> 00:15:03,040
deep inside with with it with a deeper sense of Integrity than just having more

141
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:10,600
chips that uh so here just sit and be present here so what's the request so the near

142
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,920
friend of sensual desire is this deeper desire the

143
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:21,360
quest so then there's uh ill will aversion in some schools of

144
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:28,160
Buddhism and that always has a quality of hostility in it and um and some even

145
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:34,240
though can quite mild annoyance with things and uh this always closes down

146
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:42,480
the heart always closes the mind when there were caught in ill will and um and it's always a kind of reinforcement of

147
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:48,399
self-centeredness if if you know but to to avert to avoid things which are

148
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:56,600
unhealthy that doesn't have to be self-centered that can be actually the opposite so for example to avoid the

149
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:03,160
tendency to be hostile to feel you have ill will towards whoever comes along um

150
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,040
and you say you know I think I'm going to be careful today maybe I'll go for a walk around the block before I go to

151
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,920
this meeting where I'm just angry at everyone so we're averting

152
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:21,279
avoiding how we're feeling not just going along like usual and and trying to

153
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,720
find another way that's not hostile so there is a healthy way of saying not

154
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:33,920
this not now let me stop doing this let me turn away from this kind of thing and

155
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:41,800
some of us do that regularly in meditation I've I go to um you know I we're sitting

156
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:48,480
here meditating and after a while you're tracking a little bit noticing what you're thinking about in meditation kind

157
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,000
of distracted thoughts and so you know I don't need to think about that anymore this is not the

158
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:00,279
time and place for this uh and so there can be hostility to that angry with

159
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,280
yourself for having one more distracted thought but that doesn't help you to do

160
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:12,280
that that kind of creates more self-centeredness because it's about me not liking something me being the wrong

161
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:19,839
doing the wrong thing but if it's instead you say you know this is not useful what is the request now or the

162
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:25,120
request is to open up in some deep way to my experience here and now and for

163
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:30,360
that for that purpose let me stop thinking about these things let me avoid

164
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:35,640
it let me avert myself attention from those thoughts to being here with this

165
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,039
deeper request this deeper intention we might have and this is where the first

166
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:48,640
uh thing request this deeper desire comes back over and over again to support us because if we know we have a

167
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:55,640
deeper desire deeper quest of what our life is about then it's easier to avert from

168
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,679
things that don't serve us oh let's come back back to the request that's the Deep

169
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:07,440
spiritual Quest something that we have and then the third hindrance is

170
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:15,440
usually uh classically described as sloth and torper and um and some people love this

171
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:21,440
word sloth I I noticed that because I I I've been avoiding the I've come up with a

172
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:27,679
different translation for the the original poly but some people have protested to me because I guess that's

173
00:18:27,679 --> 00:18:33,200
cute SL or or or they like to do things slow or

174
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:41,039
you know the kind of sloths AR inspiring for people who are always hectic and running around and so so you're welcome

175
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:46,360
to keep sloth if you're one of those people but um these are these whatever

176
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:52,400
it is they are ways of shutting down they're ways of resistance there's a

177
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:57,520
challenge and we shut down it's a challenge and we um are closing down

178
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:02,720
we're not open to to being present we're not vitalized and and engaged and and

179
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:12,840
you know um enlivened in a good way the opposite happens and um and uh you know

180
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:18,039
and it's classic for children to do this if they don't like what's going on and

181
00:19:18,039 --> 00:19:24,080
oh I'm so tired and it's amazing how quickly they can switch that over to be fully

182
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,600
energized I mean just like in a moment's notice all you have to do is say ice cream and you know and they have all the energy

183
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:36,360
they need but you know oh it's so difficult I'm so tired and um but adults

184
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:41,760
do this too as a strategy is it's kind of sometimes if we're overwhelmed if

185
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,840
we're deeply bored if it's our our self-centeredness is not being supported

186
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,400
that there's a shutting down a quieting down a closing down that goes on in the

187
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,760
extreme version It's I like the word the classic word is not in meaning of the

188
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:04,720
classic po word um Mida is not is um

189
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:11,280
that is literally means rigidity and this works really well for one of the one of the ways we really

190
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:18,080
shut down that based on fear the freeze Instinct that we have and uh and this is

191
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:25,640
one of the really great challenges for people who go around with chronic builtup anxiety they shut down they

192
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,799
freeze in certain situations and um it is necessarily that because

193
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:36,960
the mountain line has come in um the one of the earliest memories I have of really freezing and kind of

194
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:42,440
disassociating in that fear uh was my freshman year in college and everyone in

195
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:47,520
the English class was required to go see the alone to see the professor in office

196
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:53,200
hours and that for me was so intimidating uh and uh and I remember

197
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:58,880
going in there and sitting there opposite the professor and the

198
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,720
and I I had such a complete feeling of Disappearing sowh is this person looking

199
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:10,720
at the wall because I wasn't there and uh that's the last thing I was aware of

200
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,400
before I was aware of walking down the hallway and what happened between having that feeling question why is this person

201
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,960
looking at the wall and may be walking down the hallway I have no idea I just

202
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:29,279
kind of disassociated and it was because I was for me that was so anx anxiety produced in to be in front of this

203
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:34,720
authority figure when I was 18 and

204
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:41,760
um and uh so this freezing this rigidity that goes on and this is not healthy for

205
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,440
us to do because it's all kinds of terrible things can happen in that disassociated rigid

206
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:55,279
State and uh and then there's also lethargy this is the kind of kids kids strategy and oh it's so hard I'm so

207
00:21:55,279 --> 00:22:01,200
tired we we kind of get heavy and resistant by being tired and sleepy and

208
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:07,799
not a few people end up sleeping in meditation U one of the reasons for that is because there's too many too much

209
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:13,320
difficult material coming up strong emotions begin opening up meditation is not

210
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:19,720
a a straight route to becoming calm and happy and meditation is a straight route

211
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:24,880
to discovering straight a straight route to disc meeting yourself discovering who

212
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:31,760
you are and that's not always good news and uh but it's but it's real

213
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:37,440
news and if you really want to meet yourself in a productive and useful way

214
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,760
Med mindfulness is the way to do that and that's and but the the benefit of

215
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:50,120
that is if you're really meet yourself deeply even to the most challenging things in the middle of that ask what's

216
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:55,279
the request here what's being requested of me in these

217
00:22:55,279 --> 00:23:03,080
challenges what is my heart request give given that I have these challenges and so when you have deep

218
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:09,960
fear deep anger deep grief deep sadness what is the request what's the deepest

219
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:19,279
request is uh is always useful so then um um you know so the

220
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:26,440
opposite of you know this um rigidity and lethargy is to have Vitality is to

221
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:33,400
be enlivened and this is something that can become slowly second nature if you

222
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:40,919
ask yourself the question what is the posture that I should take now that is a little bit more lively a little bit more

223
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:46,960
engaged has more energy to it that feels good sitting in a chair i' I can easily

224
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:54,080
sit in a couch and with such a uh slouching in such a kind of way that it

225
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:01,440
actually begins draining my energy and I can also capable of sitting sitting away from not use the backr sitting upright

226
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:06,600
and I can feel there's more energy here I feel more alive and good how do you

227
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:11,960
walk I'm easily Poss I can easily walk kind of me feeling sorry for

228
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:17,679
myself and it's I walk kind of slow and kind of like doesn't doesn't feel good I

229
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:24,440
could also pick up the pace and it feels like oh now I'm engaged nicely there's a more sense of Engagement and vitality it

230
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:32,200
doesn't take so much to shift little bit to choose where the Vitality is where's

231
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:39,360
the vit where where there where's their Vitality right now and um and this can be a great

232
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:46,559
antidote to um to um no no I'm I'm confusing that

233
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:54,440
that oh I'm so sorry to tell you this I'm I'm I'm confusing the pairings so so

234
00:24:54,440 --> 00:25:00,960
lethargy and um and uh and rigidity the opposite of

235
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:07,760
that the near enemy of that is rest and relaxation what needs to be rest and

236
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:12,799
relaxed right here and um so both of them involve a

237
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:21,039
Stillness a quieting but there's a healthy one and an unhealthy one now we get to the other one so make

238
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:28,240
up F this so um so the um uh the hindrance is

239
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:34,720
um restlessness and classic language is restlessness and

240
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:42,200
regrets they both have the effect of creating agitation and this is why they're together here and so we can

241
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:47,320
become so agitated by all kinds of reasons um

242
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:54,720
frustration we can get agitated because we have unfulfilled desires we can agitate because we have unexpressed

243
00:25:54,720 --> 00:26:00,399
hostility that we just don't know what to do with we can be restless because um

244
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:06,039
we have a lot of self remorse and self-criticism uh uncertainty about

245
00:26:06,039 --> 00:26:13,640
ourselves we can be restless and agitated because of what we've done and will people find out what we've done and

246
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:20,640
will we be blamed and will people not like us and and so it's uh kind of U

247
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:25,760
sometimes anxiety produced uh the anxi the agitation we live

248
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:34,399
with the near enemy or the near friend of uh this kind of agitation that's a

249
00:26:34,399 --> 00:26:42,720
healthy in Vitality there is a kind of energy which is strong that we can live with that's I

250
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:48,919
call Vitality or being feeling physically enlivened and this is what I'm proposing

251
00:26:48,919 --> 00:26:56,240
is that we can do a lot of small things through the day choosing H how to be present for

252
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:01,799
something in a way that's enlightening ing or not enlivening and if you're standing in

253
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:08,840
line at at a supermarket uh you might just stand there and just judge what other people

254
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:16,840
are buying or how quickly the clerk is you know doing the checkout or look at the

255
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:23,279
magazines or wonder about you know which of these Like These are nice all these chocolates they're selling here and you

256
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:30,039
know and think I want chocolate that's one option but what is what would be if feel like a nice clear

257
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:37,159
sense of physical and vitality standing here oh if I stand on both feet if I

258
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:43,840
kind of sit in St stand facing a certain way maybe I don't need to be looking at everything around me and losing track of

259
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:48,919
myself maybe I can sit up a little stand up a little bit stronger a little bit

260
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:55,399
straighter and they're just not that anyone has to notice dramatically but there's vitality and there's presence

261
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:01,039
there's attention and ask yourself the question while you're looking at the

262
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,320
national Inquirer ask your question what is your heart's deepest

263
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:13,640
request and probably you'll bat it away that question but ask the question what is your deepest request when you're

264
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:19,519
standing upright straight present in a nice way and then you might get a deep

265
00:28:19,519 --> 00:28:27,039
answer right there in the supermarket who would have believed and then we come to the the

266
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:33,640
last these doubt and remember doubt here as a hindrance is always something which

267
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:40,200
closes us down so always involves some kind of narrowing of attention some kind

268
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:50,240
of um um narrowing possibilities it involves in uncertainty

269
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:57,559
indecisiveness um and confusion about what to do the near friend of it that can look

270
00:28:57,559 --> 00:29:07,159
like that is healthy doubt a healthy questioning a what's going on here in uh

271
00:29:07,159 --> 00:29:13,559
inquisitiveness let me take it deeper look here let me find out what's happening here I'm sure i'msure what's

272
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:18,840
what this is about I'm unsure what I want I'm unsure of things but let's now

273
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:24,399
reflect on this and consider and and then you can ask the question again

274
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:31,600
given my heart's deepest request what perspective does that

275
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,960
give with what I have doubts about or uncertainty about does that offer some

276
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,440
clarity and one of the clarities about the deepest request question is that you

277
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:47,640
might not have an answer to what you're uncertain about what you have some questions

278
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:53,880
about but you might have some answer about how you want to be in relationship

279
00:29:53,880 --> 00:30:01,919
to it you want to be in relationship to the the challenge you have with presence with

280
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:08,159
attention with uprightness turning towards the challenge you

281
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:14,919
have rather than being pushed around by or caught up in the agitation of Doubt

282
00:30:14,919 --> 00:30:21,720
of uncertainty of indecisiveness and so in this

283
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:26,799
mindfulness practice a lot of it comes down to how do you want to show up for

284
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:32,000
your life how do you want to be present what kind of attention do you want to bring to

285
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:37,080
your whatever you're doing and that those questions are

286
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:42,440
relating to every time we're involved in something that's a challenge how do I

287
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:48,039
want to be now with this challenge all too often we have some

288
00:30:48,039 --> 00:30:55,000
serious Challenge and the old operating systems kick in operating princip

289
00:30:55,000 --> 00:31:01,880
principles kick in the habits kick in I want to look for something pleasant

290
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:07,519
instead I want to blame someone I want to shut

291
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:14,720
down I just I don't know if I want to but I just kind of running around like a chicken without its

292
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:22,360
head or I'm just filled with indecisiveness these are all

293
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:27,440
optional we don't have to believe these hindrances this way of being we don't

294
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:33,120
have to prioritize them we don't have to uh think that they're true to be this

295
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:40,279
way because they all represent ways that we are being not true decisions

296
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:45,399
understandings of how reality is how situations are they're the response

297
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:51,480
within us and these are responses the hindrance of responses that close down

298
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:57,320
the range of possibilities we have in responding and if we'd have a smaller

299
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:02,679
range of possible ideas of how to respond or possible possibilities

300
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:09,080
available that can make the whole thing even more challenging and can reinforce the very

301
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:17,080
strength of the hindrances but if we can come into a a way of being that opens up the field of

302
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:23,000
possibilities that can give us a lot more confidence that can a lot more

303
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:31,760
creativity then we can move in a different direction and one of the ways we do that with mindfulness practice is

304
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:37,679
how we show up and to show up asking the question

305
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:43,760
what is the request here the request of the situation the request of my heart

306
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:50,679
what's a deeper request that I have that this is part of what is it that would be healthy to

307
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:56,039
stop doing so I can know better what is healthy to

308
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:01,480
do what is it that needs to um relax

309
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,600
here maybe it's the ill will maybe it's essensual desire the tension of that

310
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:14,559
what is it that needs to rest what kind of wrist bite do I

311
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:20,080
need rest relaxation is an important part of human life and a lot of people

312
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:27,519
in our culture here locally don't get enough and then uh what you know in what

313
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:32,679
way do I want to um be vitalized be

314
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:39,200
enlivened by this life show up in a way that I feel energized in a good way I don't know what to do the situation is

315
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:45,919
difficult but at least I'm sitting in a way that feels Lively I'm not going to give up my my

316
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:51,159
uprightness my sense of Vitality which we often give up I've

317
00:33:51,159 --> 00:33:57,600
give I've seen myself give it give up so subconsciously you don't even know I'm doing it oh

318
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:03,919
oh the computer is not working oh not

319
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:09,599
again I don't know how it works and I don't even know that I'm

320
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:14,480
doing it but you know oh look the computer's not

321
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:20,638
working look at that I'm I'm being given another

322
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:28,240
opportunity to sit up straight and then um

323
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:33,358
so what's the what's the what's the what what's the inquisitiveness the

324
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:38,760
Curiosity the questioning we can have that opens the field and one question

325
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:44,358
for that is what am I not seeing here what am I

326
00:34:44,359 --> 00:34:50,560
overlooking I don't know what's happening here I don't know what to decide to do but am I missing something

327
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:59,520
are there more possibilities here so hindrances are an important part

328
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:05,800
of our practice studying them getting to know them and as we study them in our

329
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:11,200
practice then we can also then know we have these things that look like them

330
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:16,800
that I'm calling the near friends that uh are our friends these kind of the

331
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,880
opposite ways of being and they make the whole study of the hindrances I think more interesting to have something close

332
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:30,680
by that can get offer you an alternative so maybe the hegemony of the hindrances

333
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:36,800
kind decreased a little bit and um so next time you find

334
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:45,920
yourself in a personal challenge take the opportunity to kind of pause and ask

335
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:53,520
yourself which hindrance is operating here and what alternative is there rather than to give to live with

336
00:35:53,520 --> 00:36:01,200
this hindrance operating and interfering with all the possible ways of

337
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:07,800
responding so thank you so those are my thoughts on this topic and uh so we do

338
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:13,839
have the potluck lunch today it usually happens at the last Sunday of the month

339
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:19,200
and uh we have about you know eight seven minutes left eight minutes before

340
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:24,599
the usual time we end so everyone's welcome to stay for the potluck whether

341
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:30,119
you brought something or not it's just a nice way to hang out it's an excuse to hang out with each other so don't don't

342
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:35,359
feel like you have to have brought something and um some of us will have

343
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:43,119
tables here sometimes are tables set up outside too yeah so there's tables outside as well they can eat

344
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,880
outside and um but because if it's a puthu and it's nice to kind of meet people say hello and if especially if

345
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:57,000
you've never been here um if you if you're willing to stay for a few minutes you're welcome to leave if you prefer

346
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:04,079
but uh just a turn to maybe two people next to you and look around make sure no one's left out that way and just look

347
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:10,119
around and say hello say hello and introduce yourself and maybe you have one or two things that were interest

348
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:16,000
interesting for you from this talk you'd like to share with your new friend and then in about five minutes there'll

349
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:23,000
probably be a bell or something for the puck thank you
