1
00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:09,599
okay hello again seems like we got this I got disconnected from the

2
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,700
internet hmm so I'm going to give a moment for

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:22,740
hopefully the uh you see yes seems like

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:32,758
folks are coming back okay hmm well conditions are like this

5
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,100
right now challenges this is this is a great

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:45,300
lesson to practice uh this is a great opportunity to practice compassion for

7
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:50,820
the difficulties here I was happily guiding a meditation on my own

8
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:56,520
and here you were struggling and oh we're disconnected what happened so oh

9
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,160
yes instead of coming up with with

10
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:10,080
in our minds cases to to have compassion 360 degrees here is an example there's

11
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,979
so many different ways our minds can react so many different ways our minds can react

12
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:22,500
and of course compassion is available oh this is

13
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,960
difficult this is difficult to be cut off in the middle of this meditation in

14
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,180
the middle of our community time and

15
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:40,680
um and compassion for the challenges and keeping our our Equanimity keeping our

16
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:47,040
stability so so let's let's begin again let's begin

17
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,820
again uh let's begin again every moment A New Beginning every

18
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,399
moment A New Beginning every moment A New Beginning so

19
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:05,159
so I think I have a sense that the connection was lost

20
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,459
pretty early on so we're exploring today we're

21
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:17,400
practicing compassion 360 degrees for all beings

22
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:26,520
everywhere including ourselves so let's uh let's begin again each

23
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,620
moment a new arrival age moment in New Beginning so let's

24
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,959
let's arrive in our bodies

25
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,819
let's settle

26
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,940
feeling our breath

27
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,959
and feeling this body settling feeling this body settling

28
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:24,239
with kindness with kindness towards kindness towards itself

29
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,239
and kindness towards others kindness towards circumstances compassion towards

30
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:37,519
oneself other circumstances things are challenging

31
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:44,099
in this human life surprises change

32
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:51,900
things don't always work as we expect them to can we have a sense of stability and

33
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:58,519
feeling our feet on the Earth our sit Bones on the cushion

34
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,819
and breathing breathing

35
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,919
and having kindness compassion for for this being who is me this body who

36
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:37,560
is me if it felt confused or uncertain or frustrated or or if there

37
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,139
are any challenges in the body pain and

38
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:55,800
your other emotions connecting with

39
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:01,080
extend the stability of kindness stability of

40
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,918
care

41
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:43,560
perhaps imagining that there is this bright

42
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:51,180
light bright orb of light in your chest in your body

43
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:59,600
that shines this golden yellow light of care

44
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,680
this golden yellow light of soothing kindness compassion

45
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,740
and whatever whomever this light comes in contact with

46
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:18,199
it brings peace it brings ease

47
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:32,039
notice that this light in your chest first and foremost shines

48
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,240
through your body

49
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:48,500
touching your whole body all the areas of your body but this soothing compassionate light

50
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,840
and then it shines out

51
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,680
if there were a

52
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:25,580
perhaps imagining a curtain around you

53
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,500
the curtain was opened curtain 360 degrees for this practice

54
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:37,020
this way of exploring it the curtain was opened

55
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:42,800
in front of you and

56
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:49,560
you acknowledge the compassionate bite

57
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,319

58
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,460
to the front of you

59
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:13,638
and it's not so much a an effortful shining but this light shines on its own

60
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:29,960
the ends of the Earth and Beyond

61
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,399
letting your light shine

62
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:45,600
as if the curtain now around you is opened up further and the area to your right

152
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:58,860
going for a walk it's so happy making if you're going for

153
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:04,080
a walk or if you're going for a drive every being you you pass by you you

154
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:10,679
share your kindness you share your good will you share your compassion and imagining you like just like you them

155
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:16,200
too just like me just like me they suffer just like me they have challenges

156
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:22,080
just like me and may they have ease may they have all the resources they need

157
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:29,460
just to expands the heart otherwise we that the mode we tend to operate in all

158
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:35,400
of us human beings is if again evolutionarily this is what

159
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:41,880
we have uh it's our bequest is what we've gotten is a sense kind of being in our own mind

160
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:47,340
in our own world thinking about our own problems and our own me me me it's it's

161
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:53,220
just the way that evolutionary we run so if we do this practice for all things

162
00:25:53,220 --> 00:26:02,059
everywhere it we tend to become less um centered in some good ways not to be

163
00:26:02,059 --> 00:26:11,419
for our perspective not to be so narrowed all the time of course we have to to consider our lives and our

164
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:17,940
problems and our issues and yes yes of course we are our own primary concern

165
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:25,200
and it is it's absolutely appropriate for this being who is me to be of primary concern for me and yet sometimes

166
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:32,700
our our lens becomes far too tight just focusing on me me sometimes it's

167
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:39,179
poor me why me oh again me oh and instead we can we can expand we can

168
00:26:39,179 --> 00:26:44,700
really expand over here all beings on this planet all this all beings yeah

169
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:52,380
we're in on this planet together and and um and with with Earth Day actually and

170
00:26:52,380 --> 00:27:00,419
and the timing of the earth day today doing this practice together also has for me had this sense of oh yes all of

171
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:06,950
us together on this Earth together may we have ease from the suffering

172
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:13,559
[Music] um from the pain suffering of of climate change

173
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:19,020
that impacts all of us so

174
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:24,259
so different few things I want to share with you today

175
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:32,100
one of them is to come back to the word boundaries as we talked about yesterday and I do want to expand that a little

176
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:38,880
bit and um and before we go there there's one

177
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:45,059
other thing I wanted to say about this this last category this category of all

178
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:50,700
beings so so just a review that we have been practicing in concentric circles

179
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:56,880
starting with ourselves then the benefactor dear friend the

180
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:03,779
neutral being the person we had entanglements with challenges with which was yesterday and then all being so so

181
00:28:03,779 --> 00:28:08,880
with the all beings category of course all of these categories are included in

182
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:14,520
all beings all the um as I brought in towards the end and it is helpful to to

183
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:21,380
acknowledge that and there are different ways that this practice is done today we explored uh

184
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:27,779
two ways very briefly and given that we had a YouTube glitch earlier it became

185
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:34,820
even briefer one way is directionality so

186
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:42,419
traditionally it's to the north and south and east and west and and Northeast and Northwest and all these

187
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:48,179
directions and and up and down is expanding so it could be the eight

188
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:53,580
Dimensions or or um sorry six uh six dimensions or it could be eight

189
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:58,980
dimensions around you or or in front of you behind

190
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:04,260
you so there are different ways to do this and also you can do this with

191
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:11,240
categories and you can go through categories in your mind all babies all adults all

192
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:17,220
adolescence or two-legged animals all four it just so many different

193
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:25,080
categories all birds all ducks all fish Etc or even finer categories

194
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:31,679
so there are many different ways to do this practice in order for the mind to

195
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:39,120
not numb out to not numb out and say oh yeah all beings wow that's I don't even know how how to get there but you you

196
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:47,100
you play around with it oh yeah all um all crickets may they be well see I

197
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:53,760
know whatever categories you can be playful with it too however be careful not to get overwhelmed

198
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:59,159
because it can be overwhelming like wow so many categories

199
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:07,380
um and the mind can become a little too full so if that happens then it's best to just lean into The Shining of this

200
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:13,440
light of Goodwill just resting with the light and just letting it Shine Shine

201
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,500
The Shining of of the Good Will and again

202
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:24,240
as review but just to keep this in mind that the practice of compassion is where

203
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,940
kindness meets suffering so if we're practicing compassion there needs to be

204
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:35,220
an acknowledgment of challenges but without falling into it without it

205
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,500
becoming empathic distress

206
00:30:40,799 --> 00:30:47,760
and talking about empathic distress as a near enemy um on the second day I believe of this

207
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:52,980
week so but it but the if we're practicing

208
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:59,820
compassion there is an acknowledgment of suffering of of a being and holding that with care and love

209
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:06,240
instead of just um just meta which is Goodwill which is

210
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:13,200
lovely Imagining the being in a neutral state but but here we do touch into the

211
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:20,220
suffering and again with climate change it could be quite easy to imagine yeah this being is impacted in way scene and

212
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:27,360
unseen um or or any other way so but be careful not to fall into grief and fall into

213
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:32,700
empathic distress because that is not helpful that is a near enemy and it's

214
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,940
also not pity which is unless that

215
00:31:38,399 --> 00:31:45,419
um so let me turn and actually this last day is a perfect day to talk about boundaries so I mentioned this earlier

216
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:52,620
but the culmination of this practice the practice of the promise that let's talk

217
00:31:52,620 --> 00:32:00,120
about compassion specifically as we're we're cultivating in this week together so as I mentioned the one of the tests

218
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:05,940
mentioned in visudi Maga the path of purification manual which is a thousand

219
00:32:05,940 --> 00:32:11,399
page practice manual somewhere behind me there um in in

220
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:18,419
um in this manual one of the the quote quote-unquote tests that is or

221
00:32:18,419 --> 00:32:25,799
the test for this practice is as I mentioned um is if you imagine in the olden times

222
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:31,520
if you're in a carriage and in the carriage you are uh taken you know the

223
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:37,380
bandits come thieves come and stop the carriage and in the carriage there's you

224
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:44,659
and there's your benefactor or dear being and there is your neutral person

225
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:51,000
and there is the person you've had challenges with four of you are present and the question

226
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:56,640
is which of you are you going to give up you have to in your heart think about

227
00:32:56,640 --> 00:33:03,899
which you're going to give up and if you've practiced this to its culmination to its fruition if you've practiced

228
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:10,980
um The Compassion to fruition when you consider when you um think about you know who am I going

229
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,080
to give up myself well my life is dear how about the person have challenges with actually no now they're they're

230
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:21,120
like me I love them as much as I do again not condoning actions but there's

231
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:26,419
a sense of common Humanity so this is called

232
00:33:26,419 --> 00:33:31,799
dissolving of the boundaries this practice this test because then there is

233
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:36,960
no there is no boundary there is no boundary so there's dissolving of the

234
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:42,840
boundaries there's the the the yeah the boundaries essentially dissolve that's

235
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:48,539
the culmination of this practice so now coming back to this work in

236
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:55,380
Western um a psychological Canon boundaries you have to have healthy boundaries Etc I

237
00:33:55,380 --> 00:34:01,559
can I can see the idea that that can be helpful and yet maybe there's another

238
00:34:01,559 --> 00:34:07,799
word that in our for me I'll just sharing for me can is more helpful and

239
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:15,358
for me when I think of the word boundary there's a sense of oh yes there is a wall and I have I'm I'm kind of weak and

240
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:23,099
I'm like oh okay because you know there's like a um tall wall I'm defending myself like

241
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:30,118
don't don't don't come here is my boundary whereas the way that I've seen the practice of meta and compassion for

242
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:36,240
me have really shifted and changed this idea of actually having healthy space

243
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:43,260
healthy space and relationships that may not be helpful uh or or supportive is

244
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:51,020
this sense of as I was describing to you today or or inviting you to feel into it

245
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:59,640
this the strength of the The Compassion the strength of of this light of this

246
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:07,740
this strength this power this uprightness there's there is a fierceness that cares about oneself and

247
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:15,240
it cares about the other being so it's like a force field it's like a force field of compassion it's like yes I care

248
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,940
about myself so much that that uh yes you can be around you can it's not that

249
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:26,160
I'm creating a wall between you and me but yes you uh but

250
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,740
um out of compassion not out of hatred not out of fear I'm not putting up a

251
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:38,040
wall but there's a sense of you cannot hurt me there's this force field of compassion I care of self-compassion I

252
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:43,440
care about myself so much and I care about you so much that it's not that

253
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:50,460
that this force field is invisible it's not this boundary that you're putting up so so for me this works better and also

254
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:58,500
so it's aligned with with the culmination of this practice which is dissolving of the boundaries so I can't

255
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:04,680
put up boundaries and to solve boundaries at the same time for me as practice it doesn't make sense but this

256
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:10,200
uprightness of fierce compassion from me and and the other person

257
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:16,440
um that we've been entangled with um it it it's out of love it's it's

258
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:22,200
giving us space giving each other space out of love not out of hatred not out of

259
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:29,940
fear it's a different way the the impact maybe the effect maybe in some ways is

260
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:37,140
similar but actually feels very differently it feels very differently it's not avoidant it's not pushing away

261
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:44,160
it's more upright and it's very loving it's very full I've explored both of these before

262
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:51,240
and this feels just so much more nourishing so I invite you to explore this and see if it works for you this

263
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:57,119
this is something that works for me and I've discovered in my own practice

264
00:36:57,119 --> 00:37:02,280
so dear practitioners it's been delightful it's been a joy to to

265
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:10,200
practice with you this whole week thank you so much for your practice for your cultivation for your dedication for this

266
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:17,099
beautiful Community thank you may you cultivate compassion for yourself for

267
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:22,740

268
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,240
