1
00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:06,720
so welcome to our meditation weekday

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,920
meditations offered here from Insight Meditation Center

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:18,840
and today's meditation is part of an ongoing series on

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,160
samade and we come to a kind of a turning point now in this

5
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,240
series where we're now going to uh

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:36,160
consider um the role

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:44,360
of um pleasure in different forms as part of

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:52,399
samade so pleasure can take the forms of straight kind of physical pleasure it

9
00:00:52,399 --> 00:01:00,440
can take the form of joy and happiness gladness and um and other

10
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:08,040
qualities of uh that come with pleasure and so

11
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:17,040
um so to begin very simply and and maybe if you can suspend

12
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,079
disbelief at Your Capacity to feel pleasure and

13
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:28,320
meditation and um and to be open to

14
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,479
recognize ways maybe subtle ways that um

15
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,840
there can be pleasure and there can be pleasure at the same time as

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:47,079
pain and uh and has a little bit to do with how much or how little

17
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:53,920
we prioritize certain Sensations over others and certainly pain can be very

18
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:01,119
difficult and it can be very feel like almost a survival Instinct to focus on on it and try to

19
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:08,679
manage it and so and of course you should try to manage it the best you can and certainly never use meditation is a

20
00:02:08,679 --> 00:02:17,800
way of injuring yourself with pain through pain but uh there's also an art

21
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:25,480
to not being reactive to the pain not being in the mind fixated on it in some

22
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,800
kind of way but to be open to the pleasure

23
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:38,400
that's also present and so the pleasure can accompany the discomfort the pain

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,440
emotional pain physical pain there might be and it creates a different context

25
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,200
maybe a different opening an openness maybe a a calmer or kind of a Freer

26
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:58,760
relationship to it all so to assume a meditation posture

27
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:06,959
and [Music] to spend a little bit of

28
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:15,159
time seeing if you can find a posture that ex that somehow manifests

29
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:23,959
both some degree of calm and alertness that at the same time you

30
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:31,159
enjoy you appreciate maybe because it's familiar your meditation posture

31
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:40,239
and to feel the gladness feel the relief for

32
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:46,239
appreciation of beginning meditation in this

33
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,799
posture and as a way of

34
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,760
waking up and relaxing at the same time waking up the

35
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:14,959
body see if you can breathe somewhat Fuller or deeper than you usually do but

36
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,040
to do it in a way that's Pleasant for you you enjoy

37
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:26,840
it so to let the breathe Fuller so

38
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:31,680
that rib cage expands

39
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:42,360
deeper so the belly expands just enough not more than enough

40
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,400
just enough so that's a very simple ordinary

41
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,080
enjoyment pleasure and

42
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:07,039
breathing and to Exhale longer than usual maybe mostly by relaxing at the

43
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:11,600
end of the exhale so it

44
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,960
continues and maybe they're letting go the

45
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:32,919
release of exhaling is there any pleasure meure in that any

46
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:49,560
pleasantness anything Pleasant about the Rhythm breathing in and breathing

47
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,560
out sometimes the pleasure relief can

48
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,080
be that we're not so no longer caught up and involved in our everyday

49
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:13,160
concerns they might still be there but it's nice to be now in a posture and a

50
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:19,440
practice that where we can begin taking taking a step away from

51
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:26,039
it a step not away from ourselves but into ourselves

52
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,000
and letting the breathing return to

53
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:48,280
normal and I often teach spending time relaxing the body at the beginning of

54
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:56,360
meditation and as we do this see if you can feel any sense of pleasure

55
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,520
pleasantness enjoyment relief

56
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:10,360
in the relaxation so that as you

57
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:15,680
exhale to relax the face the eyes the

58
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,879
cheeks the

59
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:34,960
Jaws as you exhale to soften in the

60
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,280
shoulders sometimes it's difficult to relax the shoulders but to soften

61
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:46,400
around any holding in the shoulders

62
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,759
on the exhale softening the

63
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,879
belly sometimes that's little bit uncomfortable but there can also be

64
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,680
something pleasant in it side by side from the

65
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,199
discomfort for this meditation feel the pleasure

66
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,880
and if it's easy enough on the

67
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:56,399
exhale relax soften open the thinking

68
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,200
mind the thinking muscle

69
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:14,240
and to feel whatever pleasantness pleasure relief there is in that

70
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,680
softening of the Mind

71
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:49,279
and centering yourself on your breathing and whatever way is easy for

72
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:55,000
you feel your body kind of in a wide

73
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,800
Broadway the global body

74
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:08,920
to feel where in your body there is some modum of pleasure

75
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:15,959
pleasantness comfort and feel that Comfort feel that

76
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:19,320
pleasant as you

77
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,800
breathe it might be just a little spot

78
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:42,320
someplace in the hands somewhere in the

79
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:49,959
legs the lips touching or it might be

80
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:04,120
broad it might be in this inct more like a

81
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:13,480
Radiance in the vibration hum of the body

82
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:41,279
and then to feel your breathing within

83
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:49,000
that maybe feel within that context of pleasure

84
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:08,399
and the idea is to breathe in an ordinary normal way no special effort to breathe in any special breathing

85
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:13,800
technique but within the normal range of

86
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:20,279
breathing there is room for slight adjustments in your

87
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:29,760
breathing to breathe more from the belly more from the chest more from

88
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:35,920
with nostrils and maybe the whole all of the

89
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:42,440
above at once see if you can find where in the

90
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:49,720
cycle of breathing where in the body there is some degree of

91
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:56,519
pleasure comfort with

92
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,720
breathing no matter how small or

93
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:25,000
brief and ever so slightly just enough can you adjust your

94
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:33,079
breathing so that there is more pleasure more comfort in

95
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:41,680
breathing maybe a slight breathing deeper

96
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:49,880
Fuller maybe not by doing it but having there be a letting go near the top of

97
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:55,759
the inhale so the inhale continues

98
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:06,440
letting go at the end of the exhale so the exhale continues in a nice

99
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,440
way

100
00:14:55,000 --> 00:15:01,839
and as part of breathing the Cycles are breathing in and

101
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:08,160
out let yourself be touched by whatever

102
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:15,600
pleasure there is in breathing whatever Comfort

103
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,959
pleasantness maybe

104
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:29,199
Joy whatever sense of well-being is found

105
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:35,240
with breathing in the sensations of breathing

106
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:41,560
or radiating from them around them

107
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:10,399
and no matter how small the pleasure is maybe your mind stays more

108
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:18,079
interested in being absorbed in breathing absorbed in attention to

109
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,319
breathing if you keep touching into what's

110
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:30,920
Pleasant what's comforting in breathing

111
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

112
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

113
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:01,840
for for

114
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:01,280
if there is any Pleasant in

115
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:09,200
breathing as you breathe Relax The Thinking mind into

116
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:16,840
that pleasure so the thinking mind becomes

117
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:20,400
quieter and more

118
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:30,720
content just to be quiet attentive

119
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

120
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:31,640
for for

121
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:16,520
and if you do feel any pleasure or have a soft mind that can feel the

122
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,440
pleasure of the

123
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:29,559
breathing in a way that is maybe similarly Pleasant

124
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:36,960
gently count the exhales so that the

125
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,559
quiet maybe Whispering ex

126
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:48,039
count quiets the thinking

127
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:57,520
mind so you can better feel the pleasantness of

128
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
breathing

129
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

130
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

131
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

132
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

133
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

134
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
for

135
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,320
for for

136
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:07,799
and then as we come to the end of this

137
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:15,039
sitting to feel

138
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:22,080
notice is there any way that you are calmer than you were before more

139
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,600
settled less preoccupied

140
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:37,840
maybe a greater sense of being in touch with

141
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:47,360
yourself is there something you appreciate about how the meditation has

142
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,360
changed or shifted something for

143
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:05,799
you and is there something pleasant about the appreciation or what you're

144
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:21,279
appreciating is there some gladness that you feel glad and

145
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:28,720
content to be meditating is there any pleasure

146
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:33,600
pleasantness that's grown in the course

147
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,519
of grown in the course of the

148
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:52,320
meditation and as you exhale to imagine yourself settling back into a soft

149
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:59,320
chair easy chair recliner settling back down into that

150
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:04,559
pleasure pleasantness and from

151
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:09,120
there gazing out upon the

152
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:20,799
world gazing upon maybe the people you will in your

153
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:26,919
life people in your communities out across the land and across the globe

154
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:30,120
with all its suffering

155
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:40,158
enjoys and perhaps your ability to rest in Pleasant

156
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:48,399
state is better for the world than for you to rest in an agitated state or a

157
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:55,159
troubled state or an unpleasant

158
00:28:55,240 --> 00:29:00,480
State at least for these next next minute minute or

159
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,760
two whatever degree you can rest in

160
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:11,559
pleasure in comfort in

161
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:21,799
goodness as you gaze with your mind's eye out across the world it's medicine for the

162
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
world for

163
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:03,039
and as you go forth into the

164
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:10,240
day May there arise from your

165
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:15,399
actions from your speech and even from your mind and how

166
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:20,399
it thinks May there

167
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:35,000
arise when ways of relating to people that can be manifest these kinds

168
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:44,440
of words these wishes may all beings be

169
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:52,279
happy may all beings be

170
00:30:55,639 --> 00:31:02,480

[Music]

175
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:41,760
thank you

176
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:31,880
so hello and welcome to this 21st talk on samadi

177
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:39,480
the the the phenomenally useful um ability to

178
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:44,720
be happily absorbed in an

179
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:51,480
activity absorbed as in a state of being absorbed

180
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:57,159
connected and uh and this is one of the gifts that can happen in meditation and

181
00:32:57,159 --> 00:33:04,080
it's a state that as somebody develops that involves a lot of

182
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:11,840
pleasure some of that pleasure can be experienced as gladness comfort some of it as Joy

183
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:18,880
sometimes as happiness some people will describe it as um uh some of it in when it gets

184
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:26,880
intense as a Rapture and Bliss and um when the Buddha was

185
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,559
searching for a path to Awakening uh he there is a story that's

186
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:40,600
told that um he remembered being a child and uh being left in a safe place

187
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:47,399
while the adults were working on or doing the the spring plowing Festival in

188
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:53,240
the field and he was in the edge of the field under a tree it's kind of lovely that they

189
00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:00,559
record of what tree it was it was a rose apple tree and somehow watching the events

190
00:34:00,559 --> 00:34:08,358
around him he got very calm and settled and peaceful and and um and in a way

191
00:34:08,359 --> 00:34:14,040
that was noticeable and felt a lot of joy and

192
00:34:14,119 --> 00:34:19,720
happiness and um and then um and he

193
00:34:19,720 --> 00:34:26,638
entered into a state of some that was very enjoyable and he remembered having that

194
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:33,480
as a child as an adult and he said wait a minute maybe this is the way forward maybe this

195
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,839
is the way to Freedom he had been doing aestheticism where he was denying

196
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:45,200
himself and experiencing tremendous amount of pain intentionally and he had realized that

197
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:52,440
that that wasn't going to lead to his Awakening and in Ancient India to feel

198
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:58,240
pleasure was considered a little bit taboo among religious people some at least some of them

199
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:06,119
that uh somehow that was indulgent somehow that was self preoccupation of some sort but he

200
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:11,359
felt the quality of this pleasure of absorption was actually quite

201
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:17,000
healthy and useful and that it was onward leading it led to kind of a

202
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:24,200
deeper unification deeper arriving here connection here and a deeper Clarity

203
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:31,960
that was going to allow him to do the work of coming to the end of suffer offering so we have here in Buddhism two

204
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:38,880
kind of things that might seem contradictory but are important to understand they go hand in hand one is

205
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:45,280
it's a very uh direct acknowledgment of suffering suffering in

206
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:50,440
the world and our own suffering there's not a turning away from it or denying it

207
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:56,839
or pretending it's not there or overriding it with some kind of even

208
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:04,280
meditation there is a kind of mature serious like yes there is

209
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:10,359
suffering and at the same time in appreciation that there is a healthy

210
00:36:10,359 --> 00:36:16,760
pleasure healthy sense of well-being that we can cultivate and develop as a

211
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:24,040
way of meeting that suffering holding that suffering finding a way through that suffering and so how we can hold

212
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:30,040
both at the same time is part of the art and one way to do that is to not be

213
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:35,720
fixated on the suffering not be overly afraid or concerned or trying to fix it

214
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:41,640
or solve it uh maybe to understand that the at least in in in the context of

215
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:47,079
meditation not in a restor our life but in meditation at least there's something

216
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:53,560
about our challenges our problems even some deep psychological

217
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:59,280
suffering that we carry that um it won't be solved but it

218
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:04,760
will be dissolved and uh there's something uh so

219
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:12,200
that it's almost like better not to fix it on it but let the discomforts and stuff be on the edges or and in the

220
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:17,319
middle of it um without denying it start

221
00:37:17,319 --> 00:37:22,800
uh as we develop and get settle in meditation more and more to feel the

222
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:30,359
pleasure of meditating of course this is not something someone can do when suffering

223
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:37,160
is new and fresh or big or someone's new to meditation but as meditation deepens

224
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:42,800
and we have a sense of it then we start opening up to this the the pleasure of

225
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:50,000
meditation and um and you know this is the 21st talk on somebody so there's been a lot of foundation hopefully to

226
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:55,960
lead up to this that um if some of you are new to this that maybe by now uh

227
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:01,640
maybe you can start seeing a little hint a glimmer of the pleasure that might be

228
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:08,599
there the pleasantness the sense of well-being and um and when the Buddha

229
00:38:08,599 --> 00:38:17,240
recognized it from his um uh uh uh you know that he had it as a

230
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,760
child and then now this is the way forward um he said I don't have to be

231
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:27,800
afraid of this kind of pleasure and again because of and his

232
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:33,960
time people were afraid of of pleasure and and uh sensual pleasure and all

233
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:40,079
kinds of things because it kept them trapped in the world and created more Bad Karma or some idea like that they

234
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:45,720
had and for him it was revolutionary to discover that there is a kind of

235
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:52,599
pleasure kind of well-being that is not a trap is not a problem but actually you don't have to

236
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:58,440
be afraid of it you can embrace it you can use that as an entry

237
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:04,160
and so the mind it's easier for the mind to want to be present if what's we're

238
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:09,319
being present for is enjoyable listening to really Pleasant

239
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:15,040
things like music listening to doing an activity that we enjoy a lot uh it's

240
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:22,040
easier to stay present and show up meditation is can be a little bit like that too eventually as we begin

241
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:27,520
understanding ourselves learning the art of being present um it isn't a direct kind of

242
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:34,960
sensual pleasure because we're getting a massage or something there starts to well up from some deep inner Source a

243
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:41,440
sense of uh rightness a sense of relief a sense of delight a sense of

244
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:47,680
pleasure that is not because of something good in the world that our

245
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:52,839
senses are being stimulated in a good way but is more related to something

246
00:39:52,839 --> 00:39:58,560
begin to working in harmony the harmony of breath and mind

247
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:06,359
the har the the breathing is relaxed enough that it feels harmonious and easeful within us an easeful breath a

248
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:14,359
relaxed breath and um and an an awareness that enjoys being there and so

249
00:40:14,359 --> 00:40:19,839
start be start becoming more and more sensitive to the maybe at first very

250
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:25,839
subtle sense of enjoyments or pleasure that seems to be part and parcel of the

251
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:32,680
meditation itself it might be a growing Global feeling of a hum a pleasant hum

252
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:38,160
throughout the body it might be particular part of almost like a little

253
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,800
you know square inch inside of a square centimeter that just has a as we breathe

254
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:52,560
when we touch that centimeter of the breath or that little brief point it just feels so poignantly

255
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:57,920
delightful uh to feel that or it might be the whole exhale just feel feel so

256
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:05,760
pleasant to Exhale but maybe not in a in a in a square centimeter kind of point

257
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:11,920
but maybe more uh like a almost like you can't fixate the attention on that

258
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:18,880
pleasure it's more there in the periphery on the edges of the breath and Edge of the sensations of breathing and

259
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:26,280
so you you you better not fixate on it look for it but you kind of just allow it to be there as a nice supporting

260
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:31,599
pleasure that provides a kind of biof feedback mechanism where when that

261
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:37,920
pleasure is there connected to breathing that um then we're on track and that

262
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,319
kind of encourages the mind yes stay there keep doing what you're doing stay with the breathing ride the breath stay

263
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:51,520
absorbed in the breath and allow that pleasure to be there and even allow it to grow as you're

264
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:57,440
there so sometimes that pleasure is is a growing pleasure is the tingling of the

265
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:06,160
air going in and out of the nostrils that can get more and more intense it could be the the um the soft Rhythm and

266
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:12,000
the smoothness of an exhale in the chest or the belly it could be the the

267
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
sensation of breathing in that um maybe the the speed of it and the smoothness

268
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,359
of it if if it is that way um it could be that uh it's not connected to

269
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:28,800
breathing itself as I said but maybe it's more there kind of on the edges of

270
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:37,359
it just beyond the edges of breathing there's something that just feels comforting and nice and like a Radiance

271
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:44,760
perhaps so I don't know how it'll be for any of you there's in many many many ways maybe infin number of ways in which

272
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:51,599
we can feel the pleasure that's related to meditation um it's not because it's

273
00:42:51,599 --> 00:42:57,520
Pleasant in the room for just the right temperature but it's really there because the way in which we're getting

274
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,280
connected and present for uh the focus of meditation the centering place the

275
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:08,400
settling place we're really in the in involved in that process that it feels

276
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:16,319
good like reading a good book or involved in a wonderful activity that we enjoy doing so that kind of Joy begins

277
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:21,640
welding up so I'll talk more about this this week this is the those week will'll

278
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:27,200
focus on this aspect of pleasure and um and hopefully you can

279
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:34,040
find something and so you might through the day today until we meet again 24

280
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:39,359
hours um spend more time noticing the

281
00:43:39,359 --> 00:43:46,040
pleasures you feel in the activities you do and um maybe there's ways you can

282
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:52,599
drive in a pleasant way you have to adjust something so driving is Pleasant maybe how fast you drive and all kinds

283
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:58,079
of things how you sit um maybe there's ways you can bring in more pleasure in

284
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:05,400
how you cook or clean or whatever you're doing see if you can find and appreciate

285
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:12,119
how you can feel pleasure in activities you do and it might be better than the alternative if you don't do

286
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:20,480
that so thank you and I have an announcement so uh partly inspired by

287
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:27,200
what happened three years ago with this YouTube Community um we're imc's uh

288
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:33,640
having a fundraising drive this this week three years ago we did a fundraising drive for save the children

289
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:41,720
for the children and mothers and families that were suffering from the Russian in invasion of the Ukraine and

290
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:47,359
we raised $70,000 which was fantastic made AIT and we're trying to do that

291
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:53,400
again this time for the save the children's emergency fund which is going

292
00:44:53,400 --> 00:45:00,880
to the places in the world where children are most uh in danger of starvation starving to

293
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:07,319
death most uh hunger homelessness all kinds of great

294
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:14,000
challenges so there'll be as money will go to Gaza to sedan I think to

295
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:21,720
Syria variety of places in the world and um and it I'm hoping that what the you

296
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:27,200
this community that we're here inspired last time will continue to inspire The

297
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:33,440
Wider IMC Community to participate in this fundraising drive and so you can read a little bit more about it and by

298
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:39,920
going to the IMC website and um and I had asked someone to post it on

299
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:45,400
the chat here today I don't know if it's appeared there but um um but if you go

300
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:51,160
on the homepage of imc's website uh there's a banner at the top that takes

301
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:57,119
you to the the donation page for the drive and also in what's new there's a

302
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:06,200
page which describes it so um so um this is one way that from out of

303
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:13,000
our meditation Community we can benefit the world and to feel like we're doing it together as a community and to the

304
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:19,680
collective power is a wonderful thing and it just a a uh I think a very

305
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:27,839
significant uh I don't know I don't know coincidence is the right word but that we plan to do this uh before the us uh

306
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:33,319
closed down the agency for International Development uh where there's now even

307
00:46:33,319 --> 00:46:41,720
more challenges in this the world to get food and supplies and medicine to people in distressed situations so to uh be an

308
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:47,359
alternative to this uh has even more meaning now um and

309
00:46:47,359 --> 00:46:53,200
um so thank you very much
