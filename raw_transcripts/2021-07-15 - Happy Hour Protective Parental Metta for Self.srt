1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:06,960
so hi hello and formally welcome to happy hour now that it's

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,280
being recorded for audio dharma so so for the theme of our practice

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:23,039
together today i'd like to invite us to explore um

4
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:30,560
in another dimension of meta which is um

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:38,960
fierce meta this fierce it's energetic meta can feel soft

6
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:46,160
and soothing and tender and calming and they can also feel fierce you can

7
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:54,800
also feel strong um and energetic they're different ways and

8
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:03,600
and um for example in the metasutta in the metasuta in the line where

9
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:11,280
it says even as a mother protects with her life her child her only child

10
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,320
so with a boundless heart should one cherish all living beings

11
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,240
radiating kindness over the entire world so i want to bring your attention to

12
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,840
this metaphor even as a mother protects with her life her child her

13
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:36,159
only child so that that image of a mother

14
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,159
protecting her child to me that can also bring up

15
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,280
well there with metaphors of course there are a lot of different things that metaphors can

16
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:54,159
can bring up and and and refer to and conjure up one thing that this metaphor

17
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,399
can conjure up um is the fierceness if if a mother

18
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:08,000
is protecting her only child with her love her life i suspect there will be a sense of

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:15,440
fierceness is that love it's the love is big it's huge it's powerful and there's a fierceness about

20
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:23,520
it so can we conjure up that same sense of love for ourselves

21
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:30,480
for the only child that is us our inner child the child that

22
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:35,840
we take for granted we we beat up usually you're not good enough you're

23
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:41,360
not working hard enough not not this being that is

24
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:50,560
us what if we had this sense of energetic powerful this mother protecting

25
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:59,120
with her life her child her only child so both the sense of love

26
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:06,080
meta care being profound but also the sense of

27
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,200
fierceness it's there's a strength to this powerfulness there's a powerfulness to

28
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,319
this love a powerfulness so can we explore that for ourselves

29
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:24,000
what does that feel like if we explore that for ourselves does that bring us

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,200
more energy more aliveness more recognition of our true nature

31
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,840
of the goodness within so let's explore let's explore together and

32
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:44,840
see what we discover in this way of practice being scientists of our own minds

33
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:52,400
so so with that is the preamble let's let's settle

34
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:55,360
let's arrive

35

162
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:41,119
please hello hi hi i i got tripped up

163
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:46,400
over the word fierce and it just raised connotations in my mind and it's like

164
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:52,400
once i i i started to think about that i i couldn't put it down again

165
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,839
and so i didn't do that well i without making this too long a story i

166
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:04,560
think in one of earlier sessions you said that you could have meta in terms of like

167
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,400
falling asleep and calming and i related that i did not experience that because of the level of

168
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:15,839
excitement ferocity to me my mind indicates intensity excitement and therefore not

169
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:23,520
sleep i i'm sorry my mind is hung up on this but i just can't can't get past that sorry yeah so so

170
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,920
what i'm hearing is a couple of things one is that this the word fears was in the uh

171
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:37,119
you have connotations with it and and the mind got tripped up with that so with that what i would suggest is is

172
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:42,960
use a word that works for you bill see what works for you protective you know i was trying to

173
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:49,599
offer some alternatives protective there's this protective loving image

174
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:55,440
if that works for you use that so tune out the word fierce and also what i'm hearing is that that

175
00:39:55,440 --> 00:40:00,480
brought up some energy for you so so if you sometimes fall asleep with

176
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,160
the very tender soothing calm gentle peaceful meta this was an energizing

177
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:12,160
so so um and part of that you're chalking up the

178
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:18,079
energizing to the confusion of the fears and also part of it could be that this practice and i'd love to hear from

179
00:40:18,079 --> 00:40:23,119
others is is more energizing is really awakening

180
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:28,319
this is not the type of meta that makes you fall asleep it's really enlivens you you feel

181
00:40:28,319 --> 00:40:34,880
powerfully loving and so that's the aspect i think you're talking about right yes i

182
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:40,079
think so so you're saying there's different types of meta yes that's exactly what i'm trying to

183
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,920
say not all meta needs to be sleep inducing that's exactly right okay i'm good thank

184
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:52,319
you that's exactly right we were exploring a different kind of meta tonight

185
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:59,920
that's exactly it it's a well if you don't like the word fierce it's it's an energetic energizing protective

186
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:07,599
powerful meta maybe the word powerful apparent that's really lovingly powerful like a lioness

187
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:13,280
powerful loving yeah that's exactly it bill you got it

188
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:21,040
you got it you're welcome you're so welcome so um let's see

we have a a parallel sangha joining us on youtube very sweet so please fred

198
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:25,280
i found that very powerful i was able to

199
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:32,160
envision myself as a teenager with real clarity uh and perhaps

200
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,560
because i i had just finished walking around lake merritt with an old friend uh

201
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:43,760
that i knew as a teenager that we sort of rekindled a friendship during the pandemic

202
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:52,480
but i could see myself as he probably saw me when we were kids and i was able to embrace that

203
00:42:52,480 --> 00:43:00,000
self with all the parental energy that i would want to bring to it

204
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:08,720
not particularly fierce that didn't really feel quite the word but adult and protective and i could

205
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:15,119
feel my younger self confident in the embrace of my older

206
00:43:15,119 --> 00:43:24,240
self and getting a lot of soldiers from my my presence and advice and

207
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:33,040
encouragement thank you fred i am so touched and buoyed by that ah

213
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:19,839
blood brazilian and ireland here oh that's sweet i love all these metaphors as uh as nicholas pointed out

214
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:26,960
i love it so dear ones let's turn to practice

215
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:34,160
in small groups together with this protective loving um energetic

216
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:40,160
energetic meta i think that's what i'm trying to really tune into and for me there is

217
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:45,520
this sense of really feeling awakened energized there's this

218
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:52,160
powerful meta that that can shine onto the world from this practice

219
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:57,280
the other practice too from the gentle soft what um bill was calling kind of like

220
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:05,680
the sleepy method i like to call it the gentle method but also this this this energetic meta can also be very

221
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:12,160
powerful this power of this kindness radiating over the earth so just tuning into these different

222
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:19,440
frequencies it's not one thing it's not one thing let us surprise ourselves by the capacity

223
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:25,520
of the human heart and mind every time we practice instead of just doing the same thing may

224
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,440
you be happy maybe i'll be let us surprise ourselves with just this capacity

225
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:38,880
with humanity so so with that let's join each other

226
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:47,200
and explore and speak about what we discovered support each other in this exploration

227
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:54,319
in this experiment of being human sangha practice is so precious

228
00:45:54,319 --> 00:46:01,040
so i'm creating the rooms now and let's start with 15 seconds of

229
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:07,359
silent meta okay all right here we go

230
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:14,560
okay all right welcome back everyone we've got a couple we have a couple of

231
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:22,079
minutes um for reflections what did you discover practicing together especially in sangha

232
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:28,960
if you haven't um reflected commented in a while you're especially welcome to share your

233
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:35,760
reflections so why did you notice what worked what was challenging it's

234
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:43,839
all good sharing your practice for the benefit of the sangha

235
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,760
and if you want to raise your zoom hand that's better option because i won't say your physical

236
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:57,040
hand if you raise it oh jerry says i like my adult life much

237
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:03,760
better than my childhood oh yeah yeah and it's and it's wonderful to be able

238
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:09,440
to reparent ourselves in this way yeah it's it's very powerful practice

239
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:17,440
actually this protective parenting re-parenting very powerful we can fill our own

240
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:23,839
cup and hence not need others to do that

241
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:30,400
says same same for me jerry oh marianne says my 13 year old self was

242
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:38,040
very happy to get the intention oh that's sweet it's very sweet and

243
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:41,110
[Music]

244
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:50,160
i just want to share that i was able to um to revisit

245
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:56,720
the moment that i was so scared and when i was young and when i was a child

246
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:03,680
that i really wanted to have some someone who's protected me but i never had it maybe i had at some point but

247
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:08,960
most of the time listen and i was able to go back that moment

248
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:14,480
and i was just parenting myself which is i was doing it before but

249
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:21,280
this time was like oh my gosh it's just like such a crap practice it

250
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:29,359
was just precious moment and um i actually shared with one of those um in a small group and the

251
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:37,040
other person also shared his experience and i just want that person's child like when it was

252
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:42,640
child i really wanted to hug that person that that gifts

253
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:49,520
so much and it just brings me a tears yeah thank you for sharing this video oh

254
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:55,599
i yeah the both reflections one is that you know how how powerful it is to actually to connect

255
00:48:55,599 --> 00:49:02,640
to these tender moments in our in our past when we wanted protection and and to even going it feels like

256
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,359
going back in time and offering that to ourselves and also being able to see the child in each other there's

257
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:14,720
something precious and beautiful that the heart opens up the heart opens up

258
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:21,040
as you're talking you wanted to to hug the younger version of this this person is yeah

259
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:28,559
beautiful thank you thank you for that thank you for listening yeah and morgan says protective meta

260
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:35,000
could be a way to fight back from self-judgments imposed by society for example

261
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:42,880
internalized isms yes yes right on morgan yeah very very astute

262
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,920
observation this is really powerful practice for self-judgment

263
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:54,480
because there's the sense of protective ourselves protecting this part of us that's

264
00:49:54,480 --> 00:50:00,800
oh that's hurting so very powerful practice very powerful

265
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:06,400
practice um i have more questions for you but it is seven o'clock so

266
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:13,119
