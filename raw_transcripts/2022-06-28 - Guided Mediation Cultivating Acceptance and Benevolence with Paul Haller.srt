1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:06,240
good morning everyone or good morning here on the west coast

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,280
and good day everywhere

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:19,680
wherever you are and thank you for those of you who are joining the zoom page

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,680
somehow i find it easier to talk

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,960
when i see faces in front of me

6
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,239
i haven't quite mastered the art of being animated

7
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:42,640
just looking at a screen that doesn't have a kind of

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:45,840
a human response

9
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,520
so thank you who joined the zoom and i haven't quite mastered

10
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,199
having a zoom and a youtube channel both open at the same time i hope too soon

11
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,000
but i haven't yet

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,799
so yesterday i was offering the notion of

13
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,840
our practice in in a variety of ways

14
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:23,119
is an expression of wisdom and compassion

15
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:31,039
i think of them as the yang and the yin

16
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,880
the wisdom being it is what it is

17
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:44,640
each moment each experience pleasant or unpleasant each interaction

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,680
pleasant or unpleasant it is what it

19
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,960
and the is you know each one of us navigating

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:05,920
our life each one of us exploring what it is to flourish what it

21
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:11,920
is to bring forth the qualities of being

22
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,840
that make a life enriching rewarding and

23
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,959
vibrant alive

24
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,120
and that these two interplay

25
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:37,680
and and together as we connect to them

26
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:45,360
they they bring an extraordinary extraordinary quality

27
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:53,280
to our human experience they enliven it

28
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:59,440
they give it depth they create within us

29
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,319
a capacity to be

30
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:15,840
each moment create within us a capacity to trust the human process

31
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,120
it's not an affliction it's a great gift

32
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,519
and of course when we're just holding that as

33
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,159
an admonition for or a

34
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:41,040
transformative notion and that can inspire us but when we

35
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,640
taste it when we become it something in us

36
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,680
is deeply nourished

37
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,840
so as we start to sit if you can just

38
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:08,640
remind yourself of what it is to be aware

39
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:13,159
in the midst of the human condition

40
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:25,199
usually what's most dominant for us is some

41
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,680
state of mind maybe with a persistent contact

42
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:36,520
or maybe just a disposition

43
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:49,918
and in the midst of that disposition reminding ourselves

44
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:57,360
this is about meditation it's about calling forth

45
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,199
the qualities of presence that enhance

46
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,639
and support the human experience

47
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:21,440
rather than some food more quality

48
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:28,319
of taking this time to nurture our being

49
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,440
discovering how the very process of being aware

50
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:48,800
as our singular activity can be benevolent

51
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,400
it can be supportive

52
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:04,400
as we engage our body

53
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:10,319
can we find within our relationship to it within our posture

54
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:18,919
within our somatic being can we find that benevolence

55
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,759
expression of physical aliveness

56
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:48,280
maybe just tuning in to the physical sensations in the body

57
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,960
you give them an expression of aliveness

58
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:16,639
unless you tune in can you let the body teach you

59
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:23,280
through its physical sensations what it is

60
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:31,520
to inhabit it fully what it is that helps it to open

61
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:38,400
it helps it define a quality of uprightness

62
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,360
equality of balance

63
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:55,520
what it is that helps the chest open

64
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,680
and soft

65
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,000
quite literally what is it to be heartful

66
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,840
and almost

67
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,440
as if you didn't know how to breathe just noticing

68
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,560
the inhale and the exhale how they move

69
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,760
through our body

70
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:53,640
physical movement of breathing in

71
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:08,320
the physical opening to what's happening in the moment

72
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,120
taking it in

73
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:21,399
sticking in the physical sensation taking in the thoughts

74
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,120
taking in any ambient sounds

75
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:36,279
taking in any mental dispositions

76
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:44,920
emotions it is what it is

77
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:19,640
and let the eyebrow release

78
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:29,440
everything changes it's dynamic

79
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,839
it's a constant flow

80
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,959
the exhale

81
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:55,920
maybe if your experience feels a little tumultuous

82
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,839
the exhale can have a quality of a sigh

83
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:14,040
not dismissing or rejecting but just finding a way to be with

84
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,760
do not grasp

85
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,360
and then

86
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:46,320
pretending to the stream of consciousness

87
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:52,279
that flows with this body in this breath

88
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,720
this constant engagement

89
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:13,519
in living this life

90
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:20,720
this amazingly complex event

91
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,639
that's happening in our being all the time

92
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:40,639
creating emotions creating memories

93
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,839
creating thoughts

94
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:56,120
creating openness creating contractions

95
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:23,639
can all light be embodied and breathe through

96
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:48,519
okay

97
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,199
uh

98
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,039
okay

99
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:50,320
and when you notice that your awareness is wandered

100
00:18:50,720 --> 00:19:00,240
just pause let the moment rediscover itself

101
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,880
the body rediscover itself

102
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:29,240
remembering we don't make the moment happen it's always happening

103
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,080
and as we move towards the end of our sitting

104
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,840
imagine the bell has already run

105
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:24,960
whatever doing has been happening can be allowed to fall away

106
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:31,600
and just being without any

107
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:39,960
agenda without imposing consequences

108
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:09,120
no no

109
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:21,329
[Music]

110
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:40,320
martin luther king said the challenging experience

111
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:47,640
can be educational and transformative

112
00:30:52,559 --> 00:31:00,080
each of us attempting to navigate our life

113
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:07,760
with all the challenges of it internal external

114
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:15,440
or sugar in as we read

115
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:21,039
and hear certain pieces of news about our world

116
00:31:27,279 --> 00:31:33,640
the task of balancing all the things in your life

117
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:41,360
how to take care of them how to

118
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:48,720
decipher the most important thing at any particular moment

119
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,760
that they may be educational and transformative

120
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:07,039
that they may embody wisdom and compassion

121
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:18,080
the marvelous thing about mindfulness

122
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:26,760
is that it draws us into an activity a process

123
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:34,640
it allows the very things that we would normally grasp

124
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:42,320
or push away to just be moments of experiencing

125
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,559
moments of discovery

126
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:54,640
sometimes as simple as oh

127
00:32:54,640 --> 00:33:02,320
my shoulders are tight can i listen to that tightness

128
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:09,440
and be educated can i listen to the tightness in my

129
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:14,720
shoulders and discover

130
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:19,919
how to shift into letting something be more

131
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:25,200
open something be more

132
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,039
accepting of just what is

133
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:38,120
can i find within that moment a benevolence

134
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:43,760
a compassion

135
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:52,480
but that's a completely internal process or whether that's

136
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:59,679
how we're relating to another person a group of people

137
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:08,480
and can we track that through our day

138
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,878
you know yesterday just offered the notion in in an intentional way just a

139
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:23,599
single notion of it is what it is

140
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:28,158
and it's asking for compassion

141
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:38,240
okay can we continue

142
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:44,760
mindfulness through all the things that the day presents

143
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:54,800
and when we can frame mindfulness

144
00:34:54,800 --> 00:35:01,520
as a benevolent act as something enriching

145
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:09,680
something nurturing then it's like we're attracted to it

146
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:18,720
and as we can act on that attraction and rediscover

147
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:24,240
how to shift situation by situation interaction by

148
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:31,400
interaction to shift into a benevolence

149
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:38,400
it's not that our grasping and aversion disappear

150
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:46,400
it's more like they're not the only thing that's happening we bring to the moment

151
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:51,920
a compassion for even our grasping and diversion

152
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:58,960
this is me doing my best effort at being alive

153
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:05,920
discovering happiness and suffering less this is this other person

154
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:13,160
being their best effort of being alive discovering happiness

155
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:23,680
and that benevolence as we explore it

156
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:30,400
it's an experiential learning it's educational in an experiential

157
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,039
learning way

158
00:36:35,839 --> 00:36:41,920
and experiential learning is somewhat supported by

159
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:47,119
mental learning conceptual learning but in some ways it's radically

160
00:36:47,119 --> 00:36:54,400
different it's like it has

161
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,960
a tangible engagement to it

162
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,280
it's palpable we feel it in our body

163
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:09,920
our emotions it

164
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:18,640
so as we engage mindfulness through the day you know can we keep checking in with

165
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:26,880
that what state of mind is it creating

166
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:32,720
what emotions are coming up along with it

167
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:40,000
and can we remind ourselves to be benevolent

168
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:47,760
this person that i'm annoyed with is just

169
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:53,599
making their best effort at making their life work

170
00:37:54,160 --> 00:38:00,160
it finding happiness and freedom

171
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:07,839
from restrictions can i remind myself of that

172
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:17,079
can i check in to this experiential learning process

173
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:28,400
can i notice when the mind is contracting or the attitude is hardening

174
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:36,400
or the emotions becoming more negative

175
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,838
or judgmental in what's being evoked

176
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:51,599
and as we do it we moment by moment

177
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:57,359
we're introducing a transformation

178
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:08,000
just think of how many conversations you've had in your life where it's they they felt combative

179
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:15,400
and then when something in you and hopefully the other person lets go

180
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:23,040
and there's like a sigh an exhale and then something

181
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:32,720
simpler just listening to who this person is

182
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:40,079
you're just hearing them express the truth of what they are in that moment

183
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,200
and you express your truth in that moment

184
00:39:49,839 --> 00:39:57,160
something quite different from combativeness can happen

185
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:07,800
this is the transformative quality of awareness of mindfulness

186
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:17,680
so maybe today you can explore

187
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:23,480
in the world that happens for you

188
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:31,359
in the self that happens you can explore it

189
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:38,079
and see can there be an experiential learning ah

190
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,839
what is it to be present like this

191
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:50,000
what is it to be skillful with the mind and the heart

192
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:56,720
when it's contracted when it's separate when it sees other

193
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:01,440
as a difficulty or an opposition

194
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:12,480
what is it to practice with that is it helpful to feel it in the body

195
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:20,640
just what is the impact of that is it helpful to acknowledge and note

196
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:27,440
the emotions that are strong for you or the attitudes with which you're

197
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,440
addressing yourself or someone else

198
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:47,440
our practice in seated meditation and our practice in the interaction of

199
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:52,880
life they balance each other

200
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,160
they teach each other

201
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:06,640
in this capacity this opportunity

202
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:13,079
to let it shift from its usual patterns

203
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:25,760
and can something in us remember the benevolence

204
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:32,960
that this is a gift this is not a burden this is not the should

205
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:38,960
that's demanding and

206
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:47,760
burdensome this is the gift that opens up possibility

207
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,160
so maybe you can reflect for a few moments on

208
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,520
helps me remember that

209
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:16,480
it helps me to remember the things that

210
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:20,960
the teachings that have touched my heart

211
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,400
the quality of sati the root of the word

212
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:38,599
it is remembering coming back

213
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:52,960
so thank you and i got the chat message that the sign was a little low and i will

214
00:43:52,960 --> 00:44:00,318
endeavor to either speak louder or find a way to put on my lapel mic

215
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:05,480
and have a great day thank you
