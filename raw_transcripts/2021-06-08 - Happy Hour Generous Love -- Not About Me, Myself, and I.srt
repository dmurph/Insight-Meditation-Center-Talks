1
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:08,080
okay so hello and welcome to happy hour

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:16,960
everyone so for today's practice

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:23,840
i'd like to invite us to consider the practice of meta

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:33,040
without so much self occupation in it without self preoccupation

5
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:41,360
so i'll say a few words to set the frame and then i will lead us into meditation

6
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:48,640
so we explore it together and see what kind of flavors come up what we discover

7
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,878
so

8
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:03,680
when we care when we have meta love kindness

9
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:10,000
different nuances of meta the word meta loving kindness friendliness etc

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,240
a lot of times um there is a sense of preoccupation

11
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:21,360
self-preoccupation that can still be in there um either in the relationship or in the

12
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:28,159
moment so it could be a sense of oh um i like you

13
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:34,960
i wish you well there's you know there could be some attachment in it you know there's this self involved maybe it's

14
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:41,119
conditional care oh i may you be well i love you so that you will love me back so that you would

15
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,240
think that i'm worthy and i'm nice and i'm kind and

16
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:52,240
you know there might be just nuances i may not be too overt but there might be nuances of the

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,840
self being entangled in their love like oh i am wishing you well what a wonderful practitioner i am human being

18
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:06,560
i am wishing you you know there could be different nuances flavors of the self kind of budding in instead

19
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:11,760
of just pure care love without the self uh

20
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:19,120
concern those are some ways it can show up it can also show up in the way

21
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:26,400
of the moment of practice that oh i'm too tired or this is too hard for me

22
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:34,080
or this is where i'm having too many emotions or my mind is not stable enough or i i right you know just

23
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:41,840
different nuances flavors of self um occupation preoccupation can come in and

24
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,400
and i'm kind of making light of it a little bit making a caricature of it just to kind of point out it may not be that

25
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:56,319
gross but might be more subtle might be more subtle again it's um

26
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:03,519
it doesn't make you a bad person or a bad buddhist or bad practitioner it's just interesting to notice right

27
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:10,080
because we cultivate awareness we cultivate mindfulness so that we're aware of what's happening

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:17,519
and the invitation tonight as i'll guide us through it is what if it's not about

29
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,360
me it's not about us what if it's not about me

30
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:29,920
about this being the self of mine what if it's not about me at all what if

31
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,400
it's just an expression of love expression of care expression of good will regardless of

32
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:42,000
what i get out of this regardless whether i become happier out of this

33
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:49,280
during happier regardless of what you will think of me or our relationship or

34
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,080
regardless of any of that just sitting landing being

35
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:01,200
in goodness kindness and letting it radiate

36
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,840
from nowhere could be through you or just is you're reflecting it perhaps

37
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:14,959
you're like a mirror that maybe take reflects the kindness from the universe and we reflect it back and

38
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,440
and the mirror is just reflective it's not like oh look at me i'm a mirror and

39
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:26,720
like it doesn't absorb it doesn't it doesn't kind of color the light it just reflects it

40
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,680
just without without showing up too much so we'll play with different metaphors and

41
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:41,520
just to bring one other consideration in is for those practitioners who like the

42
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,600
practice or or um have been practicing for a while and perhaps

43
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,000
are familiar curious with the concept in buddhism practicing not self it's not

44
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,280
personal it's not personal this is one way that the practice of metta

45
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:06,639
cultivating good will can really merge with the practice of anata not self or shunyatta

46
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:13,360
emptiness but there isn't really so much about us this entanglement is just love

47
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:20,240
flowing love flowing out of emptiness so all right without making it

48
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:26,479
too heady let's practice let's come to our bodies first and foremost

49
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:39,840
so invite you to arrive arriving in your body landing

50
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:53,840
however you're sitting [Music] or lying down

51
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:01,680
inviting this body to relax to soften

52
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,478
to land to land in this moment

53
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,280
as if you are putting this body down

54
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,840
lovingly kindly

55
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,039
allowing the breath to move on its own in and out

56
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:50,240
not so much controlling the breath the breath is breathing you

57
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:57,919
it's been doing it all these years so let it continue

58
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,840
without making breathing a project

59
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:27,360
with each breath each out breath

60
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
letting the body relax soften

61
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:41,680
land connect more with the earth

62
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,479
supporting you through your feet under your sit bones

63
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:59,840
all the contact points

64
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,720
and just knitting inviting the awareness

65
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:41,200
expansive spacious relaxed awareness

66
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,199
to receive the breath and the sensations of the body

67
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:52,800
just to settle and calm and calm abiding [Music]

68
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:59,200
for the next few minutes arriving

69
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:09,839
settling

70
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:19,839
here here

71
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:33,839
now

72
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:28,320
notice if there's any joy delight the process of being breathed

73
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:39,839
simply in this moment

74
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:50,320
and if thoughts and pure occupations arise in this moment

75
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:59,440
kindly gently noticing what's arisen and is it possible

76
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:09,040
to ever so gently put down put down the preoccupations

77
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,839
the stories

78
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:26,639
isn't it interesting they all have to do with me myself and mine

79
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,600
having some humor some lightness

80
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:40,399
kindness with your mind as it likes to think

81
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:46,320
gently lovingly thank you sweetie thank you dear mind

82
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,279
it's okay we can put this down right now

83
00:15:51,680 --> 00:16:09,839
it's okay thank you for your hard work

84
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:22,240
this moment just being breathed simply simplicity delicious

85
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:37,839
simplicity of just sitting and being briefed

86
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:06,880
and notice we're not trying to get rid of the self just noticing that it's arising

87
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:13,360
with all self preoccupied thoughts

88
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:20,558
lightheartedly smilingly oh here it is

89
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:33,840
can we gently put it down the next out breath maybe just for one breath

90
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:49,200
noticing for those breaths when there is no preoccupation

91
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:54,720
ah oh freer how much freer more open

92
00:17:54,720 --> 00:18:15,840
the heart and mind feel how much more spacious

93
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:39,840
okay

94
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:08,399
now i'd like to invite you to bring

95
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:20,559
to your heart to your mind someone for whom your care

96
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:28,559
your affection kindness meta wishes of well-being

97
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:33,840
maybe love flow with

98
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:41,039
and you think of this being [Music] it could be a person could be a pet it

99
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,240
could be a child you think of this being maybe there's a

100
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:54,000
sense of ease sense of safety maybe a smile shows up just

101
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,080
naturally wish them well

102
00:21:00,159 --> 00:21:17,840
bringing bringing them to your heart to your mind to your mind's eye

103
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:37,360
and now instead of seeing them from your vantage point

104
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:45,440
through your eyes imagine this being it's just being held being seen

105
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:53,919
as if they're standing on stage in an amphitheater a performance hall there they are

106
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:59,840
there's space all around them

107
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:12,080
it's not just you they're being held and can they be held in care and love

108
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:19,520
and good will can they be showered

109
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:26,080
in goodwill

110
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:40,159
you could be witnessing it but it's not about you it's not about you it's not about us

111
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:46,240
your visual and this visualization might be helpful

112
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:55,840
imagine them being showered with flowers

113
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:06,320
coming from every direction as if it were meta these flowers

114
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,840
flower petals

115
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:42,880
maybe all the beings maybe there are beings in this

116
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:49,279
concert hall all around or maybe the seeds are empty see what

117
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:56,000
works best for you but somehow from all around

118
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:04,320
the phrases of meta are being directed

119
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:19,840
to this being to this dear one

120
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:29,519
i'll say the traditional phrases you can use whatever phrase works for you

121
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:37,220
may you be safe may you be safe from inner and outer

122
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,319
[Music]

123
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
harm

124
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:55,120
imagine imagining them receiving that

125
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:01,840
again maybe there's a chorus where it's silent

126
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:10,159
so it's not about you you could be joining or you could be witnessing with care

127
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:17,120
with love but it's not about you this menta

128
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:23,120
freely offered this care this good wealth

129
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,840
may you be safe from inner and outer harm dear one

130
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:41,120
hearing the second phrase of meta chanted maybe by all the participants

131
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:46,960
are somehow coming through the empty seats see what works for you

132
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:57,840
may you be happy may you be happy and joyful

133
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:14,320
the third metaphrase may you be healthy and strong

134
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:24,000
may you be healthy and strong

135
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,679
the fourth metaphrase may your life flow with ease

136
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:40,880
may you take care of yourself happily

137
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,240
may you be safe

138
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,399
may you be happy

139
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:07,840
may you be healthy

140
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,840
you have ease

141
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:28,080
and watching witnessing [Music] beholding your dear being

142
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:33,440
comfortable maybe sitting standing could be in a comfortable chair on the

143
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:40,639
stage just receiving the meta the care all around them

144
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:48,640
all these good wishes for their safety for their happiness

145
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,480
for their health and well-being

146
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,720
what do you want for them what do you wish for them

147
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:17,840
they're receiving it

148
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:31,840
you're wrapped in it showered in it

149
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:28,640
maybe it occurs to you that your dear being there are many people

150
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:35,600
who hold this person with affection with worms with care

151
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:46,799
all of you all of you joining your hearts your good wishes

152
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:55,840
so it's not just about you wishing them well all of you

153
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:07,680
all the people this person's life perhaps feeling this hall

154
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,120
[Music] all around together you're wishing them well

155
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:16,640
wishing this being well

156
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,720
it's about giving love

157
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:37,840
freely generously not about me not about mine

158
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:09,360
such an act of generosity

159
00:32:12,559 --> 00:32:19,120
as if you've organized the surprise blessing ceremony for them

160
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:29,840
they're being showered with good will care good wishes

161
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:43,840
okay all the people who care about them

162
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,760
and whether you feel tired the mind feels distracted

163
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:42,749
the body feels achy [Music]

164
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:50,319
can you remind ourselves it's not about me it's not about me in this moment

165
00:34:51,040 --> 00:35:00,400
it's not possible for just a moment to take self preoccupations out and just

166
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:07,760
generously witness share good will kindness

167
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:17,839
see what happens

168
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,838
for the last couple of minutes of this practice

169
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,240
letting go of your self-preoccupations and this being who is you

170
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:19,520
shows up as you and the world let them step in

171
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,599
step into the center together with your dear being

172
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:40,240
and both of you receive good will good wishes just receiving

173
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:48,160
generously offered from all the beings in the hall

174
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,079
and not get in your own way with self-preoccupation but i'm not worthy of it

175
00:36:54,079 --> 00:37:00,960
not good enough letting that go this being who is you just receiving

176
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:07,359
it's not about you get yourself out of there just receiving

177
00:37:07,359 --> 00:37:13,760
meta just receiving goodwill

178
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:37,839
letting it land letting it be received

179
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:51,119
sink into your bones

180
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:57,599
this being who is you is deserving of care of love

181
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:05,839
of meta as much as anyone else

182
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:11,760
in some ways it's not about you

183
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:20,640
the self reflections preoccupation just the being who you are

184
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:33,839
deserves absolute love and compassion so let this being receive it

185
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,079
may all beings

186
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:02,960
including ourselves know their own goodness

187
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:06,800
that they're deserving of love

188
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:15,839
may all beings be free

189
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:39,040
thanks everyone thank you for your

190
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:45,440
practice so

191
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:53,200
i'd love to hear your reflections what do you notice what this was like for you

192
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:59,570
what might have opened up in this different way of entering into meta

193
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:05,040
[Music] and i'll change the chat settings you can

194
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:11,359
if you type in chat to everyone i'll read your name if you just send it to me privately i won't read

195
00:40:11,359 --> 00:40:17,200
your name you can also raise your zoom hand to share your reflection it can also be

196
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:22,400
about the first part about calming and settling our minds did you

197
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:27,760
notice if you with the out of breath if you put down preoccupations

198
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:33,680
if there was more spaciousness more ease when the preoccupations were put down

199
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,960
and also maybe how this practice of

200
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:45,599
creating a circle of benefactors for your dear being in the past i've taught

201
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:52,400
circle of benefactors when we created for ourselves and we receive from people who care about us but here

202
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:57,599
you basically threw a surprise party a blessing ceremony for someone you cared about in

203
00:40:57,599 --> 00:41:04,480
your heart to see oh what does that feel like how is there a sense of generosity goodness

204
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:13,040
that can can come up when we take ourselves out of that so i'd love to hear what you noticed

205
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:21,839
how this was for you

206
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:37,599
and you can raise your zoom hand it's under reactions or

207
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,920
under participants depending on the version of zoom you have

208
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,838
yes kim please

209
00:41:52,880 --> 00:42:01,359
it was lovely um very spacious and

210
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:08,880
um i could a nice progression from

211
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:16,800
um my breath feeling kind of contrived or thick to

212
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,520
uh to it feeling fresh and cool

213
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:30,240
and that was nice i chose my son who's

214
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:36,560
an actor so it was like you know but he's a tv actor and but yeah

215
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:42,079
imagining him and he's he's filming right now and so he's like everybody's

216
00:42:42,079 --> 00:42:48,319
on the set and then all his friends added and then all the people that are watching him

217
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:56,319
um the show and that felt really good and then um bill i hope you don't mind

218
00:42:56,319 --> 00:43:02,560
i was so pleased to still see that you were back and that made me you know i was joyous when

219
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:08,000
i when i came on and so bill came into the circle when i came in and said like the

220
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,280
three of us carlo and bill and i were like you know this huddled and we had all this

221
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:20,480
all of carlo's friends and the set and the the uh the actors and

222
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:27,280
the people viewing him we were taking advantage of that

223
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:34,319
that's pretty cool oh my god kim it just makes me so happy i'm happy

224
00:43:34,319 --> 00:43:42,079
i'm happy here hearing your your practice reporting just it's so joyous what you're describing

225
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:47,839
with your son and on the set and and being happy that bill has come here and him joining your

226
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:55,200
your and and bill says glad to see you two kim in the chat that's sweet you know this this this song of support in in your

227
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:01,280
practice it just delights me to no end thank you kim it was really sweet to hear

228
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:06,880
the progression from the contracted breath to all the joyousness that you're

229
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:14,880
talking but i loved it thank you delights me to know it yeah sweet

230
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:22,079
any other reflections you'd like to share any challenges any questions jerry says

231
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:29,359
it felt more nurturing and less just about one to one and as a result more powerful

232
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:34,400
for a crowd of folks wishing a person well yeah

233
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:39,200
yeah beautiful thanks for that observation

234
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:51,440
and what also i noticed too i was having a great time um imagining my dear being just being

235
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:56,880
showered and just like oh so there was also sense of mudita

236
00:44:56,880 --> 00:45:04,000
vicarious joy for them being showered it was interesting to explore the sense

237
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:12,640
of self kind of getting a little softer or not being so so out there so they're so strong

238
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:18,560
this way and another message i've had a hard time in the past trying

239
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:23,599
to hang out in the field of meta but with this image i could really

240
00:45:23,599 --> 00:45:31,040
access that yay oh that makes me so glad yay for the person who sent me this

241
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:39,040
this reflection yay i'm celebrating yeah that makes me very glad yay so

242
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:45,760
great this is always available to you this way in great it's wonderful to know what works

243
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:52,640
we explore so many different things and each way just opens up a new dimension

244
00:45:53,200 --> 00:46:00,079
so dear ones we can save some time for on the other end when we come out of

245
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:05,599
practice groups and um and in the practice groups yay now you

246
00:46:05,599 --> 00:46:11,280
can come together with a couple of other practitioners and have a little meta party

247
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:16,640
together oh kimberly says one has one more reflection i'll share this

248
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:22,160
and then we'll go into groups um i chose someone that i saw briefly someone that

249
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:28,000
i couldn't relate to at all and for whom i felt a kind of repulsion because she was smoking a cigarette

250
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:34,400
and looked contracted and self-centered i found that she was soaked in the safety but only after

251
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:40,000
shock and awe and then she was able to open to the support and love that was coming her

252
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:45,760
way and when we were together we were holding hands and reaching out

253
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:53,680
to our support group wow thank you kimberly i'm getting chills reading your reflection

254
00:46:53,839 --> 00:47:00,319
yeah you went for the challenging category i love it and it opened up in this way

255
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:05,599
oh beautiful beautiful that's profound thank you for sharing that

256
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,800
yeah lovely oh i am so inspired by all of your practice

257
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:15,920
everyone just i'm so inspired by all of your practice thank you

258
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:24,079
so so let me make the breakout group so it'll be groups of

259
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:31,040
three and let's start with um 15 seconds of

260
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:37,200
meta silent silently for each other then you can share as much or as little

261
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:42,720
as you want with your practice partners yay practicing community so

262
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:50,319
here we go opening the rooms enjoy okay the rooms will be closed and

263
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:57,520
they're closed everyone is back so welcome back everyone we have

264
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:04,079
a few minutes for any reflections especially if you haven't spoken already or if you haven't spoken for a

265
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:08,880
while we'd love to hear from you what did you notice

266
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:15,599
don't be shy love to hear about your

267
00:48:18,839 --> 00:48:26,000
insights and you're welcome to raise your zoom hand

268
00:48:31,119 --> 00:48:38,480
yes the voice that says recording in progress is a new zoom edition so that when i

269
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:49,760
turn on the recording everybody gets notified so that's what's happening yeah um richard please

270
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:56,160
am i unmuted yes oh i just wondered about if you

271
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:02,400
find yourself sending meta to someone who's ill for example i mean does it turn into

272
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:09,599
compassion is it all right if you mix the two yeah yeah so um

273
00:49:09,599 --> 00:49:15,920
basically when metta which is love and kindness which is good will sense of may you be well may you be

274
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:21,440
happy just sense of good will comes in contact with suffering it

275
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:28,720
becomes compassion it gets expressed as compassion compassion is meta plus suffering

276
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:34,160
so that's what you're experiencing it becomes compassion it holds the suffering

277
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:39,440
um is so is that what the question is also

278
00:49:39,440 --> 00:49:47,200
if there's more needed here i'm not as confused as i thought no you're not at all you're right on

279
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:52,800
right on richard thank you jeff please uh

280
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:59,599
yeah thank you nikki i guess one thing inside i had was that you know what we commonly regard as love

281
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:07,359
in our culture like the romantic version of love is just totally and totally about self really i

282
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:12,400
mean that's really what it's about it's like i love you because of what how you're going to make me feel

283
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:19,920
and um and this is just like taking the self out of it takes away that romantic you know that

284
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:26,800
romantic type of love just takes that seems like to me it takes that just off the table it's just a totally different

285
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:33,359
kind of a thing but i'm just curious what what do you think about the relationship between you know meta as we're practicing and

286
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:40,000
the romantic love is there some overlap perhaps that i'm not seeing yeah yeah there's absolutely

287
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:47,119
overlap jeff and i so appreciate you bringing it in um so the um often our

288
00:50:47,119 --> 00:50:54,720
concept of romantic love in this culture is is love affection plus attachment

289
00:50:54,720 --> 00:51:00,079
plus obligation con a contractual you know i love you so you love me

290
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:06,960
it's not it has strings attached right so so it is possible to have romantic love

291
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:12,079
without attachment so we do we don't have to limit it to that it it

292
00:51:12,079 --> 00:51:19,280
can be i love you just as you are just with generosity um

293
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,880
and there are some couples many couples who actually reach that stage and it's

294
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,079
such a beautiful stage of romantic love that you just love the other person

295
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:36,720
just as they are with a sense of unconditional love and it's it's sacred it's holy it's

296
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:43,200
beautiful it's non-transactional so absolutely

297
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:50,880
there's there's overlap but let's let us not limit our

298
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:59,200
concept of romantic love to be this small version of what it can really be

299
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:05,599
yeah thank you for that so dear ones we have come to the end of another happy

300
00:52:05,599 --> 00:52:10,720
hour together thank you so much for the gift of your
