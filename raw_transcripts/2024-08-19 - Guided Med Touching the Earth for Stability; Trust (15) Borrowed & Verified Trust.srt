we

15
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:44,799
are arriving and settling here arriving settling

16
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,000
here feeling the connection of our feet

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:06,640
with the earth I am

18
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,280
here letting ourselves feel the connection of our sit

19
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,200
bones with the cushion the

20
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:34,400
chair just as the Buddha touched the Earth on the

21
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,120
night of his enlight Enlightenment we're touching the Earth

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:46,319
We're touching the Earth with our bodies this Earth that we're

23
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:53,280
on allowing to feel how our body is on the earth supported by gravity allowing

24
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:58,280
our body to relax the muscles to relax

25
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:09,680
feeling supported by gravity there is a sense of trust that here we

26
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:16,760
can can let go of the muscles and soften relax into our chair into our

27
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,799
cushion our seat and gravity is here we're not going to

28
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,519
go flying into the space like on a spaceship traveling even though we are

29
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:33,840
traveling through the universe and at astounding speeds and yet gravity

30
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:40,879
there's a sense of trust that yes the heart can

31
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:54,319
relax and connect with the breath this breath here

32
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,560
letting the INB breath and the out

33
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,799
breath blow flow through the body

34
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,120
it's not so much that we are consciously breathing or controlling the

35
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,880
breath and if there is this subtle control of the breath no need let that

36
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,520
go and really let the breath be

37
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,720
free calming soothing settling the mind and heart

38
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,560
we show up we show up again and again to our

39
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:30,319
practice to our meditation practice to to this moment

40
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:37,280
at this moment being aware lovingly kindly aware

41
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,319
of the breath of the body of this mind

42
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,759
states with a sense of trust

43
00:05:54,479 --> 00:06:00,919
that that we are planting seeds this practice Works in some way we

44
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:06,360
may not understand and be able to articulate

45
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,198
even it's okay but in some

46
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,880
way it works in some

47
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:29,000
way and letting this

48
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:36,560
[Music] knowing be a sense of settling

49
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,560
confidence stability as perhaps the mind wanders to

50
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:48,280
thoughts and it's okay Minds do

51
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:58,560
that inviting inviting awareness bag to settle not

52
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:04,599
with judgment or anger self- disappointment oh here you go again none

53
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:12,280
of that none of that not NE it even if very subtle so subtle

54
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:15,800
sometimes sense of

55
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,400
confidence confidence uprightness in how you're sitting how you're sitting in

56
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:33,919
your posture sitting like a

57
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:43,080
Buddha allowing your inner Buddha to be known to be

58
00:07:57,639 --> 00:08:01,440
seen one breath that is

59
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
time

60
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

61
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

62
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

63
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

64
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

65
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

66
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
e

67
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

68
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

69
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
e

70
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
e e

71
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:04,600
and if you find at any point that the mind has wandered into a story and

72
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,839
is lost remember feel the Earth feel the Earth

73
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:18,440
with your feet with your sit bones or even touching perhaps the Earth

74
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:29,240
or your cushion or your chair it's really your it's um it's a reminder I'm here

75
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:37,120
I'm here I'm on this Earth a sense of stability uprightness

76
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,120
trust

77
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:52,040
connecting connecting again and again

78
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:13,120
remember that this reconnecting is always available we might forget and

79
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:19,199
feel lost and it's so simple to turn our

80
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:26,480
attention to it so simple to just turn our attention to

81
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,279
it when when we

82
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,480
remember and it's

83
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:48,480
okay it's okay we all get lost sometimes we all do don't judge

84
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:56,439
yourself the more we judge it becomes heavier and harder

85
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:12,959
regaining connection with the body with the breath with the

86
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Earth

87
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840

100
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,720
here here

101
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:52,320
here connecting through your feet with the Earth your sit bones

102
00:24:52,320 --> 00:25:00,320
here here stabilizes the heart and mind

103

e e

111
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:20,000
as we turn slowly to bring the sitting period

112
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,769
to a [Music]

113
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:31,960
close I'm aware of how you might be feeling a little

114
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:38,000
different than when you arrived tiny bit different perhaps maybe

115
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:43,679
a little more subtle perhaps the mind is just a bit

116
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:47,600
calmer the heart

117
00:28:50,519 --> 00:28:55,480
maybe very subtle perhaps

118
00:29:01,519 --> 00:29:08,440
perhaps you feel a sense of connection with your feet to the Earth your sit

119
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:15,320
[Music] Bones the breath moving through more than you did before they're more

120
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:19,639
available just a tiny bit more

121
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:30,200
available and let these sh shifts tiny

122
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:39,039
shifts ways that the heart and mind can [Music] settle and resources of stability become

123
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,799
a little more available just tiny bit more Let It Be a source of confidence

124
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:50,960
and Trust yes

125
00:29:51,919 --> 00:30:01,600

126
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:12,559

and it take a moment to swap recordings for the next piece

139
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,720
I had forgotten how sweet it is to be with the morning s and or the 7 a.m. s

140
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:05,799
okay California time and and and see all your um Reflections all your yeah the

[Music] warmed yeah

144
00:33:23,639 --> 00:33:31,600
great so so the theme for today as you might have gathered um

145
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:37,039
actually the theme for this week is um is

146
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:44,080
confidence trust the word in poly is uh

147
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:49,399
Sada and um wait where's where are my notes hold

148
00:33:49,399 --> 00:33:55,000
on a second I'm having technical difficulty my so many windows open hold

149
00:33:55,000 --> 00:34:00,880
on here where did my notes go here we go I can always riff but it's better to

150
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:07,639
have notes Here we go there they are great okay great

151
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:14,839
lovely so so Sada the word in poly Sada s a d d

152
00:34:14,839 --> 00:34:20,118
ha a Sada I'm sure one of you will write it

153
00:34:20,119 --> 00:34:25,398
uh in chat Sada and um s Sada actually

154
00:34:25,399 --> 00:34:33,280
Sada I should say it right Sada because there is a um um elongation that the a

155
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:40,040
at the end is long Sada Sada Sada yeah that's better better poly pronunciation

156
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:49,000
poly being the language of the Buddha Sada so so the word Sada um translated

157
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:59,480
as trust confidence and sometimes faith and and um it is a very significant

158
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:05,280
uh concept and not just so much concept but in our practice I mean Buddhist is

159
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:12,720
not so much conceptual I I take I take this practice to be really practical and when I started practicing uh years and

160
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:18,440
years ago I was um I just wanted to practice I just wanted to to um I

161
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:25,640
actually said on let's uh it's said you know what I'm going to put in the chat s eyes yeah there you go Henry Henry

162
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:34,079

164
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:49,079
a delay between the zoom and the YouTube so it takes like 30 seconds after you put the um something in chat for me to

165
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:56,359
acknowledge it you know this already I know you know anyway so um so yeah I was saying that

166
00:35:56,359 --> 00:36:03,680
when I started practicing uh decades ago I was just interested in meditating and practicing and and the concepts and and

167
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:09,880
the teachings only I became interested later so the uh this is copied and paste

168
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:18,000
it from Wikipedia love it very sweet um so so Sada so it's interesting because

169
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:25,240
um some people um come to practicing meditation mindfulness or become

170
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:31,839
interested in Buddhism um from being um not interested in faith faith-based

171
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:38,599
religion somehow there's a sense of this faith in uh that we associate with um

172
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:45,440
with theistic religions with with having to have a faith in God as a uh entry to

173
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,880
the religion as uh and unless you have that ticket you can't enter

174
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:58,520
um and where and and come to the practice of mindfulness Buddhism

175
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:04,119
with because it doesn't require any beliefs it doesn't require believing anything you don't have to believe in

176
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:11,079
rebirth you don't have to believe in the but you don't have to believe in anything you don't have to believe you practice and through your practice oh

177
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:18,520
yeah I'm a little Kinder I'm a little gentle with gentler with myself or I'm a little more peaceful yeah okay oh this

178
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:26,960
this kind of works maybe I'll do more of it that it's that that kind of confidence or faith or trust that really

179
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:33,920
um we uh it's it's part of Buddhism it's not Blind Faith it's it's uh it's a

180
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:43,480
trust and confidence and faith that comes through verifying um the the results of the

181
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:49,760
practice and and also to say that um also some people come to the practice of

182
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:59,280
mindfulness and and and Buddhism also having faith in in Divinity in God in in

183
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:06,880
um you know being being Christian being Muslim being uh Jew and and also uh

184
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:13,800
practicing and and being a Buddhist and that's that's all good too that's all fine it's it's again there are no uh

185
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:21,359
there are no requirements tickets that any particular Faith or belief needs to be held it's just what what is helpful

186
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:28,680
what is wholesome what is supportive for your Humanity for your wisdom and kindness really wisdom and compassion

187
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:35,839
the two wings of the bird um how can we practice in a way that we can grow in

188
00:38:35,839 --> 00:38:42,040
those for uh in those beautiful qualities for our sake and the sake of the world so the other beliefs can can

189
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:48,280
be there you can be practicing you know chakras energies and be doing this practice

190
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:54,839
so so now the idea of trust and confidence and and and Sada Sada say it

191
00:38:54,839 --> 00:39:02,280
right Sada in in in Buddhism um it's an essential quality yeah that's

192
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:09,359
it not concept it's an essential quality for anyone anyone beginning to practice

193
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:16,200
or or continuing practice on this path there has to be some level of trust in

194
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:23,240
this practice and and the um at the beginning

195
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:29,480
of the practice the trust is often borrowed

196
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:35,560
trust so what is borrowed trust borrowed trust um I know for me for example

197
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:44,319
borrow trust was this friend of mine years and years ago I'm still grateful for when I was very sick very ill and

198
00:39:44,319 --> 00:39:50,760
and she had uh done meditation Retreats she had done um practice meditation

199
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:56,000
practice and she said you know this might support this might support not necessarily physically but might be

200
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,800
supportive in some ways and so I had trust in my friend that this is a good friend I had borrowed trust I borrowed

201
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:08,680
her trust to start practicing and go on my first 10day Meditation Retreat

202
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:14,520
because of that borrowed trust there's also borrowed trust when

203
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:19,640
we um have not just good friends but also

204
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:27,079
teachers and people that we respect and we see that oh there's something a little different about them ah I I like

205
00:40:27,079 --> 00:40:33,000
that I want that whatever that is a sense of stability confidence kindness

206
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:40,319
or whatever it is there's something that I I want to cultivate um so so it's a

207
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:47,359
borrow you're borrowing from their trust like okay there's something they've done works I'm going to borrow from um it's a

208
00:40:47,359 --> 00:40:53,560
borrowed trust that's something they've done works and then when we practice on our

209
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:59,680
own it becomes verified trust or verified faith we verify it you know

210
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:05,400
maybe even um through the sit I invited you from the beginning to the end to

211
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,560
notice so are you just a tiny little bit perhaps calmer or more peaceful oh yeah

212
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,680
okay this practice Works something about sitting in silence and and um bringing

213
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:23,599
awareness and attention to the body and the breath yet there's something about this this toolkit that works oh yeah

214
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:29,920
verified trust verified Faith verified confidence and you can have more and more and more

215
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:35,560
and more verified confidence more and more as you see how you change how you

216
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:44,960
are Kinder so so the this borrowed trust borrow

217
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:52,040
Sada and then verified uh trust at some point when we keep

218
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:58,640
practicing it becomes unshakable trust it becomes unshakeable able trust and

219
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:05,240
confidence um in in these teachings that they really really work they work for me

220
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:11,119
they work for me so different levels and also there's one more type of Faith or

221
00:42:11,119 --> 00:42:16,240
trust I'll mention sometimes it's bright very bright Faith bright trust maybe we

222
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:23,359
come to the teachings at the very beginning there's this bright Faith bright trust that uh it's very bright

223
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:30,720
and then it becomes more verified through our own practice until it becomes unshakable there's a sense of

224
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:39,040
stability to it trust faith can be particularly

225
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:45,680
helpful um at the times when we feel unored when we feel lost and we all feel

226
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:52,960
lost at some point in our lives maybe at times of transition um at times of

227
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:58,200
difficulty uh we just don't know which way to go what to do there's a sense of

228
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:04,240
being completely unored perhaps um as if we're we're falling and there's nothing

229
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:10,440
to hang on to and that that borrowed trust just a little bit of trust in

230
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:17,960
something little bit of trust in something and it doesn't have to be huge

231
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:25,000
trust it could just be a little bit of trust for example if if you wake up and you're feeling out of sorts and there's

232
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,880
a lot of Doubt coming that out about

233
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,240
everything finding just something little maybe as I was bringing the meditation

234
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:40,760
just bringing a sense of trust and confidence in oh my feet are touching

235
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:47,000
the Earth okay trust confidence and gravity okay

236
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:52,359
that I can just sit here for a moment just tiny little bits of trust and

237
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:58,559
confidence and if it's physical embodied it even better even more

238
00:43:58,559 --> 00:44:07,000
supportive to support us through times of uh um yeah lack of trust doubt a lot

239
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:13,880
of TR um yeah a lot more to say but I realize i' yeah well we have four more

240
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:20,280
days on the topic so I'll I'll speak about those um one thing I wanted to say

241
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:29,280
is invitation for the rest of the day to um to notice this to notice areas of

242
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:37,800
trust to notice areas of trust and also notice areas of lack of trust um where

243
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:44,400
where there can be trust oh well maybe I don't have trust in this but can I have a little bit of confidence a little bit

244
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,960
of confidence in this yes maybe I feel overwhelmed by this project ah but can I

245
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:55,920
have trust confidence that I can take this first small little step maybe just

246
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:02,079
I don't know open this book and just read the first line or or just answer this one email or or

247
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:07,839
again just breathe and feel my feet on the earth so notice where there is trust

248
00:45:07,839 --> 00:45:13,880
where there is trust because the more you notice trust and confidence the more it grows you notice that yeah it's there

249
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:20,559
it's really here there's so much of it here okay all right so um thank you all

250
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:26,559
for your practice thank you so much for your presence all around the world um

251
00:45:26,559 --> 00:45:33,520
and look forward to exploring so many different aspects of trust this was just the introduction of course today dipping

252
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:40,200
our toes may all beings be well may all beings be

253
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,640
happy have a great day
