1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:09,639
well thank you those of you who uh are listening and reported and the sound on here we're here at IRC and

2
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:16,118
you can't see much I thought you'd be able to see more um maybe at the end of this I can zoom the camera out and you

3
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:23,480
can see the meditation Hall today is being uh been claimed

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,000
for a training we're doing so it doesn't look like exactly like a meditation Hall

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,120
but there's a couple of people here meditating with us in person which is unusual for me in when I'm doing this

6
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:43,800
YouTube uh teaching so I'm very happy so uh welcome

7
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,800
everyone

8
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,920
and so this week in the morning I've been offering

9
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:00,960
these little snippet of sayings that you can use in your meditation practice

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,520
and um sometimes we can say yes as a way of

11
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:14,880
enhancing our awareness just be present for what's happening sometimes there's a wonderful no to what's happening no to

12
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,960
being distracted that puts us into the present moment yesterday I talked about

13
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:25,799
the little saying no comment just to be aware of what's there without adding any

14
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:32,200
comments that's not all you know not necessarily appropriate and in everyday life but in meditation there's something

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:39,159
very profound about just not getting involved not judging not talking about

16
00:01:39,159 --> 00:01:46,240
what's happening in your experience but allowing everything in AR rise in meditation just be there without any

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:54,000
comment and and uh and so today the culmination of this of these four

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,840
little mantras that I offered is um could be another one but

19
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,640
it's what they're they're all leading to and I mentioned in on Tuesday a

20
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:14,040
little bit this way is as well and that is the word no that's spelled k n o

21
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:23,599
w that all the others were meant to lead us to a very radical simple

22
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:29,480
state that simply knows what's happening as it's being

23
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:36,920
known and yes it can be yes to what

24
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:42,000
arises as long as it is known almost like we can get out of Our

25
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,840
Own Way in The Knowing there's something very profound it's kind of like um a uh

26
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:55,120
one of those kids toys a Jack In The Box where you take the lid off and the Jack

27
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,800
jumps up you know Springs out it's finally released its tension because it has space

28
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,200
there's something about releasing tension that allows whatever needs to unfold to

29
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:14,159
unfold and so today no k n o w just know

30
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,920
maybe that could be the two words just know just know what's

31
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,040
happening keep it that simple what's happening just know it and

32
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:31,400
if it's not obvious uh how you recognize it or label

33
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:40,000
it or um it's okay to just know it as something something is being known or

34
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:46,280
confusion is known not knowing is

35
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:54,200
known and so in the back of the meditation practice as we settle in on mindfulness of breathing and being here

36
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:01,280
to um to um

37
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:09,920
stay close to just knowing so assuming a meditation

38
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,440
posture and there is a a kind of

39
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,520
knowing that happens through the body embodied knowing or the

40
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:31,720
body not just feeling and sensing but the body recognizing

41
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:39,000
a posture a way of composing the

42
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,919
body that feels right that feels

43
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:49,840
appropriate for whatever conditions we have in our

44
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,160
life and gently closing the

45
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:18,000
eyes and there is a kind of knowing in how the body experiences

46
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,319
breathing it's not commentary it's not judgment but there's a knowing that the

47
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:31,440
body has of a breathing that's Pleasant or

48
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:38,960
unpleasant comfortable or uncomfortable a breathing which is

49
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:45,319
tense with resistance or holding or recognizing a breathing with

50
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:50,960
its fluid breathing

51
00:05:54,600 --> 00:06:00,280
easily with no judgment no comment

52
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:07,680
just knowing knowing what breathing knows

53
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,400
what breathing feels the body feels

54
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:19,479
as nose recognizes as you breathe

55
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:01,800
and then as you exhale you relax let

56
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,319
go settle

57
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:31,520
in

58
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
e

59
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

60
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
for

61
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
for

62
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
for

63
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
for

64
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

65
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,240
e

66
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
for

67
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
e

68
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,160
for for

69
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:02,079
for

70
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,320
in the practice of just

71
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:58,160
knowing it's knowing what is obvious without any any need to search

72
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,720
or figure out out or

73
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:14,160
analyze and sometimes that means knowing you don't

74
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:21,079
know or knowing just that something is

75
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:28,000
happening or confusion or chaos

76
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:39,519
keeping the knowing radically

77
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:43,000
simple just

78
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
know

79
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

80
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
e

81
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
e

82
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

83
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

84
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

85
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,720
e for

86
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,640
for

87
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

88
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

89
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

90
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

91
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
e

92
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320
e

93
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
e

94
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,278
e for

95
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:39,399
and then as we come to the end of this sitting I would like to evoke

96
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:48,960
a a little truism or a little aphorism that I've learned from the field of

97
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,640
psychotherapy that adults

98
00:26:55,640 --> 00:27:02,120
uh need to be heard children need to be

99
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:11,720
seen and the combination of those for me is people need to be

100
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:16,760
known and that there's something about seeing

101
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:26,840
hearing knowing that can carry love can carry care

102
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:32,440
respect that appreciation that we can know we can

103
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:40,120
offer our capacity to know someone else and that knowing comes along with

104
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:44,840
these wonderful capacities we

105
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:52,039
have to see with love see with care with

106
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:58,919
kindness and may it be that this practice that we do supports us not not just to be

107
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:04,559
mindful in the world but supports us so that our

108
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:11,320
mindfulness is carried along with kindness with good

109
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:17,919
will any one of the social emotions that where we care for each other we

110
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:25,240
appreciate each other may we know

111
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:32,120
others so they they feel valued

112
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:38,880
appreciated may all beings be

113
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:48,039
happy may all beings be safe may all beings be

114
00:28:48,039 --> 00:28:56,320
peaceful may all beings be free

115
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:19,450
is [Laughter]

116
00:29:19,450 --> 00:29:25,409
[Music]

117
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:42,519
so thank you all very much and I saw there were some comments

118
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:50,880
about a high pitched buzzing sound and um and uh I'm going to uh turn off what

119
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:56,640
I think is the input for the sound uh while I drink some water and

120
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:04,000
maybe some of you can tell me if that uh buzzing sound stops

121
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:54,640
so I see these comments that the sound has stopped the hissing has stopped but now that I've turn the mic on again is

122
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,840
it better is it back

123
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:09,200
also I see that um the video camera goes as a couple of

124
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:14,519
times goes out of focus and I wonder if the camera we have here at the IRC is

125
00:31:14,519 --> 00:31:20,399
very sensitive to the tuning in zeroing in on someone and then if they move

126
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:29,279
maybe it goes out of focus a little bit I've never seen this before but um

127
00:31:30,039 --> 00:31:36,799
so the buzzing stopped before you concluding remarks it's already stopped very curious I'm going to try

128
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:40,919
one thing and see if I can get the sound to come

129
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:51,039
back so there I replicated something that I took

130
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:55,638
apart before when I saw the sound

131
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:07,320
so I think it have to wait a little bit here because it takes about 15 20 seconds

132
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:13,080
for uh this to what what I do here to be broadcast

133
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:18,279
on YouTube and then to get um

134
00:32:18,279 --> 00:32:23,919
messages so sound was fixed in the middle of meditation the buzzing is back

135
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:29,840
okay and now it should be completely gone

136
00:32:33,639 --> 00:32:40,440
so I think what the problem was is I had um two electrical devices a a electric

137
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:46,720
clock on top of my the laptop and also the remote control for the camera on the

138
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:55,200
wall over there and maybe they were somehow um um The

139
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,840
Crickets so then now it's gone again gone again yeah that's what it is it's

140
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:08,080
uh I can't have those two things sitting on my computer it somehow has enough electrical

141
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:14,399
interference so that was a little bit of a different thing so here I am at IRC

142
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,600
very happy to be here with two of the uh

143
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:26,159
former or present resident volunteers who sitting here with us and and um very

144
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:33,279
happy to be here and this is a concluding now a talk on uh the themes

145
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,320
from this ancient Buddhist text as I keep saying it's some scholars believe

146
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:44,519
it's the oldest uh teaching in Buddhism the Buddha's first teachings perhaps and

147
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:50,080
um in the appendix of the book I go into some of the reasons people think this

148
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:55,799
and uh the evidence for that and um and that there are three

149
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:01,039
four themes that I've selected out of this and it's perhaps these themes are

150
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:06,120
things that are subjective to me um especially this last one we're going to

151
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:12,520
do today so the first one is uh it's really clear in the text it's repeated over and over again this idea of not

152
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:18,158
clinging to any kind of views and not holding some religious views as being

153
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:25,839
better than others or more Superior ultimate just not getting involved in that comparison at all and not depending

154
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:32,480
on any religious do Doctrine beliefs um but rather depending on what we can know

155
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:38,158
and see directly for ourselves and in doing so the second theme uh not

156
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:45,079
clinging to sensual desires because we know and see the downside of that we

157
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:50,720
know and see for ourselves that uh how we're limited by our by the attachment

158
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:58,119
to sensual desires so again it's not because someone tells us or there's a rule that you should like let go of

159
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:04,240
sensual desires but some uh it's to really have understood for oneself seen

160
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:09,839
and known for oneself that uh sensual desire being caught in them is not

161
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:15,359
beneficial and it's actually better not to be caught in them so it's not a

162
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:23,839
Doctrine here that is presenting Authority like this is what you should do it's a teaching about uh developing

163
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:29,040
your own capacity to know and see for yourself and those two verbs knowing and

164
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:35,280
seeing are the most common kind of description of the practice that is in this

165
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,680
text and then uh the descript third third theme was the descriptions of this

166
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:46,240
age and those descriptions like for example of not clinging to anything not

167
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,760
craving to anything might seem kind of pretty far Advanced pretty impossible to

168
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:57,839
do however it is naturalistic it is something humanistic we can understand

169
00:35:57,839 --> 00:36:04,280
understand that we can understand that we have craving and we can understand those times when they're not there and

170
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:12,319
um and it's so it's not tied to some kind of Supernatural belief something that uh some ultimate state of um uh you

171
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:19,359
know of Mind alter State of Consciousness it uh again it's dependent on what can be seen and known for

172
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:25,240
oneself even though it might seem pretty uh pretty distant to have no craving or

173
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:33,560
clinging at all and then the last theme the fourth one is training cultivating developing

174
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:43,200
oneself and um and the remarkable thing about uh this is that uh in this text um

175
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:51,119
the um uh it isn't so much that training is a training to get

176
00:36:51,720 --> 00:37:00,560
anywhere there is in a way I'll explain in a minute but it's not so much about getting somewhere but but it is um a

177
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:05,720
training uh to be the goal so what I

178
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:11,480
mean by this is that um if the goal is non-

179
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:19,000
craving then the training to that goal is to stop craving maybe in small pieces

180
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:26,560
gradually over time so that the non- craving grows and develops until the full non- craving is experienced so

181
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:32,839
we're actually practic practicing the whole goal that we're going towards each

182
00:37:32,839 --> 00:37:39,280
moment if the if the goal is to be peaceful to have a deep abiding sense of

183
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:46,960
peace in our hearts and uh that the way to tr train for that is to begin finding

184
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:52,240
peace here knowing peace here letting go into peace

185
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:58,920
here and so there's not a real sharp distinction between the training and the

186
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,319
goal of the training uh it's like exercising to become stronger uh you

187
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:09,760
become stronger by doing the things that make you strong and

188
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:16,760
um and so uh you know if you need to need to get become a strong Walker so

189
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:23,040
you can walk well you begin walking maybe and so walking is the way to be to

190
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:30,440
become a good walker so um so the idea that uh so the the goal is not such a

191
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:36,000
distant one this way it's not like we have to uh try for years to kind of

192
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:41,040
develop high levels of concentration or really sharp mindfulness or going into

193
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:47,760
deep states of meditation um those can all happen but uh and they might have their role at

194
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:56,160
times but uh here in this text the the idea is to find the goal in the

195
00:38:56,160 --> 00:39:04,680
means uh to practice the goal until the goal becomes perfected in a sense and um

196
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:10,440
so not clinging to views and beliefs maybe it's hard to do that but uh but

197
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:15,599
then we practice that the best we can and how do we practice this uh through

198
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:22,200
this knowing and seeing we know and see as we practice as we train as we engage

199
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:28,200
in our life we can know and feel oh this does not feel peaceful this do this

200
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:34,720
feels like a lot of clinging here going on and um and so it's in that direct

201
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:42,119
knowing of the downside of clinging of agitation that we understand the value

202
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:50,240
of not continuing that which leads to that more of that so here the sage the wise one uh

203
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:57,920
has all the information they need for doing this practice in themselves through their own abilities to know

204
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:04,839
and see um

205
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:11,960
so um the book of eights focuses on

206
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:17,079
fundamental personal and psychological Transformations for which individuals

207
00:40:17,079 --> 00:40:22,160
are personally responsible quote train fully in your

208
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:30,160
own Release Train fully in your own liberation and then uh elsewhere it says

209
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,760
a monastic should not seek peace from

210
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,400
others the text provides no help from gods or external forces to many modern

211
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:49,599
readers this will be less revolutionary message than it probably was in the Buddhist

212
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:57,000
time in focusing on cultivating behaviors and virtues the book of eights rarely mentions specific techniques or

213
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,200
practice practices stated differently the text doesn't emphasize religious

214
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:10,280
practices that can be seen as steps towards attaining the qualities of an ideal person furthermore it explicitly

215
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:17,440
and provocatively says that religious observances and practices in themselves

216
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:23,400
are not adequate for becoming a person at peace rather it encourages people to

217
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:31,839
Simply behave like an ideal Sage not to pretend not to act it out but to

218
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:37,400
in the knowing and seeing to understand how in the moment we can act like a sage

219
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:43,160
without clinging even if the clinging is close by or keeps

220
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:49,520
reappearing so I'll read a couple

221
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:53,800
of um

222
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:27,960
those who say virtue is Ultimate dedicate themselves to Purity

223
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:35,240
and religious observances only by training in this will there be Purity they say claiming

224
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:40,400
to be skillful they are faced with further

225
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:47,480
becoming further building up themselves and attachment one who falls away from

226
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,160
virtue and observances trembles at having failed at the task and hopes for

227
00:42:53,160 --> 00:43:02,079
Longs for Purity as a PO poor far off traveler hopes for Longs for

228
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:07,720
home but whoever has let go of all virtuous conduct and

229
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:13,839
observances as well as all actions blamable and

230
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:19,079
blameless and who has no wishes for Purity or

231
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:27,960
impurity lives without indulging not even taking up peace

232
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:35,079
that's just a radical message um so you don't find the peace that the Buddha is looking for through

233
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:40,160
virtuous conduct through practices religious

234
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:46,280
practices but also not without them you don't find it by being blameless in your

235
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:52,559
actions but you also don't find it by uh doing things which are blamable neither

236
00:43:52,559 --> 00:43:57,760
are the way there this is not a teaching to just be free to do whatever you want

237
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:04,920
independent of whether you harm others or not but it's not to find your peace in all those things there's another

238
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:10,040
possibility and don't even take up peace don't hold on to it don't make it it's

239
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:15,240
there's something else and then also a problematic is says

240
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:20,880
whoever depends on austerities uh whales for

241
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:29,319
Purity not free from craving for becoming and not becoming longing comes from wanting and

242
00:44:29,319 --> 00:44:36,720
with planning there is fear but with no death and rebirth as a

243
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,960
concern how could one fear what could one long

244
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:49,240
for someone asked the Buddha that Doctrine some say that is best others

245
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:57,599
say is inferior as they all claim to be experts which statement is true

246
00:44:57,599 --> 00:45:04,119
they s Buddha says they say their own Doctrine is perfect they say the doctrine of others is inferior

247
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:10,559
quarreling so they dispute everyone saying their own opinion is

248
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:20,000
true but the true Brahman are not led by others when considering doctrines

249
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:26,240
believed they have therefore gone beyond disputes indeed they see none of these

250
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,200
doctrines as the

251
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:38,960
best they who are in trenched in teachings who Revere preconceived views

252
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:45,839
and are not easy to train whatever they depend on they say is beautiful is

253
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:53,640
Purity is where they see truth however the true

254
00:45:53,640 --> 00:46:00,720
Sage sages don't make up don't make things up they don't follow views

255
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,359
religious views Doctrine or bind themselves to

256
00:46:06,359 --> 00:46:13,000
knowledge knowing the many commonplace opinions they are equanimous thinking

257
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:21,240
this is what others hold on to free of worldly ties sages here don't follow any

258
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:29,920
faction in a dispute peaceful among those not at peace a animous thinking that is what

259
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:35,160
others hold on to they don't hold on to

260
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:41,280
anything having giving given up old attachments without forming new ones

261
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:46,760
they neither pursue desires nor get entrenched in doctrines free from

262
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:52,960
viewpoints not clinging to the world wise ones have no self

263
00:46:52,960 --> 00:47:01,640
reproach they are not an enemy to any Doctrine not forming opinions not closed down and

264
00:47:01,640 --> 00:47:11,480
not desirous they are sages wise ones who have laid down their

265
00:47:11,559 --> 00:47:19,319
burden so that's chapter 13 in this book the

266
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:27,000
Buddha before Buddhism so this has been an important book for me I spent about 20 years on

267
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:33,720
and off uh translating I I first started translating it when I was um in graduate

268
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:42,200
school studying doing Buddhist studies I did it as a kind of had some extra time during a summer break and I was so uh

269
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:49,359
fascinated by this book that just for my own sake to understand it better I started translating it and and did a few

270
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:54,760
few of the chapters and and then came back to it over time and spent a lot of

271
00:47:54,760 --> 00:48:02,160
time reflecting on it I read a wonderful book about by a teacher named uh scholar named Grace berford was uh her doctoral

272
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,599
dissertation on this book and that made a big impact on me and added to my love

273
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:13,520
of this particular text and um and uh now I share it with

274
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:19,960
you so thank you very much for being part of this this week and that I could share something that's been valuable for

275
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:26,319

276
00:48:26,319 --> 00:48:31,520
fortunate to be able to share uh something that it's so dear and and

277
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:37,800
deeply loved by me and I hope that it supports you in being a sage supports

278
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:42,920
you in relying on what you can know and see directly for yourself without

279
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:48,359
recourse to holding on to religious beliefs including Buddhist ones

280
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:54,720
including what I teach so thank you very much
