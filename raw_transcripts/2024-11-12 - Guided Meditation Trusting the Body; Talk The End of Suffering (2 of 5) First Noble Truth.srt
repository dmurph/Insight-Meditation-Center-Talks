00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:07,400
hello and welcome welcome to this next 30

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:14,519
minutes where we'll meditate

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:21,960
together over this medium of electronics that we have that connects

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:27,160
us in a way that respects or

5
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:34,960
acknowledges the vast vast way web of humanity that we're part of and

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,120
that has been interconnected for a long time

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:46,878
between people and people the seven

8
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:56,120
n kind of layers of Separation that used to connect us is now maybe much

9
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:03,559
smaller thank you for being here and today going back to basics

10
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:07,280
and Basics is

11
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:16,280
not is not meant only for beginners in some ways the longer we've

12
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,680
meditated the more we appreciate the basics as being quite

13
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,920
profound and today the want to talk about mindfulness of the

14
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,840
body and the body and mind are not so distinct

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,119
it's hard to really tease them apart especially in our experience of the body

16
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,560
in our experience of the mind if we step back and talk about it think about it we

17
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,640
might be able to come up with Concepts and ideas that keep them

18
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:57,880
distinct but in our direct experience here and

19
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:03,200
now and the body is the way we experience the

20
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,720
body sense it feel it is in

21
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:16,319
separable from the mind for one reason is that we don't

22
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,560
know exactly the beginning and end of the mind but perhaps we could think of

23
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:27,200
it as being this inclusive of all the neurological

24
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:33,560
connections uh that exist throughout our body body and it's only with the nerves

25
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:41,239
all over our body that we can feel the body so those nerves are part of the

26
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:46,480
mind and how they fire and how they report to the rest of

27
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:53,319
us is uh contributes to our constructing the the sense of our

28
00:02:53,319 --> 00:03:01,000
body and then we have nerves that pick up all kinds of things nerves are

29
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,920
the body the the experience of the

30
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:14,080
body is um kind of like an antenna an antenna that receives

31
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,440
information from the world around us invaluable information through the

32
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,080
body the ears the eyes the nose The

33
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:32,439
Taste and it's also an antenna that

34
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:37,480
transmits transmits information to the world around us and transmits

35
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:43,920
information within us to ourselves to the conscious mind where we

36
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,720
register what's happening and what the antenna picks up

37
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:56,439
is amazingly complex or extensive not

38
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:02,879
just Sensations on the skin and but but deep in the body

39
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:09,239
biochemical physiological processes are picked up in the heart and

40
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:15,120
the stomach and all over and the more we can rest in the

41
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:21,560
body the more we can be aware of the body the more information we

42
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:31,320
have but more important the more we are at home at ease relaxed in the body

43
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:38,800
the more the body will support us to be at ease to feel

44
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,240
peace to feel safe and some of the challenges we have

45
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:53,720
the body is the ways that our conscious mind transmits information to all over

46
00:04:53,720 --> 00:05:00,400
the body that there's something to be afraid of fear anxiety

47
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:08,919
desires and aversions so assuming a meditation

48
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:18,240
posture and part of the posture that you take for meditation let it be a

49
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:25,360
posture that confidently shows your body your

50
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,960
mind that you are confident

51
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:38,720
confident and for now for these minutes in meditation that you're

52
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,800
safe if you have any anxieties and fears that are

53
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:53,000
operating chances are the object of it is not present here

54
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,840
and now in your direct experience

55
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,120
and so it can be very profound to let the

56
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:15,840
body help you to feel at ease for these few minutes to feel deeply

57
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:22,639
safe here and now and if we relax the

58
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:31,000
body a confident postured body it's remarkable the support support

59
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,240
and the care it provides to the

60
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,759
Mind gently closing the

61
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:49,360
eyes and taking a few moments to feel your body in whatever

62
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,918
way you feel

63
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,879
it scanning through the

64
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:31,440
body and if you feel any anxiety in your body

65
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:41,560
body trust it to your body the body is a quite a phenomenal

66
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:48,400
antenna and support processor for how we

67
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,440
feel rather than churning on in the mind

68
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,440
feel from the inside out the body

69
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:14,680
and as you exhale to relax the

70
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,800
body relaxing the muscles of the face

71
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,760
softening in the shoulders

72
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,399
softening in the

73
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:33,079
belly as you inhale feel the

74
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:41,000
expansion of the rib cage the Torso the belly

75
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,560
with the inhale and the expansion of your

76
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:13,480
torso feel your body become larger

77
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:21,839
Fuller having more room to feel what's

78
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:34,240
here and to soften relax as you

79
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
exhale

80
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
for for

81
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:19,519
perhaps relaxing the thinking

82
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,480
mind with every exhale

83
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:59,440
whatever restlessness or agitation there is in the control tower

84
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:05,000
of the thinking mind with every

85
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,010
exhale letting that agitation settle

86
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:18,279
[Music] more settle down into the

87
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
body

88
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
e for

89
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:31,959
e for

90
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:20,639
as you breathe to feel how the body experiences

91
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:30,199
itself centering attention in the body

92
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:36,240
rather than having it centered in the control tower of

93
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:52,360
thinking softening calming in the body so the body

94
00:16:52,360 --> 00:17:00,040
begins to transmit feelings of being safe

95
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:07,880
Here and Now feelings of being at ease

96
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,798
peace Here and

97
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
Now

98
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840

99

for for

106
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,240
as you exhale as you

107
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:25,799
inhale spread your awareness through your body

108
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:38,279
so that whatever challenges you have in your body are

109
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:43,279
resting in a wider space of the

110
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
body

111
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

112
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

113
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,360
for

114
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,320

115
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
for

116
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
for

117
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
for

118
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
for for

119
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:41,200
and as we come to the end of this sitting to

120
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:44,200
gently

121
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,240
softly sense and

122
00:27:52,519 --> 00:27:56,880
feel your body

123
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:05,120
maybe the body that is just beyond the

124
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:11,679
edges of breathing whatever Sensations associated

125
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:19,679
with breathing gently spread your attention

126
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:34,799
Beyond spread your attention into to the parts of the body where there's a feeling

127
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:41,039
of Cal

128
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:55,590
ease and to whatever degree however minor you have feelings of calm or

129
00:28:55,590 --> 00:29:01,759
[Music] ease or feelings of being

130
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:06,960
safe let that register through your

131
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:13,799
body let that register in your heart in your mind

132
00:29:29,399 --> 00:29:34,799
and then to consider how wonderful it would

133
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:43,440
be if others could feel safe could feel at peace and

134
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:49,679
calm in their body in their hearts and their

135
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,320
minds that everyone who is anxious and

136
00:29:56,320 --> 00:30:05,120
Afraid could be deep deeply reassured right down into their

137
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:14,760
marrow deep in their body and may it be that how we live our

138
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:24,039
day contributes to others feeling safe others feel feeling that they can

139
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:29,760
be at ease at least with

140
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:34,960
th may all beings be

141
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:40,279
happy may all beings be

142
00:30:40,279 --> 00:30:46,559
safe may all beings be

143
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:52,559
peaceful and may all beings be free

144
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:03,528
[Music]

145
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:13,600
thank

146
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,919
you e

147
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,799
so hello and welcome to these teachings and this week the topic is the four

148
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:27,519
noble truths and after doing the introduction yesterday I'll start today with the

149
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:34,519
fourth the first Noble Truth who is the Noble Truth of suffering and as also as an introduction

150
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:41,679
to it the guided meditation that I just did was on mindfulness of the

151
00:32:41,679 --> 00:32:48,080
body and the reason for that is that um The Suffering that they approach to

152
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:54,600
suffering to really know it well is not so much through the mind but rather

153
00:32:54,600 --> 00:33:01,799
through feeling it experientially here and now in the body to know what's happening in

154
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:08,880
the in the experienced life that we live not in the imagined life not in the

155
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:15,240
projected life into the future not in the remembered life but here and now the

156
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:22,000
experienced life the lived life of now and for many of us it's really through

157
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:28,639
the body that we can feel the greatest sense of aliveness the greater sense of

158
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:35,760
being connected to life itself and to ourselves and the most useful way of

159
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:41,519
being present for the first Noble Truth which is

160
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:51,000
suffering and um the um so the first Noble Truth uh as it's

161
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,760
come down to us is a very simple statement it says um uh

162
00:33:58,760 --> 00:34:04,039
there is the Noble Truth of suffering and

163
00:34:04,039 --> 00:34:09,878
um you know that's it so that requires a little bit of an unpacking and first the

164
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:17,280
word noble uh it's uh some one translator translated the ennobling truth of

165
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:25,240
suffering that there's a what it implies that suffering by itself is not ennobling or Noble or

166
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:30,760
or special um what's uh

167
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:36,200
ennobling is the possibility of

168
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:44,000
meeting suffering honestly seeing it clearly and finding a path through it to

169
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:50,520
the other side to bring suffering to an end but to go through it is to really

170
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:57,359
know it well to really understand it well maybe to see whatever suffering we

171
00:34:57,359 --> 00:35:04,280
have is uh a messenger and what is the message what is it that needs to be

172
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:13,320
learned what is we need to be present for here and um and um many people when they

173
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,760
have uh challenges in their lives they have uh all kinds of things they're

174
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,079
grieving or distressed about or stressed or

175
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:31,160
afraid one of the invaluable reports that can happen is to have a friend who

176
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:39,079
will listen be accompanied by someone for a walk in the park or sit and have tea together and the friend doesn't uh

177
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:45,920
judge doesn't try to fix but really takes in experiences compassionately

178
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:52,079
fully uh in a friendly way in a caring way uh what you're experiencing you can

179
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:58,760
you can explain you can say what's happening and your friend just receives it and

180
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:05,240
uh and it's so good to be received to be known to be heard and uh by someone

181
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:13,160
who's calm and settled and available and so in the same way uh this

182
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:19,599
ennobling the en nobling attitude of how to be with suffering is to be our own

183
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:26,400
good friend to really stop and be able to take time for to really know what

184
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:33,520
this suffering is and that has to be done with a lot of care and love and attention about the uh

185
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:42,079
how much we can tolerate how much we can open up to at any given time but this is the message of the Buddha is that um the

186
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:50,480
direct way to Freedom the direct way to uh peace is not by avoiding suffering

187
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:56,920
but learning how to stop to recognize it the I sometimes in a silly way say that

188
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:03,520
the the the bumper sticker for Buddhists it would say I stop for

189
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:08,880
suffering not to suffer more but to really kind of be present for it and

190
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:14,880
offer this ennobling attention to really know it and see it and the bumper

191
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:20,960
sticker uh doesn't have any pronouns as I as I talked about yesterday that um

192
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:28,520
and so we stop if others are suffering maybe we stop to be their friend to uh

193
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:35,640
accompany them for a while around it to what's going on and support them if we're suffering we stop and pay

194
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:41,720
attention and um there's many ways of stopping I mean I uh sometimes it's

195
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:50,440
meditating sometimes it's sitting having cup of tea sometimes it's going for a walk in a in a calm relaxing place so we

196
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:57,200
can really take time for it as opposed to just go head long into our busyness

197
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:02,560
or or sit and uh and just kind of have a way of sitting and lost lost in the

198
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:09,040
Fring lost in the preoccupation lost in the anxiety about what we're experiencing our

199
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:16,280
reactivity so this en nobling the noble um is not inherent nobility is not

200
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:22,440
inherent in suffering but it's what we bring and how we are with

201
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:28,160
suffering and then suffering itself the word in poly is Dua

202
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:35,079
and um and it's a difficult word for some English speakers because partly the word suffering implies you know really

203
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:41,000
big things catastrophes and um and partly because

204
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:47,720
uh in that we're coming to an end of suffering it seems like um our some of suffering we have is we don't want to

205
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:55,400
end it doesn't seem right to push it away or stop it or you know just seems like it's inherent part of life that a a

206
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:02,119
parent maybe who loses a child would feel emotional pain and are we supposed

207
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:07,760
to not have that the the uh the Dua that we're

208
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:16,920
talking about here is um the emotional pain that arises from our

209
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,280
reactivity not from the deep empathy not from the deep sense of

210
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:29,240
connectedness that uh where there is no attachments there is no fear there is no

211
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:35,920
um uh hostility or or conceit around it it it's possible

212
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:44,160
to experience certain kind of emotional pain in the world have be heartbroken for example and uh and be at ease with

213
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:51,599
it not only be at ease but feel its part of the fullness of a relaxed free life

214
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,599
to feel both the joys and Sorrows of this world but the Dua the suffer uing

215
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:06,280
of the first Noble Truths is the suffering which doesn't have to be there uh so it's a a subset

216
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:14,680
of all the different ways that we can feel some emotional pain it's the emotional pain that comes from uh

217
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,800
clinging from craving from react uh

218
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,680
hostility from being caught in something being contracted around something uh

219
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:31,680
where the desires are so strong that that there's a compulsivity to the desires where there's compulsivity to

220
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:40,000
the hostility we have that there is something extra that's going on and as we

221
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,839
start being honest about our suffering stopping and getting to know it uh and

222
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:51,319
we're experiencing it through the body we start being able to tease

223
00:40:51,319 --> 00:40:58,440
apart that suffering that emotional pain which is fine to have in a certain way

224
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:05,599
it feels like this is part of a lived life versus the kind of suffering which

225
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,119
clearly uh comes from some kind of reactivity some kind of attachment that

226
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:17,000
we're really holding on to that we don't have to hold on to that we're better off

227
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,319
without and so the importance of mindfulness of the body is that with through mindfulness of the body we're

228
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:29,520
learning a number of different things we're learning to be present for our discomfort our emotional

229
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:35,280
discomfort uh in a relaxed way letting the hold it in the body letting the body

230
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:41,440
process it letting the body reveal to us what's there that is more holistic than

231
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:48,400
if we only understanding our emotional discomfort from our thinking mind they

232
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:55,640
only have it from our thinking about it through the lens of our fear hostility

233
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:02,839
or self pre occupation in and of itself and so we're kind of breaking the

234
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:08,640
hegemony of the reactive uh self-

235
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:14,800
preoccupied contracted thinking Mind by dropping down into the body to feel our

236
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:23,440
discomfort emotional discomfort and to learn how to be nonreactive to it to learn how to be

237
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:30,720
present for it in a very simple open caring way to be present for it as if we're own

238
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:37,960
our own best friend and learning to breathe with emotional discomfort learning to feel it and this is a tall

239
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:43,520
order it's not easy to do this but the rewards of doing it are phenomenal the

240
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:49,440
rewards of having being able to have a non-reactive attention that doesn't add

241
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:57,280
or subtract doesn't uh push or pull is not uh rejecting or accepting but just

242
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:05,559
there and feeling and being present then we can begin seeing more clearly then we

243
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:14,200
can see uh at some point that kind of emotional discomfort pain which is kind

244
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:19,800
of deeply part of something precious as a human being maybe it's part of love

245
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:25,960
and care and and um that doesn't you know that it's okay to have in a certain

246
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:32,359
way that it's not troubling but rather troubling it's actually in certain kind

247
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:39,480
of way enriching because it arises from deep in the heart deep in within us we see that

248
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:46,040
on one hand and on the other hand we experience that oh this is extra this

249
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:51,359
has to do with my reactivity my attachments this has to do with my

250
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:57,720
rejecting or my wanting something so strongly that I'm filled with disappointment and anger that I can't

251
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:03,200
have it this has to do with my heartbreak that is

252
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:09,040
not because the discomfort of losing something losing but rather it's

253
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:14,520
heartbreak because my whole sense of self was tied up in this thing this

254
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,800
person this experience and I was really attached to that in order to whatever

255
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:24,839
reason and so we start teasing apart that which is kind of comes with human

256
00:44:24,839 --> 00:44:31,359
being in a relaxed and and um maybe meaningful way and that which that

257
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,280
suffering which is extra that has to do with our what we're

258
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:44,440
contributing and so the first Noble truth the truth of suffering there is

259
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:50,079
suffering in this world there's no way that a human being is not going to have some kind of

260
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:57,440
emotional pain going through this life and can we clarify our for our

261
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:05,160
elves so that what kind of emotional pain we're having so that it's not uh

262
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:11,880
diminishing in us it's not draining us it's not uh harming ourselves even by

263
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:17,920
the reactivity by which we feel it and so the path to that one of them is to

264
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:25,280
get to know the suffering well stop for suffering but learn how to do that learn

265
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:31,720
how to be present through the body to relax to breathe with the disc uh

266
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:40,400
emotional discomfort until there's a subtleness and openness that we can now uh begin

267
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:46,520
seeing receiving from the body almost the information that tells us um whether

268
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:51,800
this is healthy for us as part of a healthy life or this is unhealthy to

269
00:45:51,800 --> 00:46:00,160
have this kind of caught upness with what we're doing and uh and if we do that then uh

270
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:06,520
it's en nobling we receive the deeper message uh what needs to

271
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:12,079
be uh healed and then what needs to be

272
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:17,359
allowed so uh the first Noble Truth The Noble Truth of suffering and then

273
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:23,078
tomorrow comes the second thank you
