1
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,240
so good day

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,359
and in a sense continuing with the theme of

3
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:24,000
patience for the week and yesterday talking about

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,880
patients under insult or not giving in to anger

5
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,000
we might feel angry but not to give into it

6
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,280
and

7
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:55,120
sooner or later when people practice mindfulness they probably will encounter

8
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,920
within themselves anger resentment

9
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,879
feelings of hostility towards other people

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:13,520
and these are important areas of practice to be present for

11
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,960
and to learn how to be present without giving in to them or collapsing into them

12
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:25,920
but also to learn how to be respectful of them to not condemn them or condemn oneself

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:33,200
that these states are present and then to learn to be wise about them

14
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:40,479
and then what i talked about yesterday about really seeing the difference between the thoughts that have to do with other

15
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:46,640
other things other people that take us away from our present moment experience

16
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:54,240
uh that's such an important discovery because you really see that difference

17
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:59,680
and then to be able to appreciate the value of presence the value of being

18
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:07,520
right here and not going into stories and ideas that are not here

19
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:14,319
this allows for a possibility a very important possibility

20
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,680
of in a certain way becoming larger

21
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:26,480
than our angers larger than our resentments

22
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,760
so rather than figuring out how to let go of them

23
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,879
or how not to have them we learn not to be

24
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:43,599
a victim of them we learn not to inhabit them or

25
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:50,160
let them take over and this idea of becoming big

26
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:57,760
a really you know it's a it's a way of inhabiting our experience

27
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,800
with a fullness and habiting it without

28
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:07,840
these ideas of other but also these ideas that we carry about

29
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:14,080
ourselves that diminish us that make us feel like we're less than

30
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,519
or inadequate or wrong or or

31
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:28,080
or even the ideas that i'm right is a kind of narrowing and limiting of

32
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,120
who we are and as we sit in mindfulness sit and practice and breathe

33
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,560
and learn to recognize these thoughts of other these also these thoughts of about

34
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:48,480
oneself that limit us that box us in that puts us into

35
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,000
a becoming being someone being someone

36
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,519
and it isn't that we need to become no one and nobody but we don't want to be limited

37
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:07,040
by these ideas and so to to learn to shed

38
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,519
the limiting ideas is part of the advantage of letting go of thoughts and coming back

39
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:19,759
to hear and inhabiting here so that it is

40
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,919
there's a fullness here

41
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:32,479
so to feel careful with the posture you take

42
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:38,479
or caring about the posture you assume for meditation

43
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:44,080
that it's a posture that maybe in some kind of way

44
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,440
would allow you to inhabit your

45
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:56,400
largeness your fullness not a posture that

46
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,080
there's a even a slightest tendency to collapse or shrink

47
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:09,199
but a more of an uprising especially for sitting upright

48
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:14,320
they're really inhabiting that uprightness

49
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:23,319
sometimes if you're sitting with the backrest it's helpful to kind of readjust a little bit so that

50
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,159
you're sitting a little bit straighter

51
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,840
to gently close the eyes and part of the

52
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,440
and and entering into the fullness of ourselves

53
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,759
it can be helped by this deep breathing at the beginning of this meditation

54
00:05:53,759 --> 00:06:00,240
not forcefully not a way of activating ourselves

55
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:07,520
so much as inhabiting a fullness of being

56
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,199
taking a deep breath in which expands the chest and lifts the

57
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:22,000
shoulders maybe expands the belly so physically we become a little larger

58
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,680
but to kind of

59
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,680
use that largeness to become more embodied here

60
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,840
and on the exhale long relaxed letting go

61
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:50,479
to let go of thoughts to let go of ideas

62
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:55,840
opinions and some of your thoughts and ideas

63
00:06:55,840 --> 00:07:03,039
maybe are just fine but it's so easy to have self-limiting thoughts

64
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:09,840
and so for a few moments just let go of all thoughts so that

65
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:17,840
even the self-limiting ones fall away or come down

66
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,319
so feeling a fullness of being as you inhale

67
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:39,160
and letting go of limitations as you exhale

68
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,360
and then letting your breathing return to normal

69
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:33,039
and spend a few moments roaming around in your body

70
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:41,839
feeling the fullness of your body the three-dimensionality of your body

71
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,639
the substance of your body

72
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,839
the vitality of your body

73
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:20,760
a broad awareness of your body

74
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:30,320
that supports breaking free from limited ideas of self

75
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,560
self as inadequate or self as a victim

76
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:46,240
self as troubled self as

77
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:54,399
angry or resentful all those things might be there

78
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:02,720
but you can be bigger than it you encompass so much more

79
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:11,680
in your body your heart and your mind and to sit quietly breathing

80
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:19,839
in the expansiveness of your being

81
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,800
maybe with each inhale feeling the movements of

82
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:47,839
breathing in throughout the body or at least the torso that expands and fills you

83
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:54,079
and on the exhale letting go of your

84
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:04,600
thoughts calming the thinking mind

85
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:22,160
preoccupation with thoughts interferes with feeling or sensing the

86
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,800
fullness the largeness of our being

87
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:43,120
that is sometimes experienced better with the eyes closed

88
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,279
because it frees us from the thoughts ideas we might have about

89
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:55,120
who we are and we allow ourselves to feel

90
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:03,360
our being from the inside out expansive open unlimited

91
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:12,399
with every inhale being quiet and still to really feel

92
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:18,480
the fullness and then on the exhale to let the

93
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:26,759
thinking mind become quiet soft gentle

94
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,559
coming back into the fullness of your being that is lost when you're involved in

95
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,559
thinking

96
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:17,120
the fullness of being that might reveal to you

97
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:23,480
what is lost when you're preoccupied in thought

98
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,760
and as you meditate if you can find within

99
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:12,720
a sense of confidence

100
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:22,158
or maybe finding the place in your body that you most associate with confidence

101
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,640
maybe in infinitesimally infinitesimally

102
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:46,840
adjusting your posture so the posture expresses confidence

103
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,080
and then breathe with the confidence breathe through the place that

104
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:05,600
confidence lives in you

105
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:18,158
perhaps allowing your thinking mind to be quiet

106
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:27,120
or not taking away by taking a few moments to assume

107
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:34,080
that it's okay for you to sit quietly with

108
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,600
a quiet sense of confidence

109
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,919
in the fullness of your being

110
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,919
and imagining that any resentments you have

111
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:40,159
slide off your fullness of being slide off your

112
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:49,480
confidence like drops of water slides off a lotus leaf

113
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:16,080
not holding on to any resentments not holding on to any

114
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:24,159
anger not denying its presence

115
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:37,200
but not inhabiting the resentment letting it be like drops

116
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:41,639
running off the sides of a leaf

117
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,159
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

118
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,399
to appreciate that this practice that we do

119
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:32,240
can help us to be free

120
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:40,080
or unstuck unlimited by anger or resentments

121
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:48,320
that it can give us a very different relationship where we're not

122
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,960
living in the anger or living in the resentments

123
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:03,360
and perhaps we can even let go of them

124
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:10,000
and in doing so become someone who

125
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:13,840
is safer for the world

126
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:25,080
someone for whom others do not need to fear because of their anger resentment

127
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,520
and in this way

128
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:41,840
this is one way that we can benefit the world from our meditation practice

129
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,520
so that we don't impose assert our anger onto others

130
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,399
our hostility

131
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:59,039
and may it be that our practice

132
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:06,880
is for the welfare and happiness of others may it be that

133
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:13,440
we consider how this practice and how we grow and develop in the meditation

134
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,679
how it can be up how it can live in the world

135
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,440
to make the world a better place may all beings

136
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:32,880
be happy may all beings be safe

137
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,320
may all beings be peaceful

138
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:44,360
and may all beings everywhere be free

139
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:58,260
[Music]

140
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:19,679
so that guided meditation was

141
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:25,120
meant to support the topic i'll talk about now

142
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,519
another aspect of patience or this pali word kanti

143
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:38,640
and that is forgiveness forgiveness of insult

144
00:32:39,919 --> 00:32:46,000
and forgiveness is uh held up as being a great ideal a

145
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:51,760
wonderful thing to be able to do and of course it's not easy

146
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:57,320
and there can be protests of all kinds

147
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:04,640
and there can even be some ways of practicing forgiveness which is not so healthy not appropriate

148
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:11,440
even so in the buddhist sense

149
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:16,480
of forgiveness forgiveness involves two things two

150
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:22,000
primary things it involves

151
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:27,840
letting go of resentment letting go of anger

152
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:35,600
towards someone or that has hostility for others

153
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:42,399
that's the first thing and the second thing it involves

154
00:33:42,399 --> 00:33:48,640
opening up our good will to others opening our hearts

155
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:55,279
becoming friendly or well wishing for others in a genuine way

156
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:02,960
and we don't have to be loving that's why maybe loving kindness can seem like a little bit too high of an ideal

157
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:09,599
you know it's hard to love everyone but it's possible to open our hearts and

158
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:17,200
have good will to wish people well maybe from a distance

159
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:23,440
and and those two movements letting go of anger and then opening up the heart to include

160
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:29,760
let other people be in our heart to be a heart open to them that is good will

161
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,679
and the first one letting go of anger um is

162
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:41,280
you know one of the reasons to do it is for your own sake

163
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:48,158
so that you don't harm yourself resentment is a simmering

164
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:53,440
suffering it's a simmering injury that we do to ourselves

165
00:34:53,440 --> 00:35:00,320
and us anger can that anger towards someone anger because someone has done something to us

166
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:07,280
that maybe it's you know long past the actual event um it's be kind of injuring yourself

167
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:13,599
there's a story that jack cornfield tells of two former prisoners

168
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:20,400
and one of them says to the other have you forgiven your captors

169
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:27,520
and the second one says no never they did horrible things to me

170
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:33,040
and then the first one says well then they still have you in prison

171
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:39,040
so this would be to be trapped in anger and resentment is a kind of prison

172
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:44,480
and it limits ourselves and i've known people who've had resentment for years

173
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:50,800
until they realized that the person they're resenting had gone on with their life

174
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:56,960
and maybe even forgotten who they were and and so the only one who was being harmed

175
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:02,480
by the resentment was themselves and they said wait a minute this doesn't make any sense

176
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:09,520
to live this way in some ways i'm doing my enemy a favor by continuing to

177
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:15,760
put salt in the wound or something so learning to let go of anger

178
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,560
or at least put it aside learning to let go of being a victim

179
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:28,960
or at least not being the victim not inhabiting it

180
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:35,040
making that our identity that i am you know you know that the whole whole definition

181
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,480
of who we are becomes around the injury that we received

182
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,320
and and so this idea of meditating as a way of reclaiming

183
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:51,680
a fullness of being uh reclaiming a largeness

184
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:57,599
and we discover in meditation how much our thoughts ideas concepts judgments

185
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,359
that we have makes us smaller limits us keeps us in check keeps us bounded keeps

186
00:37:03,359 --> 00:37:08,640
us caught sometimes even in prison a kind of prison

187
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:16,480
and so to be learned to let go of thoughts learn to see thoughts and let them move aside or learning to kind of

188
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:22,640
become more embodied more fully alive may fully

189
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,839
uh in embodying inhabiting our life

190
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:33,680
so that maybe we still have resentments and angers but they get pushed a little bit to the

191
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:41,440
side are a little bit uh appendages to we are who we are not who we are

192
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:47,599
and uh they become you know maybe like a a jacket we wear

193
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:53,359
it still has role and is present and we can't deny it that's there

194
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:59,359
but uh you know we we don't we don't we're not we are not our jacket

195
00:37:59,359 --> 00:38:05,200
we are so much more and so to begin to shift our

196
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:12,560
relationship to anger to resentment so that we're not caught by it

197
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:20,240
and this of course is a slow process is not done automatically or quickly but even the idea even the wish

198
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:25,440
the dedication to no longer be caught by anger resentment to work with it and

199
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:31,599
find a way through it is the beginning of becoming larger it's the beginning of becoming free

200
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:36,800
uh and to appreciate that out there there's there's some freedom there's some

201
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:42,160
taking agency there's a stepping away from it and becoming more

202
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:48,160
so this idea of ability to let go of anger and resentment and there might be other all kinds of

203
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:54,720
thoughts these other thoughts othering thoughts that uh keep us trapped in the anger

204
00:38:54,720 --> 00:39:01,119
like you know i'm doing the you know i can't do the the person who hurt me i can't you know

205
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:06,560
do them a favor or i can't i can't condone them or i can't

206
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:12,400
um get let them get off the hook for what they've done and

207
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:17,839
and all those might be true in some ways but it doesn't mean that we have to close our heart to them it doesn't mean

208
00:39:17,839 --> 00:39:23,280
we have to stay with our anger our wisdom our understanding our memory of what happened

209
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:29,119
might lead us to behave a certain way around the person like say well if you continue that kind of behavior i can't

210
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:36,160
be with you or i have to be cautious with you because i was hurt before

211
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,599
or some you know who knows all kinds of things have to happen in the world but

212
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:48,000
but we don't have to be trapped in the anger so forgiveness then in buddhism is

213
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:53,760
letting go of our resentment and anger and the advantage of that to the word forgiveness

214
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,440
is forgiveness kind of implies we're giving something to someone else and that makes it a little more

215
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:04,480
complicated the social relationships and the nature of the injury and what happened and

216
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,720
and maybe maybe we're not ready to give anything to people but we can let go for our own sake let

217
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:17,920
go of the anger the second step is this loving kindness this good will

218
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:24,480
is because if we keep our hearts closed to other people we're also in some ways limiting ourselves we're injuring

219
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,880
ourselves and to really appreciate that gives us a reason to have good will

220
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:38,160
that's not an argument that they deserve to have our good will or they don't deserve it or something

221
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,800
independent of whether they deserve it or not which is maybe a silly silly topic

222
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,760
you deserve you to not to be limited by your thoughts by your contractions by

223
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:58,319
how you are limited and so for you to open up the heart works so much better

224
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:05,359
when there's good will it's freer it breathes easier so then to come find that's not it's not

225
00:41:05,359 --> 00:41:10,880
easy to do this but this is a practice to find that okay where can i have the good will

226
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:16,480
and if those two things can be done letting go of anger and having good will

227
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,960
in shorthand we can call that and and then the forgiveness practice of

228
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:29,200
buddhism maybe is more accessible so sometimes we forgive others

229
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:35,200
for how they've harmed us and some people will do that in meditation practice and even have a

230
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:42,079
words they say that classically would be something like for whatever harm others have done me

231
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:48,079
intentionally or unintentionally i now forgive them and now when you hear that word forgive

232
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,920
you understand it to be letting go of anger and opening your good will

233
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,119
it's also uh can be a beautiful thing to request forgiveness

234
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:05,280
there's there's often we have to be large enough big enough to um

235
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:10,319
let go of our conceit let go of our of our

236
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:15,359
or even some certain kind of negative pride

237
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:21,119
to ask for forgiveness and and so it's a beautiful thing sometimes

238
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:28,480
you know for whatever ways that i have harmed you intentionally or unintentionally please forgive me

239
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,880
um and um and then the person we're asking maybe they can understand what it means is please don't hold your anger against

240
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,319
me um it isn't that you have to approve what i've done or didn't you know

241
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:46,400
somehow get me off the hook entirely for what i've done that might have hurt you there might be consequences

242
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:54,800
but it's kind of like asking please could uh could you accept me again without your anger

243
00:42:54,800 --> 00:43:01,599
and offer some some level of good will as we find our way forward with the challenges we have

244
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:07,440
and then also towards oneself for whatever ways that i have harmed

245
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,200
myself knowingly and unknowingly may i forgive myself

246
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:18,960
and for some people this is the most difficult one but the i that does the forgiving

247
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:24,160
is the i that is beginning to discover how not to be limited small

248
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:30,319
being the victim but actually begins to breathe freely and openly and holds everything

249
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:36,960
um makes space for all of who we are it's a coming from a place of strength

250
00:43:36,960 --> 00:43:42,000
and largeness of great capacity to be present for our

251
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:49,200
experience without being caught in it and so as we practice mindfulness we are

252
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:54,960
slowly over time developing a greater capacity greater strength greater sense

253
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,640
of unlimited quality and confidence here

254
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:06,319
that all the things that detract from that they don't necessarily go away

255
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:13,280
but they become smaller they become appendages they become something which we take into account we're wise about

256
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:18,720
we're caring about we're compassionate about but we're not defined by it

257
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,040
and to not be to be defined by the things that limit us

258
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:32,560
is a fantastic thing and maybe it helps us to live a life of we're ready

259
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:38,640
to forgive ready to let go to not live in the anger not live with resentment

260
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:44,079
and to open to goodwill for the world and what a great thing

261
00:44:44,079 --> 00:44:50,800
to become someone who's safe for others they don't have to be afraid of our resentment but they know

262
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:57,200
to live with our resentment but they live with our good will

263
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:02,880
may we live in this world offering good will to all that we meet

264
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:05,838
thank you
