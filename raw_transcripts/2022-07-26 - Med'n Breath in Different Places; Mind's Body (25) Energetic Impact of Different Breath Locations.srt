6
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:20,399
miles away from imc the virtual background of imc so we feel

7
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:26,959
we're at home so today speaking of being at home

8
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:34,000
we continue our exploration of the mind's body not just the body as

9
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:39,600
we take it to be this fathom-long body

10
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,959
but the mind's body the way that

11
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:52,720
this physicality this experience of

12
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:59,440
having a physicality in the world or a perception of a body

13
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:06,639
is impacted by the way we pay attention

14
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:15,600
and vice versa the way this mind's body or energy body

15
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:20,639
impact supports our awakening

16
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:28,240
especially if you tend to always do the same thing or pay

17
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:36,079
attention the same way to your breath to your body these sessions are especially for you

18
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:42,560
to explore to open up different pathways different ways different impacts

19
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:48,000
so so today in the guided meditation

20
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:54,320
um i'll intro i'll invite us to explore

21
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,519
the impact of

22
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:07,279
attending to the breath being mindful of the breath in different places the difference

23
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:15,839
between paying attention to the breath in the abdomen the chest the nostrils the whole body

24
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,680
these all have different impacts and at different times different

25
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:28,399
practitioners would be invited to explore so [Music]

26
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:34,560

feeling our sit bones

32
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:16,600
feeling ourselves connected to the earth

33
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:48,079
sensing feeling your feet on the earth

34
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,480
your legs

35
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:06,959
your bottom on the cushion lower legs let them land let them be released

36
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:13,199
connected connected to the earth a stable base

37
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,240
stable base

38
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:32,000
turning your attention your awareness intentionally to the sensations of

39
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:38,720

wholeheartedly to the lower abdomen to receive the breath

47
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:37,760
the breath is being breathed on its own

48
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:47,200
so no need to make it into a project you don't have to breathe intentionally

49
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:52,720
it's already happening it's already happening

50
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:01,639

64
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,760
how it manifests in the body

65
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:50,320
what happens in the heart and the mind and you may have never noticed before

66
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:58,200
be interested in this laboratory

67
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,559
make sure you're relaxed

68
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:26,559
now with the same ease in the body

69
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:33,040
ah feeling relaxed releasing

70
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,159
[Music] thoughts muscles

71
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:47,120
now turning attention awareness to receive the breath

72
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,840
in the chest area

73
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:10,240
as if the breath was being received from your heart center the middle of your

74
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:14,840
chest entering and exiting

75
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:27,840
awakening your heart

76
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,600
this moment in time with each breath

77
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:48,640
giving receiving to the world

78
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:54,360
perhaps your good wishes your kindness

79
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:54,320
notice how different it may feel to receive the

80
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,799
breath in the chest the heart center

81
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,640
compared to the abdomen

82
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:24,039
is there something different about your state of mind now state of your body overall

83
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:37,840
and now receiving the breath at the nostrils

84
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:45,480
not inside the nostrils but outside the nostrils at the upper lip

85
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:51,440
noticing the coolness of the air the warmth

86
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:56,440
could be more subtle

87
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:03,799
let the body remain relaxed

88
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:22,960
noticing the breath outside the nose that the upper lip could be

89
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:29,919
quite subtle see how the mind the body adapts

90
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:32,919
notice

91
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,600
you notice any differences in the state of mind and the body

92
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:55,559
receiving the breath at the nostrils

93
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,960
do you find yourself more distracted perhaps or not

94
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:13,519
or thoughts arising or perhaps

95
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:19,240
more concentrated see the difference

96
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:23,640
and letting go of attending to the breath of the nostrils

97
00:33:24,159 --> 00:33:32,879
ah settling into the whole body whole body filled out

98
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:39,360
the entire body especially if you were practicing

99
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:44,480
yesterday the outline of the whole body

100
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:53,840
the whole body filled out sitting whatever your posture is in this moment

101
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:03,278
head shoulders arms trunk

102
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:08,398
sit bones legs feet

103
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:16,398
entire body this entire body

104
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,760
breathing as if you're breathing through all your pores

105
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,878
this whole body billowing

106
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:36,240
if the body itself was breathing through the pores

107
00:34:37,599 --> 00:34:44,000
not effortful it's happening on its own just bring your attention awareness to

108
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:47,000
it

109
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:18,640
perhaps even [Music] considering that your body extends

110
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:24,800
just a tiny bit beyond the border of your skin

111
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:29,560
and the breath moves through

112
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:35,519
in and out with ease porously

113
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:44,040
settling settling into the whole body breathing

114
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:08,440
imagine the whole body bellowing

115
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,720
being breathed

116
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:25,640
your hands are breathing your back is breathing

117
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:26,839
and as we bring this period of sitting to a close

118
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,960
dedicating sharing our goodness our cultivation

119
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,079
our engagement our energy our effort

120
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:46,480
as a community as individuals and a community

121

may our cultivation or knowing or

124
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:14,560

00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,920
thank you for your practice

130
00:42:00,839 --> 00:42:06,960
uh hello greetings dear sangha

131
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,800
lovely to be practicing with you

132
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:18,559
so as we are exploring the mind's body this week

133
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:25,359
this particular invitation today in the guided meditation

134
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:31,280
was to explore the impact of attending to the breath

135
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:37,359
turning awareness to receive the breath either in the abdomen

136
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:42,720
the chest nostrils or the whole body there are more ways to tend to the

137
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:46,400
breath but given limited time

138
00:42:49,359 --> 00:42:56,079
and and recently i was talking with a dedicated practitioner who's

139
00:42:56,079 --> 00:43:03,599
practiced for many years or decades actually set three-month retreats at ims multiple ones etc

140
00:43:03,599 --> 00:43:10,240
and we got to talk about um the breath and i started to share about

141
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:17,119
the different impact that attending to the breath in different places has and they said i had no idea no one has ever

142
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,319
shared this with me before why why why don't other dharma teachers ever talk

143
00:43:22,319 --> 00:43:29,440
about this and um and i thought ah this is important to

144
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:36,400
talk about this is important to talk about and um and i also i i'm appreciating

145
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:43,760
seeing the comments about how breathing into different areas really are shifting the energetic

146
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:49,119
feelings for people how you're exploring and seeing that that's wonderful makes me

147
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:54,720
very happy to see that um so so

148
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,720
a couple of things one is dharma teachers in i may or may not have heard this through my own practice maybe for

149
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:06,160
one person or not but but it's also something that i would say that i've experienced on my

150
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:11,920
own and discovered on my own and there are other writings anyway it's

151
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:17,359
the so this is part of the canon this is important it's knowing how to work with

152
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:23,200
the breath can also can support you can support where you're in your practice can

153
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:32,000
support the energetic feeling can support you with hindrances so so let's dive in let's dive in

154
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:39,920
so attending receiving the breath um

155
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:46,720
in the abdomen let's start with the abdomen the sense of ease relaxed

156
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:53,280
receiving of the breath again not intentionally breathing yourself because that could become very tight

157
00:44:53,280 --> 00:45:00,800
it can become like a chore i'm breathing but the breathing is already happening but receiving it in the abdomen

158
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:06,880
so the abdomen especially the lower abdomen that's also where

159
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:14,560
mahasi sayadaw a prominent teacher in the um

160
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:20,800
in theravada tradition in burma

161
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:28,480
that's where um and mahasi said i was a teacher to

162
00:45:29,839 --> 00:45:36,880
many of the teachers who came to the west and brought vipassana to the west

163
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,319
about 50 years ago or so so so attending to the breath in the

164
00:45:42,319 --> 00:45:48,880
abdomen can have the uh impact can have

165
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:54,720
um [Music] the the the um the result of the the

166
00:45:54,720 --> 00:46:00,880
mind feeling settled the fee the mind feeling grounded so

167
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:06,079
the abdomen can be perhaps one of the most grounding places

168
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,400
to attend to the breath and especially if you are a practitioner who tends to be very

169
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:18,240
heady tends to be very heady in your work in your life you tend to think a lot

170
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:24,720
then bringing the the gra the the center of gravity of the attention down down

171
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:31,839
down in your physical body to your abdomen and noticing the breath receiving the breath

172
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:38,560
in the abdomen can be really grounding can be really grounding the image

173
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:44,880
to have is like a balloon if you have a helium balloon and it's light and it's just wants to

174
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:51,119
get away you put a weight you put the weight on the bottom of it and you put it on the earth

175
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:57,839
so put a weight on your helium balloon of your thoughts that i want to go with here there

176
00:46:57,839 --> 00:47:04,960
everywhere if you notice there are a lot of thoughts bring the attention down down down to your abdomen

177
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:11,760
receive the breath in the abdomen so the abdomen is

178
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:18,800
generally i would say the best place for beginning practitioners if you're relatively new

179
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:26,640
or still exploring the abdomen or even if you're an experienced practitioner the abdomen is

180
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:33,040
it tends to be a one size fits all has many many advantages

181
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:39,680
um and there's also a grossness to the sensations of rise and fall that can be

182
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:44,960
again something for the mind to grab onto all the sensations on the sides of

183
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:52,160
the belly on the top of the bridges there's so many sensations everywhere so that can really

184
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,520
ground and settle the mind the mind's body

185
00:47:57,520 --> 00:48:03,119
can be really comforted soothed settled

186
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:09,599
with paying attention to the breath in the abdomen

187
00:48:09,599 --> 00:48:16,160
especially if there is um the hindrance of agitation

188
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:23,119
if there's the hindrance of restlessness worry bring the energy down

189
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:29,839
lower lower abdomen sense the um the breath there and it will calm it

190
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:36,800
will soothe it will settle it will ground um and sometimes even your sit bones can

191
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:43,040
that can be helpful it's really low really feeling your your breath low

192
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:52,330
the the chest the chest [Music]

193
00:48:53,280 --> 00:49:02,760
can also have different impacts different uh ways of the energy moving shifting um

194
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:09,359
sometimes the the the advantage maybe i'll say one one advantage of the breath here

195
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:16,400
sometimes feeling that the breath is entering directly into the heart center and exiting the heart center you can

196
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:22,480
open the heart it can have a a meta quality to a loving kindness and

197
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:29,359
and especially if you're practicing meta this heart center breathing can be jasper it can be just so lovely

198
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:36,480
um can synchronize your meta with even if there are no phrases but just this feeling of kindness breathing through

199
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:41,960
your heart for the whole world for yourself there can be a sense of calming and soothing

200
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:47,680
their um the chest however

201
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:54,160
can bring up some anxiety if if you're having anxiety or restlessness worry etc

202
00:49:54,160 --> 00:50:01,119
can can kind of bring the energy up a little bit in your chest um so so you can

203
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:06,559
knowing that you can bring it down if that happens you can bring it down to the abdomen

204
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,680
again all of these places have a lovely uh both you know

205
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:18,720
the right time the and what's not helpful um the nostrils the nostrils can be very

206
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:26,480
subtle and the nostrils can be very subtle and i do not recommend the nostrils uh for any beginner or even

207
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:31,520
intermediate practitioners um thanks for exploring it this morning so

208
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:38,160
if you're new it's okay the nostrils the the beauty of the nostrils can be is that it can be the

209
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:43,599
breath can be so subtle here that the mind can really get concentrated but

210
00:50:43,599 --> 00:50:48,960
only after you've been you've experienced many many years

211
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:56,559
of practice and and even decades and you really know your way around the energy bodies and concentration practices

212
00:50:56,559 --> 00:51:01,680
the challenge with and and never go inside never go inside the nostrils do

213
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:07,119
not feel the breath inside the nostrils that's bad habit do not do it

214
00:51:07,119 --> 00:51:14,000
can cause a lot of problems down the road with worth practicing but outside here this is called the

215
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:19,119
anapana spot on upon the spot here the

216
00:51:19,119 --> 00:51:26,319
mindfulness of breathing spot here i've been below the nose and and over the the uh the lip

217
00:51:26,319 --> 00:51:31,680
uh this ridge here so um the disadvantage can be that again

218
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:38,720
it's very subtle so it's so subtle that um you you don't feel it at all

219
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:45,599
you lose it you become really tight like where is that breath you become you become so tight that you

220
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:52,640
you uh trip over your own shoelaces and practice and and uh not helpful

221
00:51:52,640 --> 00:52:00,079
it can also uh bring a lot of bring the energy to the head area so one

222
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,359
can be distracted a lot more easily um so

223
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:12,240
so again all of these have uh these with so um let's say we're practicing at at the

224
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:18,720
nostrils um it is how my teacher the parks parks iodine

225
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:25,520
for the deeper level of genres this is where the point but again after a lot of experience has happened a lot of

226
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:32,000
experience on the path etc so um

227
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:37,520
um and and also to say the the abdomen as i talked about being the generally

228
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,880
wonderful place to go if you're feeling a little sleepy if you're sloth and torpor

229
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:48,800
and you're feeling very uh sleepy then it might be helpful to

230
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:55,920
actually pay attention to the breath in the chest or at the nostril just to bring the energy up to wake you up it

231
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:02,720
can have an uplift have an uplifting the energy body can kind of uplift instead of being settled

232
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:09,520
and down so if you're feeling sleepy it's okay for for some time to feel the breath further up

233
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:14,960
and the whole body breath the whole body breathing

234
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:20,800
which we tried very briefly can again be very comforting soothing grounding

235
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:27,599
uh this whole sense of the energy body and can feel spacious can both feel

236
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:32,960
conf confined in a good way sense of secure

237
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:40,720
here i am in a cocoon i'm being i'm being breathed and can also feel very spacious again if

238
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,920
we add the spaciousness there's a lot more may um

239
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:52,319
say so i i didn't include all of that because in 30 minutes there's only so much you can do and besides this was a

240
00:53:52,319 --> 00:53:57,440
really quick tour i would recommend that trying all of these for longer periods

241
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:04,640
of time on your own and really exploring in your own energy body wow this shifts i mean

242
00:54:04,640 --> 00:54:10,960
five minutes is just not a lot enough for each of these uh stops um it's like

243
00:54:10,960 --> 00:54:17,760
a whirlwind tour of our breath and then there are more practices etc etc

244
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:24,559
um so there's so much to share with you about the mind's body uh

245
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:31,440
so i knew this was going to come up i there are lots of chats lots of questions i haven't seen them all but the one that i

246
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:37,599
see is why the sensing inside the nostrils is not good so if you just practice a little bit

247
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:44,240
here and there inside the nostrils is not going to impact you but inside the nostrils

248
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:49,920
if you go on a retreat or if you practice a lot it

249
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:56,960
the sense of solidity the earth element is it is said the sense of solidity arises inside the nostrils inside the

250
00:54:56,960 --> 00:55:03,040
head and and if you do it over and over for a long time especially on the retreat then it feels

251
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:10,720
like they're bricks in your nose in your head and it can completely mess you up um i've worked i've

252
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:18,799
known practitioners where this has happened you forget how to breathe you can't even breathe it gets tight it's it's it can become very painful so do

253
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:24,319
not develop these bad habits that later you have to undo if you um

254
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:29,520
practice more um so so i'll leave that

255
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:35,280
answer to jane's question okay so so much in this

256
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:42,079
mind's body to explore and share i hope this is supportive to your practice knowing how to

257
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:47,359
shift and turn and change if there's sleepiness if there's anxiety if there's

258
00:55:47,359 --> 00:55:52,480
need grounding subtlety and there's a lot more

259
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:58,880
to share i look forward to practicing with you for the rest of the week

260
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:03,000
take good care be well

261
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:06,319
you
