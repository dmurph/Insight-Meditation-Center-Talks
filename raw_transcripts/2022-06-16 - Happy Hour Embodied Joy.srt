1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:08,240
okay so so hello and welcome everyone welcome to this rendition of happy hours

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:15,440
lovely to be with you to feel your presence from so many different time zones

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:23,600
joining these different mediums different media

4
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:30,640
so so for today's happy hour practice session together

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,920
i'd like to invite us to engage

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:41,120
with the practice of of um

7
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,680
of mudita in the form of appreciation so what is mutita for those of you

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,039
uh who may not be familiar with the term um

9
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,399
the polyword for vicarious joy so basically turning

10
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,680
towards joy whether it's joy for our own

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:12,159
goodness and blessings or or um the gifts of other people so it's um

12
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,799
it's a way to really just relax relax and savor goodness

13
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:26,000
relax and savor goodness and the gift of this practice

14
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:33,040
is especially important because our minds tend to gravitate towards

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,560
challenges towards dukkha towards trauma towards what's hard it's difficult

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:46,000
ouch and in order to knee in order to feel resourced to remember yes there is

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,439
goodness here there is so much goodness here this practice allows us to open up to

18
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:59,200
goodness in our lives the goodness in our lives in the lives of others

19
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:05,439
especially when there is difficulty especially when there is difficulty in our lives

20
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,720
and when there's difficulty in the world it's not a way to

21
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,760
to put our heads in the sand not at all it's not escapism

22
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:22,480
but the way to open the heart to really fill up our sphere of experience

23
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:28,800
with with the fullness of life with the fullness of life

24
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:36,480
so so we've practiced joy opening to joy gratitude

25
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:43,519
in different ways and tonight i want to get into it actually slightly differently differently than i usually guide it

26
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:50,000
because as you know but i always like to to invite explore in

27
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:56,319
different ways and invite you to explore your heart your mind these these spaces

28
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,760
through different entry ways because as we enter through different doors we end

29
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:08,959
up in different chambers of the heart like oh wow i didn't know this was possible as many of you have shared and reported

30
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,239
as we try different doors different windows not always the same thing but just

31
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:20,000
creativity this practice of the brahma viharas the

32
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,280
the heavenly abodes which meta loving kindness and would dicta vicarious joy and gratitude are a part

33
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:35,280
of our creative practices are really creative practices to to plant seeds and

34
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,040
and if you happen to be new to this practice what i like to say is whatever

35
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:46,720
arises is okay don't feel like you're a failure

36
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,120
just because you cannot generate joy or you cannot connect with gratitude and

37
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:59,040
in order to be successful at the practice it doesn't work like that it does not

38
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,599
as long as you turn towards whatever arises with kindness even towards difficulty with

39
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,319
appreciation i'll talk more about this because it's like what is she talking about towards difficulty with appreciation but it can

40
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:19,440
become available then you're doing the practice right then practice you're planting seeds it doesn't have to look a

41
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,680
particular way in fact this this practice amazes us it surprises us

42
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,880
in ways that opens us to the dimensionality of our humanity in ways

43
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,320
we don't quite know ourselves we take ourselves to be this limited

44
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:43,840
little two-dimensional being and then these practices open up our heart to so

45
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:49,280
much possibility so let yourself be surprised so

46
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,840
so i won't say more about how we're going to enter so that you just

47
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,320
enter through a different path today maybe

48
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,840
and whatever arises again turn towards it with times it's all okay

49
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:15,280
so i think i have said enough to set the stage so i would like to invite us all now to

50
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:22,800
enter into our meditation posture landing

51
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:29,360
landing in this body and if you need to lie down or stand

52
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:35,199
the different postures the buddha has taught that's perfectly fine

53
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:41,120
if you're sitting for a moment maybe move your shoulders move back and forth

54
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,400
reconnect with this body see what this body needs

55
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,440
and land in your sit bones

56
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,479
land with your feet

57
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,280
land with your breath breath in the abdomen

58
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:21,560
breath in the abdomen let it be received

59
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:35,080
and breath and the outwards

60
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,160
and just spending a few minutes

61
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,720
being settled connecting letting your awareness connect with your

62
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:57,479
body your feet on the ground

63
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,440
as if your breath is moving through your feet

64
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:17,479
into the earth connecting deeply rooting

65
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:24,319
feeling the sensations of your hands on your lap

66
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:29,160
releasing relaxing

67
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,039
your bottom on the cushion

68
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,840
releasing the weight of your upper body

69
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,560
ah unto your sid bones

70
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,680
and as thoughts arise as they will

71
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,800
inevitably arise it's okay

72
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,839
see if you can

73
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:06,080
attend to them know them not with judgment but appreciatively all

74
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,600
this mind this brain works thinking is happening oh

75
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:20,000
thinking about this and then with kindness with a smile

76
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,880
saying thank you and not now

77
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:30,480

78
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,360
let's just settle settle in the body and relax

79
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:48,640
nothing to do nothing to accomplish in this moment nothing at all

80
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,880
nothing no doing [Music]

81
00:09:54,880 --> 00:10:00,760
just let the body the heart relax

82
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:11,760
just be breathed taking refuge into simplicity

83
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,880
by doing nothing

84
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:01,360
and can you enjoy just really enjoy having no agenda right now

85
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,560
no agenda

86
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:16,240
and just to enjoy being

87
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:20,920
in its mysterious simplicity

88
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:47,440
just opening your awareness to joy delight

89
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:03,800
what's nourishing in the body in the heart maybe you feel some buzzing

90
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,440
in your body

91
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:33,320
maybe with each out breath there is more letting go and settling

92
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,200
nourishing contentment

93
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:11,920
sometimes we forget what it's like to just sit contentedly

94
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,959
always need to do to accomplish to be

95
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:23,120
even when it comes to the dharma to the practice

96
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:33,160
radical radical simplicity of letting go

97
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,000
it's like a free fall where there is nothing to fall onto

98
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:55,079
it's safe just enjoy

99
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:06,199
enjoy the release

100
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:18,399
and if thoughts arise i don't know what i'm doing ah is this right

101
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,480
simply smile and release

102
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:36,720
no need to believe all the thoughts you are doing it right

103
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:43,040
whatever doing there is in this non-doing

104
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:48,880
release and open your heart to enjoy

105
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,240
inviting all the flowers the birds

106
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,279
the deer to come [Music] to the watering hole wait wait long

107
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:05,320
enough they will show up

108
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:16,600
the bird song of the breath maybe you notice it's enjoyable

109
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:28,560
for the sense of heaviness in your body after a while wow

110
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:37,480
how nice be patient release and enjoy

111
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:47,360
so we wait long enough our attention becomes more subtle

112
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,440
it can take a while be patient

113
00:16:54,560 --> 00:17:02,079
release and enjoy there is so much

114
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:07,720
it will become clear

115
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,640
at the beginning we put more emphasis on their release

116
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:47,520
there are more thoughts more doing wanting release and enjoy

117
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:56,240
and when you notice your heart has settled into refuge in this moment

118
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:01,960
and open wider to enjoy

119
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:39,039
when we look when we perceive [Music]

120
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,240
through the lens of enjoyment we notice more

121
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:49,000
joy that we hadn't noticed before

122
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:56,640
maybe the sensations of the breath a particular way particular place

123
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,960
becomes source of joy enjoyment

124
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:10,720
or sensations in the body or sound or maybe there is nothing and that

125
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:17,840
nothingness becomes a source of contentment

126
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:21,840
and joy and ease

127
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:31,640
your mind your heart can enjoy

128
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:40,240
what is subtle more than you give yourself credit

129
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,840
open up to that possibility

130
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:16,679
relax and receive the joy of the present moment

131
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:56,080
relax re release and receive the joy of the present

132
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,080
moment

133
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:58,480
you can stay in this subtle

134
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:05,320
present moment embodied presence

135
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:13,120
appreciating the subtle contentment with the subtle

136
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,440
what is

137
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:39,039
and if you like you may drop in [Music] still in the subtlety but like a dropper

138
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:46,640
that picks up a drop of color drop in one goodness one blessing in your life

139
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,840
and let it reverberate

140
00:27:53,039 --> 00:28:00,240
maybe it's friends family health

141
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:06,880
roof over your head something it's personal

142
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:12,000

143
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:19,520

144
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,919

and now you can drop another dropper full of something else another drop

148
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:34,279
of another blessing let it be appreciated enjoyed

149
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:33,919

150
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:36,919

154
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:48,720
taking a drop of our own life's blessings and now take a drop

155
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,559
it's the drop of color from someone you care about the blessing in their life

156
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:03,120

as if it were your own

175
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,240
as we bring this practice period to a close

176
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:47,200
let there be appreciation in your heart in your body contentment for whatever arose

177
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:53,119
it did not arise and if there was one moment of goodness

178
00:36:53,119 --> 00:37:00,960

179
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:08,240

any aha moments any challenges any any gifts don i see your hand please

195
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:08,880
yeah nikki uh thanks so much it was uh

196
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:15,520
really interesting i was pondering enjoying i'll call it suffering or

197
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:22,400
pain and um and i was just that's a slippery one for me

198
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:29,839
and every once in a while i sort of go oh that's really interesting that's really cool to sort of just seeing a

199
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:35,440
pure or feeling pure sensation but it's tough and i'm just curious kind

200
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:43,280
of hear your reflections on you know observing difficulty

201
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:49,440
yeah yeah so i appreciate you bringing that up and don't mute yourself just yet don let me ask you something here i'll

202
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:54,960
say more about what i mean and yet i think there's something very important here that you're raising from your own

203
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,400
experience it feels like something opens up for you in the way of oh actually there's some

204
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:06,319
maybe there's gratitude or or or openness to dukkas of to suffering

205
00:40:06,319 --> 00:40:13,200
seen a different way and then it's like whoa whoa whoa this is slippery slope this is not safe this is not okay is that how it's showing up or actually let

206
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:21,359
me hear it from your words oh it the slippery part is it just reverts to suffering the uh sort of the

207
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:26,960
sort of excuse me sort of i'm not i'm not sure if it makes any sense

208
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:33,359
but just sort of observing the pure sensation and is is sort of

209
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:38,960
yeah i can enjoy that and and and sometimes it's suffering or it could be pleasure

210
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,240
but in the case of suffering oftentimes it just reversed you oh wow this is really painful

211
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,280
and um and and so there isn't that that joy and uh

212
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,200
and i heard at one point you mentioned that it would sort of be patient

213
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:03,280
and uh and yeah that's the part that's like oh okay how patient do i need to be

214
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:08,640
yeah right right right yeah so so very interesting so what i'm hearing in your

215
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:14,160
own experience it seems like maybe and also sounds like you're talking about physical pain because there's so many different types of suffering but you

216
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:20,000
talk about physical pain it sounds like both men physically mentally

217
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:26,400
and maybe there is a moment of opening up to oh just seeing perhaps a different perspective and suffering and then

218
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:33,760
reverts back so so so um i think what i mean by that again this is not it's not meant to be

219
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:40,480
it's not at all a masochistic way of enjoying pain it's it's not that at all

220
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,520
for its furthest from that so i just want to say that at the very beginning

221
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:52,240
but what what it is is that our perspective can shift our perspective

222
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:57,520
um to what what we take to be

223
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:02,880
reality or experience what's good what's bad it can shift

224
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:10,400
and and sometimes it can be surprising um and there can even be the sense of

225
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:16,400
and and maybe one way that's easier to see that sometimes not enjoying suffering but maybe the word gratitude

226
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:22,880
for suffering i think that might be more present for people that might be the way to enter that's not so much enjoying it

227
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,160
so i'll drop that for now because that that's a little it could be more obtuse or weird but

228
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:35,839
let's let's work with with appreciation for suffering and that i think that can be more

229
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:41,440
uh accessible because sometimes you can actually see the goodness you can we can see the

230
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:47,680
bright the silver lining in the suffering that's that's inter intertwined with it so

231
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:54,880
there's a sense of gratitude for it because of this there is that and yet sometimes

232
00:42:54,880 --> 00:43:00,160
this perspective shifts so much that it's not just the silver lining but it's like

233
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,839
wow even suffering this is grace to be human to have the joys to even have the

234
00:43:05,839 --> 00:43:12,400
sorrows this is this is amazing this is grace the mind the heart can open to

235
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:20,480
that perspective and and yet don't push it just knowing that that can be available like that can be possibility

236
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:28,400
does that does that help don yeah thank you great thank you so much for bringing that in

237
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:36,720
any other reflections before we turn to practicing community

238
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:43,280
anything else that opened up for you today in this way of getting into this practice of mudita from a very

239
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:48,400
different way i'm really curious about that if you notice the

240
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,960
they're just relaxing releasing and enjoying and then just dropper full of your own enjoyment then drop her full of

241
00:43:54,960 --> 00:44:00,400
somebody else's enjoyment into your life like wow this is another

242
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,440
way to feel feel joy for others joys so

243
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:11,040
merry christine oh my goodness i see you and booty booty

244
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:24,670
boys all of a sudden very loving joyously [Laughter]

245
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:33,839
is it that the suffering gives us are we gradual because the suffering opens an opportunity to

246
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:40,079
explore is that what you're saying or i've misunderstood yeah i think that's the first stage of

247
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:46,240
it i think that's what i'm that's the first stage that can be more accessible for people that it's it's through the

248
00:44:46,240 --> 00:44:52,480
suffering that a lot of growth uh and there's so many studies about post-traumatic growth etc that we

249
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:59,119
wouldn't be the people we are if it wasn't for the challenges we have in our life so so that's an easier accessible

250
00:44:59,119 --> 00:45:06,160
so yes i'm saying that and i'm saying another level to that which is above and

251
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:15,440
beyond that okay thank you from birdie and i ah thanks to both you and bodhi oh so sweet

252
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:19,640
oh my god so cute

253
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:25,839
in the other reflections a quick one perhaps um

254
00:45:25,839 --> 00:45:32,960
again how this different way might have affected you impacted you entering this

255
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:39,759
this metaphor of the dropper full of appreciation for your own or somebody else's

256
00:45:44,560 --> 00:45:50,720
maybe i'll share since i don't see any hands or written reflections i mean for me again this is another way to get into

257
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:56,560
it and it's instead of going into like imagine somebody else's happiness and feel happy for them this really brings

258
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:03,839
it home this really brings it in this embodiment of happiness joy for ourselves delight

259
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:10,319
appreciation and then for them it's just such a physical and and what i was sharing at the end for

260
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:17,680
example imagining what came up in my mind or someone that i know who's very physically active with sports and

261
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:25,040
and just imagine taking a dropper full of their uh energy and their joy to all these

262
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:32,079
sports and dropping and you're like oh yes it's as if it's my own there's a such a sense of embodied

263
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:39,359
appreciation embodied mudita via carious joy which is different from a heady appreciation that's what i was

264
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:44,560
hoping you would you would tap into that's my hope however much that was

265
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:52,160
possible anyway so dear ones let's turn to

266
00:46:52,160 --> 00:47:00,800
to holding each other with mudita with appreciation with with with joy and i will um

267
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:06,319
create the practice discussion rooms with another couple of people

268
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:12,480
invitation always is to just share from your own experience and the next person we share from theirs

269
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:19,200
will say past just hold space if you don't want to speak that's fine holding kind space for each other

270
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:25,119
and then the next person then comes back to you you'll go around around a few times so we'll be sure to monologue each

271
00:47:25,119 --> 00:47:30,400
person not into no interruptions asking questions just sharing from your own

272
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:37,119
experience and not facilitating the group either just showing up and letting other people show

273
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:43,760
up in whichever way is safe and comfortable for them and holding each other with kindness

274
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:50,480
so tonight you're invited to say if you like something about how this practice was for you or maybe

275
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:56,400
something that you're grateful for just the dropper full for of your life or somebody else's

276
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:03,040
