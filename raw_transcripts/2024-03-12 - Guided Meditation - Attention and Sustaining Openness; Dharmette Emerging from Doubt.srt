1
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:11,040
okay folks so uh welcome

2
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:18,000
um so in a moment we'll uh we'll sit but just to say that

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,080
uh a lot of different ways we can break down sitting but

4
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:31,720
uh illuminate the different facets of what is entailed by meditation

5
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:37,480
but one distinction that feels important to me is uh we're we're learning to

6
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:45,640
train the attention that kind of attentional Spotlight uh and we're learning to uh

7
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:52,960
stay open to not let the awareness collapse even when intensity is running

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,920
through our system through body and mind

9
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:07,119
and we can get overidentified with the attentional facet of practice Focus this

10
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:15,680
breaths the kind of Stillness seclusion um but uh part of why we do

11
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:23,280
that actually is to strengthen the capacity just to stay uncollapsed amidst

12
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,400
intensity and we study collapse at a kind of micro level it may not happen in

13
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,280
some major meltdown during a sit but there are little micro meltdowns

14
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:44,000
where something is even just the urge to to um you know to scratch an

15
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:50,880
itch is a is a subtle kind of meltdown that we pay attention to okay how did

16
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:57,479
that happen how did we get kind of overrun uh and we pay attention to those

17
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,840
little micro collapses because

18
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:11,879
is they happen in more significant ways in our lives so what does it mean to actually

19
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:19,040
stay stay open even as the kind of channels the affective emotional

20
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:25,599
channels are stimulated and might lead us to the kind

21
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:31,080
of awareness collapsing into that intensity so we're directing the

22
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:40,280
attention and then keeping a certain kind of uh Poise amidst amidst uh the

23
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:44,879
intensity so let's uh let's

24
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
practice

25
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:50,080
so without laying too [Music] many conceptual maps on what meditation

26
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:55,720
is we just uh take our posture take our

27
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
posture

28
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:17,439
we kind of trust that there's enough uh goodness

29
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:25,080
here to fuel our meditation

30
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
forever

31
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,720
the intensity that is life seems to

32
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:17,720
beg the awareness to collapse kind of

33
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,039
claustrophobia of problem

34
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,880
solving but

35
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:40,680
we practice staying open broadening the

36
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
awareness

37
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:17,599
raising the kind of threshold of intensity that can be

38
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:24,240
tolerated without devolving into problem

39
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
solving

40
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:11,800
and we we notice with um patience forgiveness we notice the

41
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,680
ways that uh intensity lures us into the problem solving

42
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,360
mode awareness

43
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
collapses

44
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,839
very innocent movements of our

45
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:50,440
mind and here we're exploring just

46
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:57,000
knowing intensity without being seduced into the

47
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,200
fantasy of solving it

48
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,040
so we establish this

49
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:35,399
openness a certain kind of reverence for the first Noble

50
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:41,079
Truth that there is duka

51
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:01,120
intensity

52
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:41,600
and then when we direct attention to our breathing or

53
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:44,600
body

54
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:54,360
soundscape the attention doesn't feel so

55
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,040
brittle

56
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:16,200
the seclusion settledness Refuge Stillness is

57
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:25,000
supported by uh

58
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
relinquishment

59
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:09,200
any given moment is uh

60
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,880
imperfect but awareness makes it good

61
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,320
enough

62
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:53,120
we're attending in a simple way and we hear that kind of siren song

63
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:58,840
of uh maximization

64
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:03,799
optimizing the moment solving

65
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:13,240
problems carefully tracking threat opportunity awareness

66
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:23,320
collapses you just reestablish that openness by blessing the

67
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,240
intensity with uh okayness

68
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:45,000
reestablishing a sense of the open field of

69
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:58,880
awareness and maybe before it feels safe again

70
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:07,159
to just be with a kind of attentional anchor the breath or the body may just have to reestablish the

71
00:20:07,159 --> 00:20:13,879
sense of okayness of intensity it's

72
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:20,120
okay let the energy unwind in the

73
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
body

74
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:28,799
the only thing better than solving our problems

75
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,919
is not solving

76
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
them

77
00:29:27,159 --> 00:29:29,320
all

78
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,320
okay good to say with

79
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:26,440
you the only think better than solving our problems is not solving

80
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:31,480
them I mean what is that I don't know where that came

81
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:42,120
from sorry you know uh it makes sense in the moment you

82
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,279
know okay so

83
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:56,240
uh Faith doubt

84
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:07,279
um the uh the Buddha said that uh if we if we get stuck in in doubt uh

85
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:13,480
it's like being lost in a desert without the map you know

86
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,880
and one one conception of information

87
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:26,360
information is that information is the reduction of uncertainty the reduction

88
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:36,760
of uncertainty and every every um moment is rif with

89
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:46,360
uncertainty you know we're so hungry for for data to clarify exactly as the

90
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:52,039
Buddha said moment so open hungry to

91
00:31:52,039 --> 00:31:58,000
reduce the uncertainty of the moment and the information that we get

92
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:04,360
is through um through our senses and through the mind and this is this

93
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:13,440
reduces the level of uncertainty doubt doubt is the

94
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,240
absence of trustworthy information and so

95
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:27,240
uncertainty indecision abounds and we don't know what to trust

96
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:32,600
in doubt we don't know what to trust where to look where to harvest data from

97
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:37,840
where there's this kind of like frenzy in the

98
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:44,200
looking hungry for information but can't find it and we don't know how to

99
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:53,320
interpret what we do encounter what we do encounter and so it's like

100
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:59,960
um uh you know all all noise no

101
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:08,399
signal and people in in doubt um they tend to kind of like really

102
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:13,720
bounce around one mindmade narrative to another

103
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,880
kind of swinging between vacillating between different stories that may be

104
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:29,000
highly incompatible it's like this grappling with the static the static and doubt

105
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:36,559
and all these kind of yeah mindmade plans ideas Frameworks but they emerge

106
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:42,080
not out of any kind of deep sense of groundedness embodiment they're just

107
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,799
like just trying to Overlay some conceptual narrative on this basic sense

108
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:54,679
of uncertainty and in that state

109
00:33:54,679 --> 00:34:01,080
we um might be especially kind of influenced

110
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:06,960
by the the views of others over trusting others we look to kind of like okay

111
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:14,079
what's the prevailing views or something maybe that's it maybe I get my information you

112
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:21,878
know from there and um we tend to uh to really get

113
00:34:21,879 --> 00:34:27,520
lost in a world of thought and rumination and

114
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:36,679
um thoughts just feel so so real they feel like the the most important

115
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:48,000
data and it's a little like um we we sort of keep taking our

116
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,520
thoughts out for test drives but the ride never feels quite

117
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:59,400
right test float it float

118
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:05,160
it now part of why people get um get

119
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:11,880
Meed in doubt is that they ask the practice to do things that it can't

120
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:17,200
do we get mired when we are asking the practice to do things it can't do the

121
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:24,880
practice will not insulate us from the ungovernable tides of Pleasure and

122
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:30,240
Pain the practice cannot insulate us from from the

123
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:38,119
changing this of all things we we get mired in doubt when we

124
00:35:38,119 --> 00:35:44,800
try to out outsmart the first Noble Truth that's part of what I was alluding

125
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:51,319
to in the sit was like okay can we just not collapse amidst the intensity of the

126
00:35:51,319 --> 00:35:58,800
first Noble Truth even just here on this day together in this lovely

127
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:07,520
s just to stay still is intense and that kind of

128
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:15,319
encounter really with the first Noble Truth um uh can lure us into the fantasy

129
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:23,440
that if I just kind of could think hard enough could Harvest

130
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:32,480
enough information from my thought I'd find the answer but often there there's no answer

131
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:39,839
there's not an answer exactly to the first Noble Truth dukka

132
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:46,920
is coming for all of us regardless of what we are thinking and so to try

133
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:54,400
to um to imagine the kind of dooka free path when we're at some fork in the

134
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,480
road that leads us into doubt out you we know those moments where it's just like

135
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:07,520
oh let me let me I'm at this Fork like maybe if I is it just a two two-pronged

136
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:13,200
fork or something can I go is there a third way is there some some Dua free

137
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,640
path and we just spin in

138
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:23,760
doubt sometimes um our our craving for

139
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:29,119
certainty is what actually creates the doubt certainty is going to elude us

140
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:37,119
right but our craving for it is what what leads us to spin into

141
00:37:37,119 --> 00:37:44,359
doubt so um Aristotle said something like wisdom satisfied with the degree of

142
00:37:44,359 --> 00:37:49,880
precision that the nature of the subject admits and doesn't seek exactness where

143
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:54,240
only the approximation is

144
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:02,720
possible in formal practice doubt doubt manifests

145
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:08,920
as um sometimes as like uncertainty about

146
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:16,920
technique you know should I do vasana or meta is like this kind of like Dharma

147
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:23,880
fomo you know like there's some I'm missing something something you

148
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:31,160
know or doubt manifests as the kind of rush to fit all the puzzle pieces of the

149
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:39,000
Dharma together you know just to like make

150
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:47,200
everything square with everything else or doubt manifests as getting mired

151
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:54,440
in in kind of theoretical um questions you

152
00:38:54,440 --> 00:39:01,400
know of sometimes doubt is like with a sense of like oh yeah we're performing

153
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:07,560
meditation for someone even if that's someone is just our own inner audience

154
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:14,200
our own you know meditation super ego or something or performing for the teacher

155
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:22,880
or something but it's like that that that's an expression of a certain kind of doubt and faith

156
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,720
faith simplifies things so much relaxes

157
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:35,520
amidst Faith

158
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:45,560
we're we're no longer hungry to uh confirm that we're on the right

159
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:52,800
path we're we're no longer uh kind of so preoccupied with

160
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:59,599
doing it right we know we're just going to keep going like and of course we're doing it right and wrong and we're going

161
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:11,319
to learn we're going to grow Sharon solsberg uh speaks about um Faith as uh

162
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:16,440
you know written her book of Faith um as the process by

163
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:22,240
which uh you come to trust your own experience I think that might even be

164
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:28,359
the subtitle of the book it's like coming to trust your own deepest experience

165
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,800
there's a kind of power in that in our faith a certain kind of Independence

166
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:41,760
grows we start to know what to

167
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:47,480
trust and it engenders patience

168
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:53,280
and uh you know it doesn't matter anymore how long something takes how

169
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:58,319
long the path is going to keep going

170
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:03,880
and uh aun aun suito likened Faith to

171
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:10,760
like a hinge point on the door and once once that hinge is set the door is going

172
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:16,000
to swing open sometime you

173
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:27,319
know the teacher's job is mostly to get you know maybe it's to get people to

174
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:35,760
to the point where that Hing is set or the point where in a sense there's no no

175
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:43,240
going back you know and once once a person's there once

176
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:49,079
there's no going back mostly the job of the teacher is just cheerleading you

177
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:55,280
know and um that door will swing open that door

178
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:02,040
will swing open and so the Dharma doesn't doesn't feel

179
00:42:02,040 --> 00:42:08,000
like a choice we have to keep making doesn't feel like a choice we

180
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,520
have to keep making there's

181
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:21,720
Faith so offer this for your uh your

182
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:28,160
