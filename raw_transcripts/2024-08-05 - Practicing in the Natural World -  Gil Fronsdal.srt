1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,759
yeah good morning it is is quite nice to be back here and those of you who

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,799
haven't been here much um I've been gone for the last maybe five weeks or

3
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:17,760
something and um I was away for the month of July and

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,680
so For Better or For Worse I thought I would tell you what I did my Su for my

5
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:31,880
summer and as a um as a kind of background for this talk

6
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:37,360
maybe as a question for you to carry with you as you listen to the talk or after the

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,480
talk is um around the topic that in

8
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,360
Buddhism uh it maybe at least in our tradition it's uh less interesting to

9
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,760
ask the question of yourself who am I than it is to ask the question what is

10
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,960
my nature uh what is natural for us here

11
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:05,960
and when you ask the question what is natural for you that uh can highlight

12
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:11,320
the second question what is not natural and this of course raises lots

13
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:20,360
of interesting philosophical questions and protests very quickly but um but uh what is it that

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:25,920
belongs to the Natural World distinct from the social World distin from the

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:34,840
social world and the mental world we live in where we could construct we fabricate we uh make up all kinds of

16
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:41,040
ideas in which we live in that we don't question we take it as just this is how

17
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,040
things are and but to start questioning the distinction between what

18
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,439
is natural and what is socially constructed is a powerful way to really

19
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:58,719
begin going deep into this world of seeing ourselves knowing ourselves and

20
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,840
finding a way to Freedom so that's the background and the reason

21
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:09,679
for that background for this talk is that for uh good part of the month of

22
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:17,560
July most of July uh I lived in the wilderness I lived outdoors I was about

23
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,959
10 days I was backpacking and uh for two weeks I was

24
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:30,239
um uh living in a kind of a nature preserve 1300 acre Nature Preserve and

25
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:37,239
all this was in the forested mountains and foothills of in northern Oregon

26
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:43,920
Northern and Central and northern eastern Oregon had never been there before it it's quite beautiful to be

27
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,920
there and for most of that time for three weeks of that time uh I was um a

28
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,800
part of the faculty uh teaching a program called nature Dharma teacher

29
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:03,440
training and this was a uh we took a group of about

30
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,840
maybe originally maybe about 20 people who had already been trained to be Insight Meditation

31
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,920
teachers and a group of about five people who are had long histories of

32
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:22,000
being guides uh facilitators for bringing people into the natural world into the Wilderness and backpacking and

33
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,080
things like that and brought them together uh in order to train them in

34
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:35,519
how to uh be able to offer meditation Retreats uh day longs teaching events

35
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:41,159
somehow that's embedded in the natural world so some of them were back some

36
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:49,040
people are offering backpacking Retreats some people are offering what's called stationary camping Retreats you go someplace and somehow and then you stay

37
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:55,200
at some outdoor place and people are camping and and all the meditation is

38
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:01,360
done Outdoors all the sometimes the eating is done Outdoors the whole day is SP

39
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,920
outdoors and so uh we were so that was that was the focus of the three of those

40
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:13,720
weeks and it was a little bit the practicum for them taking them into the Wilderness in order to practice there

41
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,639
and and um and good part of it was actually meant to be a retreat for them

42
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:26,720
rather than the PED pedagogy of how to do this giving them a deep experience for doing it including three days in

43
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:32,199
which they all did solos and there solo practice in natural world and nature by

44
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:38,120
yourself away from everyone is um even even away from themselves just really

45
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:44,600
alone is can be extremely powerful and in all kinds of ways and in

46
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:49,800
fact it was to hear them debrief afterwards at the end of this was quite

47
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,000
something and um so that's kind of what I did and uh in a few of those at the

48
00:04:56,000 --> 00:05:05,080
end of it I went backpacking with my wife up there around Mount hood and um one of the reflections I had

49
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:10,400
this uh for a month living you know living outdoors and Hiking

50
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,479
Outdoors um and much of the time I slept Under the Stars just uh I didn't even

51
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:22,360
use a tent and um was uh coming across I think

52
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,560
the first this reflection first first began coming across a very big Douglas

53
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,880
fur probably considered an old growth Douglas fur and in much of these forests

54
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:40,440
that we traveled in we were living in um there was very little old growth there

55
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:47,039
were beautiful forests but many of them had been planted many of them had just kind of sprouted up after things have

56
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:53,000
been cut down and maybe bit enough decade since they was cut down that had grown up quite a bit but they weren't

57
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,160
old growth and I remember coming across this the big Douglas fur huge

58
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:07,400
tall wide big and it kind of took my breath away it kind of like it was in

59
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:12,759
awe looking at this tree and I felt like I was entered a

60
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:22,160
whole different relationship to time because this tree must have been around for a long time um both the Timeless now

61
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:27,520
and that long span of History I felt kind of humbled in the

62
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:34,560
presence of it I felt a little bit smaller than I usually am and uh I had a very different feeling

63
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:40,919
of my my relationship to the cosmos to The Wider World by being in relationship

64
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:46,919
to this big tree that's been around a long time I've I've traveled in places in the

65
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:53,199
world like in Japan where uh you come across periodically also places where there's

66
00:06:53,199 --> 00:07:00,000
been uh lots of Forestry you know there's mountains in Japan that are filled monocropped with it beautiful

67
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:06,400
cedar trees but they're there because they've been cut and grown it's a big part of the industry in Japan is to have

68
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:14,479
cedar trees but then you come across a cedar tree in Japan that is 800 years

69
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:19,840
old wow and it isn't just you come across a stream it's massive massive

70
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:25,360
massive trunk and this you know gnarled and big and I mean it's kind of like a

71
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,800
power spot or kind of like this is special this is like something and the

72
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:39,319
mind can go quiet just like wow and in fact in Japan these trees have become um

73
00:07:39,319 --> 00:07:45,479
worshiped you see there's a little altar in the front of it people put their coins there put water there a little bit

74
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:51,240
of food there to the tree the tree is not going to benefit from that but uh

75
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:56,360
maybe but um and they say it's the Kami and there's a wonderful term in Japan

76
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:03,599
Kami no one in Japan apparently there's no consensus in Japan what a Kami is so

77
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,080
maybe sometimes a kind of a God and God in the natural world the god of the tree

78
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:16,280
but maybe it's not maybe it's just the natural force the living Force that's alive there that's the Kami maybe what

79
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:21,479
is doesn't really matter people want to worship it people stop and sit and are

80
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:28,280
quiet and they they bow to that then and uh and so when I was seeing

81
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:36,039
this um being old growth Douglas fur in Japan I wonder what it was like that

82
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:42,440
area when it was full of old growth trees what was it like here in the

83
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:47,560
peninsula when it was filled with massive oak trees there's a few left

84
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:54,800
here and there you can see some years ago there was a massive Oak Tree on madale pulus on the corner there that

85
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:00,000
the city felt was dangerous it was so old they felt it was going to fall or break

86
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:06,600
branches and Fallen cars or something on the kids there near the school over there and the pro the neighbors

87
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,120
protested the kids protested and the kids made these little altars and put

88
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:18,399
bracelets around the trunk of the big tree and made offerings and dolls and everything and trying to protect the

89
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,600
tree and finally when they realized they couldn't they do even more kind of things to honor the tree

90
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,160
and I you know the kids had no idea about Kami but you know but they this

91
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:34,720
was special their relationship to this tree but what if what if most of the

92
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:42,640
trees here in the peninsula were still here what if there were no homes no

93
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:48,800
fences what what if there was just you go from from St Carlos all the way down

94
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:56,880
to Mountain View and it's a vast plane of grasslands and these huge oak trees

95
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:02,600
with no fence lines what what happens to your site and how you see what happens

96
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,800
to your relationship to the land what if there's very few people there what if

97
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:15,000
there's some grizzly bears so in U

98
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:21,040
1792 maybe the fir one of the first English people who came to California

99
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,279
was George Vancouver who was a

100
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:36,720
Explorer Vancouver up in Canada is named after after him and um and I think he came and

101
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:43,160
visited the San Francisco Bay area in November of that year he was in San

102
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,959
Francisco and he uh he took a party of people on Horseback and rode down the

103
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,680
peninsula to San Jose and as he crossed kind of the the

104
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:00,839
the area that's the boundary between uh St Carlos and Redwood City so right here

105
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:08,440
where we're we're sitting today um he um he described this whole area about 20

106
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:16,560
miles going south as U uh like an English

107
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:24,360
park with Old English oak trees so I can imagine being November it

108
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:32,200
would the grass was just getting green and it must have been spectacular with this big trees and open Plains and

109
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,560
and very few people here the lam chin uh indigenous people of Redwood

110
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,320
City from Belmont down to I think maybe Atherton

111
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:50,880
and around fi and the bay um they people think there were only

112
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:57,920
about 350 of them at the time when Vancouver came through this is before the Spanish land

113
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,279
grants happens few years later so what an amazing thing to imagine this

114
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:09,519
peninsula here where we are here this vast plains with massive oak

115
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:17,199
trees and what would we like to be here and walk through that what was what happens to your gaze

116
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:24,079
how you look across the land what happens when you stand in front of these huge ancient

117
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,199
trees would it be a very different experience than you walk down a city

118
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:34,360
streets in Redwood City and see all the fences one after the other and you look

119
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:40,480
gaze along One Direction and it's like you can't see very far because there's fences maybe you see 30 ft maybe 10 ft

120
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:47,440
maybe 5T the houses are in the way there's no Grand Vistas unless you stand in the middle of the street and you're

121
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:55,600
lucky you know no one runs no one runs you over you you can see way down the asphalt a mile or two perhaps you know

122
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:02,480
that's maybe nice but um but uh but maybe what you can do

123
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,880
if you're if you're kind of tuned in you look up into the sky and in the sky you

124
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:14,440
see a Grand View the sky you see the clouds and the vastness of it and that

125
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:20,399
feels kind of special relaxing peaceful to see but just walking through Redwood

126
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:26,480
City maybe it's kind of peaceful right now there's a lot of wonderful trees here and so it's kind of nice just if

127
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:33,720
you like trees but but so what was it like for the Lumin the

128
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:38,839
natives who used to live here still here around the Lumin there's one family left

129
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:46,600
of the Lumin that uh indigenous people of this area and one lineage and

130
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:52,120
um you know what was their relationship what was the relationship

131
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:59,680
of you know when when the natural world was massive was awesome was

132
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:06,360
created so much was a kind of a peaceful View and place and when the trees and

133
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:13,839
the sky and the mountains and the waters and the grizzly bears and everything

134
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:20,279
were kind of part of the territory in the land does it change how people feel

135
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:28,399
does it change people's relationship to the natural world there's a change how people relate to themselves how they

136
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:33,440
understand themselves in that and some of us have gone into

137
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:40,120
the natural world away from the social world have gone in gone camping backpacking sometimes you know just

138
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:47,079
going for a Day hike in the Park Nature Preserve here in the peninsula will sh change and shift your relationship to

139
00:14:47,079 --> 00:14:54,880
yourself it's so easy living in a social urban life where all the kind of ways in

140
00:14:54,880 --> 00:15:03,639
which life is organized are socially constructed what we wear where we go how we work the

141
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:09,240
relationship between the different people that we encounter all belong kind of to a social world that's been

142
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:16,440
constructed and invented fashions that we have Fashions of what kind of bodies are accepted and

143
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:23,240
appreciated not appreciated uh Trends and what kind of sexuality and genders are understood and

144
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:30,000
appreciated and how we relate to them there's so many ways race ethnic

145
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:35,959
that we have ideas and biased and preferences and and uh bump up against

146
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:42,680
that are challenging and we the Dynamics between different genders this very rich

147
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:50,120
social world that's mostly a social construct 90% maybe 80% some percent

148
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:57,079
that uh if you just go to a different culture you see that the the relationship people have between genders

149
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:03,279
is is uh sometimes radically different than how it is here in California and

150
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,519
how much of it is socially constructed and how much of it is that we think it's

151
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:15,000
natural and we go into the natural world away from most you know social things

152
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:23,440
and it's remarkable how much of this socially constructed kind of spinning of the Mind

153
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:30,759
quiets down the preoccupations the concerns the he did she did they did

154
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:36,759
kind of become quieter trying to live up to standards which are belong to our

155
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:44,360
society or family or the people we have around us quiet down and it's remarkable to be able to

156
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:52,360
step away from the social world the social constructs and just be able to breathe easily and have the Mind become

157
00:16:52,360 --> 00:17:00,279
quieter and little bit that's what we or maybe a lot of it this is what some of us experience in meditation

158
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:06,160
that meditation itself is a quieting of the socially constructed

159
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:12,199
world because that's the quieting of the Mind the thinking mind is mostly that's what it

160
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:20,400
is and uh and then we discover the natural world in ourselves and just as it is awesome to

161
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,959
encounter an 800 year Cedar Tre or to stand looking out at the

162
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:33,799
Majesty of Mount Hood which I saw many times in the hiking

163
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:41,760
trip it's possible to sit quietly and and view the Majesty of the

164
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,280
inner landscape to feel the the the

165
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,480
awe of being conscious and present and peaceful that can be

166
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:59,600
inside there's a natural world inside of us that's available as well and the capacity to go into the

167
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:09,520
natural world in order to um uh have the social World calm down is

168
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:17,600
extremely powerful it allows us to begin questioning and becoming wise about the

169
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:24,520
constructed world that the mind is usually living in what we we can see more clearly what is necessary and what

170
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:31,440
not necessary whereas we're always living in the social World always navigating it it all that seems natural

171
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:39,039
that seems obvious that seems Universal that seems like there's nothing else but the step away from it is

172
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:46,760
powerful so in Buddhism there's been a very long tradition of practitioners meditation

173
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:53,159
practitioners going into the natural world to practice sometimes they're called Forest

174
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:59,720
practitioners uh sometimes they're called Wilderness PR practitioners there different names that they use for uh for

175
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:05,960
these practitioners and um and in the periods in the many thousands of years of

176
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:14,440
Buddhist history 2500 years of Buddhist history sometimes whole schools of Buddhism have been revived by the forest

177
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:21,520
tradition by the the monks and the nuns who have gone into the forest to practice and sometime there's been a

178
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:27,520
tension between the the Buddhist teachers and practitioners who live in

179
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:34,360
urban settings and urban monasteries and those who step away from that social world to practice deep sometimes alone

180
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:41,559
deep in the forests sometimes little monasteries Forest monasteries and uh sometimes that

181
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:47,080
tension has been creative a useful creative tension and um sometimes it's

182
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:54,280
been really essential because as I said sometimes Buddhism has been revived by it in our tradition the Insight movement

183
00:19:54,280 --> 00:20:02,240
that we're part of here we are clearly uh uh inherited that some of the uh

184
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:08,760
benefits that came from the forest practitioners in Thailand and in Burma

185
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:15,480
in the late 1800s and early 1900s and to give you one dramatic kind of reference

186
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,760
point for this is that uh in the 1800s in

187
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:27,240
Thailand uh the dominant Buddhism of the time did not believe it was possible for

188
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:32,960
human beings to become enlightened anymore to have some degree of realization that was not possible and

189
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:39,080
they weren't oriented around doing that so a lot of the emphasis was in study and preserving the teachings but not

190
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:45,679
doing deep practice but there were a couple of people who decided oh no this is not

191
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,960
possible uh it's possible and they went into the forest away from the urban

192
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:59,559
Buddhism of the time and went deep in the forest and practiced for years and came back and said yes it's

193
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:06,320
possible to have some degree of attainment of realization of freedom and uh the ecclesiastical

194
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,360
authorities of the time in the early 1900s no criticize him no no it's not possible it's not possible what you're

195
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:18,880
doing is not possible right up until 1950s they were being told you can't

196
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:24,919
they can't do this but uh the those there was two monks in particular who went and did

197
00:21:24,919 --> 00:21:31,400
this and one of them was a man named aanm and uh and his attainment his

198
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:39,919
realization really made a big impact slowly and um and among his uh his

199
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:45,360
people who had a big impact was aan sha who went to study with him aan cha was a

200
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,520
teacher for auno aun suito for Jack

201
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:56,000
cornfield and uh and and this idea that it's possible to practice to the point

202
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,039
of some kind of Deep attainment came out of that and then it became more

203
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:07,200
popular and by 1950s there was a big shift in Thailand a little bit earlier in decades

204
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,400
earlier in Burma and maybe I don't know when exactly the shift was in in Sri

205
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,919
Lanka but in all these places there was the forest uh monastics who really who

206
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:24,840
went didn't practiced away from all this that really showed what was possible and

207
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,360
why is it the forest monascus could do this I think part hardly is the support

208
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:36,559
that this natural world gives us in practicing the natural world teaches us

209
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:43,279
how to distinguish between the world of social constructs and and the world that's free

210
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:49,120
of it the natural world also challenges Us in ways that are invaluable for

211
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:56,080
Buddhist practice going into the Wilderness by yourself even if it's just going to one

212
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:01,320
day is frightening for some people it's

213
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,159
uncomfortable there are times when it's uh it's championed as a place that's really peaceful and nice and it's

214
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:12,360
inspiring to go feel the peace peaceful settings of a natural setting sometimes

215
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:18,440
and people can experience peace sometimes in a natural setting that's greater than any other time in their

216
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:24,840
life but there's also it's uncomfortable in the natural world there are

217
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,240
mosquitoes Grizzlies there are the weather is not

218
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:35,640
Cooperative uh you go out and live in the natural world and you know it's not

219
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:44,600
you know pastoral environments there could be storms and lightning and thunder and and uh fires and here in

220
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:55,640
California Oregon and Washington these These Days smoke and um and uh I was woken up at

221
00:23:55,640 --> 00:24:00,039
Night by something

222
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:10,880
chomping they sound like sound like very hard chomping teeth right close to my

223
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:18,559
head what is that and before I could turn to look two cute little fawns

224
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:25,679
dashed by me one of the women who was part of the the three-day solo she was sitting

225
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:33,000
minding her own business meditating and she heard this crashing sound behind her she turned around to see a big bear

226
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:38,760
running by and another one chose a place to to

227
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:45,679
uh spend her three days she kind of was very careful and tried to be respectful for whatever was part of the natural

228
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:53,799
world and and somehow she chose up spot that was kind of the home of a herd of

229
00:24:53,799 --> 00:25:00,200
deer and they kind of like checked her out in the middle of the night they were check out what's going on you know what

230
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:07,559
who is this person and she wondered whether she should move but you know so you know there's so many things

231
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:12,960
so the idea of not having the Creature Comforts but to really practice with

232
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:19,080
renunciation letting go of Comforts letting go of it has to be just our as

233
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:26,600
we want it to be our preferences and all this this is part of the gift of being in the natural world and for these

234
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:32,440
Forest monastics who went into the for for us back then they had to kind of let go of so much they had to work with

235
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:40,440
their fears work with their desires work with their preferences and learn how to let go very very deeply and why is that

236
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:46,840
useful because if you really want to drop the world of attachments the world

237
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:53,640
of all these social constructs that we live in and are caught in it really helps to be able to learn to let go in a

238
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:58,919
deep way to really learn how to be at ease

239
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:04,919
with discomfort to let go to work with our fear go to the other side of the

240
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:12,200
fear be in fearful places but not run away and I'll end this talk by saying

241
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:17,840
that there's a beautiful discourse in this in the ancient teachings attributed to the

242
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:24,919
Buddha where uh a man comes to the Buddha and says you know something basically

243
00:26:24,919 --> 00:26:32,000
something like this I notice that you and your followers sometimes go and practice in the wilderness in the forest

244
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:39,919
it's hard to practice in the forest it's frightening to be there and the Buddha says oh yes it's hard to practice in a

245
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:46,279
forest it's frightening to go in there before I was enlightened I wanted to go into the forest to practice and I

246
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:51,760
considered yes it's difficult in the forest it's frightening but then he I thought about

247
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:57,919
myself and I said well if you're not ethical you don't to live an ethical life then it can be frightening to go in

248
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:04,440
the for Forest but I lived an ethical life so that's I don't have that

249
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:10,760
fear if uh if I have a lot of the hindrances a lot of desire for sensual

250
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,840
pleasure a lot of aversions looth and toror restlessness and doubt and

251
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:22,200
uncertainties um anxiety it's hard to go in the forest and uh live there by

252
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:29,320
yourself and he said no but I don't have the hindrances so he listed at all these things he did this review so I'll go

253
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:35,120
live I'll go practice in the forest and um and uh and he said I'll go

254
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:40,640
practice it and I'll work with my fear that comes up that's still left and in

255
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:47,240
fact the Buddha before was enlightened when practiced in the forest and he he was frightened he got afraid isn't that

256
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:54,399
nice story we hold up the Buddha as being like perfect and he's never going to be afraid but he was writing and then

257
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:01,960
it's cute how he he talks about it he says yeah uh sometimes there were you know uh you know these footsteps around

258
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:07,320
me at night and there was peacocks he he got frightened of the

259
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:13,159
peacocks walking around and uh but he made a commitment that no matter what

260
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:18,880
posture he was practicing in when he got afraid he would stay in that posture

261
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:25,600
until he saw went through the other side of the fear and um and so he had to deal with

262
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:33,159
peacocks in the biographies out about photographies of these forest monastics in Thailand some of them talked about

263
00:28:33,159 --> 00:28:39,279
sitting and having to confront Tigers you know they were dangerous things and so tigers are roaring around the middle

264
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:45,000
of the night and they're sitting there and tigers are roaring and they felt really afraid and they said okay I'm

265
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:51,840
going to sit here and work with this Spar and the ones who

266
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,360
survived wrote wrote wrote biographies biography

267
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:07,720
and uh so the Buddha went off and um you know dealt with his fear there and then

268
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:12,840
when he work through his fear then this this particular discourse goes on and just describes how he stayed in the

269
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:18,559
forest and got very concentrated and his concentration had insight and then became

270
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:26,039
liberated but then at the end of the story he's talking to this man uh and he says well some of you

271
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:31,360
might think that uh uh I go into the forest to practice now

272
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:38,440
that I'm fully awakened because I'm not really fully awakened he said that's that's not the case I go to practice in

273
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:44,840
the forest for my own comfort and my own my own sense of ease and

274
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:50,519
delight and I do so out of compassion for future

275
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:58,200
generations and the usual understanding of why he does it for future Generations he wants to be a model an example of how

276
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:06,159
to practice and to go into the Wilderness to practice and um and so that was

277
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:12,519
considered to very very for the Buddha a very important way of practicing some of that might be because

278
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:21,120
back in 2500 years ago they were still living in the bronze ages and it was you know there were no meditation centers

279
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:27,360
there wasn't no retreat center he could sign up for you know maybe if the Buddha had lived today he would have signed up

280
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:33,919
for a retreat he would have gone to IRC or something um but uh back then there were

281
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:41,240
no such things and so the place to kind of really go have the circumstance the occasion the ability to go and be in

282
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:46,480
seclusion and practice and meditation day after day in a way that really uh

283
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:53,600
was not caught up and Complicated by the social World it took going off into the forest for a while and he did that and

284
00:30:53,600 --> 00:31:00,399
then he came back and he would go back and forth between these two worlds and that's been the Rhythm for many Buddhist

285
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:07,279
practitioners down through the centuries the rhythm of spending time in the wilderness practicing and times being in

286
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:14,679
urban settings and teaching and supporting people and so we don't have a very rich

287
00:31:14,679 --> 00:31:21,880
uh Forest tradition yet in the United States there are some wonderful Forest monastics who are starting that and and

288
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:28,200
uh and kind of living that way and um but the lay tradition of inside teacher

289
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,120
that we are um that's only it's only about 20 20 years old that some teachers

290
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:41,600
like Susie Harrington and Mark Coleman had been beginning to exp experiment with teaching Wilderness

291
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:47,120
Retreats and so they wanted to pass this on to the next Generation so they

292
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:52,679
created this teacher training program for people to do this and and uh they

293
00:31:52,679 --> 00:31:58,279
invited me to become along not quite qualified for it I never taught things

294
00:31:58,279 --> 00:32:05,559
in the wilderness like they have but they wanted me along anyway and I felt very privileged to be part of it and and

295
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:11,600
to be been very important part of my practice uh practicing in these

296
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:17,039
Wilderness settings I spent three years in Los Padres national forests with at

297
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:22,679
tahara that was all outdoors and in the forest in Thailand and little there I

298
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:28,960
was in little cies little little huts and uh and uh in one way or the other

299
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:34,799
natural world has been a big influence on my own practice and my own um

300
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:40,639
understanding of what freedom is how freedom is possible and what freedom

301
00:32:40,639 --> 00:32:45,679
is so um that's what I did for my

302
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:54,360
summer luckily I don't luckily I don't have to write an essay on that so um so we have a few minutes

303
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,360
before the usual ending time if any of you would like to ask any questions questions or comments or anything about

304
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:05,398
this or anything at all you're welcome to do

305
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:20,200
so so I have a question about the logistics where do you go to the

306
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:27,000
bathroom oh uh so the one of the guides there five people who are really trained

307
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:33,440
to take people and keep people safe in the natural world teach them Logistics and how to put tents up and everything

308
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:38,639
uh she did this beautiful like I don't know it probably was like 20 minute long

309
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:44,559
talk about pooping in the wilderness and uh everyone was like wow

310
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:53,158
they never had such a thorough complete you know but all the details you can imagine and it was it was quite of

311
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:59,399
inspiring and um but um the idea when you go you know in the wilderness that

312
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:05,080
uh nowadays especially in many places you're supposed to go um leave no Trace

313
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:11,720
so uh for pooping you're supposed to dig a hole that's fairly deep so people have trolls with them and you're supposed to

314
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:18,480
bring your toilet paper out of the Wilderness with you so you bring Ziploc bags and you take them with you and then

315
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,760
because you're not supposed to leave anything there and so there's a whole way of doing that and where where to dig your hole and how to make your hole in a

316
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:32,520
way that doesn't cause problems for later and thank

317
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:47,079
you I have this theory that one reason or maybe for some people the main reason

318
00:34:47,079 --> 00:34:54,839
that being a forest monastic is helpful toward becoming enlightened or moving toward Enlightenment is that you just

319
00:34:54,839 --> 00:35:01,320
don't have so much stuff that you own that's precious to you and that you worry about

320
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:08,480
losing house I think all the precious things in your house your decades long

321
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:14,838
book writing projects or or whatever achievements you're you have to make sure you keep your

322
00:35:16,359 --> 00:35:21,880
Tri but if you lose your trial you can probably borrow one from someone else anyway not so much stuff to be attached

323
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:27,680
to what do you think you said you know the primary I think I think it's an important

324
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:33,040
important reason I think that uh to simplify the life life of radical

325
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:40,160
Simplicity and it's not just because of stuff but it's also because of responsibilities and caring for the work

326
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:45,880
and all kinds of things quiet down for a while it becomes more and more simple and I think being able to live a

327
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:51,400
radically simple life uh and uh and it's sometimes easier to do it in the

328
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:58,760
wilderness and elsewhere but it also takes a lot of preparation because like what do you do for food

329
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:05,640
and uh one of the people who was doing the program who's a a um a guide kind

330
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:14,160
of is um is is a is a uh is taken uh survival

331
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:21,160
courses Wilderness survival courses like in the desert and now teaches that so they really well trained and she all she

332
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:28,079
brings into when she goes in I think she wears a cloth some kind of clothes but um she goes in with a knife

333
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:33,599
goes into the deserts or the mountains just with a knife that's and from that she has to figure out how to sleep and

334
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,839
how to create conditions and find food and water and everything and she's skilled mean she mean she's done

335
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:44,880
programs to learn this so that's very simple but it's also complicated you

336
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:52,240
have you're busy trying to figure out food and um generally uh like for

337
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:58,119
example when people did the solo trip three days in the wilderness um it was pretty simple but there were other

338
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:05,560
people who had prepared food for them and so they packed up prepared food and and food that could can last for 3 days

339
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:12,839
and had that with them so they didn't have to cook really and actually they weren't allowed to bring anything to cook with and because of the fire danger

340
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:19,400
and so it was all prepared so that made it a lot easier monastics often live close enough to they have to live

341
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:25,960
because they can't monastics Buddhist monastics can't keep food overnight so every day they have to get new food to

342
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:31,119
eat so uh they usually live close enough to a village where they can go and do

343
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:38,000
alms and receive the food for the day and uh so you know generally the forest

344
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:43,880
monastics forest life is supported so then that allows this

345
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:50,480
different kind of Simplicity but we have to appreciate that it is supported so there's a wide Network that has that

346
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:56,359
supports and allows us to happen and um so like uh so some of these some of the

347
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:02,040
people in the training program uh are IMC teachers and so I see that in

348
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,079
the future we'll probably be offering more we've already offered some but we'll offer more of these nature

349
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:12,280
Retreats and maybe even solo Retreats opportunities in nature and my goal is

350
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:18,280
to at some point be able to offer a month-long retreat in the natural world where people can do solos and be well

351
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:23,960
supported by teachers but it takes a lot of it's It's it'll it take a lot of uh

352
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:30,680
background support and and uh upfront support to make that possible so so it's

353
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:37,200
not as simple as just getting rid of all your stuff and going in the forest yeah yeah not that's not just that simple so

354
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:44,119
uh living a life of Simplicity to uh to organize that can be

355
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,960
complicated so I don't want to just glor glorify Simplicity without appreciating

356
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:56,400
that we have this wider World take care of too and we're and it's very well understood in Buddhism that the forest

357
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:01,440
monastics have to to stay relationship to society because their food their you

358
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:09,079
know depending on it their clothes depend on it their well-being their medicine they get so they they um so I

359
00:39:09,079 --> 00:39:16,880
think it's important not to create this hard divide between the natural world and the urban world but to see them in

360
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:22,520
relationship to each other in a healthy way thank

361
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,839
you over here

362
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:44,680
so I'm a Backpacker also and I have always felt an experience that the

363
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:52,880
process of getting ready for a backpack is as important as the backpacking itself because you really do have this

364
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,359
you know you have a backpack in a limited amount of things so what do you take in that process of deciding the

365
00:39:58,359 --> 00:40:04,240
values of what is more important and what do you leave behind yes is a really

366
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:13,760
it's it's I I don't rush through it I it it's a pro it's a really um just that

367
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:20,000
taking time with that really brings insight and and a new way of looking at

368
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:25,079
your possessions when you take time to figure out what to take and what not and what

369
00:40:25,079 --> 00:40:30,640
to leave behind fantastic I love love that point it's very important and

370
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:39,599
um as a little bit an example of this so I did go backpacking with my wife at the end and um for four days we were

371
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:47,839
backpacking but she was just warming up uh because uh because uh when we finished after 4

372
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:54,160
days we were going to end up on the Columbia River we were hiking in Oregon towards the Columbia River and then the

373
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:59,359
next day she was going with was going to a walk the Pacific CR trail from she's

374
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:05,720
doing it right now from um the Columbia River from the Oregon border to Canada

375
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:11,920
so she's a through what called a through hiker so she showed up and she said Gil

376
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:19,599
we were in the I I picked her up at the airport in Portland and we stopped at a parking lot somewhere industrial parking

377
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:25,119
lot someplace Gail show me what you have in your backpack what you're taking with you

378
00:41:25,119 --> 00:41:30,880
backpacking with me and so I everything goes out not this not this you don't need

379
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:35,920
this you don't need this I thought I did a really good job keeping it really

380
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:44,000
simple but if you're through hiker you have idea is to go super light and um so so I was glad she went

381
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:49,440
through it because it you know lightened up even more but then there was the things I

382
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,960
didn't let go of and um and so then but then you know

383
00:41:55,960 --> 00:42:03,160
why am I carrying this I had uh like for example I brought I brought a Kindle with

384
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:10,280
me because I thought you know we're sitting around nice to read a little bit or something and she didn't she didn't

385
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:16,400
say she didn't force me to get rid of the Kindle she might not have seen

386
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:24,400
it and then you know but I didn't look at the Kindle at all it's like why am I car Kindle's

387
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:30,680
heavy and um and so so then I got so so it's not only what you got didn't bring

388
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:36,520
but it's also contending with what you do bring and

389
00:42:37,359 --> 00:42:43,319
yes another interesting thing is was that I um in that with my wife somehow

390
00:42:43,319 --> 00:42:49,839
because in this this thing in the parking lot moving my things you don't take this that that and um I I had my I

391
00:42:49,839 --> 00:42:55,400
had I use contact lens for my right eye and so I had more contact lenses

392
00:42:55,400 --> 00:43:01,640
than I needed so no just and so in that process of separating that out I didn't

393
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:08,920
bring any contact lenses with me and I didn't know that until we started the trail so that was interesting to be able

394
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:16,760
to to to spend you know the four days with the you know certain degree of blurry vision as well and um and that

395
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:23,640
was just part of the learning part of the contending with difficulties and what's going on and I kind of

396
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:29,119
appreciated that challenge it was kind of nice to be free of

397
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:39,079
that so so I hope that was nice to hear that I think that uh I'm inspired by

398
00:43:39,079 --> 00:43:47,040
this idea of uh having a a lineage or having a part of our inside meditation

399
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:53,359
world have a connection this richer connection to the natural world and we'll be doing that I hope over this

400
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:59,599
next few years because we uh some of you know now we've we're developing a relationship with hidden villa which is

401
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:05,040
a Nature Preserve in Los Altos Hills they would like us to come there and practice there and teach

402
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:10,280
there and that gives us lots of opportunities to do uh uh you know

403
00:44:10,280 --> 00:44:16,240
practicing in in the natural world and nature without having to give up our

404
00:44:17,119 --> 00:44:22,400
Kindle or or such things because go there for the day or

405
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:31,520
for Retreats or something so easy so so um thank you
