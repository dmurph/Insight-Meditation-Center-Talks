1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,000
so

2
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,480
this is the third talk

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,080
on the theme of oneself

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,200
and

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,640
began monday with the topic of

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,640
self-respect

7
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,800
and perhaps self-respect is uh

8
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,680
maybe sometimes easier to come to than

9
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:32,400
self-love or self compassion or

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,719
but to have a deep respect

11
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,079
and

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,000
what we respect

13
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,760
maybe we try to understand it better we

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,160
make ourselves available to know it

15
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,680
better

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,520
and so yesterday was a topic of

17
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,760
self-understanding

18
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,760
to really understand this person that we

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,719
are

20
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,440
what drive us what drives us

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,840
what

22
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:03,600
attitudes beliefs attachments

23
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,199
desires and aversions we have

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,520
and how we understand ourselves so that

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:13,479
we can be free or

26
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,040
and today the topic is

27
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,720
not harming oneself

28
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,400
and

29
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:27,119
i find that uh this idea of non-harming

30
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:27,920
and

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,360
not harming others not harming ourselves

32
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,840
is such a profound topic

33
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,520
that um

34
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,360
it's easy to be to uh eclipse that topic

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,119
with more inspiring topics of

36
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:45,520
the dharma or spirituality

37
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,759
it's inspiring the idea of love and

38
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,079
compassion generosity

39
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,720
it's inspiring wisdom

40
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:56,000
it's inspiring the idea of freedom

41
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,439
and

42
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:00,240
but it's also possible to be focused on

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,880
those and not really understand the

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,799
nature of harm

45
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:06,799
nature way the mind works the heart

46
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:09,280
works that we're harming ourselves and

47
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,800
maybe in

48
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,040
in ways that we

49
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,000
harm others both out of impulsive speech

50
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,720
and action that we never would have

51
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,319
consciously planned to want to do but it

52
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:24,000
just blurts out of us

53
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,319
but also in kind of subconscious ways

54
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:27,360
that uh

55
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,000
we're not really aware that uh how we're

56
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,920
speaking in a way to kind of

57
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,760
poke someone or

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:38,000
or

59
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,640
express our hostility or

60
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,959
or

61
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,480
a little bit mean to someone

62
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,080
and so to um

63
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,360
to value non-harming as a foundation

64
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,720
beca and to appreciate that non-harming

65
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,440
is a profound topic because it applies

66
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,200
to so many areas

67
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,840
to live a life without harm self-harm

68
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,560
and harming others is a phenomenal life

69
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,560
it's a really a good life

70
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,800
and people learn to trust us we can

71
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,560
trust ourselves we can go anywhere we

72
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,360
want without having to feel

73
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,200
self-conscious that we're

74
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,879
causing harm

75
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,120
and it's the foundation for a peaceful

76
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,400
life peaceful world

77
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,840
so um

78
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,840
not harming oneself

79
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:30,720
there is this um

80
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,640
uh

81
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
verse

82
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,799
in the sutras

83
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:40,159
the buddha says

84
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,440
traveling in all directions

85
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,560
with one's thoughts

86
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,159
nowhere

87
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,720
can one find anyone

88
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:51,840
dearer

89
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,480
than oneself

90
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,319
in the same way

91
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,280
to each individual the self is most dear

92
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,599
oneself is most dear

93
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:05,120
therefore whoever loves oneself

94
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,519
must

95
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,920
whatever loves oneself most

96
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,640
doesn't harm others

97
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,479
so sometimes this idea of

98
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:17,840
you know

99
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,759
holding oneself dear

100
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:20,880
valuable

101
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,199
holding oneself as being precious

102
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,160
is

103
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,960
maybe seen as being selfish

104
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,840
but uh there's a way in which it's not

105
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,479
and one way is that the more we have

106
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,120
respect and care and appreciate and

107
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,040
value for ourselves

108
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,160
and the value that they would see the

109
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,560
value of not being harmed by anyone not

110
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,120
be suffering not having no one steal or

111
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,560
lie or

112
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,199
attack us or anything and know

113
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,120
that we can appreciate that's true for

114
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,960
other people as well

115
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,280
allow them to be the most the person

116
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,000
who's most precious to themselves

117
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
and imagine that they also do not want

118
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,639
to be harmed

119
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,800
and this combination of seeing oneself

120
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,880
as being valuable

121
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:13,039
and that translating to not causing harm

122
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:14,720
and caring for others

123
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,400
is one of the wonderful principles of

124
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,680
buddhism

125
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,680
and um

126
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,280
so that's so if you if you um

127
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,039
and uh and then there's a particular

128
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,880
verse in the dhammapada that can be

129
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:31,840
quite challenging to read

130
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,800
or to

131
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,280
deal with

132
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,919
so that begins with something maybe

133
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:39,120
that's uh

134
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,120
not so difficult it says

135
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,680
don't give up your own welfare

136
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,320
don't give up your own welfare

137
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,560
but the next line says

138
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,880
don't give up your own welfare for the

139
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:56,160
sake of others welfare however great

140
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,319
and the idea that uh you wouldn't

141
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:00,240
sacrifice yourself

142
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,919
your welfare for the welfare of your

143
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:04,160
children or your neighbors or people you

144
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,520
know or people who are suffering more

145
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,960
than you

146
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,120
goes against the grain for many people i

147
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,639
know

148
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,560
but i think that as we understand

149
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,560
ourselves deeply

150
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,479
um it isn't that we're trying to be

151
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,440
comfortable it isn't we're not trying to

152
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,840
but that we have access

153
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,600
to an inner sense of peace inner sense

154
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,479
of

155
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,720
non-harming

156
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,000
we don't harm ourselves through anger

157
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,039
contraction attachments um expectations

158
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:38,800
bias all kinds of ways which we harm

159
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,360
ourselves

160
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,160
that's where the real welfare is the

161
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,240
real welfare that profound welfare is

162
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,280
how we keep the heart at peace happy

163
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,240
contented even if we're uncomfortable

164
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,520
so

165
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,919
don't give up that welfare

166
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,080
for someone else's welfare but that

167
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,280
doesn't mean

168
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,560
don't

169
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,319
benefit others don't do things for

170
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,319
others just don't sacrifice what's

171
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,560
greatest and beautiful in yourself for

172
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,759
that

173
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:10,800
keep that and help others

174
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,160
so if a neighbor for example is uh has

175
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,599
an emergency

176
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:17,599
and you haven't eaten

177
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,919
and for your welfare you should eat

178
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,000
otherwise you'll get a headache maybe

179
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,960
but your

180
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,400
your neighbors

181
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:25,919
needs to get to the emergency

182
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,360
immediately

183
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,960
so of course you would i would hope you

184
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,440
would sacrifice your meal and sacrifice

185
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,039
the

186
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,280
the absence of a headache to save the

187
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,960
life of your neighbor

188
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,120
but in doing so you don't have to

189
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,479
sacrifice

190
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,960
your heart you don't have to give away

191
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,800
your peace or your

192
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,240
you don't have to get agitated or

193
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
contracted or something

194
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,639
and that is where self-understanding is

195
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,080
so important to really understand deeply

196
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,879
where the refuge is within where how we

197
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,280
hold ourselves in safety

198
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,879
in our hearts

199
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,039
by not getting caught in our attachments

200
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,240
so to not harm ourselves

201
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,039
requires a lot of self-understanding

202
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:13,039
a lot of

203
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,520
sitting quietly and still or

204
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:18,000
any kind of way to really get underneath

205
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,280
the surface

206
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,720
of how we think

207
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,039
the surface layer of our desires our

208
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,080
wishes our preoccupations concerns

209
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,160
i've had still to this day

210
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,639
i can be in the labyrinth

211
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,440
of

212
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,440
my concerns and thoughts what should we

213
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,240
do what happens here and i have a lot to

214
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,399
do and i have to figure this out

215
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,039
and it's labyrinth that

216
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,399
i call a labyrinth because sometimes

217
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:44,640
there's no way to get out of it

218
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,839
on its own term terms

219
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:50,959
but if i sit and meditate

220
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,240
then um

221
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,120
i'll drop down into a deeper place of

222
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,800
knowing a deeper understanding a deeper

223
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,800
way of thinking that's not in a

224
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,800
labyrinth of superficial thoughts or

225
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,480
surface thoughts that

226
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,120
preoccupations were kind of lost in them

227
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,519
and then from that deeper place

228
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,240
then there's no labyrinth then oh now i

229
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:11,760
understand

230
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,080
myself and what needs to happen and what

231
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,160
the priority should be

232
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
so this ability to

233
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,040
know oneself by dropping below

234
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,440
the surface chatter of the mind

235
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,000
and really feel deeply what's happening

236
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,720
in the heart and the body

237
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,920
in the mind

238
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,720
and eventually discovering

239
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,279
understanding the little movements or

240
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,240
the big movements that we have within of

241
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,080
harming ourselves

242
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,120
of being mean to ourselves or being

243
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,920
judgmental or being in conflict with

244
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,120
ourselves

245
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,839
or

246
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,240
um getting caught in desires which uh

247
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,399
and maybe even pursuing them desires

248
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:56,880
which will come back and harm us uh if

249
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,160
we pursue them

250
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,160
you know some desires some addictive

251
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,920
desires for example

252
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,839
sometimes

253
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:05,200
uh the addiction

254
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,640
might it might bring pleasure in the

255
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,040
short term but can ruin a life in the

256
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,399
long term

257
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,560
certain desires we pursue

258
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,320
and in the short term they're pleasant

259
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,760
but in the long term

260
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,680
they cause problems

261
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,959
if we um you know if we overeat it's

262
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:22,959
pleasant but then we have you know we're

263
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:24,959
groggy afterwards perhaps

264
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,040
or if we have an affair because it's

265
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,399
pleasant to do

266
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,320
then afterwards we realize how much harm

267
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,440
that has caused to other people

268
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,519
so this idea of

269
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:36,560
you know

270
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,480
understanding deeply

271
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,800
how we get caught in desires how we get

272
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,200
caught in cravings and judgments and all

273
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,079
this

274
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,720
and learning how to give ourselves a

275
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,560
phenomenal break

276
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,120
learning that we there's no need

277
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,560
to be

278
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,880
caught in the grip of desires no need to

279
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:57,040
be caught in the grip of hostility

280
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,320
towards ourselves there is a this place

281
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,920
of respect

282
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,440
deeply within

283
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,120
where it's okay

284
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,800
to relax

285
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
it's okay to just be

286
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,959
it's okay to be here just breathing

287
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,680
below the surface level the flow that

288
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,959
chatter and

289
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,079
and um

290
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,839
below the

291
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,079
desire and hostility level

292
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,600
those are just a level that's just a

293
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,519
labyrinth we get caught in

294
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:26,079
but to sit quietly learn to let go and

295
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,480
quiet the mind and the thoughts and drop

296
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,040
down to this place that's deeper

297
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:34,000
and the deeper calm we can experience

298
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,160
the more we'll understand ourselves and

299
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,480
understand when the little impulses

300
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,600
arise

301
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,560
even the slightest one that involves

302
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,680
self-harm has an ouch in it

303
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,440
and then we learn i don't have to do

304
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,240
that

305
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,800
i can let go of that

306
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,399
so

307
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,519
practicing non-self-harm

308
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,920
partly because we cherish ourselves we

309
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:00,560
value ourselves and partly because it's

310
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,839
just so painful to harm ourselves

311
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,680
and then knowing

312
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,000
that discovering the wellsprings of

313
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,880
non-harming within

314
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,560
is a

315
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,920
foundation

316
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:16,240
for caring for the world caring for

317
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,480
others we come into the world we meet

318
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,959
others in a very different way

319
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,200
if we have learned the art

320
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,320
learn the skill and the capacity

321
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
to

322
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,000
minimize and eventually hopefully stop

323
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,519
how we bring about self-harm

324
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,880
then we and don't sacrifice that

325
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,800
absence of self-harm don't sacrifice

326
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,079
that peace

327
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:43,680
but

328
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,279
it's a foundation

329
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:47,040
from which to meet others care for

330
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,040
others and care for the world

331
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,959
and that can be done tirelessly that can

332
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,040
be done with tremendous dedication

333
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,959
so this uh this quote

334
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,600
don't give up your own welfare for the

335
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,959
sake of others welfare however great

336
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,800
yes don't do that

337
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,040
but if you don't do that maybe you'll

338
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,959
have a lot more energy

339
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:11,839
to

340
00:13:11,839 --> 00:13:12,959
care for

341
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,440
the people in your lives known unknown

342
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,639
and throughout the whole world

343
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,880
so

344
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,600
not harming oneself

345
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,839
thank you
