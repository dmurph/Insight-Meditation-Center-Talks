1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:10,920
so hello my friends and welcome and welcome to this

2
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:20,680
meditation and one of the ways of beginning meditation is to think that what we're

3
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:29,519
doing is gathering ourselves together there's ways in which

4
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:37,440
we become fragmented or spinning out or disconnected from parts of ourselves

5
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,840
because we overemphasize other parts and to begin sit down in order to

6
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:50,800
gather ourselves and so a

7
00:00:51,840 --> 00:01:01,480
posture and sometimes if in in ordinary life if someone who knows nothing about meditation and they're really

8
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:07,799
anxious spinning out and some friend comes along and in a

9
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:16,159
very kind way says friend gather yourself together we have to we have to do

10
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:22,520
something we have to go help the children

11
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,880
uh you know get out of the burning house gather yourself together and so

12
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,439
the person then stands a little bit straighter and taller with feet kind of both firmly on

13
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,560
the ground and maybe takes a deep breath and and takes a posture and a breath

14
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:48,399
that is to kind of gather together bring everything back in so that they can take care of the

15
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:56,000
important thing that needs to be done so we're here to gather ourselves

16
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,640
together and perhaps starting with your posture

17
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:10,319
a posture that includes as much of your parts of your body as

18
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:20,040
possible so you're caring for the whole body in whatever posture you're in

19
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:26,160
standing sitting lying down you are

20
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,360
consciously adjusting placing considering the different parts of your body so that

21
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:39,080
they begin to be aligned or they begin to can begin to in a sense

22
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,720
work together come

23
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:58,599
together and [Music] to take some deeper breaths so on the

24
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:02,760
exhale you're gather gaing yourself

25
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:13,360
together not racing off in thoughts and

26
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,120
desires not resisting

27
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:31,760
anything not holding on to anything or clinging to

28
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:38,120
anything so that you become disconnected from the

29
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:44,400
hole and you don't have to necessarily stop thinking or stop feeling or

30
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:52,280
whatever you're feeling whatever your emotions are but to relate to it

31
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:01,439
all so that it's all begins to become together as part of the whole

32
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,200
nothing is selected out so we become

33
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:13,079
fragmented separated from the rest

34
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:20,479
awareness starts Gathering ourselves together into a hole

35
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,840
with the eyes closed letting the breath return to

36
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:46,320
normal and with your attention with a relaxed easygoing way

37
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:54,080
do a grand tour of your body with the idea of bringing

38
00:04:54,080 --> 00:05:02,400
in all different parts of your body into the hole gather Gathering it

39
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:10,000
together kind of like you have

40
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,440
a a messy room you start walking going around the

41
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,199
room and placing things in their place placing them in Harmony and so the room

42
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:32,800
begins to feel like it's orderly or clean

43
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:40,600
or that the whole becomes has a nice feeling so a tour of your

44
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:48,919
body bringing it all together placing it together

45
00:06:12,759 --> 00:06:19,960
seeing that with awareness with attention to your

46
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:27,039
body you can feel or sense a subtle

47
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,840
movement to bringing the body part of the body into

48
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:43,720
harmony into relationship to each other contributing to a

49
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:47,840
whole here and

50
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:02,039
now and then whatever you're feeling whatever ever emotions you

51
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:10,560
have do a tour of those recognize what's here maybe feel the emotions in your

52
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:16,800
body feel where parts of the body they're activated or energized or have

53
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:26,400
Sensations connected to how you're feeling and gather that into the

54
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,479
hole so you're not over overemphasizing your emotions you're not

55
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:39,160
underemphasizing it but rather you're welcoming it into the

56
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,280
hole

57
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:49,919
here also in

58
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:56,240
harmony with with the whole

59
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:20,840
and then to also a grand tour of the mind and

60
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:24,879
thinking and wanting and not

61
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:35,959
wanting not to resist anything not to hold on to anything but simply to know and

62
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:43,159
recognize and gather your mind into the

63
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:48,920
hole so that too is not over

64
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:57,000
prioritized but becomes part of the whole here together with the body

65
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:30,680
and then to do a tour of how you're aware

66
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:39,720
are you aware with a lot of effort and strain or you

67
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:47,480
aware casually and

68
00:09:52,959 --> 00:10:01,800
unenthusiastically are you aware by feeling and sensing what's

69
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:09,199
here are you aware by knowing and recognizing what is

70
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,200
here are you aware with the kind of Mind's Eye as if you're

71
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,399
almost observing gazing upon what's

72
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:27,279
here and whatever way you're aware of the present

73
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:34,279
moment can that be clear and

74
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,230
relaxed [Music]

75
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:49,560
calm and gently engaged as part of the

76
00:10:52,880 --> 00:11:01,279
whole not overemphasizing awareness or under emphasizing

77
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:07,839
it but having your way you're aware be in harmony with the

78
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:20,920
whole with being in

79
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:29,600
harmony with welcoming a deeper connection

80
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,600
to your lived experience

81
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,519
now with breathing at the

82
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,240
center for

83
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:39,199
gently but clearly gently but

84
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:46,800
committedly hanging out with the breathing the rhythm of breathing in and breathing

85
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,240
out while at the same time being aware of

86
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,720
whatever broad sense there is of the body

87
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:05,639
the peripheral

88
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:15,720
awareness of the body of the presence of attention maybe being

89
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,720
cozy

90
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:34,560
here as if the broad awareness with all things gathered

91
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:41,279
together is like being lovingly wrapped in a blanket soft

92
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,079
warm comfortable

93
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:10,759
so that how you're

94
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:22,360
aware has a contentment to it content to just be here and the lived

95
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,759
experience of the body

96
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:43,920
awareness that's supported by what is Pleasant

97
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
cozy

98
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
for

99
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,959
for e

100
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:56,519
letting go of desires so that there's more room in

101
00:16:56,519 --> 00:17:05,959
awareness to calmly be aware of the present moment

102
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,759
calming the thinking

103
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:38,360
mind so you can be more

104
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,799
sensitive to the onward leading

105
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:53,840
movement of

106
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,720
some of being connected here

107
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,080
here gathered to together

108
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
here

109
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
for

110
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640

for for

117
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:15,600
what would you adjust what would you change

118
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:25,720
or allow if meditation is to is to sit in

119
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:31,120
harmony with all of who we

120
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:40,960
are to hold it all together in some wider field

121
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:47,520
of Harmony

122
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:50,640
care

123
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:59,240
love no part left out no part pushed away

124
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:07,360
no part held on to all of who we are is set

125
00:25:09,559 --> 00:25:14,760
free to be part of the

126
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
whole

127
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
for

128
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

129
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:01,240
e for

130
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:36,480
and then as we come to the end of this

131
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:48,919
sitting evoking your imagination to imagine yourself doing

132
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:56,360
what you're doing right now have an image in your mind or have thoughts in your

133
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:03,120
mind of yourself sitting in

134
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:09,720
meditation imagine yourself in harmony with

135
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:19,440
yourself and somehow in harmony or at peace with the immediate space around

136
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:30,360
you and imagine yourself in harmony and in

137
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:35,720
peace with the neighborhood around

138
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,679
you and imagine that your sense of peace and

139
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:52,720
Harmony not resisting anything not holding on to anything is the most important medicine

140
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:58,480
for this world and that you imagine that here

141
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:04,760
sitting meditating you're spreading that field of Harmony of

142
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:14,880
Peace of the way that you hold and relate and are present for this whole

143
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:22,080
world as if this whole world can

144
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,518
settle in the field of your peace

145
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:42,399
and of course this is just an imagination but with that imagination

146
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:51,440
now let your good will have thoughts of Good Will and care and

147
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:58,919
love for all the lack of Harmony there is in this world all the struggle and all the

148
00:29:58,919 --> 00:30:06,279
suffering that exists and imagine that your good will

149
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:14,840
can travel out through that field of peace to touch

150
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:20,000
everyone may all beings be

151
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:26,039
happy may all beings be

152
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,039
safe may all beings be

153
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:36,919
peaceful may all beings be

154
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:47,080
free and may it be that when each of you goes out into the world and meets other

155
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:55,360
people that this Good Will is remembered this idea of being in harmony

156
00:30:55,360 --> 00:31:02,000
with the people around you is remembered

157
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:09,880
and may you contribute to the Peace of those immediately around you that you

158
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:16,799
encounter today may all beings be happy

159
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:28,760

170
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:14,679
in meditation is included that uh whatever we can be aware of here and now

171
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:20,039
as we're settling into the present moment um feels like it's all gathers

172
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:25,480
together into one large hole one large

173
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:34,240
um um uh harmonious whole and so to to find a way to to live

174
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:41,080
in this harmony so in the ancient world samade is sometimes associated with

175
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:47,480
Harmony or a evenness where all things are held

176
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:54,240
together in a kind of even uh way harmonious

177
00:33:54,240 --> 00:34:01,600
way sometimes there's a word the word that's used is beauty that there starts to be a kind of beauty

178
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:07,200
and we begin to live in kind of a beauty we meditate in Beauty and I love this

179
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:14,480
expression Beauty because of um it's not something we can appropriate for ourselves we can't kind of claim it to

180
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:19,760
be our ourselves or who we are but it's kind of like the atmosphere or the

181
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:25,800
context in which we're operating we're operating context of beauty uh walk in

182
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:31,839
Beauty talk in Beauty medita in Beauty so the world that we live in

183
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:37,839
begins to change when we are uh in

184
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:45,520
um in um when we're when we start entering into deeper

185
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,200
samade and um so

186
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:57,320
um uh it's not easy to do most of the time when people meditate they're not in

187
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:03,440
some Mi it's still amazingly beneficial to practice mindfulness meditation well

188
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,359
short of entering into a state of being that's known as samadi or recognized as

189
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:15,160
samadi or we can say that samadi is many different types and for people who do

190
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:21,240
practice uh practice mindfulness there is a kind of samade that has to do with

191
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:26,839
how we enter into any single thing we do if you're washing dishes there's a Som

192
00:35:26,839 --> 00:35:33,839
of washing dishes is where you're really there in harmony with that activity you're not trying to do it quickly to

193
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:40,560
get on to other things you're not doing it while doing a second or third thing at the same time you're just there in

194
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:49,640
that and so this idea of just being present for this activity fully in harmony or attuned to this activity is

195
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:58,280
sometimes called samade in daily life and the more we do that it supports doing that then in meditation as well

196
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:04,040
so this uh Sade the approach Sade uh I'd like to

197
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:10,079
use an analogy uh say that you've never ridden

198
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,720
a bicycle before and that you want to uh try ride you know and so you never plan

199
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:25,400
to ride a bicycle it's the last thing you want to do and um and so you um you

200
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:31,280
are um um but then there's a friend of yours

201
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:36,440
who um maybe many miles away is uh is

202
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:44,640
really in need of some medicine it's really important the person has the medicine and so then uh

203
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:50,520
you um but you can't get there fast enough you don't have a car you don't have any

204
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:57,599
public meanss of Transportation but there's a bicycle and uh but you never ridden in

205
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:03,000
bicycle before and um but someone says well if you ride the bicycle you can get

206
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,040
the medicine there in time but if you have to walk you won't be there in time but I've never ridden a bicycle well

207
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:16,400
it's up to you so you said okay well I might as well try so you begin getting

208
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:24,000
on the bicycle and it's really difficult the first few times you try to get on you fall off you pedal a little bit and

209
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:30,720
you kind of fall to the side you get back on it's so important to keep keep trying because of your friend and so you

210
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:37,359
keep trying you keep moving on and uh slowly you can pedal more than

211
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:44,240
a few pedals uh on the without falling off and then finally you seem to be able

212
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:50,720
to pedal and stay on but it's very wobbly and shaky and difficult and and uh you feel like you're ready to give up

213
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:57,079
because why bother when it's so difficult and um maybe have one big spill and then you're really ready to

214
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:04,640
stop but you remember your friend and so you get back on again no matter what even with scraped knees or whatever you

215
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:11,280
have and then you keep pedaling and after a while you get the hang of it after a while you can pedal and it's a

216
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:18,520
long flat stretch and you're pedaling along and after a while you feel like you're in the groove and um you feel

217
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:26,079
tired so you stop pedaling but then the bike stops and it's a little hard to start again because you still wobbly but

218
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:32,440
it's wobbly maybe you fall again and finally get going again and then you realize I just have to keep pedaling

219
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:37,880
because when I have some momentum it seems like it's easier and so you keep doing it and

220
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:43,560
doing it and then the way the terrain is set up to where your friend is you know

221
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:49,760
you're going to get there in plenty of time because with the bicycle but you as the terrain goes it slowly begins to

222
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,400
slant down the road a slow grade and at first it's so slight you don't even

223
00:38:55,400 --> 00:39:00,839
notice then you notice well it's a little bit easier to pedal and then then you feel it's

224
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:07,319
getting easier to pedal and easier at some point you feel the momentum the pull of gravity and you realize you

225
00:39:07,319 --> 00:39:12,720
don't have to pedal anymore you're being carried you're being pulled you can just

226
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:19,520
Glide down um it's uh you're now in this place where you're approaching your friend's

227
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,240
home that's down that hill and it's not a real steep hill but all you have to do

228
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:31,440
is to stay on the bicycle and feel that momentum stay with the momentum of

229
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:37,319
gravity that pulls you and you get pulled all the way down to your friend's house with the medicine and and then

230
00:39:37,319 --> 00:39:44,560
your medicine is Happy Ever After your your friend is Happy Ever After so someity practicing meditation

231
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:51,960
can be like that the beginning can can be wobbly and difficult and we fall off and we get discouraged and and the point

232
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:59,760
is to always just get back on again and back on again and and the regularity and familiar it with this something starts

233
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:05,359
developing and we gets easier and easier and at some point as we keep practicing

234
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:12,240
and keep pedaling uh there's almost like there's begins to be that uh slope that

235
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:18,560
um begins now we're beginning you know this there's a directionality there's an onward lead leading just like on the

236
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:23,680
bicycle if it it's on a grade going downhill if you're keeping your balance

237
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:29,599
in the bike it's onward leading now to some place and so you some point you can

238
00:40:29,599 --> 00:40:35,079
you're really all there it's all smooth all in bicy is All In Harmony biking is

239
00:40:35,079 --> 00:40:41,359
in harmony everything is Flowing with your you have the balance and now you're in that you're in

240
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,760
this approach stage and at some point you have to learn to just let go of the

241
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:54,240
pedaling and um and uh and then uh go allow the momentum the onward leading

242
00:40:54,240 --> 00:41:02,000
nature to kind of pull you along and um and that's a takes a lot of uh

243
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,200
Harmony it means to be in harmony with all things it means not to be resisting

244
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:13,440
not to be wanting not to be ahead of yourself or behind yourself but to be

245
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:20,160
centered here in yourself and um so to be in to bring

246
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:25,960
everything into harmony so um so we're here now at this

247
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:32,760
approach stage of somebody and um and this seems like a good place uh to

248
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:40,640
pause uh because um the um I'm going to

249
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:48,359
um uh I'm going off to IRC for a couple of weeks to our Retreat Center so uh

250
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:53,880
we'll have wonderful guest teachers who come to teach while I'm away and um and

251
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:01,520
in and in the meantime um and then I'll come back and uh we'll continue the somati uh Series

252
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:09,480
in March and how would I think I think on March 10th I come back and on on that

253
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:17,760
day uh we will um uh we'll do one more week on this kind of approach stage to

254
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:22,839
samade um kind of to warm up again get back into the groove of it and because

255
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:28,559
uh it's a kind of very refined State and uh becoming more familiar with some of

256
00:42:28,559 --> 00:42:34,640
the challenges that can happen in this in this approach state will help you kind of maybe understand better what

257
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:40,240
it's all about and um and maybe easier to kind of maybe

258
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:49,800
follow along when we go to the next uh step with it all and um so

259
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:55,599
um um so may Elliot will be here next week

260

263
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:21,520
relisten to some of the previous um talks or guided meditations of this series um maybe even going back

264
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:27,480
to the beginning to kind of uh kind of stay in the flow and and so some of the
