00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,960
Hello everyone and welcome to our

2
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:24,960
meditation beginning of the week and continuing in this series for this

3
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:31,360
year on samadei and insight and for this medit. meditation. I want

4
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:37,680
to evoke a a image from my son's

5
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:44,800
first second grade, no kindergarten class. It was that um every day when uh

6
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,920
he came to class, we would bring him to school and bring him to the door of the

7
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:55,120
classroom and the teacher would be standing there

8
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:02,480
in front of the door, the open door and uh standing there in a

9
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:10,399
I would say a kind of a dignified way, a kind of a kind way, clear way.

10
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:20,640
a way that felt like the teacher was fully there for what was coming and ready to receive and but also not uh but

11
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:29,440
also very competent, very calm and clear and and uh organized and ready for

12
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:36,640
anything. And the teacher would stand there in front of the door, right next to the front of the door. And every

13
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:41,680
kindergarten kid who came in, the teacher would greet very nicely. I

14
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,959
forget if they teacher shook their hand or or what how exactly the greeting

15
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:53,200
went, but every every kid would be every day would be greeted with this very

16
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:00,160
clear wave from the teacher. And so samadei

17
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:05,600
is what allows us to be stable, strong, clear,

18
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:11,600
organized in a certain way, settled on ourselves, so that whatever experience

19
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:17,519
comes our way, we can greet in the same way. Whatever comes our way, we can see

20
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:23,600
it clearly. We're not pushed around by it. We're not caught in it.

21
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:31,040
We're not uh defined by it, but we're just there with it because with this

22
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:36,959
feeling of rootedness, this feeling of being complete, whole

23
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:44,399
here, so that each thing that comes our way can be seen, greeted, respected for what

24
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:51,440
it is. And there's room in the classroom for it. It's just one seat in the class.

25
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:56,560
It's not the whole world just this thing here now.

26
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:02,399
So this applies to suffering. The per one of the purposes of of

27
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:09,600
samadei is so that we are not defined by our suffering. One of the purposes of

28
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:16,000
insight of mindfulness is so we can know something and not be defined by it, not

29
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:21,440
be pushed around by it. But we're there to

30
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,200
know our suffering to greet it with respect with clarity

31
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:35,360
with rudess not being defined by it but ready to be respectful for each act of suffering.

32
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:42,320
So suffering doesn't become the whole world. Suffering doesn't become something to reject or to be frightened

33
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:49,279
by, but something that we can see clearly,

34
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:57,040
so clearly that we see that it's just a piece of the bigger picture of life. It can be

35
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:03,519
big and monumental, but it's still just one piece. There's more. And samadei

36
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:09,920
provides the more, the stability, the wholeness, the calm.

37
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:16,399
And insight provides the more the knowing that is not

38
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:23,600
making it into everything. And there is what's known

39
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,800
and the knowing of it. And as soon as they see the difference between what see

40
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,839
the difference between what's known and what's known and the knowing of it, we

41
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:39,440
start to become free and respectful. We become that teacher in the classroom

42
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:45,040
door that's ready to s greet everything respectfully.

43
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:52,480
And so suffering is known. Suffering happens within a wholeness of

44
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:59,800
experience. We're rooted here to know it.

45
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,680
And we start seeing that suffering like everything else

46
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:12,440
is part of the river of change. Imagine.

47
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:17,959
So assuming a meditation posture,

48
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:26,200
a posture for being rooted,

49
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:32,079
stable on whatever surface hold your the weight

50
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:38,560
of your body up. a chair, the floor,

51
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:45,480
a bed, whatever it might be.

52
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:53,040
And to feel how the weight of your body settles

53
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:59,920
on the surface that holds it up. The surface in which your weight

54
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,199
meets the pole of gravity.

55
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:15,680
And as you exhale, allow yourselves to settle in

56
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:22,560
to the meeting of your weight

57
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:27,720
and the pull of gravity against that surface.

58
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,480
Maybe making small adjustments

59
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,440
so it's more comfortable, more rooted here.

60
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:56,360
and then arising from

61
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:06,760
that stable rooted contact. Feel the rest of your body.

62
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:16,279
How the weight of your body moves through

63
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,639
your torso.

64
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,120
And if you feel any weight

65
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:36,360
that exists there because of the pull of gravity

66
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:42,639
as you exhale, relax

67
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:49,639
into that pull. Let your weight settle.

68
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:11,040
Almost without trying or doing anything,

69
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:18,560
allow your inhale to be fuller

70
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,639
to expand more fully through your torso, your rib cage.

71
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:37,120
Not so much making yourself breathe deeper,

72
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,000
but yielding to the inb breath

73
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:51,800
and then yielding to the exhale.

74
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,240
So the exhale is more extended.

75
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,520
And as you exhale,

76
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:20,199
relaxing your whole body, a kind of yielding

77
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:30,039
to the pull of gravity. Yielding to the

78
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:35,320
desire for tension to unwind.

79
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:51,080
and then letting your breathing return to normal.

80
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,799
And now with the inhale, feel any tension, pressure,

81
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:12,519
forcefulness that might be in the thinking mind

82
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:23,000
as you exhale. soften the thinking mind.

83
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:39,240
Ever so gently quiet the thinking voice

84
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:47,080
or slow down the images of thoughts.

85
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:03,720
Rather than living in thoughts, let thinking

86
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:09,679
exist within a wider field of calm

87
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:12,679
spaciousness.

88
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,600
Then settling into

89
00:19:35,679 --> 00:19:40,679
the body's experience of breathing.

90
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:09,280
without making a lot of effort or any effort at all.

91
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:18,120
See if you can recognize there is the experience of breathing

92
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,640
and there's the knowing of it.

93
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:36,520
The knowing of it could be verbal, it can be nonverbal.

94
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:44,880
Very simple. uncomplicated knowing

95
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:51,799
of the that you're breathing in, breathing out.

96
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:10,559
And knowing that's part of being rooted,

97
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:18,919
stable here in this body here and now.

98
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:48,400
And if as you're sitting here there's anything that might be called

99
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:53,480
suffering, stress,

100
00:21:53,600 --> 00:22:00,520
emotional discomfort. Feel

101
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:12,320
the experience from a rooted,

102
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:19,158
respectful place. Know it

103
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:27,799
where the knowing is clear, free of what is known.

104
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:35,520
Like a teacher knowing each student coming to the door.

105
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:41,640
The teacher rooted, clear, fully here,

106
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,159
knowing the student clearly, respectfully,

107
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,799
but not losing

108
00:22:54,799 --> 00:23:02,400
the calm, steady clarity that the teacher wants to convey to the

109
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,400
students.

110
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:16,400
See if you can avoid being defined by your suffering.

111
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:25,000
Let it be part of the larger experience of now.

112
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:30,600
One more thing to know, to greet,

113
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:35,640
and to be ready for the next experience,

114
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:39,960
to be with that.

115
00:27:54,559 --> 00:28:00,679
Watching the smallest movements of the mind

116
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:08,720
to be sensitive to how there might be stress,

117
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:16,760
destress. in the mind.

118
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:27,960
And rather than ignoring it because it's subtle or big,

119
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:38,960
think of yourself standing at the door of the classroom.

120
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:48,120
greeting it while being calm, rooted, clear

121
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:57,520
where suffering and stress is simply one more thing to greet.

122
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,960
Nothing more, nothing less,

123
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:08,600
nothing to get involved in.

124
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:13,880
And as we come to the end of this sitting

125
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:23,040
to feel whatever degree of stability,

126
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:30,400
calm, centeredness might be here in the

127
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:35,960
present moment with your body

128
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:45,440
and imagine meeting the people of the day

129
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:51,320
going through the experiences of the next 24 hours

130
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:59,440
greeting each thing. It's one more thing to greet

131
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:06,280
from a place of stability and clarity, openness

132
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,880
to know each thing without being defined by it,

133
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:22,759
pushed around by it, caught in it. just to stand and

134
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,920
be present.

135
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:32,920
And just maybe that will allow

136
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:41,079
good will to be part of your attitude.

137
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:47,160
A field of goodwill, an attitude of goodwill

138
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:55,240
towards yourself, towards others,

139
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:04,640
towards the whole world. May all beings be happy.

140
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:11,280
May all beings be safe.

141
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:16,920
May all beings be peaceful.

142
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:21,720
May all beings be free.

143
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:29,079
And may my samadei and insight

144
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,599
support me to offer this gift to all beings.

145
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:52,400
[Music]

146
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,640
Thank you.

147
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:10,880
So, welcome to beginning of the week as we continue this series on insight

148
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,839
And the three insights that are core to the insight meditation practice

149
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:23,359
is having this deep observation, this deep

150
00:40:23,359 --> 00:40:28,560
clarity, deep recognition of

151
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:37,400
change, of stress and of nonidentification.

152
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:45,440
And um and I choose those words carefully as an alternative to some of the usual ways of

153
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:50,640
saying talking about these three characteristics, three insights,

154
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,680
recognitions that we have. And um

155
00:40:55,680 --> 00:41:03,839
and the focus currently is the second one duka

156
00:41:03,839 --> 00:41:11,520
the rec deep recognition the capacity to recognize to perceive to know

157
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:18,480
suffering stress distress in such a way that uh we find our

158
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:24,079
freedom in it. we find ways in which we can grow spiritually and develop

159
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:29,839
ourselves. Uh rather than being overwhelmed by suffering, finding a way,

160
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:37,839
a natural way in which the heart, the mind, the inner life can grow and develop into

161
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:45,200
greater clarity, greater calm, greater care, love, a greater kind of sense of

162
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:52,319
wholeness. uh by how we recognize how we're present

163
00:41:52,319 --> 00:41:58,480
for the suffering of our life and um and this of course is not easy

164
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:06,560
and this is why now we're on this you know we've done six months already now on samade and insight to prepare prepare

165
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:14,400
the ground for a deep useful way of engaging with suffering

166
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,680
and it comes and that's long preparation is a way of having a deep respect of

167
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:27,359
suffering, the challenges of it, the difficulty of being with it, but also the opportunities, the the the richness

168
00:42:27,359 --> 00:42:34,160
that's possible by bringing this practice into the middle of it.

169
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:39,359
And um in uh there is a teaching that

170
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:44,400
goes back to the earliest time of Buddhism that says there are three types

171
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:51,359
of duka. The word now in the poly the ancient language the word is duka d u k k k k k

172
00:42:51,359 --> 00:43:00,000
k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k k h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h h and um and it's usually translated as suffering, but in its core it means pain

173
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:06,480
just or or strong discom discomfort or pain that can be physical and but it

174
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:13,280
could also be emotional and um it could also be uh quite deeply

175
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:20,960
embodied or rooted in us to become kind of the core operating principle from which uh not operating princip but the

176
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:29,040
core fuel for how we operate. We're reacting and adjusting and and uh and uh

177
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:36,240
and to our deep suffering in how we see the world, how we see ourselves, how we engage in the world.

178
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,599
So the tradition talks about three types of duka and sometimes it's helpful to

179
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:49,440
distinguish these three different types and uh and in a sense there's many many

180
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:54,480
characteristics of our suffering. There's many kinds of suffering, many

181
00:43:54,480 --> 00:44:00,079
ways of understanding it and recognizing it. And different teachers

182
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:07,920
uh will emphasize different parts. Buddhists have been addressing this issue of duka of suffering for 2500

183
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,040
years. So you can imagine that over time things have shifted and there's been

184
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:19,520
different interpretations, different recognitions, different ways of working with it, different emphasis that goes

185
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:25,200
on. And so if you go through uh to the history of Buddhist teachings and even

186
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,240
in modern world listen to different teachers teachers in different terraan

187
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:36,079
traditions teachers in Burma teachers in Thailand um teachers in America uh

188
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:42,240
they'll they'll you'll find different teachers emphasizing different aspects of duka

189
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,359
and um so it isn't that they're contradicting themselves each other but

190
00:44:47,359 --> 00:44:55,920
it's that there are just you know so many different ways ways of looking at it and the task is to find out how it's

191
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:01,520
useful for you to see it so that uh you find yourself not caught in it, not

192
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:09,040
entangled with it, not being undermined or deflated or overwhelmed by it. So

193
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:18,160
there are these three kinds of duka and uh the or three kinds of pain. There

194
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:26,800
is pain pain duka duka it's literally called there is the the duca of change

195
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:34,800
and there is the duca of mental constructs. So the first one is just straight

196
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:40,240
straightforward uh uncomplicated physical pain that can

197
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:45,760
be o mild and it can be overwhelming but

198
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:52,720
it's it's not there because of our psychology. It's not there because psychological reactions clinging. It's

199
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,160
not there because we're caught in attachments. It's there because uh it's

200
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:04,880
just straightforward physical pain. And um and for that we need to have a

201
00:46:04,880 --> 00:46:10,480
wisdom. We have to have wisdom to know how to manage it. And uh we have a lot

202
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:16,240
more ways of managing physical pain in the modern world than they had in the ancient world

203
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:23,760
where the Buddha he used the power of his mind in order to deal with his intense pain as an old man. And uh he

204
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:29,200
would go into deep states of concentration. And he said sometimes that's the only time he got relief from

205
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:34,720
his uh old age pain that he had in the last years of his life. But you know to

206
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:42,800
be wise about it and one way to be wise is not to feel that we have to always endure it or that we should always find

207
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:48,400
uh use our practice to find our freedom from it or relief from it. Sometimes we

208
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,760
need medication. Sometimes we need medical care. something all kinds of

209
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,839
things that uh are useful. Uh but not to see it as a a personal

210
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:06,160
fault, not to see uh duka duka as as something that uh we

211
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:13,440
need to somehow criticize oursel for having, but it's something that we need to be wise about how to live with and

212
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:20,560
handle and find our way with. The second is um this uh the suffering

213
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:29,440
of change. And uh and here the assumption is that uh change isn't always welcome and um

214
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:36,160
and or that we want change in a way that's not happening. Uh change is

215
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:41,680
happening different than how we want it. And so uh and even if it change happens

216
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,880
in the way direction we want either way there can be attachment. There's

217
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,480
clinging and there's the suffering of clinging to something and then having it

218
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:58,240
change and go away and then that clinging then feels frustrated, feels

219
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:04,960
feels distraught and so there's a kind of suffering. So the suffering of uh

220
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:10,880
change also requires wisdom. But to some degree it requires the wisdom of

221
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:17,760
acceptance. That uh to some degree human life in order to find some way to live at peace,

222
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:24,079
at calm and steady. To be wise, we have to accept the fact that things change.

223
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:30,000
We get old. We get sick. We'll die. Other people get old, they get sick,

224
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:37,280
they die. Um the things of our life shift and change in ways that um uh we

225
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:43,920
don't want but still they change. Uh there can be natural disasters that

226
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,280
happen in your town, in your neighborhood, and that's a change. And

227
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:57,280
um and so to be able to somehow navigate the change uh with ease, with calm,

228
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:03,040
without the attachments being a wind drag, without being protesting against

229
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:09,440
the very nature of change, which is inherent in this natural world that we're part of. It's all things are

230
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:14,640
always changing. And of course we can have some role in changing things in the

231
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:23,200
right direction. Of course we can have some role in keeping certain things the way they are for a while. Uh we can uh

232
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:29,200
let our cars last longer by changing the oil or being careful how we drive or

233
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:36,319
something. But we want to be caring and careful but not be attached. And so the

234
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:42,480
the suffering of change um is when we somehow don't haven't accepted change as

235
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:49,839
a given and find a wise way to navigate with it. So deep acceptance,

236
00:49:49,839 --> 00:49:55,920
no protests against the natural movements of change. And the third, the

237
00:49:55,920 --> 00:50:02,079
one that's really core to Buddhism is the suffering of the mental formations.

238
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:09,599
This is the suffering of craving itself, the suffering of attachment, the suffering of the way that the the mind

239
00:50:09,599 --> 00:50:15,040
engages in things where there is suffering, tightness, stress, uh

240
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:23,359
clinging, um resistance, pressure, um irritation, annoyance built into the

241
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:29,200
various ways in which we engage, relate to what's happening in this world. And

242
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,480
here is what the practice has the most power to work with. Here we're learning

243
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:41,680
not to accept things, but we're learning to or finding a way to have a deep

244
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:47,280
letting go, a deep relaxing of this added addition on top of our life that

245
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:54,079
we we contribute which is we contribute clinging. We contribute uh grasping,

246
00:50:54,079 --> 00:51:03,440
craving, resistance, animosity, hatred, greed, jealousy, envy, covetousness,

247
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,280
um all kinds of things that we add that all of them that are characterized by

248
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:16,079
tension, stress, a tightening, a pressure that uh feels very

249
00:51:16,079 --> 00:51:22,800
uncomfortable. And so this the the suffering of mental formations is a suffering which is

250
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:28,400
inherent in the movement of attachment in in all its different flavors and

251
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:35,839
forms. And um and turns out that this is the attachment that is most deep inside of

252
00:51:35,839 --> 00:51:42,319
us. That maybe is for some people is is right there the core operating principle

253
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:48,319
from which they live and understand themselves and um define themselves.

254
00:51:48,319 --> 00:51:54,880
And now this is the one that we want to be able to see with a tremendous clarity

255
00:51:54,880 --> 00:52:03,760
with a mind that's very calm, still quiet, rooted. That's part of the whole.

256
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:09,520
This is the function of insight supported by samadei is to be able to

257
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:16,079
get so such a feeling of centered calm a sense of wellbeing

258
00:52:16,079 --> 00:52:22,240
that we can see some of the deepest deepest places of suffering where we're holding on tight.

259
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,440
And that is one of the great wonderful maybe you can call it paradoxes of this

260
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,800
practice that the deepest suffering we have we

261
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:41,280
want to prepare ourselves to meet that by cultivating a good amount of settled

262
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:46,559
calm well-being that our sense of well-being sense of

263
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:52,240
joy or happiness that can come with samadei and insight um that becomes the

264
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:57,839
field within which we're ready to encounter some of the deepest holding

265
00:52:57,839 --> 00:53:04,720
clinging patterns in our life. And so um so this is a a path of

266
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:12,079
preparation of being wise not to address things directly and force our way into a

267
00:53:12,079 --> 00:53:17,920
peaceful state. But we prepare ourselves create the conditions so that we can be

268
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:26,240
present for the deepest clings we have in a way that allows for the deepest letting go of that kind of mental

269
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:32,559
constructs that involve clinging. attachment.

270
00:53:32,559 --> 00:53:38,960
So three kinds of dooka. Duka duka, the duka of change and the

271
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:44,800
duca of mental formations. And uh each of them requires a different

272
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:51,040
kind of wisdom, a different approach. And um and so it's not just one way to

273
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:56,160
be with suffering. It uh we have to have some wisdom and understanding of which

274
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:04,319
ones we're working with. So thank you and um in this process may

275
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:12,160
you suffer in a way that uh supports you to reach the end of suffering. Thank

276
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:15,160
you.
