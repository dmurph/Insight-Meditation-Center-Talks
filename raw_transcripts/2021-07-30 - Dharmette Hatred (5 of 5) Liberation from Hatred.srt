1
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,919
so it said

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,839
that the greatest health is nibana

3
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:10,320
nibana being liberation from greed

4
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,120
hatred and delusion

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,160
and uh to have this experience of

6
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,080
peace of the deep non-attachment

7
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,680
that is not nothing but rather

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,960
is feels like certain kind of

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,119
health healthfulness healthiness

10
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,000
that um that

11
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,280
is uh has a nourishment to it a deep

12
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,600
satisfaction to it a deep rightness to

13
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,879
it

14
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:46,960
and importantly uh it demonstrates to us

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,559
or reveals to us

16
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,920
the ways in which uh movements away from

17
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,840
that piece

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,239
uh are kind of are unsatisfactory moving

19
00:00:58,239 --> 00:00:59,440
away from that piece

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,480
is dukkha is stressful or is

21
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,439
involves tension or involves um

22
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,640
you know sometimes

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,159
you know what the buddhist called dukkha

24
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,640
suffering

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,080
and um and it's very interesting to

26
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,360
kind of feel this in meditation

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,880
because in daily life there might be

28
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,880
good reason to be engaged actively in

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,320
the world and

30
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,720
have the mind and the body active and

31
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,000
engaged and

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,320
not so peaceful and sometimes daily life

33
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,079
it's actually quite beautiful to

34
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,560
be active and there's ways of acting

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,240
vigorously in the world that can feel

36
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,680
very peaceful or very

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,320
harmonious and engaging if there's no

38
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,759
resistance and no greed is part of it

39
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,240
but in meditation when things get very

40
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,720
quiet and still in a very vital

41
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:54,799
vibrant way the mind might begin to move

42
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,240
into some

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,920
uh distracted thought into some

44
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,240
feeling some direction of holding on

45
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,560
clinging to something

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,560
and we can see oh this doesn't this is

47
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:09,520
not so good i'm better off without it

48
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,560
the better alternative is the peace so

49
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,400
it's not a condemnation

50
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,920
or a rejection exactly of of uh

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:21,040
being agitated being distracted or

52
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,520
a reactivity against it it's just

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:25,680
knowing there's a better alternative

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,720
peace and so

55
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:33,040
as we learn to work with ill will

56
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,959
hatred aversion hostility

57
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,080
and really learn to recognize it

58
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:43,120
and learn how we get hooked to it how we

59
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,360
get attached to it

60
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,200
and how it itself is a kind of

61
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,480
attachment

62
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,640
to have hostility we're already attached

63
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,160
to something

64
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,959
and to see that and feel that in a clear

65
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:55,840
way

66
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,920
and then to put it down to let go

67
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
to go to the other side of it to find

68
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,680
that which is deeper

69
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,800
and to have confidence in that peace

70
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,159
this is a big part of dharma practice

71
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,400
and then and so there is

72
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,480
a possibility of living without any ill

73
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,840
will

74
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,879
any hostility and

75
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,640
any aversion any strong kind of

76
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:32,400
biased opposition to things and um

77
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
the um and this is a this is part of the

78
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,280
radical message of

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,319
the buddha the buddhism that there it is

80
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:41,599
possible to bring an

81
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,440
end to greed hatred and delusion

82
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,440
and and this is what the buddha

83
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,519
emphasized over and over again

84
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,680
it's not necessarily easy and for some

85
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,680
people greed hatred and delusion in

86
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,280
subtle forms desire and aversion

87
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,480
is so part and parcel of living a life

88
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:03,840
it's inconceivable to not have it

89
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,000
but it is possible to come to the end of

90
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:06,879
it

91
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,519
and and we're not diminished or less

92
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,120
because of it we're not less able to

93
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,799
take care of ourselves

94
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:15,519
it's a state of health and it's a in

95
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,199
that health there's a wisdom

96
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,120
there's deeper understanding and

97
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,440
and so it isn't just to become mindful

98
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,360
of aversion ill will

99
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,840
and learn in the mindfulness to hold it

100
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,639
spaciously

101
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:31,360
and openly and and non-reactively and

102
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:33,759
not get caught by it

103
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,320
that's very powerful to do that but

104
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,080
there's another step

105
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,520
and that is to let go of any tendency

106
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,560
to ill will to aversion the

107
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,759
the idea being that uh aversion

108
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:54,320
is um as i said earlier

109
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,520
is a form of attachment so if all you're

110
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,479
doing

111
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:02,880
is letting go of um

112
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,960
of your reactivity you're holding to it

113
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,800
but still allowing the aversion to be

114
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,759
there

115
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,080
um we haven't gone to the depths of

116
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,360
freedom so it's possible to let go

117
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,440
so um so some people

118
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,440
uh are suspicious of this message

119
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,560
idea of letting go of ill will

120
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,600
in a deep way uh it's us it might be you

121
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,639
know it seems like it's such an

122
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,919
important part of life the

123
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,600
way of protecting ourselves taking care

124
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,240
of what we need and things like that

125
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,639
but there uh there are motivations and

126
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,600
ways of living

127
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,199
powerfully that arise out of the peace

128
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,720
the absence of ill will and

129
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,280
one of the most common reference points

130
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,479
for this

131
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,199
uh or common uh

132
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,479
opposites of

133
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,880
ill will is good will is a radical

134
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,000
feeling of or attitude

135
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,120
of friendliness some people like to call

136
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,680
it love or kindness

137
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,880
and and not because we're acting it or

138
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,199
pretending or

139
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,160
or somewhat overriding everything else

140
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,759
in order to be kind

141
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:22,479
it's because it's it's though that is

142
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:23,759
what

143
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,800
wells up from the well springs within

144
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,080
when there's no aversion and to then

145
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,680
learn to live a life of good will

146
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,880
learn to live a life to meet

147
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:39,440
uh the challenges of life the injustices

148
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:40,880
of life the

149
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:44,319
the in a way that um

150
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,160
that we are um

151
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:53,360
um clearly expressing our good will

152
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,440
our well-wishing our kindness our

153
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,120
friendliness

154
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,080
and maybe don't get confused by this to

155
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,199
think that it's

156
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,240
for the sake of the other people

157
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,520
is for the sake of not losing

158
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,960
health here for you not losing

159
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,160
your capacity to be free

160
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,639
your capacity to be to let the best and

161
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,639
the fullest part of us

162
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,840
to be there and be present that can't be

163
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,400
present

164
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,479
if we have hostility or ill will or

165
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:26,400
version we become

166
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,840
then we become partial then we become

167
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:30,400
incomplete

168
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,160
and the deep letting go of practice

169
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,599
and the absence of greed hate and

170
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:38,479
delusion is a kind of coming into a

171
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,720
wonderful completion

172
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:44,560
and and so to not succumb to ill will

173
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,879
again

174
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:52,960
is tremendously beneficial for oneself

175
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,080
and so to come with good will and love

176
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,520
and have that as a reference point for

177
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,400
the world

178
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,599
and how we act um

179
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,759
it's maybe more for yourself sometimes

180
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,879
than it is for the benefit of others

181
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:10,879
but it can be both and so one of the

182
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:14,080
for the buddha one of the

183
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,080
consequence of this deep liberation from

184
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,560
ill will greed delusion

185
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,240
is a life of service is a life that

186
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:29,280
is naturally dedicated to the care

187
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:32,320
and the welfare of the world and i like

188
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,240
to believe that it's not because it's a

189
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,760
duty

190
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,560
but because it's the best thing going

191
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,279
it's

192
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:43,200
it's what allows the healthy expression

193
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,240
of the heart to ex to manifest itself in

194
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,000
the world

195
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,320
and what it means though is that that

196
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,279
expression of

197
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,959
goodwill of service of care

198
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:57,279
if it comes out of our own hearts it's

199
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:58,399
going to be expressed

200
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,839
in our own particular way

201
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,959
and there are an infinite number of ways

202
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,200
in which that gets expressed some of

203
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,200
them are just

204
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:10,720
i don't want to say just but some of

205
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:12,240
them are in forms of

206
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,120
caring for our immediate family

207
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,680
sometimes

208
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,519
caring for our immediate community

209
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:19,600
sometimes it's caring for

210
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,360
the communities around us in the bigger

211
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,040
way sometimes

212
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,920
it's uh situational and it depends and

213
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,880
it's all of the above

214
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,519
care can be different in different days

215
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:33,440
different months different years

216
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,560
where our attention goes where our

217
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,680
service and care goes

218
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,040
but to have that care and service

219
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:45,920
come from our peace and our care our

220
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,880
peace and our

221
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,560
freedom is one of the best things going

222
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:53,600
and it's one of the reasons why to

223
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,720
really

224
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,120
have a deep study of hatred and get to

225
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,839
the bottom of it

226
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,800
so thank you
