1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:06,640
so everyone [Music] hello and welcome to happy hour

2
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,679
so for today's practice

3
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:17,920
the theme i'd like to invite us to explore and consider

4
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:26,480
is is one that can come [Music] quite handy and can be supportive

5
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:33,840
especially when our minds are really really busy when our minds and hearts are really

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,120
busy and say we sit down to meditate and the

7
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,640
idea of oh my goodness i'm gonna meditate what for the next 20 minutes 30 minutes are

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,160
you kidding me says the mind just going all over the place so it can

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,760
be particularly handy for those times when there is the busy buddha when there is the thinking buddha

10
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,320
of showing up on your cushion at home wherever you're practicing

11
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,439
especially for those moments but it can actually this this thing for

12
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,759
tonight which i haven't introduced yet i'm setting it up on the edge of your seats um

13
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:23,280
can also be helpful anytime for for deepening for really giving our

14
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,960
hearts in any moment of meditation any moment of exploration any moment not just meditation but in

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,240
life any endeavor that we are doing especially one that seems

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,360
um weighty perhaps

17
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:48,320
so what what this exploration is tonight is to just

18
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:55,280
give our hearts our complete heart to it whatever it is

19
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:02,640
just in this moment just just this just this justice

20
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:09,920
justice just landing in the body it's a very

21
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:20,840
embodied invitation justice justice just aware for just this

22
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,480
moment just loving cultivating goodwill towards myself for others

23
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:33,440
just just this moment just here it's okay not reaching towards the

24
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:38,879
future and not blaming ourselves for the past

25
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:46,319
so landing landing their whole body our whole heart and

26
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:53,280
just just this just this justice letting go

27
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:01,360
of the future clinging wanting responsibility i'll do this i dread this

28
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:06,640
or oh i didn't do it it was terrible my mind wandered last you know for the

29
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,440
past 29 minutes of this sit just justice just this is perfect

30
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:18,640
just this right here is enough so that's the theme i'd like to invite us to

31
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:24,879
explore together tonight as a tool in your

32
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:32,480
in your um toolbag humanities tool bag not just meditative but

33

34
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:49,040
i'd like to invite us invite you to land

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,000
ah to land this body in this moment

36
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,840
arriving

37
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:15,840
starting with the theme of our exploration from the very beginning

38
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:28,880
this is all that i'm sure of right here this magical presence of this present

39
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:35,919
moment ever so fleeting [Music] fleeting every moment

40
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:44,479
blending landing and giving my heart my whole body landing

41
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:57,840
giving it my full presence

42
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:13,280
as the expression in english goes like there is no tomorrow like there is no next moment just

43
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,840
this

44
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:15,360
and if you notice if you notice the mind wanders

45
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:25,759
it's okay the last moment is gone no need

46
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:35,840
for judgment self-flagellation just give your heart giving your heart

47
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:49,840
our attention our wholeheartedness

48
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:03,840
relaxing into just this moment

49
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,040
and i like to suggest to drop in an idea too

50
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:09,440
explore sit with as you're practicing in this way as if you were taking a dropper

51
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,920
of a color and dropping one drop

52
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,519
of color into the waters of exploration

53
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:29,040
this invitation this drop of color is as you sit here as we sit here in

54
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:35,600
practice not so much consider this a performance

55
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:43,360
i am doing this the performative aspect of meditation that we often

56
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:48,160
sometimes inadvertently have

57
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:58,240
but what if this dropper this idea introduced to our hearts

58
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:06,320
squeezed into the heart and mind is this idea of devotion

59
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:16,880
wholeheartedly devoting ourselves showing up for ourselves

60
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:23,200
for ourselves for all beings

61
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:30,240
showing up out of love devotion in this moment fully just this

62
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:39,839
moment not the next not the last

63
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:53,680
if our presents are wholehearted

64
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,959
our wholeheartedness is the gift

65
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:07,839
that we put on all on the altar in this moment just this moment

66
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:24,880
what if simply collecting

67
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:33,840
our attention our awareness

68
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:47,679
our wholehearted presence in this moment

69
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:56,080
what if this is an utmost act of care

70
00:17:56,080 --> 00:18:01,280
especially in today's world

71
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:15,840
an utmost act of care and love

72
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:21,520
to show up fully wholeheartedly in this moment

73
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:29,840
for ourselves for whatever is arising

74
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,960
in the sphere of awareness

75
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:43,120
just this moment meeting it fully

76
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:51,919
kindly not the last moment it's gone it's okay letting go

77
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:57,919
not judging planning for the next moments

78
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:09,840
but a radical dedication to this mystery

79
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:16,160

83
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,840

thank you all for your practice

120
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:37,119

and appreciation is coming in through youtube you are welcome thanks for joining dear youtube sangha

124
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,440
and practicing so so many different

125
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:12,960
aspects or dimensions as we explored here can come up we wanted to reflect on one

126
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:18,560
thing that happened for me which is very interesting and actually quite lovely

127
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:25,599
exploring this way of just this moment showing up and embracing giving my heart

128
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:32,960
the sense of time it actually shifted time became very spacious as if time

129
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,640
dropped away and well everything is a concept everything is empty

130
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:44,560
including time and perception of time shifted through this

131
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,599
practice it's just an expansiveness which was very interesting

132
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:57,520
um just noticing that playing around with that anyway um

133
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:05,760
so and it could have been also challenging in different ways this practice it's more open our way of showing up

134
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:13,359
is a way of expressing care and love so would love to hear questions complaints

135
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:20,079
reflections how was it for you let us learn from

136
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:25,839
from what happened for you parents

137
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:33,280
okay um you mentioned a couple of times

138
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,960
returning to the body um something around the discomfort

139
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:44,400
that may be associated with the body and i've been having a lot of bodily discomfort

140
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:50,480
it doesn't affect the stability of my setting but it's uncomfortable and

141
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:57,440
and feeling the what that way that that they waft and wane and coming and going with

142
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:05,599
attention and then remembering that this is the this is for mental practice or

143
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:13,599
the compassion practice of course for for myself is the most obvious but i began to sense this pain as

144
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,119
somehow being kind of a symptom of the world or the

145
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:28,400
pain of pain except share this is something that we're very common we share and that shifted the pain

146
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:35,280
that shifted uh really opened you know in a sense awareness to a

147
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:42,800
different view a different association to the pain may this pain be the uh

148
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:49,280
cause for less pain in the world may this this pain served to

149
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,359
relieve the suffering of the world very big change

150
00:41:55,520 --> 00:42:01,200
beautiful turns thank you so much for sharing that shift in

151
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:09,040
perception in this different way of relating holding being that is profound instead of

152
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:16,880
habitually you know our mind see it as oh my pain my shoulder my back my to whoa

153
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:22,000
common humanity pain of both common humanity other people and

154
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,800
also the pain of the world this is the suffering it's the shared suffering oh and i'm holding this peace there's a

155
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:33,920
sense of nobility i'm holding this peace

165
00:43:54,640 --> 00:44:02,720
so others don't have to uh that's from pema children

166
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:10,000
yeah i am feeling this now so others don't have to yeah yeah one way of burning off our

167
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:16,880
karma yeah thank you thanks for reading that in yeah and as you mentioned as you give

168
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:22,480
credit to pemo children this is very common this way of conceptualizing and seeing

169
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:28,720
suffering as as offering our suffering as as an offering um is

170
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:36,480
uh is very is is common especially in vajrayana uh buddhism in tibetan

171
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:41,680
buddhism not so much in terra vada but yes very common it's it can be a beautiful way

172
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:48,319
that the heart can find a lot of meaning in in suffering in that instead of it

173
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:54,720
being senseless and there's no point it's just there's a beauty there's a sacredness

174
00:44:54,720 --> 00:45:01,359
that can show up in this way yeah thank you so let's let's um

175
00:45:01,359 --> 00:45:08,319
join jump into our sangha practice where the practice meets the road or

176
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:13,920
comes into contact and relationally holding ourselves just in this moment

177
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:20,240
with care holding others in just this moment with care showing up fully can we show up fully

178
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:26,640
for ourselves can we show up fully for everyone else just showing up fully this could be

179
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:32,240
great practice in small groups today for how we show up for ourselves and

180
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:37,839
others in relationships instead of thinking about what we're gonna say or what we're gonna have for lunch or

181
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:43,119
dinner can we show up for others ourselves for just the six

182
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:49,440
minutes uh practicing wholeheartedly and see how what that might feel like in the

183
00:45:49,440 --> 00:45:55,040
body and in the mind and as always let's start with 15

184
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:02,240
seconds of um of silent meta for ourselves and for

185
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:09,200
each other and um let's see i'm going to create the rooms they will

up while you were practicing together in groups why don't you notice

rebecca hi yeah it's really helpful to be in the grid

197
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:24,880
because of gaining perspectives that i don't have yeah even after years uh all of a sudden

198
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:32,160
there's a fresh perspective so someone in my group said that the important thing is effort it's like what

199
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:37,839
and and then and then i questioned it because that didn't that i didn't understand that the

216
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:30,800
when you when we're uh connected with that that peacefulness that you know the inner peace and the

217
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:36,240
the joy of the of that uh just being uh connected with the body

218
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:41,760
the breath yeah sometimes i feel like like it feels so good that it feels like like if it's

219
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:49,040
an escape you know like if i'm using it as an escape but then i remember uh someone mentioned in a dharma talk

220
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:56,240
that the buddha said that uh that he he he had the same uh state of mind or

221
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:03,040
something but he he said that if it's wholesome how could it be you know how could it be

222
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:09,680
uh what is it called like uh bad for you you know how could it be bad for you if

223
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:15,040
it's wholesome you know yeah for something that you you know uh that you could get uh cling

224
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:21,520
on you know something that you can attach to yeah i'm so glad you bring that in uh anthony that's fantastic

225
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,680
first of all delighted that that sense of spaciousness and timelessness and that peace that arises for you

226
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:34,079
in meditation because it's very nourishing it is very nourishing and and this fear that

227
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:40,240
comes up for you oh is this bad for me am i checking out is this just like kind of like am i taking drugs happy drugs

228
00:50:40,240 --> 00:50:46,480
and just checking out in this happy space is that what that is um if it is

229
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:53,520
if it becomes that really people do it just to check out just then yes it can become but but that's

230
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:59,359
not what i'm hearing is happening for you and that's not how the buddha utilized it etc

231
00:50:59,359 --> 00:51:06,480
the way actually we practice it with its spaciousness supports us it gives us calm and peace to then

232
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:11,839
bring love compassion stability care to the world instead of just checking

233
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:17,200
out it's like okay i'm going to take care of myself rest it

234
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:24,079
and and i'll be more nourished to be in the world to serve in the world instead of just check out

235
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:29,359
