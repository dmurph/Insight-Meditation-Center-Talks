00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,960
good morning good day hello and

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,320
welcome to our Monday beginning of the week

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:22,480
series and I'm continuing we're continuing with a introduction to mindfulness

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,679
meditation part two and um for the

5
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:35,520
meditation today today I'd like to emphasize or point out that one of the

6
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:43,000
primary characteristics of uh mindfulness meditation is

7
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:50,280
Simplicity and one teacher mono manindra G who I met in India vipasa teacher he

8
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,640
said that if it's not simple it's not vasam and the idea of radical

9
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:03,000
Simplicity includes uh and this is the part that's difficult

10
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:11,799
in the Simplicity includes not uh

11
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:17,240
projecting our mental constructs onto our

12
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:24,360
experience if we're thinking about the past or thinking about the future that's a mental construct that in

13
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:31,880
a sense is projected on the past and projected on the future uh the past doesn't exist the

14
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:38,799
future doesn't exist in certain kind of existentially real way and so it's there

15
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,000
has to do with memory or prediction constructs of the mind and these can be

16
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,520
fine in important part of life but when we sit to do mindfulness

17
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:58,000
meditation we're not even interested in the constructs of the Mind

18
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,439
here theas are kind of radical Simplicity where we allow our direct

19
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,599
experience to be itself free from comparisons free from

20
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,680
ideals free from what should or shouldn't happen free from our stories

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,720
that we have about it free of what we think other people will say about it

22
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,800
just sitting here in a radical simple way with the experience of this so

23
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:36,000
radical that we don't even impose on the experience Me Myself and

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,720
mine those can be fine Concepts but in the Simplicity of

25
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,200
feeling the warmth of the body this weight of the

26
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,599
body we can experience it without adding me myself and mind just

27
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:01,000
warmth just solidity just the in breath bre and out

28
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:10,400
breath moving through the body so to assume a meditation

29
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,879
posture where somewhere in the posture there's a sense of

30
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:24,959
intentionality like you're physically engaged to be here if you're sitting on the

31
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:31,159
floor it might be the Torso that's upright

32
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:38,000
if you're sitting in a chair using a back rest maybe there's a way of placing your hands on your lap that it's kind of

33
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,920
like saying here I am Palms down on the thighs here I am

34
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,400
intentionally if you're laying down maybe you're you can point uh your

35
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:56,000
forearms up forearms up to the ceiling if you're laying on your back so there's

36
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:04,920
something intentional that is support for being here and

37
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:13,519
now and then taking a few long slow deep

38
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,880
breaths softening the body as you

39
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
exhale

40
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,039
letting your breathing return to

41
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:01,080
normal and with an exhale relaxing the think

42
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:09,000
mind softening a quieting of

43
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,080
thinking as you exhale a quieting of the Heart

44
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:31,639
Center relaxing in the chest

45
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,919
and then softening the

46
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:53,880
belly letting the belly hang forward and maybe a little bit

47
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:06,599
down sometimes a soft expanded belly can feel like it provides you a

48
00:06:06,599 --> 00:06:15,039
stronger foundation for the upper torso to be

49
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:25,000
here or it supports a more relaxed rhythm of

50
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,560
breathing

51
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,199
bringing your attention into your

52
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:01,520
body

53
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,479
maybe as if you're entering a peaceful maybe sacred grove

54
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:14,800
of trees so you go into your body so you

55
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,319
can experience the be with the body's experience of

56
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,800
itself the body's experience of

57
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,400
breathing and here in this

58
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,879
body to be very

59
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:02,000
simple with staying present for the Ever Changing Sensations of the

60
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,960
body as you

61
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
breathe

62
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440

67
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:12,760
with whatever experience is happening in the

68
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:18,560
present to be simp be simple with

69
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,120
it

70
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:33,720
to free the experience from the constructs of the

71
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:40,600
Mind the ideas the concepts the judgments the

72
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:48,880
desires and if those things happen be very simple with

73
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,440
them and you don't have to believe

74
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:11,240
them just something arising in the moment soon to be

75
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
gone

76
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120
e

77
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120

for

91
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,600
can you be simpler here

92
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:08,480
if you need to think think with radical

93
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,200
Simplicity about what's actually happening here in your direct

94
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:24,399
experience without interpretation or stories or attribution to Me Myself and

95
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
mind

96
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

97
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440

e

101
00:24:47,399 --> 00:24:55,240
and then as we come to the end of this sitting to

102
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:03,840
consider review this meditation and could you have could you have been

103
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:09,000
simpler could you been less involved in thoughts and

104
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:14,600
judgments anxieties or

105
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,720
desires to sit here with Simplicity of

106
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:30,320
being that might even include a contentment just to be

107
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:49,440
Simplicity of being is not a diminishment of who we are it's a

108
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:56,039
radical respect for who we are where who we are can just be

109
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:04,240
itself without adding anything on top of it and as we come to this end of this

110
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:12,080
sitting may we prepare ourselves to go into the world with that kind of respect for

111
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:18,799
others that we're careful with our projections our desires our

112
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,880
assumptions our bias the complicated ways in which we

113
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:31,000
overlay our perceptions of others with our beliefs and

114
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:37,840
ideas conditioning but to put those aside even

115
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:44,039
maybe put aside the

116
00:26:44,039 --> 00:26:48,919
past so we can meet people as they

117
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:57,559
are have profound respect for each person allowed to be as they are free of

118
00:26:57,559 --> 00:27:03,640
our judgment may all

119
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:12,360
beings be happy may all beings be

120
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:19,039
safe may all [Music] beings be

121
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:23,960
peaceful may all beings be

122
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:31,240
free and as a minimum may they be

123
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:40,159
free of the limited view in which we look at people our judgments our

124
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:46,000
bias may people be free of our

125
00:27:54,450 --> 00:28:00,120
[Music] projections

126
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:10,120
thank

127
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
you

128
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

129
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:11,000
so hello from Insight Meditation Center on this Monday

130
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:19,120
morning and today I begin a new new kind of series within the wider series longer

131
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:26,519
series on uh introduction to mindfulness part two and

132
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:33,559
um one of the uh important areas of mindfulness is not

133
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:44,360
just what's happening in our experience to be present here and now uh to body breath emotions feelings

134
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:51,640
thoughts also to be present for to recognize the ways that we are attached

135
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:57,519
the ways that we cling the ways that we grasp the ways that we clamp and down or

136
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:05,080
tighten up up or constrict and um and uh this is Central to the

137
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:11,519
Buddhist practice of mindfulness because attachment is considered to be one of

138
00:30:11,519 --> 00:30:18,760
the primary or made primary cause to optional Suffering The Suffering that we

139
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:24,960
add to our life by the clinging itself clinging itself is a kind of

140
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:30,360
suffering attachment is a kind of constriction a contraction a resistance

141
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:38,240
a tightening up a a um weighing down that uh we can

142
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:43,480
experience and to lighten up to

143
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:49,640
release to free up uh wherever part wherever we're attached as part of the

144
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:59,159
Enterprise of the Buddhist teachings on mindfulness so to do that we want to start becoming cognizant of how we

145
00:30:59,159 --> 00:31:04,720
cling what forms of attachment we have the ways the physical the direct way in

146
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:12,320
which attachment is felt and experienced generally even if you feel

147
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:19,760
like it's valid to cling to something to be attached to something if you really

148
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,639
feel uh the cost of the attachment the impact it has on you you can feel that

149
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:34,559
it's stressful feel that it's uh um uh is a limitation it's a irritation it's a

150
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:42,279
it's a um burden it's a it's a it's it's a

151
00:31:42,279 --> 00:31:48,000
it's a kind of um it brings along a kind of contraction

152
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,360
which doesn't feel good and it leads to further contractions part of the problem

153
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:00,840
of clinging and attachment is one attachment gives birth to other attachment they grow on each

154
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:07,399
other and so the practice of mindfulness is a practice of radical

155
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:14,840
Simplicity where we're trying to be simple enough in the present moment just with the direct experience we have so

156
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:21,720
that direct experience can highlight the addition we put to it of clinging of

157
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:27,440
attachment and so the Buddha so there's two things there's what we attach to

158
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:34,880
what we cling to and the clinging in and of itself and um and so in the in the

159
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,960
teachings of the Buddha he put a lot of emphasis on five areas that we

160
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:48,760
cling and uh and and and just not just any clinging but these five areas are

161
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:54,480
offer Al also for the Buddha the primary locations primary

162
00:32:54,480 --> 00:33:02,120
areas uh uh through which we cling to a self sense of self regardless of what

163
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,799
you think about there is or isn't a self there is a clinging to self clinging to

164
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:13,960
Identity clinging to who we think we should be clinging to roles clinging to

165
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:19,120
variety of things and that clinging is a for uh is

166
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,519
how self self attachment can create tremendous amount of

167
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:31,240
suffering people act on their attachments act on clinging and when we do so then it's usually not very

168
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:37,639
skillful very helpful so these five areas are appear

169
00:33:37,639 --> 00:33:47,320
our appearances how we appear and how others appear to us um the uh uh sens the basic

170
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:56,720
sensations of Pleasure and Pain comfort and discomfort uh the perceptions or the

171
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:02,799
conceptions by which we recognize things the simple ideas we have of things which are often

172
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:08,158
not simple enough because they come along with a whole host of associations

173
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:14,638
meanings projections onto things uh and then uh the stories we

174
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:22,320
live by the larger constructions of the mind that interpretations and philosophies and memories and histories

175
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:29,200
and imaginings of the future and finally to our very simple

176
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:34,240
capacity to know not just what we know but just that

177
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:39,919
we do know it's such such a fantastic capacity and some people cling to this

178
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:45,118
so these are five areas and the way the Buddha referred to them in the way that

179
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:50,358
I kind of understand it is uh he called them the five

180
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:56,398
bundles uh sometimes they're called the five Aggregates in English but I think the word Aggregates kind of obscures

181
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:05,079
what they're about he talked about how they um uh uh uh different experiences

182
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:11,400
that we have that we gather together into a larger

183
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:16,599
collection to be through our clinging so not just not just that we cling to

184
00:35:16,599 --> 00:35:20,359
something but it's one of many

185
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:35,040
but uh we understand form here to be the shape of things the how they appear but

186
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:41,760
because it also includes hearing and smelling and tasting and the other senses it's how things appear to the

187
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:49,400
senses but appearance is in the eyes of the beholder that um uh we're we're not

188
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:55,720
passive and innocent perceivers of things but appearance is something we

189
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,400
select we select what's important for us in the world of appearances we see an

190
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:07,000
attractive person and it might be that it's the clothes they wear it might be

191
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:13,280
the shape of their nose or there might be the the quality of their voice that

192
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:19,160
somehow we're predisposed to maybe tune in to certain aspects of a person and

193
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:24,359
that's what we find attractive and so how they appear in our mind the

194
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:30,200
selection Choice we've made is um is not an innocent kind of just seeing things

195
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,599
as they are where of all the things that person is we're tuned into particular

196
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:40,800
aspect of them and that happens to us as well and

197
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:46,520
um you know you know as I grew up over time as a child uh there was a

198
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:52,160
progressive increase concerned with my appearances how I appeared for others I

199
00:36:52,160 --> 00:37:00,440
the earliest memory I have for something like this was I was probably about um I think I was maybe about

200
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:08,680
um 6 years old and before that I I called my parents mama and papa but I

201
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:14,119
was returning to Norway to visit with the family there grandparents there and

202
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:20,200
I remember um uh I was getting off the airplane at the airport in Norway and

203
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:26,200
literally we were kind of there was time to get up from our seats and walk down the aisle and so it was a time to say

204
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:31,760
something that there would be no conversations about it so I turned to my mother and

205
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,839
said uh from now on uh you're going to be in Norwegian um mother and

206
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:44,119
father so mother and father uh and the reason was I didn't want to be

207
00:37:44,119 --> 00:37:49,640
embarrassed looking like a small kid in the eyes of my grandparents I wanted to

208
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:56,520
be a little more grown up say mother and father and um so how I appeared to

209
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:01,760
people became now concern and then when I was maybe eight

210
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:07,880
I remember the first time I got classes I also changed schools when I got glasses and so in the new school I

211
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:13,480
didn't want to wear my glasses in school because I thought people would make fun of me and that I would look

212
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:19,240
funny and um and then progressively as I got older there were concerns about back

213
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:25,000
then 1960s how long my hair was and uh concerns with what kind of clothes I

214
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:30,040
wore concerns with um all kinds of things they grew and grew

215
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:35,960
and grew and I don't know when they stopped growing and I added to them but

216
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:43,800
um but this whole idea of how I appear and how other people appear to me when I

217
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:51,680
was 19 I traveled with some friends to Morocco and uh back then many most of

218
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:57,960
the men Moroccan men wore these beautiful long uh uh robes think they

219
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:04,760
called jalaba and um and I was walking around the streets of Morocco and I had a

220
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:12,000
strange feeling that I couldn't quite understand something was a little bit lighter or more open in my mind and I

221
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:18,440
couldn't understand it until one day I realized that um because all these men

222
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:23,720
were wearing clothes that I had no associations with I was not associating

223
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:31,160
I wasn't projecting judgments and ideas on them whereas in other parts of the world in the West in America uh you

224
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:37,560
could tell something about the People by the clothes they wear and walking down the streets I had judgments about people

225
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:44,839
and my mind was kind of busy kind know like almost almost subconsciously evaluating judging people as I went and

226
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:51,960
the Morocco I I couldn't do that and it freed part of my mind and that was kind of a lovely

227
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:58,800
feeling to have to not being not not have the ability to judge because I didn't have context for

228
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:06,599
it so appearances we can sit down and meditate and how we appear uh can be um

229
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:14,280
you know what we start noticing we're attached to we're attached to our body parts how we are here and how it looks

230
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,640
uh some people spend more time more care with the clothes with the clothes they

231
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:25,760
choose to wear or the hair or they arrange or all kinds of things than they

232
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,359
do with care around the word words they speak and um because how we appear is so

233
00:40:32,359 --> 00:40:38,800
important and it's partly important because others take it as important do people do judge us based on our

234
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:44,680
appearances and how we are and so we get pulled into this world of being

235
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:50,880
preoccupied with how we appear and our appearances and preoccupied with other people's

236
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:56,720
appearances and so this is one area of attachment and sometimes you can feel

237
00:40:56,720 --> 00:41:02,520
the clinging attachment to appearances can be a heavy weight to Bear it can

238
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:08,440
create anxiety the clinging to you know how am I going to be accepted a

239
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:14,240
fundamental human uh need is to be to belong kind of to be accepted and the

240
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:21,440
fear of rejection and so because we we navigate so much the world of appearances unfortunately that people

241
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:29,800
put so much store at in that world and um and then concerned about uh

242
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:37,599
appearances with um you know you know with our our hair size of our nose or

243
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:43,880
fingers hands wrinkles as we get older and uh and this can be quite depressing

244
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:51,640
for some people but it is a construct it's ideas some of them are culturally created that

245
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:56,800
our culture kind of infects us with so we think in the way that a culture

246
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:04,720
around us things and um and to sit in meditation and be radically simple and leave

247
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,079
ourselves leave our body leave our appearance radically alone so we can

248
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:15,359
breathe and be quiet and just sense Let the

249
00:42:15,359 --> 00:42:22,640
Body uh finally let the body be left alone free the body from the heavy

250
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:28,079
weight of all the ideas and projections imaginations

251
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:36,000
all the concerns we have about rejection and and uh dismissal and trying

252
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:42,599
to build up and create a more important kind of appearance for the world the

253
00:42:42,599 --> 00:42:50,000
radical Simplicity leaving ourselves alone so that something inward inner can

254
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:57,839
evolve and flow and give us a feeling of being content and happy and and um and

255
00:42:57,839 --> 00:43:06,280
alive free of any clinging to how we appear and uh we're allowed to be as we

256
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:13,680
are independent of what Society tells us what's good or bad or desirable

257
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:20,838
undesirable so there's a lot of self related to appearance self-making

258
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:26,119
self-building the attachment to appearance is not an innocent thing it's

259
00:43:26,119 --> 00:43:31,839
uh something that we gather together into bundles and there's a huge bundles

260
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,839
of of these attachments that people live with so that's the first of the bundles

261
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:45,480
the Buddha talked about and today as you go about your day you might get curious

262
00:43:45,480 --> 00:43:51,319
about the how much of your time is spent concerned one way or the other with your

263
00:43:51,319 --> 00:43:58,200
appearance with your clothes with anything at all and um and then kind of

264
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:03,559
you know kind of be curious kind of kind of tilt your head down a little bit

265
00:44:03,559 --> 00:44:10,160
what's this you know with a question what is this what this about is this needed what's

266
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:16,040
uh why am I so concerned about it what's the purpose of it and and just explore

267
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:21,520
it and get to know it more and maybe in the process of that you'll recognize one

268
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:27,839
or two attachments you have about appearance and maybe you'll look at

269
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:33,079
um The Suffering the stress that might come with that

270
00:44:33,079 --> 00:44:36,280
attachment thank

271
00:44:41,040 --> 00:44:44,040
you
