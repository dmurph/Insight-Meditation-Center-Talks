1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:05,878
[Music] so taking our meditation

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:14,519
posture and posture that reflects Our intention to bring attention to our

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:23,439
experience so some uprightness and it also has

4
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,599
ease and this can be a practice in itself how to have some uprightness

5
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,960
without stiffness some uprightness with also

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,000
some flexibility or

7
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,320
malleability this week I've been starting us off with bringing attention

8
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:02,680
to our sitting surface the pressures against the

9
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:07,400
body I think I'll continue with that this

10
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:17,240
morning what does it feel like to feel connected grounded to the

11
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,240
foundation upon which you're sitting

12
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,640
doesn't matter whether it's couch chair bed

13
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,880
cushion can we feel connected touching the surface having

14
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,000
the Surface touch us

15
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,640
feeling the pressure against the

16
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,879
body we don't need to use words we're just feeling the

17
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:43,440
sensations coming back to them when the mind wanders

18
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:23,440
sitting cross-legged and for me feelings in the bcks as it's sitting

19
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,480
on the zof is predominant

20
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,920
if you're in a chair maybe it's the back of the

21
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,360
legs if you're on a couch maybe it's the

22
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:50,120
back it leans back if you're lying down maybe it's the back of like near

23
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,280
the

24
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:03,280
shoulders wherever it is just br moment more resting attention

25
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:09,760
on the contact with the sitting or lying surface

26
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,039
and then bringing some attention to the front of the

27
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:51,400
body the face

28
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,280
lips touching maybe some Sensations around

29
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,479
the eyes

30
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:46,639
the chest can there be a

31
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:53,039
softness in the chest area sometimes we guard ourselves by

32
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,080
closing the chest in some kind of way

33
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,478
there be an opening a softening

34
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:45,720
and the

35
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,319
belly can we let the belly

36
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,879
relax however the belly is can it be okay

37
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:07,560
this meditation period just let it relax

38
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:52,080
as we pay attention to the front of the body we might naturally be

39
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:56,960
noticing the experiences as the body

40
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:02,240
breathes let's rest our attention

41
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:24,199
there noticing the sensations associated with an in

42
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,479
breath e

43
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:11,600
notice the sensations associated with out breaths

44
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:56,920
and those Sensations with the transitions between INB breaths and out

45
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,920
breaths

46
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,959
it's often a place where the Mind likes to

47
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
wander

48
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
e e

49
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,279
and when the mind wanders as it's apt to

50
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:50,519
do can it not be a

51
00:11:53,760 --> 00:12:00,440
problem and it just be an indicator it's an opportunity to be begin mindfulness

52
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:03,040
practice

53
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
again

54
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:01,120

55
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120

56
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
e e

57
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:01,000
when we wake up after being lost in

58
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:08,240
thought this can be a good place to notice what kind of

59
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:15,519
stories are we are either the content of the thoughts but more

60
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:23,160
importantly the stories we say about ourselves as

61
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:30,360
meditators when we discover that we've been lost in thought

62
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:42,319
sometimes there can be a oh shoot I'm lost in thought

63
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,880
again I'm never going to get

64
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,440
this they're just thoughts

65
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,160
we don't have to believe

66
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
them

67
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839

[Music]

94
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:49,000
morning welcome welcome today is our the fifth day

95
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:56,120
Friday in this uh series about stories and um I'd like to

96
00:29:56,120 --> 00:30:03,600
start the this morning the conversation the offering with a

97
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,440
poem and this poem is by Rosemary traumer this beautiful wonderful poet

98
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:16,120
who lives in Colorado and uh and this uh poem is

99
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:24,480
entitled sometimes like today we remember again this is Rosemary

100
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:30,640
traumer and the first the title of the poem leads right into the second line of

101
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:37,519
the poem and I know sometimes people like what was the name of that poem so I'm going to say it one more time

102
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,399
sometimes like today we

103
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:51,000
remember sometimes like today we remember that

104
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:58,679
everyone even the driver in the white Jeep who cut in front of you yes even

105
00:30:58,679 --> 00:31:04,039
the elegant woman in the dairy aisle and

106
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:11,960
the man who seems lost on the library steps and the child sitting alone on the

107
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:17,000
bench yes everyone has a

108
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:22,159
story fears and hopes and something to

109
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:28,600
learn and someone they love and someone who's hurt them

110
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:36,080
and someone they long to hold and though their stories are mostly

111
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:43,639
invisible they're always more complex than whatever we

112
00:31:43,639 --> 00:31:49,600
project and they're every bit as real as our

113
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:56,840
own the woman in the dairy a Smiles at you and though she is wearing diamonds

114
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:05,679
in her ears she looks lonely or is it you who is

115
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:12,279
lonely is it all of us all of us longing for someone to

116
00:32:12,279 --> 00:32:18,519
truly see us and that driver you're cursing don't

117
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:24,000
we all sometimes feel as if we need to move forward any way we

118
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:30,120
can and that boy on the bench notice the empty seat beside

119
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:36,080
him perhaps you could sit there too in the

120
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:40,799
sun who knows what might happen

121
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:49,159
next I love this uh poem partly because right it just brings so often the our

122
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:54,519
some of these like mundane experiences we have getting caught off cut off as

123
00:32:54,519 --> 00:33:00,880
for driving grocery shopping going to the library and just seeing somebody on the

124
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:08,120
bench as we're driving along or walking along just these uh ordinary experiences

125
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:15,039
that we see every day and without our even recognizing it

126
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:22,200
we're like projecting something onto these individuals and we're project maybe not

127
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:27,600
only just projector what we might not notice is we're projecting a story onto

128
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,720
them like in this poem The Poet is or the

129
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:39,799
person in this poem is uh projecting a loneliness onto this person who you know

130
00:33:39,799 --> 00:33:44,970
just who knows why they uh the poet thinks that they look lonely they just look

131
00:33:44,970 --> 00:33:52,880
[Music] lonely and I love what's being done here it's like wait like turning this around

132
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:59,720
I'm projecting that outwards but is it really about

133
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:05,840
me and this is such an interesting thing for us to consider all the stuff that

134
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:11,320
we're attributing to other people out there is it really about

135
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:17,158
us is the way that we're noticing it is uh because there's something about us

136
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:24,560
that we're trying to disown and instead we're projecting it on others out there or is there something about us that we

137
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,158
uh we're a little bit ashamed of and and we don't want to see it we don't want to

138
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,679
own it so we're projecting it out there who knows why we project things onto

139
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:42,398
other people out there but what would it be like to notice the stories we're

140
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:49,158
attributing to others and then just to consider just to have some curiosity is

141
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:57,079
this about me clearly it's about that person you know but wait is there something here

142
00:34:57,079 --> 00:35:03,240
about me me to this can be such a learning point and

143
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:11,560
uh I've been practicing with this for some time when I'm thinking to myself oh that person is X Y or or

144
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:18,359
Z and like why am I uh thinking this and what does it say about me it's been

145
00:35:18,359 --> 00:35:25,480
really helpful for me to consider do I have X Y and Z inside myself and that I

146
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:32,480
wish I didn't or do I think that I have X Y and Z and that's why it irks me that

147
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:39,680
this other person has it so maybe that's one thing we could take away from this

148
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:46,800
poem is that here here um this Rosemary traumer the poet she

149
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:53,040
writes the woman in the dairy aisle Smiles at you and though she is wearing

150
00:35:53,040 --> 00:36:01,680
diamonds in her ears she looks lonely or is it you who is lonely I love this

151
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:08,359
she's wearing diamonds in her ear so we're assuming she must have everything she needs she has wealth or she has this

152
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:15,200
uh certain indicator that suggests there's wealth so she must be happy

153
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,160
right she must have everything she wants and then like but wait maybe she

154
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:26,720
has uh maybe she's lonely just because some people have

155
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:33,240
some things that maybe be on the surface you know we're projecting a story oh she has wealth so she must be fine but no

156
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:38,560
wait she has wealth but she looks lonely this says a lot about

157
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:45,520
us right these uh stories that uh we're projecting onto other

158
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,920
people and then I'd love that Rosemary traumer she has this uh one

159
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:57,640
sentence and though their stories are mostly invisible

160
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:04,280
they're always more complex than whatever we project and they're every

161
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:10,960
bit as real as our [Music] own there's this way with this example

162
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:16,640
with this woman in the dairy aisle we're just kind of making her flat like with no depth there's a person who seems to

163
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:24,079
have wealth and looks like she's lonely like full stop not uh kind of like appreciating

164
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:29,319
the complexity and the depth maybe the um you know of course I'm just making

165
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:35,680
this up how could it be anything otherwise but maybe the earrings were given to her at the death of somebody

166
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:40,800
near to her that was meaningful and she's looking lonely

167
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:48,000
because now the family is torn apart after this death right then there's something like

168
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:54,560
completely different than um what we were projecting onto her or maybe she's

169
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:02,040
wearing these earrings as a they were something that um as she had this major

170
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:08,480
achievement maybe she just uh um became cancer free after battling cancer for

171
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:16,160
some time and uh the earrings maybe they're not even really diamonds maybe they're just a something that's sparkly

172
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:22,720
and from a distance look like they're diamonds but something that she wanted to buy herself as a that she made it

173
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,079
through this really difficult time battling cancer and

174
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:35,480
you know there's so much stories right that we can give to this but what I appreciate is that this poet here Ros

175
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:42,280
Mary traumer she's saying they're always more complex than whatever we

176
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:51,000
project so instead of saying the person in the white Jeep who cut us off like ah this person's a jerk no maybe they

177
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:56,480
are um in a hurry or maybe they're just not paying attention because uh they're

178
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:02,760
so confused their boss wanted to call them in at the last moment and say have a very important thing to talk to you

179
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:08,920
and maybe they're afraid that they're going to get fired so they don't want to be late to this meeting in which that

180
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:15,000
they that the boss might even think that they're going to get fired right we could just go on and on and on right

181
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:20,920
just building these stories but there's a way in which when we make them just

182
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:26,280
two-dimensional kind of like flat and simple it's there's a little bit of a

183
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:31,880
way in which we're kind of dehumanizing them oh just a jerk bull stop just

184
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:38,480
somebody who has money that's bull stop or the person uh who was this other one

185
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:48,000
who seems lost on the library steps somebody maybe a visitor from out of town or maybe somebody whose memory is

186
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:55,560
declining and um is trying to navigate the confusion of like wait where am I

187
00:39:55,560 --> 00:40:02,240
wow how could we uh not be impacted by that and

188
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:08,720
then here's what I think is such a key part of this

189
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,920
poem and though those stories are mostly invisible they're always more complex

190
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:24,319
than whatever we project and they're every bit as real as our

191
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:31,730
own every bit as real as our [Music]

192
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:37,839
own there's so many ways to uh understand this one is we tend to think

193
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:44,200
our stories are real and legitimate everybody else's stories not so much those are just their problems and those

194
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:51,720
are just stories but mine is true mine is real mine is the most important and

195
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:56,920
authentic and how things really are for everybody else they're just stories

196
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:02,800
right now notice how we do this notice how we tend to think that ours are just as you know the most real and everybody

197
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,480
else's are uh just you know some Fabrications that they

198
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,280
have news flash ours are just Fabrications

199
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:19,920
too right of course they are of course they are they're the way that we're

200
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:27,079
trying to make meaning of our experiences and they might be really uh meaningful and supportive for our lives

201
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:32,920
but but some of our stories not so helpful not so

202
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:38,760
helpful the stories of the world is out to get me the world is

203
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:44,480
unsafe the I deserve better you know some of these kind of stories they're

204
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:51,000
based on events that have had but the way that we uh um construct these stories and then project them onto

205
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:59,240
everything else out there not so helpful for us doesn't let us live our best

206
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:04,440
lives so other people's stories are every bit as real as our

207
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:10,760
own which I'm sorry to say they're not so real our stories are just in our head

208
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:18,000
like the rest of the universe is not uh um I don't know can they're not uh don't

209
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,119
even know about them they're just things that are inside our minds they're

210
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:30,960
thoughts they're just thoughts I don't want to say this to be dismissive and to say that uh people's

211
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:38,040
life events and difficulties I don't want to be dismissive of them but I'd like to encourage us to look at what

212
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:46,160
stories do we have that um aren't so helpful and is there a way that we can

213
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:52,119
hold them Loosely hold them Loosely I'll read this poem one more

214
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:57,279
time it's by Rosemary traumer

215
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:05,040
and its title is sometimes like today we remember so the poem goes like

216
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:11,720
this sometimes like today we remember that everyone even the driver and the

217
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:17,000
white Jeep who cut in front of you yes even the elegant woman in the dairy

218
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:22,680
aisle and the man who seems lost on the library steps and the child sitting

219
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:31,839
alone on the bench yes everyone has a story fears and hopes and something to

220
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:38,440
learn and someone they love and someone who's hurt them and someone they long to

221
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:45,640
hold and though their stories are mostly invisible they're always more complex

222
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:52,040
than whatever we project and they're every bit as real as our

223
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:57,839
own the woman in the dairy aisle Smiles at you and though she's wearing diamonds

224
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:04,920
in her ears she looks lonely or is it you who was

225
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:12,200
lonely is it all of us all of us longing for someone to truly see

226
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:18,079
us and a driver you're cursing don't we all sometimes feel as if we need to move

227
00:44:18,079 --> 00:44:24,880
forward any way we can and that boy on the bench notice the empty seat beside

228
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:30,040
him perhaps you could sit there too in the

229
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:38,200
sun who knows what might happen next who knows what might happen next

230
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:44,000
when we put aside the stories and actually engage with life engage with

231
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:51,119
individuals engage with what's actually happening so thank you all for

232
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:58,359
