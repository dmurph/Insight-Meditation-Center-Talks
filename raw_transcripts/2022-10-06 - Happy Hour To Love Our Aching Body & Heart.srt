1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:07,759
so hello and welcome everyone glad to be with you

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:13,679
practicing together whatever the shape of your body

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,680
um might be at this point feeling well or unwell

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,779
um so I realize

5
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:33,360
excuse me um yeah there's there is one topic I had in

6
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:39,840
mind but I am I'm so touched with Mario Christine coming and and having been

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,000
unwell and still you know not so well so I want to actually talk about

8
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,480
um self-compassion especially when you're not feeling well so that's what I want to talk about and maybe may be

9
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,480
supportive to to everyone because self-compassion we can never have enough

10
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:06,240
self-compassion and um and whether you are physically right now

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,600
there's some something maybe the whole body is not feeling well maybe there's there is a part of the body that's this

12
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,540
this back ache is just keeps you know bugging you or maybe there's a pain in

13
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,119
your heart maybe there's something that ailing your heart because physical

14
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,520
pain and emotional pain are not so different really they're not so

15
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,100
different we think they are but the way to work with them

16
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:43,320
um with care with compassion um it's it's very similar in fact physical

17
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:51,720
pain working with it skillfully is a way to practice how to be with emotional pain

18
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,280
so so with that

19
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:04,799
I'll say a few words maybe the first the first thing if there

20
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:11,459
is some challenge right now it's not a challenge or difficulty in your body and you're in

21
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:18,120
your heart is to uh to relax around it it's just to

22
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:25,440
relax around it it's here it's here it's a truth of this moment

23
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:31,379
it's what's happening because of causes and conditions

24
00:02:31,379 --> 00:02:37,739
so many of them beyond your control this is what's here this is what's

25
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:43,980
present right now in this moment and

26
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,680
number two ah

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,459
as you relax as you open up to it to treat

28
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:03,379
to treat yourself and treat whatever is showing up with kindness

29
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:11,900
practicing kindness practicing kindness

30
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:17,099
practicing kindness holding with kindness

31
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:22,340
so the practice really is simple keep relaxing

32
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:30,180
opening to ah and being kind

33
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:36,540
being kind to whatever Rises

34
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:41,519
whatever pain challenge difficulty

35
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:52,500
as if you're holding holding a beloved child or or a pet

36
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:59,459
a dear being [Music]

37
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,620
I guess we'll just slip into our meditation because my

38
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:11,700
setup really has been the words of settling into

39
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:19,500
the way of being so ah if you often transition from a chair

40
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,940
to a cushion or to a different postures this is a good time

41
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:32,820
we can transition right now to a posture let's relax

42
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:36,740
maybe you need to lie down right now

43
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,560
and how can you how can I make this

44
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,940
practice period

45
00:04:52,259 --> 00:05:00,060
in nourishing one How can I

46
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:06,180
see this as a resource not as something that I should do

47
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,380
because I want to be better or this or that but something that

48
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:21,020
ah I want I want to be a way I want to be not even in something I want to do

49
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:27,600
ah how can I be how do I want to be

50
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,720
with ease with care with love

51
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:40,820
to be here for myself

52
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:51,720
to be here for myself and therefore for others

53
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:59,120
if we fill our own cup with kindness with love with care

54
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:12,199
we become more available for others when the time is right

55
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:18,660
no use running ragged trying to serve

56
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:24,440
others take care take care of this heart

57
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:42,539
just Landing in the body sitting and

58
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,900

59
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:10,879

70
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,760

71
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,180

with care

100
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,560
when we left when we hold something

101
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:49,079
the amount of energy or left in our hands

102
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,940
is equal to the weight

103
00:15:54,720 --> 00:16:00,300
if we don't meet if we don't meet what we're holding

104
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:06,660
with something heavy we hold it up there's more energy in

105
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:11,000
holy if it's light very little

106
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:20,160
our hands don't sink into the Earth and they don't push up

107
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:26,300
we meet we meet the appropriate response

108
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:31,880

109
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:43,259

112
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:06,319
under the heaviness it meets

113
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:13,280
it's appropriate the appropriate amount appropriate response

114
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:23,459
doesn't sink into despair it meets with kindness and it doesn't push up or throw away

115
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:27,380
it meets at hopes

116
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:38,580
and in this meeting in this appropriate response not pushing the way not falling

117
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:44,760

118
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:51,080
arise with meeting our challenge meeting the paying meeting

119
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:59,160

with acceptance this is how things are right now

123
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:34,159
which is very different from resignation resignation is listless it's hopeless

124
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:49,400
acceptance is upright it meets the moment

125
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,039

126
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:04,820

it's here for a reason

135
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:07,039

136
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,100

in them and um last week you know you had recommended once a while back of just the importance

211
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:04,380
of safety and I've been using the phrase may I be safe for a while and then I love how phrases

212
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:09,960
sometimes just naturally Arise My Mind a couple weeks ago you know I was just saying my may I be

213
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:15,599
safe over and over for months and then a couple weeks ago it changed

214
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:22,320
to um I am profoundly safe and all is well

215
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:29,280
and uh that's just so that's my new phrase I know not for I don't know how it got

243
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,900
to profoundly amaze me not that I don't know the power of it but it's so fresh

244
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:40,640
it's so amazing before actually leading this guided meditation there was a lot of pain in my body and and inspired by

245
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:47,220
inspired to support um I'm Murray Christine as I as I led

246
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:54,480
this practice there was this there was there's so much more ease in my own body now and towards the end the body and now

247
00:41:54,480 --> 00:42:00,599
it feels fluffy and light and easy and all the pain and hardness and tension

248
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:06,180
just feels through the the healing power of meta at least for this body has has

249
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:12,980
been eased so that's my practice report there you go okay Deborah you're on

250
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:19,880
okay uh I haven't been here for a while and I wanted to say that it's really

251
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:26,160
great to be here because it sort of bolsters uh

252
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:34,619
well it just bolsters but but I wanted to say that a lot of times I have to not listen to the side

253
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:41,099
of me that says oh these these sayings that you say to yourself are silly you know I wake up in the morning and I say

254
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:47,700
to myself I'm safe I'm what do I say I'm safe I'm loved

255
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:54,960
I'm included you know these three things I say most mornings and sometimes I think it's hokey but the

256
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:01,440
truth is it makes a difference to hear your words

257
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:06,599
and speak these kind

258
00:43:06,599 --> 00:43:12,020
statements to myself really does make a difference so

259
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:18,240
indeed exactly it it picks the difference I mean there's so many you know just I I

260
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:26,040
just can't listen just can't listen to the cynical it's the cynical voice right right it's the story of of uh you know

261
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:33,480
the the uh this the story of the two wolves um the the

262
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:40,800
uh the indigenous story of uh two wolves which the the unwholesome

263
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:46,980
one and the wholesome one which one is going to survive well which one is going to win inside you there are two wolves

264
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:52,200
inside you I'm telling the story kind of how how you know piecemeal because I'm

265
00:43:52,200 --> 00:44:00,180
guessing that all of you has heard it have heard it but but the answer is that the wisdom is the the wolf that you feed

266
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:07,260
that's the one inside that's going to to to win and so every morning you are

267
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:16,619
feeding the wholesome the kind wolf of yes I'm I am safe I am kind I am

268

269
00:44:23,819 --> 00:44:29,700

305
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:17,400
um we're like we had a nice conversation it actually reminded me of something that I hadn't connected with this but um

306
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:24,720
I was saying that I just came back from a holiday in Indonesia and we noticed on all the beds in hotels in Indonesia that

307
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:30,720
they have the long bolster pillow and so I got sort of Googling about that and

308
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:36,300
they were saying yeah look most most Indonesians in southeast Asians sleep with a bolster pillow and they they hug

309
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:41,760
it at night you know like it's a very common thing to you know and often and

310
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:48,060
then people I've posted on my group and people were commenting back from Southeast Asia saying oh yeah I can't sleep without a bolster you know we have

311
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:55,020
to have one and and so I'm shopping now for a bolster for my bed

312
00:48:55,020 --> 00:49:02,040
and anyway just it just made me think about this about loving kindness and looking after yourself and you know kind

313
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:09,540
words kind actions sweet sweet so if bolsterers is is a kind of a reminder or

314
00:49:09,540 --> 00:49:16,859
is it there's a connection to care self-care and loving cake oh nice nice thanks for sharing that well that's a

315
00:49:16,859 --> 00:49:23,400
lovely note to end on tonight so self-care loving kindness and and taking
