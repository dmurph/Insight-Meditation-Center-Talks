this week so um

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:30,000
the theme that I like to invite us to explore this week is

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,980
um the five Aggregates and I'll say a lot more about it later but for now let's just uh begin meditating together

7
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:45,440
sitting together so let's let's begin let's arrive

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:53,100
to arrive in our bodies

9
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:57,378
let's arrive in this moment in time

10
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,440
and let us let us sit with a sense of

11
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,979
Integrity on this Earth a sense of dignity

12
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:19,920
internal dignity dignified

13
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:29,000
no matter what is going on whatever the conditions of the mind and the body

14
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,680
and we meet them with a physical form

15
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,240
that is dignified

16
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:50,280
if you're sitting allowing your spine to be a straight sense of integrity

17
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,938
dignity

18
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,039
if you're lying down and standing also

19
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:11,300
letting the body have a sense of dignity in its posture

20
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,400
and while and we said with

21
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:35,099
our back straight aligned as if

22
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:41,599
an invisible string is pulling up

23
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:48,660
on our head ever so gently straight straightening aligning our

24
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:55,700
vertebrae one vertebrae at a time

25
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,360
we also want the body to be relaxed

26
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:17,580
so that the sense of uplift is not forced feels natural the body is being uplifted

27
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,040
this form and at the same time is being pulled

28
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,180
down by gravity the muscles are relaxed by gravity

29
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,640
offering their weight to the Earth

30
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:44,299
as if we have wings and have roots

31
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,099
ah and suspended with ease

32
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:32,400
inviting defeat to feel the Earth to feel the contact

33
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,919
points or sit bones to feel the contact points

34
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:52,280
hardness softness heaviness the edges

35
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,478
the sensations of aliveness

36
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,939
and inviting awareness too

37
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:34,560
hold the breath relaxing and receiving the breath in the

38
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,960
abdomen one breath at a time

39
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,479
and offering the heart the mind

40
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,139
inviting a sense of spaciousness In This Moment

41
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:24,180
so that if thoughts are arising reoccupations ruminations they come and

42
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:30,180
they go they are not like Kryptonite

43
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:36,659
locking up the mind but they come and they go they're like a river they flow there's

44
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:39,560
so much space

45
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:49,459
and the breath receiving the breath each breath

46
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,279
each in breath each out breath provides

47
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:07,100
connection to the spaciousness to the steadiness of the heart and mind

48
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,639
letting there be more awareness

49
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,420
of the body

50
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:42,380
the way this body is sitting

51
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:53,060
whatever posture this body is in bringing awareness to the posture

52
00:11:54,899 --> 00:12:00,920
the sense of preoception we have as humans

53
00:12:02,459 --> 00:12:08,060
having a sense of the internal orientation of the body in the sota's

54
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,500
identified as the body postures

55
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:25,459
know that you're sitting and breathing

56
00:12:54,779 --> 00:13:02,579
also knowing being aware that the experience of this body

57
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:08,700
internally is composed of

58
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,740
many different Sensations

59
00:13:17,820 --> 00:13:26,540
sensations of hardness softness flow

60
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,000
temperature coolness and Heat

61
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,959
pressure

62
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,899
release

63
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:16,320
letting ourselves become curious in a relaxed way let the body be relaxed the

64
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,339
heart be relaxed

65
00:14:29,639 --> 00:14:35,899
curious about the experience of this body internally

66
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:46,019
so much as a concept body and

67
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:54,139
leg but the constituents of the experience the flow of experience

68
00:14:54,540 --> 00:15:01,100
the Marvel the Marvel of the flow of experience

69
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,990
touch vibration [Music]

70
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:22,940
eat I share all of these Sensations

71
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:33,480
your heart can relax actually when we simplify we go down to the constituents

72
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:36,380
of the experience

73
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:45,440
with a sense of awe curiosity Marvel

74
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:44,059
as we turn towards the experience of

75
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:54,500
Being Human this experience of

76
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:01,760
this body in its constituents

77
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:10,280
Sensations the flow the vibrations

78
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:26,779
hardness softness temperature throughout the body

79
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:34,400
opening up making this the measure of our attention

80
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:46,559
we begin to perceive to see differently

81
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:52,280
our usual preoccupations soften

82
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:58,880
they release see for yourself the transformation

83
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:06,020
when you open up your awareness relax

84
00:20:06,020 --> 00:20:11,940
into the awareness of the Body Sensations knowing the body

85
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,840
this form

86
00:20:19,620 --> 00:20:27,559
not through interpretation of Concepts but through the elemental

87
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:32,179
experience of Sensations

88
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:45,380
no conception there's so many Sensations sensors through this body

89
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:54,260
see for yourself

90
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:07,400
art the mind can relax the body can relax

91
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:17,780
but a different way of being and seeing

92
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:23,299
as if we're gently tethering

93
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:32,179
the mind to the body to the sensations to knowing the body

94
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:47,360
eyeing the mind the busy mind to opposed

95
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:54,919
so it can settle and see differently

96
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:33,500
and as we bring this meditation period to a close

97
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:43,860
letting there be appreciation for yourself for your dear self

98
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:50,640
for having brought yourself to this meditation at this moment in time

99
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,760
planting seeds planting seeds

100
00:28:55,919 --> 00:29:03,380
and not judging how this period was whether it was distracted sleepy

101
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:10,200
or deeply concentrated or whatever not judging not attaching to outcome in

102
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:15,600
this moment but trusting that you're planting seeds

103
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:23,580
shifting turning the flow of patterns of the heart and mind

104
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,799
little by little through your intention

105
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:34,440
with gratitude for yourself and all the causes and

106
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,380
conditions that have enabled you to be a part of

107
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:45,539
this practice with the Sangha

108
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:52,159
and the community with appreciation for them and the teachings

109
00:29:54,059 --> 00:30:00,419
and all the costs and conditions again that have brought us to this point many

110
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:07,200
of them challenging of course to be human is challenging and many of them

111
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:15,240
wonderful blessings and sharing the goodness of our practice

112
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:22,399
with all things everywhere may my practice

113
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:30,000
a single moment of awareness of kindness wisdom may be of service not

114
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:35,460
just to myself definitely to myself to my loved ones

115
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:41,240
it was like no and those I don't know all things everywhere

116
00:30:42,179 --> 00:30:48,059
may my life be of benefit in ways I cannot understand

117
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:53,898
may it be of service to all beings everywhere

118
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,579
[Music]

119
00:31:12,299 --> 00:31:17,658
say everyone thanks for your practice

120
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:22,700
hello again and uh good day

121
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:32,880
so so for this week I'd like to invite us to explore the teachings on

122
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:38,399
the five Aggregates so I was thinking about what might be a good topic to uh

123
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:45,899
to discuss this week and and so many beautiful topics I've been

124
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:52,559
covered in these um 7 A.M Pacific Time teachings and and I looked back and I

125
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:58,740
saw that the five Aggregates hasn't been um discussed as a series for a long time

126
00:32:58,740 --> 00:33:06,299
for years so so and it's such a rich uh teaching and I wanted to to do my best

127
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:12,120
to bring heart to the five aggregate teaching because even the word the name

128
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:19,320
five Aggregates like what what is the aggregate thing it just seems kind of complex and and

129
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:27,000
um very heady but it's not heady it's it's um so let's let's explore so

130
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:35,640
so the five condas condos can also be translated as heaps as these five things

131
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:42,120
and these five things they are the constituents of experience they are the

132
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,720
way that um as human beings we experience the world and experience

133
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:56,820
um uh all the ways that we experience the world are through the the combination of

134
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:05,279
these five aspects of course experience could be cut up in so many different ways and this is one way to to cut the

135
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:11,398
pie so so what are the five

136
00:34:11,399 --> 00:34:17,580
um heaps what are the five heaps the the aspect of the the Heap and and the

137
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:26,398
reason so let me mention that and and I'll unpack a little bit so the five are the first one is is form

138
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:32,040
or Rupa uh internal external stuff Rupa

139
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:40,560
form um and and also notice that these go from course to to subtle so Rupa being

140
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:48,300
the more the coarsest level of of how we experience reality our reality as humans

141
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:56,339
then there is uh vedana or failing tone the feeling tone Pleasant unpleasant and

142
00:34:56,339 --> 00:35:01,680
neither unpleasant nor unpleasant neutral so the sense of

143
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:07,680
um impression this this what the the The Impressions the sense Impressions the

144
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:15,599
feeling tone the valence on the mind and the next is Sanya perception which

145
00:35:15,599 --> 00:35:23,099
is is our how we perceive um objects internally externally

146
00:35:23,099 --> 00:35:29,460
um and I'm just going to name them because each of these will go through them each uh every day

147
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:35,160
um and then sankara's um which often translate as mental

148
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:40,760
formations mental activity and the leading uh the lead being volition

149
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:45,839
intentioned relational activity volitional activities of the mind of

150
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:51,119
speech of body and the last one being Consciousness or vinyana

151
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:57,359
is the most subtle of them all so these five so today I like to spend

152
00:35:57,359 --> 00:36:04,859
more time with form or Rupa but in order to to talk a little bit about

153
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:11,880
um what Heap or kinda con the the scandas are

154
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:17,940
it's it it in in a way if you think of say

155
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:24,359
um our experience is is an amalgamation it's it's a heap It's a combination it's

156
00:36:24,359 --> 00:36:30,599
a um um it's a Gestalt It's a combination of

157
00:36:30,599 --> 00:36:37,079
of these five aspects these five aspects form our experience

158
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:44,119
so the same way in in a way we can think of say water when we talk about water

159
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:51,000
water is water and yet there is the aspect of say turbidity whether the

160
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:56,220
water is turbid or whether it's it's clear the color of it what color water

161
00:36:56,220 --> 00:37:02,940
has whether um what the temperature of the water is these different aspects of water and all

162
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:09,900
of these different dimensions and aspects of the water then how much salt salty you know whether there's sugar in

163
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:15,000
it saltiness and then the various aspects constituents so these aspects of

164
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:20,940
experience that really come together and yet we can lean into one or the other we

165
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:26,400
can really become tuned into the color of the water what color is it is it

166
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:32,160
does it have dye in it so we can lean into knowing these different aspects

167
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:40,440
these constituents of experience and instead of just seeing it as a compact

168
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:46,619
experience comp so so why many many reasons we want to do this why do we

169
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:54,119
want to to engage with this practice of seeing the different constituents of experience separating it out

170
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:59,520
foreign so very briefly

171
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:05,760
um often we take our experience as this act this aggregate this this you know

172
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,220
perhaps we're lost in our thoughts um we are overwhelmed by thoughts and

173
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:18,660
and we're ruminating and it's just kind of a it becomes a mess maybe there's body pain and the body pain becomes why

174
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:24,180
me and and everything just kind of like this actually maybe a better example is

175
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:30,240
the the sensations of a body pain then give rise to late enough feeling tone

176
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:37,200
and that gives rise to send a particular formations mental formations and our

177
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:42,599
Consciousness is perceiving in a particular way so these five Aggregates as you can see are kind of coming

178
00:38:42,599 --> 00:38:51,540
together and then the Mind rumination these mental formations can just kind of go off the rails so so pause pause right

179
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:57,000
we can actually start to see all your these if I if I get to see the

180
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:02,640
constituents of my experience for what they are for what they are

181
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:07,980
um then it it doesn't become so overwhelming and so messy all of a

182
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:13,560
sudden and also we take it a little less personally it's it's it's not

183
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:19,980
um we we have a foothold in the middle of this experience of being human it

184
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:25,980
becomes a little ah more manageable the same way that you know if you wake up in the morning and

185
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:31,619
and like I'm overwhelmed there's so much I have to do but if you actually create

186
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:37,619
your to-do list okay I need to do grocery shopping okay I need to buy this and that and that okay that's that I

187
00:39:37,619 --> 00:39:45,960
need to make you know an appointment I need to call this person okay yeah there's a sense of ah it's it's becomes

188
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:52,200
um becomes not as entangled not as entangled so

189
00:39:52,200 --> 00:40:00,180
um and of course the the five Aggregates um of these constituents of experience

190
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:07,200
um also as I mentioned we can when we lean into each and every one of them we

191
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,560
can get to see the the flow of experience as it arises and passes it's

192
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:20,160
impermanence it's in personality and it's unsatisfactory and it's in in a heartful way like oh yes there is more

193
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:25,980
freedom available there's so much more freedom than what what the the

194
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:31,079
a mind is clinging to is mere mine is fixed so

195
00:40:31,079 --> 00:40:37,800
so I um so given the time I've spent with setting the

196
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:44,040
stage of why it's interest why it's important and many other reasons this could be our long Dharma talk about five

197
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:49,859
Aggregates why it's important but I want to spend a little bit of time with the

198
00:40:49,859 --> 00:40:59,240
first one so that we can spend time with the other ones this week um so so form form or Rupa

199
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:05,400
so form internally externally the our experience

200
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:13,859
of the world is um is through um is through our pers perception Sonya

201
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:19,980
we'll get to that in a couple of days of form of form and

202
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:26,640
and consider that um the in in the teachings in the teachings

203
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:33,660
form um uh is um is talked about in terms of the four

204
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:40,020
elements and the four elements actually the four elements in many ways seem like this to

205
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:46,500
to the modern mind seem like an archaic teaching oh really like you're saying that the body and externally everything

206
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:52,800
in the world is made up of of Earth uh Earth element Water Element fire element

207
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:57,839
and and air element like that this seems so basic and I have to say that was my

208
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:04,140
perception too when I started to practice and and through years and years of practice and also um exploring

209
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:09,780
exploring scientific understanding there are many interesting corollaries that I

210
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:15,960
can see and actually I gave a long hour long talk at IMs about the four elements

211
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:22,079
practice and modern science so maybe I'll put the link in that later if anyone's interested but ever so briefly

212
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:30,480
to say that um if if we first of all if we consider that the point of this

213
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:38,220
teaching really in Buddhism is for us to get an understanding of four elements just bear bear with me for

214
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:43,740
a moment these aspects elements inside elements outside and that's also the

215
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:50,099
same thing that modern science tells us in fact Alan Lightman the well-known

216
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:57,119
um astrophysicist it has famously said that if you take every atom of your body

217
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:02,220
and if you put a if you could put a tag on it and if you could go back million

218
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:08,520
billions of years you could really see the it is Stardust it is Stardust you

219
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:13,619
know we aren't Stardust ever this is Stardust Stardust inside Stardust

220
00:43:13,619 --> 00:43:20,040
outside internal external it's just these elements there's no difference

221
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:27,060
and that to me blows my mind it Stardust this this Striker it's it's this this

222
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:33,119
um similar this yeah a kinship a form internal external

223
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:38,760
another way to relate to four elements is also um

224
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:46,040
as you know this this um if we think of the way in science or

225
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:54,720
solids and liquids and and gases and also an energy so E equals to MC squares

226
00:43:54,720 --> 00:44:00,119
there's energy and there's matter so so fire as this energy as as energy element

227
00:44:00,119 --> 00:44:08,960
and and being able to be um uh trying being transformed one way or

228
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:15,839
either energy or or matter and then so and thinking of matter as the three ways

229
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:23,040
that it shows up either as solids liquids or or or gases so it's a way to

230
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:30,300
to for us as modern um modern folks to relate to this concept of four elements inside and

231
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:37,920
outside gases and and solids and um and uh liquid inside outside and of

232
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:45,900
course energy energy and movement um inside and outside so and of course

233
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:53,940
[Music] um relationally as we experience the four elements it comes down to our our

234
00:44:53,940 --> 00:45:01,079
um uh maybe else you know I'm gonna pause here because we're out of time I'll say more about that tomorrow because there

235
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:06,260
are two ways that the four elements teachings can we can relate to both as

236
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:13,800
matter inside outside the four elements inside outside as well as our Sensations

237
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:20,339
the way we um we perceive our perception which relates to death anyway I'll say

238
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:26,880
more about that I'll just pause here so there's so much here to explore this is fun

239
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:31,980
so so thank you so much for your practice so or the invitation I wanted

240
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:38,040
to invite you today as we explored in the meditation to lean into a

241
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:43,740
constituent of your experience with the body as you move around the world as you

242
00:45:43,740 --> 00:45:49,260
feel your body as you sense the body internally externally matter form inside

243
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:55,920
form outside Stardust inside start us outside for elements in out relating to

244
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:01,500
the constituents of your experience leaning into that and see

245
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:09,480
um see how that might shift and change the way we are okay we experience the world thank you so much everyone be well

246
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:13,880
and see you tomorrow bye
