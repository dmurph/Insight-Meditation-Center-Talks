1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,799
so good morning and welcome again and I believe all the buttons and switches and

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:14,440
things are in place I was away for three weeks at the

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,880
teaching a three-week retreat at uh our Insight retreat center and uh that was

4
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,679
quite uh wonderful and I'm still somewhat with

5
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:33,239
me and this week I'll be teaching um something that uh came from that Retreat

6
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:40,600
so for me it's a little bit of a continuation of the retreat and for you maybe a little little kind of taste of

7
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:46,120
the teachings from that Retreat and

8
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:51,399
um so one of the

9
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:57,600
invaluable personal States for doing

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:04,000
meditation is confidence and of course confidence is not easy to

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:11,320
come to and um so maybe a different word from

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:16,560
the ancient tradition might be helpful and that is

13
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:24,159
certainty to meditate with certainty and the core thing certainty

14
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:30,400
that uh that the tradition emphasizes is not exactly what you you

15
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:36,640
do but how you do it we do our practice with

16
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:45,439
confidence we do our confidence focusing on practicing in a way that

17
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:52,560
benefits us that nourishes us and to have certainty about the value

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,399
of doing that as opposed to maybe unconsciously

19
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:05,560
having certainty the value of doubting oneself or criticizing oneself or

20
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,680
feeling inadequate in some kind of way the rumination the repetition of

21
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:18,319
thoughts and attitudes toward ourself that undermine what we're doing uh can

22
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:24,879
be quite uh uh quite pervasive and difficult and the idea is to come to a

23
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,920
way finding understanding the teaching in such a way that even in the simp

24
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:37,319
simplest way that uh no matter what the background what the past experiences we

25
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:43,440
have we can have some confidence in the value of showing

26
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:50,599
up in a clear way for this moment for this

27
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:56,720
experience whatever the P however the past expresses itself in this

28
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:03,680
moment it's this moment that we want to have confidence in how we meet

29
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:12,680
it to meet it in a way that does not undermine ourselves does not um deflate

30
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:21,200
us and so to sit with some evoking some Inner

31
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:29,400
Strength some inner certainty in the value of seeing knowing

32
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,000
what's Happening Here and Now in a way that is not

33
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:40,319
deflating that is maybe even nourishing or

34
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:47,920
meaningful so assuming a meditation posture and this idea of sitting with

35
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:55,319
certainty or confidence can begin with a posture so even though it can be very

36
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,840
difficult to call upon confidence sometimes

37
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:09,280
assuming a confident posture will begin calling on

38
00:04:09,319 --> 00:04:16,639
that so with a certain certainty about the value of being here and

39
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:22,160
now having a posture that feels

40
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,440
grounded on here the hear that is supporting your

41
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:38,160
way the contact against the cushion the chair the bed the

42
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:44,960
floor where the weight of your body settles here on this

43
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:51,120
spot to know with confidence to know with

44
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:57,120
certainty that here you are in this

45
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,639
place on this little place

46
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,680
that supports your

47
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:15,840
weight taking a few deep

48
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,759
relaxed inhales as you

49
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:30,120
exhale relax into this place let your body settle

50
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:48,919
as you breathe in Let The Filling of the

51
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:57,000
lungs also be a filling of yourself with confidence in the

52
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,639
Simplicity of being here

53
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:20,160
now and then to let your breathing return to

54
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:32,039
normal and there's a way of relaxing the body where there's a confidence or

55
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:37,880
certainty in the value of softening in the

56
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:45,599
body that this is a good thing that this is a way to be more here

57
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:52,160
in your body as you exhale to soften the muscles

58
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,599
of your face

59
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:07,639
as you exhale to soften the

60
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:21,400
shoulders exhaling softening the belly

61
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:35,319
exhaling and softening the whole

62
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:43,440
body relaxing any ways in which you're bracing yourself against life

63
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,680
as you exhale softening the

64
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,200
Mind relaxing the thinking

65
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:45,399
mind with certainty or confidence that the mind works

66
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:53,600
better when it's relaxed soft

67
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,959
and then to settle into your

68
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:31,959
breathing relying on the simplest most direct

69
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:37,600
way that you can feel your body

70
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:43,800
breathing if it's difficult to feel your breathing you might put your hand on

71
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:50,959
your belly or your chest to feel the movements there

72
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:07,240
with the idea of keeping meditation radically

73
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:15,040
simple let yourself have confidence that you're able

74
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,800
to know the present

75
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:26,320
moment simply you can know

76
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:34,120
breathing in whatever way is obvious for you for you but have confidence that that keeps

77
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,720
you in the

78
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:56,519
present knowing feeling the body breathing

79
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:07,040
and having confidence in the value of doing

80
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:14,880
that without any harshness aversion

81
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:22,920
or without doubt or that the knowing itself can be free

82
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:26,200
of anxiety

83
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:38,959
find a way to know

84
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:52,200
simply having confidence in the value of the simple

85
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,200
knowing of the

86
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,240
present

87
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160

seeing if you can practice with a calm

certainty with a calm

104
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:25,960
assurance that calmly being present for the Simplicity of this

105
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:32,840
moment is enough nothing to figure out nothing to plan

106
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:39,158
nothing to fix just being

107
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:46,640
present here and now in a kind

108
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:54,840
way in a non-critical way in a way that doesn't

109
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,600
deflate to be mindful in a way

110
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:11,880
that we're nourished by the confidence of in simple

111
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
knowing

112
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520

e e

116
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,240
and then as we come to to the end of the

117
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:39,398
sitting to take a gentle deeper

118
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:45,759
breaths to feel and sense here and

119
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:54,640
now to find a way to sense and feel and know here and

120
00:25:54,640 --> 00:26:00,039
now in a simple Gentle Way

121
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:03,360
Simple Kind

122
00:26:06,679 --> 00:26:14,080
way where we allow ourselves to be present to the Simplicity of the

123
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:26,520
moment maybe calmly and in a way that feels

124
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:34,080
good for whole whole system our whole nervous system just

125
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:40,399
here allowing ourselves to be the way they are the way we

126
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:47,240
are confident in this value of Simply

127
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:58,480
knowing and having confidence in the value of being present for others in

128
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:07,200
simple ways be present to listen to

129
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:14,120
see to experience others without the filters of our emotions

130
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:19,080
and agendas and preferences and

131
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:29,799
fears to be present with others that allows them to relax allows

132
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:36,559
them to feel at ease with us so perhaps some deeper part of who

133
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:46,440
that they are has a chance to surface may it be that this practice we

134
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:54,158
do gives us the ability to set others at

135
00:27:55,000 --> 00:28:00,760
ease may it be that it brings forth makes room

136
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,919
for the capacity that others have to feel

137
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:10,600
happy safe

138
00:28:11,399 --> 00:28:17,320
peaceful and free may all

139
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,960
beings be happy may all beings be

140
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:29,960
safe may all beings be peaceful

141
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,679
and may all beings be

142
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:53,799
free thank

143
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:01,080
you e

144
00:29:54,399 --> 00:30:01,039
just a minute here for

145
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:59,039
so again being Rusty from this technological process of being on

146
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:05,360
YouTube I one more thing I had to do and that was to plug in my laptop I used to

147
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,360
see you all

148
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:17,720
chats so welcome on this Monday morning to a new week of

149
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:24,320
um on a new theme for our practice together and it's not exactly a new

150
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:31,279
theme since there have been times before that I taught on this this and it's a common topic for vasna teachers to teach

151
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:37,080
on and that is the five hindrances and uh I'll be teaching it

152
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:42,720
differently than how it's normally taught perhaps and uh for one thing I'll teach

153
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,840
it uh in reverse order the five hindrances the order is usually sensual

154
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:54,960
desire ill will uh usually called sloth and torper

155
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,960
the third one fourth one restlessness and regrets and the last one is usually

156
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:08,559
called doubt so I'll start with the last one and the reference point for all these

157
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:15,039
hindrances will have a common reference point and that is that of homeness and

158
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:20,120
UNH wholesomeness skillfulness and unskillfulness that topic of my Dharma

159
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:25,760
talk yesterday morning Sunday morning at IMC that um maybe in some ways was an

160
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:32,880
introduction for this week and um and I'll be teaching uh the first

161
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:39,960
three of these uh sessions this week and then um I'm traveling on Thursday

162
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:45,159
morning and I'm very happy that Kim Allen will follow up and finish the

163
00:32:45,159 --> 00:32:51,120
series and um so uh um and then Kim will

164
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:59,559
also be teaching next week while I'm away so I'm delighted that this wonderful teacher will be here with you

165
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:08,519
so the five usually called the five hindrances the poly word for them are

166
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:15,960
called the five coverings that's what the word means literally that's something that covers over something and

167
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:22,240
covers over and kind of hides or covers over and makes inaccessible and

168
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:28,720
um and so the question is what is it covering over what is inaccessible and one way of

169
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:33,840
understanding it is that the five hindrances in and of themselves in order

170
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:41,840
to be hindrances and uh are un wholesome unhealthy unsupportive for a good life

171
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:49,360
for spiritual life and um and so uh they're un wholesome

172
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:55,039
unhelpful and so what they cover over is the wholesome they cover over what's

173
00:33:55,039 --> 00:34:00,679
healthy for us they cover over what's beneficial and uh for a good life for a

174
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:07,000
spiritual life in particular they cover over our capacity to have be settled and

175
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:13,839
unified to have a sense of being present in a in a holistic way in a way that we

176
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:20,760
feel fully here um that in a way that uh has has qualities of Freedom has

177
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:27,398
qualities of Peace because we're not divided in ourselves we're not covering something over there's a place for all

178
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:34,760
of who who we are to be here in a but not but he to uh to be here in a way

179
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:42,520
that is supportive that's nourishing that's Health producing and so some of this has to do

180
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:47,800
with how we show up for ourselves how we meet our experience in the moment so not

181
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:54,960
just ourselves but how we meet the world and to meet them with these so-called hindrances is to meet the world in

182
00:34:54,960 --> 00:35:01,000
unhealthy ways and um and there might be things that are uh

183
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,280
close kin to each of them that uh sometimes is confused with the

184
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:12,359
hindrances um so not all desire is a hindrance not all aversion is a

185
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:19,520
hindrance if we understand aversion to be an averting a turning away from something which is harmful for us or

186
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:25,040
doing something which is harmful there's a healthy way of doing that and um and

187
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:30,680
there's healthy doubt if we translate the last one as out so what makes the

188
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:37,960
the hindrance is this unhealthy quality and so certainly there can be a way in which we relate to ourselves to

189
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:45,160
our experience and to the world to others uh we're in the grip of um uh

190
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:50,800
Greed for pleasure Greed for sensual pleasure Greed for the things of the

191
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:58,480
world uh Greed for meditation experiences and if that uh and the greed

192
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,520
itself if you really feel it it feels like it's it it's grading for the Deep

193
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:10,520
life deep inner part of who we are it's grading for the the heart there it

194
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:15,599
creates strain and tension and it contributes to a division within us

195
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,839
because we're overemphasizing an object of Desire rather than opening up to the

196
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:29,240
wholeness of who we are and having some kind of healthy desire surface from that wholeness

197
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:35,720
uh ill will uh is a very intense form of uh wanting of

198
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:43,119
hostility and uh wanting to harm it could be towards ourselves it could be towards our experience it could be

199
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:51,960
towards uh the people around us it can be to the world some people carry with them a lowgrade hostility that uh

200
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:58,640
pervades everything they see and touch and do and if you're really attuned to the

201
00:36:58,640 --> 00:37:04,359
to it then we can feel how that's UNH wholesome even though sometimes desire

202
00:37:04,359 --> 00:37:11,960
for example has a joy and delight and promise in it even though ill will sometimes has a

203
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:17,440
certain pleasure of power of strength of righteousness in it that gives it a

204
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,920
sense of Vitality if you really pay attention to these deeply they feel it

205
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,800
can feel how they harm ourselves they uh

206
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:36,280
they nurture us they diminish us they divide us so the same is true for the other

207
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:42,079
three and um and so uh here the reference point I'm trying to use is

208
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:49,240
wholesome and UNH wholesome uh skillful and unskillful healthy and unhealthy for us and this is something that hopefully

209
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,440
we can feel for ourselves and uh in similar almost in a

210
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:00,160
seat or in a sematic way you don't have to think your way into recognizing how

211
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:06,280
it's unhealthy you it's clear so it's uh it's the way you would maybe feel if

212
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:11,800
you're really parched and thirsty and you're able to drink a nice refreshing

213
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:18,280
cool glass of water and and with that something begins changing in your mouth

214
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:26,160
in your arms in your whole body as the as the water begins coursing through your body and uh and nourishing you and

215
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:34,400
something begins to shift and change and that refreshment that tingling that goodness that can come or if you've been

216
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:41,480
really cold and you stand in the sun you can feel the goodness of the body warming up and you feel this kind of

217
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:48,119
pervasive uh saturation of beginning the warmth in the extremities maybe or in the skin and coming

218
00:38:48,119 --> 00:38:53,520
in sometimes uh being hungry uh eating a good healthy

219
00:38:53,520 --> 00:39:01,640
meal and starting to feel how that we get revived uh and this kind of good feeling of of

220
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:07,720
kind of energy coming back in a nice clear way getting a good nap and uh

221
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:15,520
waking up in a very clear way that it's the whole body it's you can't pinpoint exactly the refreshment how refreshed

222
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:20,560
the body is but there is a re there is a clear way the body feels just better and

223
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:29,000
awake and clear and has kind of a simple energy that's very nice in it so um so

224
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:34,480
this inner sematic reference point uh that can be in the body as a whole in

225
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:39,560
the heart and it can even be in the mind in a somatic almost

226
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:46,280
way so then we come to the the the starting with the fifth one which is um

227
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:52,240
usually translated as doubt uh the U poly word literally means

228
00:39:52,240 --> 00:40:00,920
uncertainty uh vacillation indecisiveness and um and so and and of

229
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:08,720
course in this complicated world of ours there's a lot of things that we don't know and so we can be indecisive we can

230
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:16,359
be uncertain about things but uh uh in the classic kind of definition of uh

231
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:25,040
this hindrance it's indecisiveness or uncertainty about how we can live from a

232
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:32,720
wholesome place so there might me many things we don't know what to do many things we don't understand but how we

233
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:39,119
are with the uncertainty of Life the ordinary uncertainty uh we meet it with

234
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:45,520
certainty that we see the value of coming from a wholesome Place coming

235
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:54,480
from a a u healthy place from us within and so uh the letting go of

236
00:40:54,480 --> 00:41:01,200
uncertainty the challenges of living in uncertain certain tentative life and indecisive life not committing to

237
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:08,119
anything and um certainly having doubt about what to do and not to do um can be

238
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:15,240
quite draining quite debilitating sometimes it freezes people to you know not act at all and do

239
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:24,240
anything for a long period of time but the idea in that as a hindrance is to turn more deeply in because we as

240
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:30,839
a practitioners there's always something healthy we can do uh it's the how we're

241
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:39,079
aware the how we meet um the um uh our experience so if we're

242
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:45,920
uncertain about you know something then uh what to do we maybe uncertain about

243
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:51,040
how to fix our like today I had to fix some of this technology and uncertain

244
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,520
how to do it uh uh it could be frazzled could be afraid could be angry all these

245
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:02,319
things can come that are Den nourishing in but if we have confidence

246
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:08,839
in the value of what is wholesome that how we go about addressing the issue um

247
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:14,800
let's do it in a Wholesome Way in a way that we meet it with a calm presence a

248
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:21,559
kind presence a clear presence that we don't succumb to ill will we don't

249
00:42:21,559 --> 00:42:27,760
succumb to anxiety these things might happen for sure um but but the idea is

250
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:34,839
not to Center ourselves on them so we live a divided life but a mindful life

251
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:40,839
is a mindful life that opens up to the whole recognizes what's there but in the

252
00:42:40,839 --> 00:42:45,960
recognizing of it the recognition is not anxious the recognition has no aversion

253
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:52,599
in it the recognition isn't ruminating about what I should do the

254
00:42:52,599 --> 00:42:58,160
recognition is always very simple this is what's happening this is what happening

255
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:03,720
and I can't tell you how many times in my life um I've been uncertain about

256
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:09,200
what to do and uh rather than being caught up and walking around in circles

257
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:16,440
trying to figure out something in a way that didn't actually allow for the creativity and the intelligence to work

258
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:21,640
properly I've gone to sit down to meditate and sometimes just meditating

259
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:28,079
for 10 minutes enough for me that then then the Mind begins to organize gather

260
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:34,800
settle be be here and there's in that calm settled mind then that I'm that

261
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:40,520
I've confidence in then I can find my way better with

262
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:47,440
the issues of my life so um to let go of

263
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:57,119
uncertainty the uncertainty of how to be how to show up and to um when then the Buddha says

264
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:02,599
having let go of uncertainty one dwells having overcome

265
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:08,520
uncertainty without indecision about wholesome

266
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:16,400
States one cleanses the Mind from ruminating about how one should respond

267
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:23,040
how one should do things um so

268
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:29,240
ruminating but one has confidence in the wholesome the how we

269
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:37,359
meet the simplest way what's here even if we don't know in the bigger picture what needs to be done we can always be

270
00:44:37,359 --> 00:44:42,599
confident about the value of not diminishing ourselves not undermining

271
00:44:42,599 --> 00:44:50,480
ourselves deflating ourselves by an UNH Wholesome Way of relating to what is

272
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:58,319
difficult so um thank you and um tomorrow's hindrance will be

273
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:04,000
restlessness and regrets anxiety and regrets and

274
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:09,760
uh and we'll go on so thank you very very much

275
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,480
and may this day be a day where you

276
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:23,040
find a way to be certain to be confident in the Val in showing up how

277
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:30,480
you meet the situation and uh rather than getting swept away by the uncertainty

278
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:37,359
that you might have so thank you and
