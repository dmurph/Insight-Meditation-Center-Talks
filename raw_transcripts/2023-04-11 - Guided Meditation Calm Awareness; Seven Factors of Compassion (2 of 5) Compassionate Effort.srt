1
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:08,360
so good morning everyone and welcome from

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:15,139
imc's Insight Retreat Center and

3
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,619
and welcome also to this week where the topic is compassion

4
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:30,420
so these guided meditations are related to that or pointing towards that or laying down

5
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:37,079
the foundation for it so someone says they hear a very loud hiss

6
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:42,239
and I wonder if other people are you hearing ecstatic or hiss or

7
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:47,420
that's a problem or is it maybe that person's device

8
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:56,059
and uh so no his no hiss okay

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:01,379
there someone says yes yes to his no static yes well

10
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:08,939
some people have a hiss and some don't yes it's loud it's a

11
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:13,979
so no his interesting um some people might have that volume

12
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:21,060
turned up louder because they need to hear better and um we could try to try to do something

13
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:28,560
right we could try to change back to them which one

14
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,040
so we're going to try to turn something back here um if you

15
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,820
we turn the two back to the to the Mac or to the country's

16
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,640
to MacBook so let's see if this works better

17
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:57,540
and uh so um

18
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,979
okay so now is the hiss there I have to wait

19
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,680
better better better no hiss great okay so we're all using these new

20
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,319
devices here and trying to figure out how to make them all connect nicely

21
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:23,840
so maybe we'll start over

22
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,959
so then welcome you again to Insight Retreat

23
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:39,500
Center where I'm teaching this week and um I feel I feel very kind of uh

24
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:46,319
I don't know what the right word is cozy comforted with the topic for this week it has to do with compassion

25
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:52,680
and um uh the

26
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:58,920
and these morning meditations this week that are meant to be kind of a foundation for compassion that supports

27
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,700
it so for this day I want to emphasize calm

28
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:10,920
and to say that there's always a choice maybe it's not easy to find the choice

29
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,800
but there's always a choice to have a certain kind of calm when we meditate

30
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:24,480
in the calm I want to emphasize today is calm awareness calm recognition

31
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,519
come feeling what's going on sensing what's happening

32
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:34,620
calm observing what's happening there's some capacity in the different

33
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:41,819
forms of awareness that we use in this mindfulness practice to let that become

34
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:47,220
even if it were being aware of is agitation

35
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:53,159
so there's there's a moment a place a little location somewhere in the field

36
00:03:53,159 --> 00:04:00,060
of in the place where we're from that that is calmly recognizes agitation

37
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:05,819
so if there's a recognition then the mind would either verbally or

38
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:13,920
in some or Silent Way would have a clear but calm recognition agitation

39
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,459
agitation is present they um

40
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:25,979
the if there is um discomfort anywhere

41
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:34,139
we would recognize discomfort if the if the place of calm awareness is

42
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:39,419
a little bit more embodied like it almost feels like this feeling the body

43
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:45,419
can sense and feel discomfort or agitation then feel that with the calm

44
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:50,940
that's the place of for them to mindfulness if there's more a sense of being The

45
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:56,100
Observer a little bit removed from the experience stepping back in a sense and

46
00:04:56,100 --> 00:05:03,840
just observing that's and that's where calm is then take that backward step and observe the experience

47
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:12,600
if it's most common to be intimate with the experience really close in then really touch the experience softly

48
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,680
maybe likely but really be close if it's more calm to step back and have a bird's

49
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:25,758
eye view of it then um the

50
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:33,240
the do that so see if you can experiment with whatever is happening to have a

51
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:40,699
calm awareness so assuming an upright posture

52
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:45,740
and gently closing your

53
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,620
your eyes

54
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,020
foreign

55
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:30,660
to just be aware of how you are calmly

56
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:36,020
is there some way of just matter-of-factly recognizing how you are

57
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:44,000
in the most obvious way that is calm

58
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,800
a calm knowing

59
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,039
a calm sensing

60
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:11,539
and with that calmness be aware of your breathing

61
00:07:13,139 --> 00:07:19,400
and now take a maybe two or three long slow deep breaths

62
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,539
relaxing as you exhale

63
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,599
settling in

64
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,979
then letting your breathing return to normal

65
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,360
and settle into your breathing becoming aware of your breathing

66
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,880
and if your breathing is in any way uncomfortable

67
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:43,320
be calmly aware of the discomfort the uncomfortable

68
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:48,899
breathing maybe without having a need for it to be

69
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:51,800
any different way

70
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:21,060
if your breathing is comfortable easeful

71
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,980
know that calmly

72
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:02,720
if if there is discomfort in your body

73
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:09,019
it's tense or aches in some way hurts

74
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,440
know that calmly

75
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:20,959
and this calm knowing calm awareness

76
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,420
might be fleeting it might just last a moment or two with

77
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:34,100
and let yourself be content with that that's enough

78
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:38,180
and then do it again

79
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:30,860
if you're if your mind is uncomfortable you're agitated with your thoughts

80
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:36,320
know that calmly

81
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,660
calm recognition this is how it is

82
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:05,899
if you have emotions which are challenging you who are uncomfortable

83
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:14,959
know that calmly a Tranquility of awareness

84
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:55,759
as you're aware of your breathing finding a way to be calmly aware

85
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:06,418
maybe even comingly aware aware so something

86
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:11,240
becomes more peaceful tranquil

87
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:44,600
if you're agitated be aware of that calmly

88
00:17:46,679 --> 00:17:53,299
being aware in a way in a way that is calming for yourself

89
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:49,260
as you're aware of breathing Body Mind

90
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:56,940
whatever you're aware of if you can be aware of it calmly

91
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:59,940
lightly

92
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:07,520
can you find in the middle of that or next to it

93
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:15,440
some care some motivation or imposter care or have compassion

94
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:25,039
the simplest form of compassion for now it doesn't need to do anything

95
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,039
Who air with calm compassion

96
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:47,780
where with tranquil love even of what is difficult Here and Now

97
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:47,900
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

98
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:58,399
to consider for a moment or field for a moment

99
00:26:59,159 --> 00:27:08,240
The Compassion that might be a companion of calm or tranquility

100
00:27:09,179 --> 00:27:17,159
a Compassion or love that has no room when the mind is

101
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:24,360
agitated in a hurry reactive

102
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:32,720
the simplest form of care

103
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:55,320
and if you were going to live this day with care with compassion

104
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:02,960
that came from being calm calm compassion compassionate calmness

105
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,520
how might you live your day differently

106
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:20,580
how might you live your day informed

107
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:26,299
by a calm love calm compassion

108
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:30,620
compassionate calm

109
00:28:54,360 --> 00:29:05,220
would you live differently if you were informed by Compassion Care

110
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:09,080
love or kindness

111
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:16,100
live differently in their small details of your life

112
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,159
who are in the large

113
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,200
areas of your life

114
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:51,059
and may our care for the world somehow be carried out into the world

115
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:57,779
on these World these words may all beings

116
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:04,500
be happy may all beings be saved

117
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,659
may all beings be peaceful

118
00:30:09,659 --> 00:30:21,809
may all beings be free [Music]

120
00:30:35,180 --> 00:30:41,899
[Music] thank you

121

foreign

122
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:08,779
so the topic of this week is the seven factors of compassion

123
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:16,980
and how these seven factors follow in the wake of compassion that we live in a

124
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:22,380
compassionate way and we find that in the wake of that or together with that

125
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:29,220
there comes a form of awareness mindfulness there comes a

126
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:35,340
a quality of investigation that we do kind of distinguish

127
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:43,020
and for compassion we distinguish between suffering and the absence of suffering in all the different ways that

128
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:48,659
we call you know distress or feeling emotionally challenged or things are

129
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:54,360
difficult that um compassion is based on the recognition

130
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,840
of suffering whether it's mild or big it's a recognition

131
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,120
and that recognition involves a distinction between the

132
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:13,440
suffering and the possibility of the absence of suffering and so with this come with Compassionate

133
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,140
Care um there becomes a sense of awareness or

134
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:24,539
attention to what's happening because compassion is you know is has an

135
00:33:24,539 --> 00:33:30,840
object or has a way of living or a way of attending to the world

136
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,720
and then um and part of that attending is to make of is the compassionate nature of

137
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:43,860
compassion is to see a distinction between suffering and the absence of it

138
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:50,580
and this is the fundamental distinction that Buddhism is about it lives and it grows and develops and

139
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:57,000
flowers out of making this distinction because with this distinction it's possible to move towards greater and

140
00:33:57,000 --> 00:34:02,039
greater Freedom greater absence of suffering freedom from suffering

141
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:08,220
and so it's there is a deeper and a more more sensitive attention to suffering

142
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:13,618
when we do this practice and some of the coarser suffering might go

143
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:21,060
away but it becomes a more acute sensitivity to smaller and smaller or deeper and deeper ways and that's not a

144
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:27,378
mistake that's the way of doing house cleaning to kind of clean the house and and

145
00:34:27,379 --> 00:34:34,138
clean things up in a sense with that distinction and so all of

146
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:40,320
Buddhism can be seen as a rising out of the impetus to compassion it's so

147
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:46,800
Central to the whole Enterprise of Buddhism the whole religion of Buddhism and sometimes that compassion takes the

148
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:53,419
form of kindness and friendliness or they're they're kind of part of a mixture of care

149
00:34:53,419 --> 00:35:01,140
and so sometimes it's not exactly compassion that's in the Forefront but kindness the friendliness

150
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:12,119
a sense of care for people for ourselves as this uh unfolds then there's a we see

151
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:18,839
the distinction between suffering and the absence of it then comes effort

152
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:27,500
comes the desire to do something to make a change so from this guided meditation we did

153
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:34,560
um the change there that was emphasized was that becoming calmly aware

154
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:41,400
so we can suffer and we can just kind of suffer unapologetically just you know just be

155
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:46,920
living in the suffering really kind of captivated by our

156
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:56,400
suffering fully inhabiting it or we could in a sense step away from it

157
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:03,300
and be aware of it calmly it involves a little bit of disidentification with the suffering

158
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:10,079
like it's my suffering and I'm suffering but to step away and say oh they're suffering here

159
00:36:10,079 --> 00:36:16,020
and to calmly be aware and then that calm awareness

160
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:21,300
to see it more clearly and one of the things we see we see that

161
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:26,460
they're suffering and there's something which is not suffering so much the calm awareness

162
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:31,740
that's an important distinction and with that distinction we then were

163
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:38,520
able to choose more often that which is not suffering the calm awareness it's not getting rid of the suffering

164
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:44,540
it's not still there it's not just fixing it it's not

165
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:51,000
condemning it's not ignoring it but if it's meeting it from a place where we're

166
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:57,060
not identified with it or we're not kind of glued to it and this is a powerful thing of

167
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:05,640
compassion this ability to see clearly and calmly if the compassion is not calm it might

168
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:12,780
not really be compassion it might be distress that we're feeling so the importance of finding that calm

169
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:19,800
place is not easy to do but it's worthwhile to do and it's possible to do

170
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,859
and maybe the for some of us the easiest place might be in the mindfulness itself

171
00:37:25,859 --> 00:37:32,339
in the awareness itself so the mindfulness factor of compassion

172
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:39,359
with the mindful inspector factor of compassion we see these distinction better between suffering and the absence

173
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:46,140
of it we see a kind of a distinction there just a with that as we start seeing this

174
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:54,180
distinction and the possibility of being without suffering then comes the effort the effort factor

175
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:59,400
of compassion the the engagement the activity of

176
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:04,560
moving towards or coming close to or giving yourself giving ourselves over to

177
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:12,200
that place where there is less suffering to do that which decreases the suffering

178
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:20,520
and for if we kind of build on what's Happening already a place of less suffering is not getting

179
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:26,480
rid of the suffering but is a heightened at impact capacity for attention

180
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:32,460
awareness can kind of Blossom become stronger while the

181
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:37,680
suffering is there and maybe the suffering doesn't get any better

182
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:44,220
but mindfulness awareness gets stronger which creates a very different context

183
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:50,220
as awareness gets stronger then maybe we can identify or live more in the

184
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:56,119
awareness than we live in this suffering so it's a very significant thing to say

185
00:38:56,119 --> 00:39:03,119
that the suffering doesn't have to go away it's being it's being replaced in a

186
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:08,280
sense or the Ecology of the Mind heart is being changed but we're bringing in

187
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:15,119
something that's stronger or larger more significant to be next to it or be part of it or be

188
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:20,700
around it and that's the capacity to be aware to wake up to the middle of it

189
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:26,400
and um and uh and to be able to shift the paradigm

190
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:32,220
from needing to get rid of suffering to becoming bigger than the suffering or

191
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:37,859
become resting in a place where it's peaceful to look on the suffering that's

192
00:39:37,859 --> 00:39:44,160
a radical thing to do so that's living this this the investigation Factor the distinction

193
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:51,720
factor of compassion and then the natural effort to engage to

194
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:59,220
activity to keep practicing to do something about it so yesterday I used the example of a

195
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:06,599
little girl who's got hurt on the playground with a scraped knee and there's compassion in the adult

196
00:40:06,599 --> 00:40:13,740
who's going to care for her and of course the adult puts effort into care for the child it brings the

197
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:19,200
Band-Aid brings the the water to clean the wound and does it very carefully and

198
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:25,260
the engagement is one of care and love but it is engagement it is effort being put in

199
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:31,820
but that effort doesn't feel like work The Compassion is is a motivating force

200
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:39,359
for a relaxed easy maybe in a certain kind of way non-self-centered

201
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:47,099
effort an effort that's here to make things better

202
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:54,180
and part of the difficulty people have with the concept of effort is some people make effort which has suffering

203
00:40:54,180 --> 00:41:00,200
embedded in it they're straining they're pushing they're expecting their

204
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:06,660
anxious they're disappointed they're hesitant they're

205
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:12,300
feel hopeless in the effort what is it so then we come back to this

206
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:19,320
whole compassion oh there's the suffering be mindful suffering is in the effort

207
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:25,020
itself part of the reason to make effort is to

208
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:30,240
discover how the effort is off and then to see that distinction and

209
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:35,339
then in the seeing of it began in kind of finding a way engaging in a process

210
00:41:35,339 --> 00:41:43,260
the engaging the effort to find effort that is calm find effort that is engaged

211
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:51,300
but not agitated find effort which is engaged in doing what needs to be done but has

212
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:56,940
no strain in it that's caring that's loving that's present

213
00:41:56,940 --> 00:42:02,280
so the suggestion is that um this is a natural

214
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:08,400
in the wake of compassion in the wake of caring and it was feeling

215
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:13,800
a sense of care for something in the wake of kindness feeling kindness for

216
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:21,839
something in the wake of love feeling love for something that there is starting to make

217
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:27,119
distinctions the investigation Factor and from that comes a certain kind of

218
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:32,720
effort so um

219
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:39,540
and they're the big efforts would be to go out and save the world to go out and really trying to help someone who's

220
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:48,480
suffering that's a beautiful thing to do an important thing to do but maybe as an as a way of uh kind of

221
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:54,839
really discovering the compassion informed effort

222
00:42:54,839 --> 00:43:02,160
that includes compassion for oneself compassion for the very effort we make

223
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:07,740
maybe today we should not be in a hurry to be compassionate for the world but

224
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:15,060
have the compassion really be towards yourself uh to to these factors to not even to

225
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:23,400
yourself but to the particular ways in which your mind hearts are operating

226
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:29,220
in the way that you're aware are you aware in a way that's stressful

227
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:37,020
or demanding or expectant uh or can you be aware in a calm way

228
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:43,560
are you making distinctions are you seeing the challenges you have but building on that challenges or you're

229
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:48,900
judging yourself and being upset with things or can you find a way to see that

230
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:56,400
making simple distinctions between suffering and the absence of it really is a path to Freedom

231
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,859
and then as you engage in this practice and practice with all this the effort part

232
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:08,160
have compassion or care for that can you recognize there where there's strain and suffering

233
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:14,220
to do this very personal work sets the stage for

234
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:22,640
bringing a healthy form of compassion into the world and for others so we're laying down the foundation here

235
00:44:23,220 --> 00:44:28,260
so um thank you and um

236
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:35,520
and I'll be here for the week at the IRC so I'm happy to be here and as I said uh yesterday I think I look

237
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:41,280
forward to the chance to show you the meditation Hall on maybe the last day here and we can zoom out a little bit

238
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:48,859
and scan it for you to see let's see what's here so thank you
