1
00:00:00,719 --> 00:00:03,199
so

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,480
the 11th step of mindfulness of

3
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:07,919
breathing

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,200
is breathing in one concentrates

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,840
breathing out one concentrates

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,800
concentrates the mind

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,520
and so this relates to the whole topic

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:21,359
of samadhi

9
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,240
in buddhism words often translated as

10
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,800
concentration

11
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,080
and and we're

12
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,600
spending more days on this step

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,800
because uh the samadhi

14
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,600
is such an important foundation for the

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,120
final steps of

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,000
mindfulness of breathing and we don't

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
want to rush through this

18
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,039
ideally you're kind of coming along a

19
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:50,079
little bit

20
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:52,320
following just enough getting a sense or

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,920
feel for what we're

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,719
what these steps are about that you have

23
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,879
some inner reference point for what

24
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,000
we're doing as we continue going on even

25
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
though the next steps are getting to

26
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,280
very kind of more classically are

27
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:09,600
describing deeper and deeper states of

28
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,680
meditation

29
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,119
the these 16 steps are also relevant

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,720
um on well short of deep states of

31
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,680
meditation you

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,200
think we kind of can go through them

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,080
even in relatively ordinary states

34
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,320
and recognize kind of little shifts that

35
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,400
represent these different states so

36
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:31,520
i'm hoping there's enough by going slow

37
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,040
enough that uh

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,920
that um you know you're you can follow

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,520
enough so we're spending more time with

40
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,439
samadhi

41
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,680
and so

42
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,920
i've already said some of this that the

43
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,360
the word in this 16 stages for

44
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,079
concentrate has also been translated as

45
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,360
steady

46
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,520
and i like to translate it as unify

47
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:00,000
unific to unify the mind

48
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,200
or or steady the mind or

49
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,720
stabilize the mind the word is

50
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:12,080
uh and the

51
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,680
the verb adati means to um

52
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,720
to play something so it's like placing

53
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,760
the placing the mind placing awareness

54
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,200
on the object that we're

55
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,360
focusing on so placing it on the

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,480
breathing

57
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:28,879
i love the expression landing just

58
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:30,000
landing on it

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,720
and just kind of gently landing like a

60
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,599
like little

61
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,680
helicopter held a drone or something or

62
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,599
like a bird that comes in and just kind

63
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,319
of

64
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,120
i guess it flies in almost stops in in

65
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,920
the air

66
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,280
inch or so above the ground and then

67
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,959
just

68
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,040
lands on the ground so we come right in

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,480
there we land

70
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:53,200
and um and settle place ourselves

71
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,560
the i'm very fond of uh

72
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,680
using the word compose composure

73
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,760
as this we're composing ourselves on the

74
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,879
breathing

75
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:05,120
and that samadhi is an act of composing

76
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,920
ourselves

77
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,760
because of the word pose also means to

78
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,440
place or to stand

79
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,319
someplace so we're taking a stand and

80
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,040
resting in there

81
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,120
and um and um

82
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,239
to settle to study are all these words

83
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:24,560
associated with samadhi

84
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,440
and um now samadhi itself is often

85
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,080
translated as concentration but it

86
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,319
more generally means meditation or a

87
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:33,200
state

88
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,480
that we're in a state of mind that we're

89
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,200
in that

90
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,879
can be many different states where we're

91
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,480
quite settled and steady

92
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,440
and peaceful and and i wanted to read

93
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,159
you

94
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,360
very early uh commentary the from the

95
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,200
um very early commentary

96
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,040
where it lists it kind of defines

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,640
samadhi

98
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,640
and that's a wonderful definition a

99
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,480
whole series of little definitions

100
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,360
samadhi means embracing

101
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,879
samadhi means completion

102
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,239
samadhi means single pointed

103
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,919
samadhi means unconfused

104
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,040
samadhi means unscattered samadhi means

105
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,520
undisturbed samadhi means unperturbed

106
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,520
samadhi means liberation

107
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,520
and the next one is particularly nice

108
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,199
next series

109
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,639
samadhi is seeking harmony

110
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,840
is acquiring harmony

111
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,320
samadhi is receiving harmony

112
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,160
samadhi is grasping harmony

113
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,240
taking hold of it samadhi is entering

114
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,479
harmony samadhi is going along

115
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,759
in harmony samadhi

116
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,800
is a light

117
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,240
lightening up in harmony

118
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,240
samadhi is being lit up in harmony

119
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:21,759
samadhi is harmony welfare and happiness

120
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,960
so um it's like thing's a wonderful list

121
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,199
this idea of harmony

122
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,560
um or evenness or balance

123
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,759
the word is sama s-a-m-a

124
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:36,960
and um and so you get a very different

125
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,080
feeling

126
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
for samadhi from these kinds of

127
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,120
descriptions

128
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,600
than you would if you just told that

129
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,240
tamari is one pointedness of mind

130
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,680
and when you talk about when you talk

131
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,080
about these absorption states jhana

132
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,440
which sometimes the way that they're

133
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,080
talked about they have the intensity and

134
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,240
a kind of laser idea and people

135
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,039
really try hard to get into it not

136
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:01,360
really realizing a big part of this

137
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,840
samadhi is letting go relaxing

138
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,039
settling deeper and deeper and deeper

139
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:12,080
and then uh but for these uh

140
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,240
jhanas these absorption absorption

141
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,440
states

142
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,960
the verbs related to them are entering

143
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,160
the states

144
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,800
and abiding in them and this idea of

145
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,840
entering

146
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,120
is a i think is a beautiful image that

147
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,240
we're not looking to zero in we're not

148
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,440
looking to

149
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,560
force ourselves to be a state but rather

150
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,199
we're kind of

151
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,440
entering into and i like to think of

152
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,280
entering into a sacred

153
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:42,319
uh area a sacred piece of land or a

154
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,280
temple

155
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
where we enter into with some reverence

156
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:47,440
and respect and care

157
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,479
and how we are how we enter

158
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:53,120
is important part of the entering and

159
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,840
then

160
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,479
we the two verbs are to enter and to

161
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:58,080
abide

162
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,240
it means that we take time just to

163
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,080
linger in those states to reside

164
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,840
in those states and

165
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,759
in whatever kind of samadhi states or

166
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,680
good states or nourishing states there

167
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,319
are

168
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,800
we abide in them so that we can be

169
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,319
conditioned by them

170
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:16,319
there's a reconditioning process that

171
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,240
happens through meditation

172
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,360
that um we're allowing ourselves

173
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,400
to um you know life that as we go

174
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,080
through can condition us in all kinds of

175
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,759
negative ways

176
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,560
and meditation is to undo that the

177
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,080
conditioning that comes from greed

178
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,680
hatred and delusion

179
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,280
is very different the condition that

180
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,599
comes from generosity and love and

181
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,280
and wisdom and so some people have even

182
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,840
said that samadhi is kind of a

183
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,199
re-parenting if parenting didn't go so

184
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:45,520
well

185
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,960
as for us growing growing up it has a

186
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,680
very deep and profound impact on us too

187
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,199
if we allow ourselves

188
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,840
to be nourished by it which requires

189
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:56,800
abiding

190
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,919
let abiding in it dwelling in it so that

191
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:00,800
we really

192
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,440
can let the goodness of these states

193
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:03,919
really

194
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:07,199
seep in and affect us and if we're in a

195
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,520
hurry to get more and more concentrated

196
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,440
we're not going to get allow the

197
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,919
nourishment to really recondition us and

198
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:16,319
open us and soften us in a way that's

199
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,440
useful on the path of liberation

200
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,919
and i thought i would also read to you

201
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,280
the

202
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,440
a list of the things that buddha talks

203
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,680
about that people that encourage people

204
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,440
to abide in

205
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,159
so he's not just saying you know in

206
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,120
modern

207
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,719
united states there's often discussion

208
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,159
about a

209
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:38,640
being rather than doing and meditation

210
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,560
is a chance just to be

211
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,240
i don't think the buddha would quite say

212
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,159
it that way

213
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,480
rather than being he talks about abiding

214
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,440
maybe very

215
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,560
closely related just abide but he's

216
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,519
always talking about

217
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,480
abiding in something in something that's

218
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:55,920
wholesome and good

219
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:59,680
not just being angry you know or fuming

220
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,720
if you just abide in that

221
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,720
maybe that maybe has a negative impact

222
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,720
if that fuming and

223
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,279
resentment anger just kind of simmering

224
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,200
along and

225
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,360
in some way so that's a whole different

226
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,399
topic about

227
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,880
you know how to be wise with things like

228
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:17,839
anger but

229
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:19,920
um with the buddha it's abiding so

230
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,760
here's these states of abiding the

231
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,320
buddha talks about

232
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,600
abiding in safety

233
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,519
abiding in fearlessness

234
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,760
abiding in a mind free from the

235
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,240
hindrances

236
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,440
abiding in equanimity

237
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:44,800
abiding in contentment

238
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,480
abiding in pleasure

239
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,279
inviting in happiness and gladness

240
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:56,880
abiding in happiness without moving the

241
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:57,519
body

242
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:01,040
or uttering a word

243
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:05,360
abiding in lovingkindness

244
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:09,200
abiding in compassion

245
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,560
abiding in a mind like space

246
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,959
abiding in the dharma abiding

247
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,720
observing impermanence

248
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,000
abiding in stillness

249
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,279
devoted to a pleasant abiding here and

250
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,440
now

251
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,200
samadhi states are buddha often

252
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,640
describes as a pleasant

253
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,000
abiding here and now

254
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,720
and then abiding in the four foundations

255
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,640
of mindfulness

256
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,320
and now it's very significant that the

257
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:47,120
word is abiding in the four foundations

258
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,560
it doesn't say practice the four

259
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,959
foundations of mindfulness it says abide

260
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,040
in them

261
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,720
abiding in bliss

262
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,760
abiding in emptiness

263
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,120
abiding in peaceful liberations

264
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,680
abiding in the supreme goal

265
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,600
so to abide one has to be patient

266
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
i think of abiding as being very closely

267
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,600
akin to being in a

268
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,560
receptive state so we abide we're

269
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:22,560
patient we're not in a hurry

270
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,360
and we receptive state to feel the

271
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,959
goodness of all these states all these

272
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,160
ways of being

273
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:30,880
that can happen and so one of so we're

274
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,640
talking here now about

275
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,720
the the 11th step of anapanasati

276
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,800
so of course when we sit down to

277
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,640
meditate there are times when

278
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,959
these are not available and we are angry

279
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:43,680
we are

280
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,800
agitated and to sit down and say just

281
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,640
sit there and abide in these good

282
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,360
feelings

283
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,399
just simply doesn't work and

284
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:55,440
but so we learned to practice with the

285
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,440
first steps of unempathy that really

286
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,959
support us

287
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,200
in the challenging states of being that

288
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,720
we can have in daily life

289
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,720
in our ex but as we meditation proceeds

290
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,240
then at some point that what i'm calling

291
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,920
today the goodness the nourishing

292
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,959
feelings

293
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,279
the beneficial feelings sensations that

294
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,480
are here

295
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,720
the buddha encourages us to abide in

296
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,839
them

297
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,839
and that when they come arise in samadhi

298
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,360
in these states of harmony

299
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,519
subtleness steadiness unification

300
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,000
that we really kind of now we're really

301
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,519
here in the present moment and really

302
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:33,200
feel that in the present there's a kind

303
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:34,880
of

304
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:38,160
harmony and joy and well-being

305
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,240
gladness to all these possible

306
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,320
different flavors of the goodness that

307
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,440
might be there

308
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,839
whatever the flavor is of the day

309
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,839
there's also a very important place to

310
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,200
abide in it

311
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,920
to receive it to let it nourish you and

312
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,639
fill you

313
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,680
and and let it kind of penetrate and

314
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,240
permeate yourself in some way

315
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,000
and um

316
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,760
so to dwell in these states

317
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,440
is not to be thinking about them

318
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,079
it's uh not be seeking and planning and

319
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:17,600
expecting and wanting

320
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,760
and holding on to things it's just

321
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,920
simply abiding just allowing them to be

322
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:22,800
there

323
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,480
and just kind of basking in it or

324
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,920
enjoying it and

325
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:29,600
breathing with it breathing through it

326
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,680
now this mindfulness of breathing is all

327
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,200
with reference point is always breathing

328
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,240
breathing

329
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,240
in and breathing out so we're always

330
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,079
kind of using that as a

331
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:41,120
support as a guide as a grounding as a

332
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:44,399
as a pointer as a as a way of staying

333
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,040
in these different steps and so now

334
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,360
we're staying breathing abiding in these

335
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:51,199
states abiding in

336
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:54,240
in the present moment you know in the

337
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,040
pleasant

338
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,320
state here and now so

339
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,680
uh the word in pali is

340
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,600
it comes related to the word vihara

341
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,160
meaning a monastery a place where people

342
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:09,279
amongst the nuns reside

343
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,480
and so you might for the next rest of

344
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,199
the day next 24 hours

345
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,279
have this word abide or abiding

346
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,720
viharati vihara as a

347
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,399
something you keep close by maybe you

348
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,399
write it on a sticky note and

349
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,160
and have it with you or have it posted

350
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,440
some places

351
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,639
and uh and see when

352
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,839
in the day you it's beneficial for you

353
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:37,360
to pause

354
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,560
and abide with what's happening and

355
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,199
especially when there's a goodness or

356
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,720
something nourishing and you

357
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,880
abide really take it in learn to abide

358
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,760
