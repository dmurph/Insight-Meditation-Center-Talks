1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:08,800
hello everyone and welcome and today the plan is to

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:16,039
mostly have a silent meditation after evoking a

3
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:22,480
very uh very simply evoking a particular quality to include in your meditation

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:27,599
which I'll mostly just name so but be since people are still

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:34,200
arriving I'll take one minute to say that

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,120
um uh for the after I'll be here tomorrow

7
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:47,800
and then for the next four weeks I won't be here on YouTube I'll be away and we have wonderful teachers

8
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:56,640
coming to fill in uh while I'm gone and um and I'll will be uh for three weeks

9
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:03,160
uh teaching uh this whole Insight approach to practice

10
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:11,040
in the wilderness uh camping and backpacking with people and then uh and then the

11
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:19,880
fourth week I'll be backpacking with my wife so um so I'll be uh uh that's where

12
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:25,360
I'll be and you'll be really well attended by some of the teachers you've

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,920
we've had before and I'm very happy that they're they're filling in

14
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:39,600
so so for this sitting I want to

15
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:47,000
evoke particular quality that I'm not going to say much about or guide you into the

16
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,880
meditation but rather let each of you if you're interested to find your own way

17
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,799
because each of you will have a different understanding of this concept Well a different approach to it

18
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,079
different way of living living with it and um but may it be that you keep this

19
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:11,560
close this concept this quality this uh capacity human potential that we all

20
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:19,560
have that you keep it close in this meditation it's a guide for The Meditation it's a reference point it's a

21
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:26,360
a um orientation uh uh uh with which to

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:31,680
through which to know and see and be mindful

23
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:41,720
so so with that the quality is

24
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,040
kindness friendliness good

25
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,280
will or perhaps positive

26
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:01,920
regard to gaze upon to have one's gaze be a gaze of

27
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:08,760
positive regard kindness for ones

28
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,000
self kindness for one's experience

29
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,080
friendliness as a almost a synonym of

30
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,599
mindfulness Good Will to be

31
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,760
mindful through the lens of a positive regard

32
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:38,920
so that is the orientation for this sitting and I

33
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:47,400
will I'll leave it at that and leave you to settle in and find your way with

34
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,799
these I consider them extremely profound

35
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,959
qualities qualities that

36
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:05,040
mature on this path of Liberation these are not kindergarten Buddhist

81

and as we come to the end of this sitting to once

82
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:06,919
again tap into your

83
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:13,679
capacity for kindness for

84
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:20,440
friendliness for Good Will and positive

85
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:30,240
regard perhaps thinking of anyone in the the world that you have

86
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:37,120
these feelings for even if it's a a

87
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:43,600
pet or someone you don't know personally I know some people think of the some

88
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:46,799
great spiritual

89
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:57,080
leader and to remind yourself that you do have the capacity for kindness or

90
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:01,679
friendliness at

91
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:12,039
times in certain contexts maybe when you're with a small

92
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,720
child maybe when you're at the bedside of someone who's

93
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:25,679
dying maybe you stop on the side of the road for someone who's been in an accident

94
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:42,360
and we all have some capacity for Good Will positive regard care

95
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:49,840
kindness each person in their own way doesn't have to look the way other

96
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:56,840
people have it and to have the occasion of

97
00:29:56,840 --> 00:30:02,200
meditation to be a time in the safety of meditation

98
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:10,919
and the quiet meditation at the very end of meditation to spend a few

99
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:17,679
moments reflecting gazing bringing to

100
00:30:17,679 --> 00:30:23,840
mind all beings everywhere or say differently bring up

101
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:30,039
that kindness and see if for a few

102
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:37,480
moments it can be there directed to all beings all

103
00:30:39,519 --> 00:30:47,158
people a regular tapping in to a universal Good

104
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:54,480
Will May all beings be

105
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,399
happy may all beings be

106
00:31:00,399 --> 00:31:06,519
safe may all [Music] beings be

107
00:31:06,519 --> 00:31:12,519
peaceful may all beings be free

108
00:31:23,650 --> 00:31:26,949
[Music]

109
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:32,880
thank you

110
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:27,120
is

111
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:38,480
so hello and welcome to this fourth talk having to do with the upay

112
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:46,360
suta and um I'll read it again to you every day beginning of each of these

113
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:53,360
talks and the Buddha talking to his disciple Ananda his attendant attendant

114
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:58,440
monk it is not easy Ananda to teach the

115
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:05,000
dhma to others the dhama should be taught to others when five qualities are

116
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:11,480
established within oneself which five the dhama should be taught to

117
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:18,960
others thinking I will speak speak step by step the dhama should be taught to

118
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:26,360
others thinking I will speak for practical reasons I will speak with

119
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:31,440
reasons the dumb much should be taught to others thinking I will speak for I

120
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:38,760
will speak grounded in kindness that dhama should be taught

121
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:44,880
with others thinking I will not speak for material

122
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:55,080
reward the dhama should be taught to others thinking I will speak without wounding myself or others

123
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:04,760
so and as I've been saying I believe that this teaching that supplies to

124
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:14,320
teaching the dhama that uh when we're not teaching the dhama that um we can apply this to

125
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,358
any way that we speak or any way if you're a teacher of any kind it can be

126
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:28,398
applied to teaching in any way and um and so here today I want to uh talk

127
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:33,599
about uh in on this list the third piece which is

128
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:45,679
kindness and the word here is some probably a poly word many of you don't know it's anuda a n u d a y a and um and

129
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:53,760
Dia also means kindness or so Anu means with or following or directed directing

130
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:59,599
um kindness and um and uh some people will

131
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:04,760
have called uh have tried different ways because kindness is often associated

132
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:11,520
with meta one of the challenges when there's all these different words in poly that are related having to do with

133
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,320
our they kind of the posit positive social emotions and um and so some people have

134
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:24,680
translated anodia as compassion some people as tender

135
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:30,640
kindness um sympathy um um so all kinds of it was one of the problems of one of

136
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:35,800
the wonderful delightful challenges of translating poly into English is finding

137
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:41,160
English words for these positive emotions so uh for here it's a kindness

138
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:49,160
today anuda and um and so this positive regard of

139
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:55,560
others and the reference point for me for very important reference point for

140
00:35:55,560 --> 00:36:02,200
all the positive social uh care emotions loving kindness

141
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:09,280
compassion um sympathetic Joy equinity kindness friendliness all these

142
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:14,920
is the way when I started practicing Buddhism in my early 20s I think I was

143
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:22,400
20 when I started that um these these uh these motions of

144
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:28,119
positive regard kind of found me they arose as part of the meditation

145
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:34,000
practice they were not something that I Tred

146
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:40,359
to make happen it wasn't something I was told you should be do do the things uh

147
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:45,520
they seem to arise in the course of the practice and since I was practicing Zen

148
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:52,720
at the beginning there was a big emphasis on emptiness and certainly we were in Zen not supposed to be we were

149
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:59,640
not supposed to be really in Zen in Zen meditation you're not supposed to be trying to cult at or develop anything uh

150
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:06,839
it was really kind of just sitting completely uh with the truth with no gaining idea just with the present

151
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:12,960
moment in a full accepting um uh a

152
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:19,680
um a a kind of a thoroughgoing acceptance of the

153
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:25,560
present moment and um and in that there arose in

154
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:33,520
me compassion and uh first I think it was because I suffered so much that um this this uh

155
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:39,640
thorough acceptance of the present moment accepting suffering um not fighting it not struggling against it

156
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:46,520
not trying to fix it it made room for something to soften in me made room for something new to appear that I never had

157
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:53,440
before or not had in any kind of significant way and there was the rising of compassion and because it didn't seem

158
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:59,200
to have a source in me it just seemed to arise um uh it seemed to arise in the

159
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:06,720
emptiness of this that was there with this thorough thoroughgoing acceptance of the present moment I I came to the

160
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:12,880
conclusion that that emptiness in a certain way is um is uh not exactly

161
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:20,319
synonymous with compassion but emptiness contains compassion something like that there's a natural function that

162
00:38:20,319 --> 00:38:25,400
arises that doesn't have to have a reason exactly or it's not engineered or

163
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:31,440
made happen and and um and then as the practice continued to develop over the

164
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:38,599
years and with you past the same thing happened with loving kindness with meta then then it's evolved more with this

165
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:45,319
more profound thing I think or related thing called anukampa I translate as

166
00:38:45,319 --> 00:38:50,680
care friendliness has became a more more more and more something that I was

167
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:56,560
oriented towards and so I say all this to talk

168
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:04,680
about uh uh that the the the um the um social care the social

169
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:10,359
positive emotions we have for others that um they are part of the fruition of

170
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:16,480
practice part of the the fruit of doing this practice itself because a lot of

171
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:22,480
what the practice is about is getting out of the N the way of what wants to arise in US

172
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:29,160
naturally now it can feel very natural to be angry and hostile can be very natural natur to be greedy and want

173
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:37,200
things and be afraid and of course in some ways it is natural it's a part of our being but it's this uh as I said

174
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:45,319
last last few weeks it's a very different operating system that uh is oping within us and um

175
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:51,560
and it's the operating system which in a sense is more um synthetic it's more

176
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:57,640
something that the engineering mind the constructing mind the the survival mind

177
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:04,079
uh kind of operates under and uh tends to have a a strong orientation towards

178
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:10,079
the contraction of tension of stress which uh in all kinds of ways becomes

179
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:18,520
the focal point or the organizing principle for our more attached ideas of

180
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:24,920
self of Me Myself and mind and sometimes the very feeling we have of amness I am

181
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:31,480
in a certain way uh is uh really the place where the subtlest little uh

182
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:38,440
tension pressure Gathering Together coagulation of um of of these kind of

183
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:44,000
muscles and tensions in the mind um are come together and it feels like it just

184
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:50,680
what is is just an amness I am but it's actually a manifestation of very subtle

185
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:56,319
or maybe not so subtle tension and that tension then gives rise

186
00:40:56,319 --> 00:41:02,640
to emot that arises out of this kind of constructed part of the self the

187
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:10,960
survival part as that survival part is not needing to operate so much as we relax

188
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:17,079
all the tension we have it'll gives room for something else to arise that's

189
00:41:17,079 --> 00:41:25,000
something that doesn't seem to be connected to self is not synthetic it's not uh an artifact of the mind's making

190
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:30,480
things up making ideas up of self others and Futures and pasts and all kinds of

191
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:38,560
things and so that I call the more naturalistic and part of this naturalistic movement within us is these

192
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:45,960
uh social care emotions these positive regard emotions and one of the really

193
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:53,040
wonderful pieces of modern Psychology was the lessons we many of us

194
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:59,599
learned from Carl Rogers who was an American psychologist who was uh taught

195
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:07,880
us the tremendous value of positive looking at people being with people with unconditional positive regard and uh he

196
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:14,520
did that in Psychotherapy while really listening careful to people people really felt listen to him because when

197
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:20,839
they spoke he would repeat back to them what they said maybe in slightly different words and the combination of

198
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:26,160
being listened to being heard hearing them their own ideas being spoken in a

199
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:33,400
little different way um and this positive regard who car people caring for them allowed something

200
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:40,559
to shift and change and it's if you can watch some of the probably on YouTube videos of Carl Rogers with his sessions

201
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,760
and watch how people transform I call it this natur again this naturalistic

202
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:52,880
transformation that can happen to people when we're listen to carefully when there's a kind regard for each for

203
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:58,880
ourselves when there's a kind of a presence that uh we get out of the way and allow people to be who they are to

204
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:04,400
be heard to be seen to be understood um uh uh without allowing

205
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:09,960
them to harm us or harm anyone just but but we step forward and hold what's

206
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:17,079
there in positive regard this is a remarkable thing and um

207
00:43:17,079 --> 00:43:25,880
so here in the teachings from the um the uh UD suta the Buddha says to speak

208
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:31,920
grounded in kindness it's possible to do this to speak with

209
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:37,480
care to speak with positive regard and it doesn't have to be so certainly

210
00:43:37,480 --> 00:43:43,119
shouldn't be saccharine it shouldn't be forced and but a lot of it comes from making

211
00:43:43,119 --> 00:43:48,559
space um making room uh a wonderful American Theologian

212
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:58,520
talked about uh named Henry Nan talked about making um um uh empty friendly

213
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:05,240
space to receive the stranger so an empty space makes room

214
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:10,960
for people to be who they are but that space is friendly and and for him it's

215
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:18,920
the receive the stranger not just our friends and um so to speak grounded in

216
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:28,240
kindness um this is at least the Buddha's instruction for Buddhist teachers and um so so

217
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:34,760
uh may you on this day that

218
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:41,720
um it's it's good for every day to ground ourselves in kind kindness in

219
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:49,079
positive regard but there are times when it's really difficult and uh in some of those

220
00:44:49,079 --> 00:44:55,079
difficult times it doesn't have to be difficult some of the

221
00:44:55,079 --> 00:45:01,800
times um those those are the times when this practice of ours it comes really

222
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:10,599
alive don't succumb to despair don't disc succumb to

223
00:45:10,599 --> 00:45:15,800
helplessness don't succumb to hostility and

224
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:21,559
anger rather see if you can find a positive

225
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:28,960
regard through which by which you can address the problems of

226
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:35,119
this world kindness is not a avoidance but it's a

227
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,559
means that carries with it a profound

228
00:45:40,559 --> 00:45:47,400
message of respect and positive regard for everyone

229
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:57,000
even those people who are considered our enemies so um thank you very much and um

230
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:07,800
tomorrow will be the last uh in this series and and um I look forward to being back here
