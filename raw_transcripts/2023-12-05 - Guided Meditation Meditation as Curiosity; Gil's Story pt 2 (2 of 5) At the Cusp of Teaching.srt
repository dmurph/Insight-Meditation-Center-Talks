1
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
e

2
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
e

3
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
e

4
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,920
so hello everyone and

5
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:24,519
welcome and it's helpful when we sit down to

6
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:30,120
meditate to have a bit of an attitude or an approach

7
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:36,079
that we're doing it for the first time maybe with a certain amount of

8
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:43,240
momentum or familiarity but still that it's a it's new it's something new to

9
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:49,160
discover new to be uh that we don't really know the

10
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:56,320
maybe the subtleties or the depths or the corners or the attics or the basements

11
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:01,920
of Our Lives that might show itself in any given

12
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:08,360
meditation so just to meditate as if it's fresh and

13
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:14,360
new a new entering a new world not assuming or bringing with you the

14
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:20,480
expectations or the assumptions from before and in that regard it's helpful

15
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:25,880
to think of meditation as a form of

16
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:31,600
curiosity but a form of curiosity that doesn't stimulate more thinking but the

17
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,760
opposite a form of curiosity that is a keen interest what's

18
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:42,360
going on here that quiets the mind and the

19
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,839
analogy that I like is that um if you're in say the

20
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:54,760
forest and uh you you hear a sound that's unfamiliar and it's very

21
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:00,839
faint and uh maybe it's the sound of the river that you need to

22
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:07,040
find and you find is that the river what is that or there's a sound of a bird and

23
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:14,800
you would um um to be able to listen kind of acutely or carefully

24
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:21,920
fully your ordinary thinking might quiet down you might stop thinking ordinary

25
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:27,160
thoughts there be maybe some very simple thoughts about the sound but something

26
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:33,160
inside of you gets very still and quiet and connected focused to the

27
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,880
hearing and things got very quiet and um and in that kind of

28
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:47,720
way uh we can ask ourselves the kind ofas question that I act asked myself when I

29
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,279
was in Burma practicing there was the question what is

30
00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:01,440
this what is this whatever was happening what is this and uh and even if I kind of

31
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:08,600
recognized it something that I know knew like maybe it was the uh tingling in my

32
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:14,680
chest I could have just said tingling in my chest and be done with it but this kind of checklist approach to

33
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,760
mindfulness to awareness just kind of recognize what's there and move on um uh

34
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:25,079
is limiting so I might recognize as tingling in my

35
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:33,120
chest and then I would ask what is this and but I did it with a way to make my

36
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:39,639
my mind would get quiet and in order to and I wouldn't be looking for an answer it wasn't like I

37
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:46,160
was asking a question so that I answer it with some more thoughts or descriptions or ideas but I asked the

38
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:53,480
question to quiet the mind so I can move into it and feel it more fully so I can

39
00:12:53,480 --> 00:13:00,160
open myself and allow myself to receive it more fully what is this to really know

40
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,720
something well to know something experientially to know something in the

41
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:12,480
through the senses um because the sense data the sense how we things come in through the

42
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:20,279
senses is the gate by which uh all the experience of the world and ourselves

43
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:27,480
begins and then we construct it we interpret it we uh apply names onto it

44
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,519
and it gets complicated very quickly in a way that takes us away from the

45
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,240
immediacy of this sensory experience that we have and what I learned in Burma

46
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,320
practicing there was how Central the sensory experience was to this practice

47
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,639
of AAS the ongoing flow of

48
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:55,600
Sensations and so this question what is this and then in letting things in that

49
00:13:55,600 --> 00:14:01,120
Curiosity what is this but to to do that sometimes I would

50
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:07,759
do it with say it in my mind and sometimes I would just it was just kind of an attitude but an attitude that let

51
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:13,199
something get quiet a quieting a

52
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:20,120
stilling to feel to open to to

53
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:27,040
receive to float on whatever experience was so even if there was a lot of

54
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:34,040
thinking going on even there I would say what is this not to discern what the

55
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:42,440
content of the thoughts were and why I was thinking what I was thinking but again what is the sensations of

56
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:48,959
thinking if I had a strong emotion what are this what is this and let everything

57
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:56,519
get quiet so I can feel and sense the sensory nature of the emotions so the Curiosity that quiets

58
00:14:56,519 --> 00:15:03,279
the mind so sitting upright or

59
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:11,720
sitting or lying if you're lying down lying in a way that adjusts your

60
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:17,639
spine a way that works for you but aligns the back the

61
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:24,120
spine so optimizes the feeling of alertness in your back while taking care

62
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:30,480
of whatever might be an issue in the back

63
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,000
and gently closing your

64
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:48,880
eyes and beginning with curiosity and the question what is

65
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:55,560
this what is this experience of being alive right now in this posture with the

66
00:15:55,560 --> 00:16:00,600
eyes closed

67
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:11,199
not to answer it with words but let the thinking mind become

68
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:20,560
quieter as if if you're quiet enough what is here will reveal itself

69
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,839
to you you don't have to go looking or figuring

70
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:35,120
out what is it that wants to be revealed what is

71
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:47,959
this and if nothing comes there might still be the

72
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:55,160
pleasure of that Curiosity that openness that

73
00:16:55,240 --> 00:17:00,480
receptivity that comes with that question

74
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
for

75
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:48,440
and taking a few longer deeper breaths relaxing with the

76
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
exhale

77
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:21,799
letting your breathing return to

78
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:30,760
normal and Center yourself into a receptor mode Center yourself in

79
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:40,559
the breathing to be receptive to breathing the bod sensations of

80
00:18:51,520 --> 00:19:01,360
breathing with a question what is this what is the body sensations of

81
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:07,280
breathing what is it as a way of quieting the mind and

82
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,760
being more sensitive to the experience of

83
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
breathing

84
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

85
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:30,159
for

86
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:41,120
what is this as an entry into the ongoing flow

87
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:49,799
of present moment experience with the Mind becoming

88
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:52,799
quieter

89
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:04,600
Stiller to better perceive the lived

90
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:11,519
experience of Sensations in the

91
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
body

92
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
e

93
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

94
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
for

95
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

96
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

97
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

98
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

99
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
e

100
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

101
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
for

102
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,600
for

103
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,520
for

104
00:27:56,519 --> 00:27:59,519
for

105
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
for

106
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,320
for

107
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
for

108
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:29,240
for

109
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:46,840
as a way of opening more fully to the experience of here and

110
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:55,440
now you could ask ask yourself the question what is

111
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,519
this don't look for an

112
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:08,039
answer let the question open you to the experience of

113
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,159
here

114
00:31:56,159 --> 00:31:59,159
for

115
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,080
for

116
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,039
for

117
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,960
for

118
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,960
for

119
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,878
for

120
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,879
e

121
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,800
for

122
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,800
for

123
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:19,440
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to ask yourself

124
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:28,720
now with a quieting curiosity what is this

125
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:36,318
what is this experience of being

126
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:51,560
alive and if you let the body answer that question what answer does the body

127
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,680
provide

128
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:10,359
then with a quietest mind maybe a calming M

129
00:37:10,599 --> 00:37:18,319
heart to look open up to the world around

130
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:24,599
you in your neighborhood your home your

131
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:33,520
town what is it to have an open

132
00:37:38,599 --> 00:37:42,040
heart what is

133
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,880
it to Value the people around

134
00:37:55,599 --> 00:38:03,240
you what form of receptivity and

135
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:08,160
attentiveness comes out of meditation out of

136
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:16,680
mindfulness that allows you to take in others in a deeper

137
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:24,240
way not as projections of our complaints or desires or

138
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,040
opinions but to kind of be sensitive to the humanity of

139
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:36,319
others in all their shapes and

140
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:46,240
forms and to end the meditation with a wishing everyone

141
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:51,880
well may all beings be

142
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,520
happy may all beings be safe

thank

152
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:28,359
you

153
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:15,800
so hello and welcome to this now series that I'm giving about my Dharma

154
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:21,280
life and um and I left off yesterday with um

155
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:27,520
having gone to Insight Meditation Society in Massachusetts for three month ret

156
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:34,400
treat and up to that point I've been kind of going back and forth some between doing Zen practice at the San

157
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:40,520
Francisco Zen Center and doing Insight practice um uh in

158
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:47,079
Asia in Thailand and Burma and then I the first time I practiced with the Western teachers was at three-month

159
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:55,200
retreat in IMS and um and then I went back to Zen Center I

160
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:02,160
had been ordained as a z Zen priest there Zen buunk and um in the course of

161
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:09,599
kind of the of of um growth in that kind of

162
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:15,880
role uh at some point uh someone is ordained there as a priest uh has this

163
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:23,119
position of being the the called the um head student the head monk of a

164
00:42:23,119 --> 00:42:29,559
three-month practice period at the monastery and and it's considered to be kind of like the the transition into

165
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:37,599
starting to train to become as zen teacher and you do your first Dharma talks there and um and so I was invited

166
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:42,720
to have that role and it seemed like a wonderful continuation of or comp kind

167
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:50,599
of a completion of my zen training some people see it as a completion uh all your kind of basic training now been

168
00:42:50,599 --> 00:42:55,839
done and um so you're also you're a little bit the model student and a model

169
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:01,720
practi ier and so you go to all the meditations and uh you do all the

170
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:07,559
rituals and uh the job the head student has is to clean all the bathrooms the

171
00:43:07,559 --> 00:43:13,200
public bathrooms and do the trash and the compost I loved it it was very nice

172
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:20,559
and so I went back from IMs I went to do this three three-month retreat at tasahara Monastery in the

173
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:28,160
wilderness and um it was wonderful as a way of continuing what had happened 3 months imagine being 3 months in Long

174
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:35,160
silent Retreat and then not going back into the business of the world but being able to go into the kind of monastic

175
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:40,960
life and the quiet of the winter where there was no public coming into

176
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:47,119
tahara and um so I continued with that but during that time I began feeling

177
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:53,400
that um my future was not to stay at Zen Center uh I can't articulate exactly why

178
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,440
but just didn't seem right to I'd spent 10 years of of intensive practice and

179
00:43:58,440 --> 00:44:03,480
that period of time felt like it had completed there complete cycle of

180
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:11,280
development of growth and it felt appropriate not to continue in the kind of more intensive Buddhist and practice

181
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:16,720
environment and to kind of go out into the world a little bit now but uh I had

182
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:22,359
no interest for a career or conventional job or anything at all and I thought

183
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:29,559
well I'm going to have to support myself some way and I had this probably naive idea that if I got a master's in

184
00:44:29,559 --> 00:44:36,520
Buddhist studies then maybe I could teach Buddhist studies at a community college classes in Buddhism or something

185
00:44:36,520 --> 00:44:44,160
and make enough uh you know income to kind of get by in my simple monastic

186
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:51,240
lifestyle and um so I applied to the University of Hawaii in Manoa in

187
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:57,440
Honolulu to uh do a masters in religious studies with a focus on Buddhism and the

188
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:03,400
reason I went there was twofold um someone had given me a book by a professor in the philosophy

189
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:10,520
Department a Sri Lankan man named David kalupahana uh about the the middle way of ngaro

190
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:16,480
narina was one of the very important early Mahayana philosophers of

191
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:21,760
India and um and David Kalapana had a very different orientation towards how

192
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:28,160
to study kapana study narina most people studied this philosopher this maybe second

193
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:35,200
century philosopher um through the through the lens of later Indian

194
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:43,000
interpretations he said no no we shouldn't do that we should understand him through the lens of the earlier

195
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:49,480
Buddhist texts that ngagara would have read and been influenced by and for and

196
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:55,280
and that was these early poly sutas early poly discourses of the Buddha and

197
00:45:55,280 --> 00:46:02,240
I thought that was a brilliant move and I really like David kahana's take on all this so I wanted to go there to study

198
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:09,400
with him also there was a zen teacher wonderful uh teacher named Robert Akin

199
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:15,240
roshi who was also right they lived he had a a Zen Center in a house right next to the

200
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:23,240
university so I went there to study with the Zen master the zen teacher and do  study with him for two years and to

201
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:30,680
do this master's program there and and um and a master's program in Buddhist studies turned to be lots of fun for me

202
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:37,359
in the 10 years that I'd lived this kind of more monastic life I actually hadn't done very much study of Buddhism uh very

203
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:43,960
little reading and and um and now it felt like a kid in the candy store and

204
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:51,760
and I just had a great time with the studies and um and so that was nice and

205
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:58,640
um and then uh after two years it was over and I said whatat do I do now and

206
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:07,040
again I had no conventional career in mind I wasn't didn't feel like I should go back to again to the more living at a

207
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:14,480
a Buddhist center anymore so what do I do I didn't really have any idea I wasn't really I wasn't a teacher

208
00:47:14,480 --> 00:47:21,480
yet so I thought well it was fun to do this master's program why don't I apply for a doctoral program in the San

209
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:27,839
Francisco Bay Area because I wanted to be close to my Buddhist teacher in my Buddhist communities I want to be close

210
00:47:27,839 --> 00:47:33,359
to San fris Center and also by then I wanted to be closer to um the burgeoning

211
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:40,760
world of U Spirit Rock there was some Vasa teachers there Jack cornfield and others that I hardly knew but I wanted

212
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:46,240
to be kind of closer to that scene that and um and I didn't expect to get

213
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:51,880
accepted to a doctor to a doctorate Pro program but I was accepted and to my

214
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:57,599
surprise and Not only was I accepted but there was to my surprise there was a um

215
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,640
a for me a very large um scholarship uh

216
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:08,599
for living for Roman to you know I think I was it was a lot of money back then it

217
00:48:08,599 --> 00:48:15,119
was $8,000 a year in 1990 for me to live on and that was enough for me to live on

218
00:48:15,119 --> 00:48:23,480
and go to school and um and I quickly discovered that um a doctorate program at a major

219
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:30,319
research University is very different in a master's program and master's program was kind of like um just kind of like

220
00:48:30,319 --> 00:48:35,480
just just great surveys of so much of introduction and surveys to mucha

221
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:43,599
Buddhism and the doctoral program was now to kind of bore down into the details and do a lot of analysis and and

222
00:48:43,599 --> 00:48:49,440
um often uh critical analysis of texts and te you

223
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:56,319
know and um and um it wasn't so much fun the way that I had before

224
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,720
but one of the motivations for me was that uh when I my undergraduate degree

225
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:07,440
was in Agronomy at the great agricultural School University of California at

226
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:15,839
Davis and I was part of a team of a group of uh other students who were kind of the um uh uh Alternatives in

227
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:22,480
agriculture we called it Alternatives in agriculture kind of activists on campus trying to get more organic farming

228
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:31,240
studies trying to do to do different things that were more alternative to Conventional commercial um fertilizer and pesticide

229
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:36,799
centered Agriculture and um and uh we had

230
00:49:36,799 --> 00:49:41,960
wonderful adventures at University uh promoting that but one of

231
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:48,240
the things that uh were a surprised for me when I studied the agriculture the science behind

232
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:54,920
farming is that uh I came kind of as a fundamentalist organic farmer with a lot

233
00:49:54,920 --> 00:50:02,040
of rece received ideas about about farming and especially fertilizers that

234
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:08,599
were erroneous and um and I was kind of shocked that uh I was capable of kind of

235
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:15,920
very dogmatic opinionated ideas about farming and things and it wasn't quite

236
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:22,799
right when I started studying my doctoral program it was in the religious studies Department to do Buddhist

237
00:50:22,799 --> 00:50:28,559
studies um I remember that and I said you know no I'm doing religion here and

238
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:35,000
um and in religion um I think there's even more dogmatism more easier to succumb to this

239
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:41,920
is the truth this is really what is and I wanted to be really careful not to fall into that trap and I wanted to be

240
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:49,319
able to have the foundation to understand my assumptions to understand where the beliefs came from to

241
00:50:49,319 --> 00:50:54,400
understand how to interpret um experiences meditation experiences so

242
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,960
there wasn't overlay of dogmatism on top of it and uh and I've certainly seen a

243
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:07,880
lot of fundamentalists in Buddhism and I would I didn't want to be one of those and so this study so turned out to be a

244
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:13,680
doctoral program at a really major research University and religious

245
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:21,480
studies um in some way served really well to develop kind of a better critical mind in the best terms of that

246
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:28,200
expression a mind that could analyze or think about things and question question things in a deeper way and I kind of

247
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:33,359
felt that when I was there that that kind of questioning was other form of

248
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:41,839
Liberation it was kind of an intellectual Liberation that was going on so that was kind of nice and um but

249
00:51:41,839 --> 00:51:47,119
then a number of interesting things happened along the way uh just around that

250
00:51:47,119 --> 00:51:54,040
time uh um just before leaving Hawaii to come

251
00:51:54,040 --> 00:52:02,880
back to California I think it was still 1989 uh I received a phone call that it

252
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:09,839
was out of the blue for me I wasn't expecting it uh from Jack cornfield who I only knew a little bit and I'd never

253
00:52:09,839 --> 00:52:16,720
practiced with him but uh he knew about my practice and and uh he invited me to be in his

254
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:22,680
next teacher training and uh it was one of those remarkable experiences where I remember

255
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:30,920
standing looking at of Windows uh he was talking to me on the phone and I literally kind of viscerally uh had this

256
00:52:30,920 --> 00:52:39,319
Fe sensation in my body of the puzzle pieces of My Life coming together and it's like a click click click and I wow

257
00:52:39,319 --> 00:52:45,640
this it all fits now and um I can't necessarily explain that but that was the physical

258
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:52,559
sensations of it and then later in a rational way I saidwell I don't know if I'm going to become a Vasa teacher but

259
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:59,040
it'd be foolish not to go study with Jack cornfield so I started that training at the same

260
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:05,000
time that I started my doctorate program and then I when I came back to

261
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:11,240
California I had a little bit trouble finding a place to live so I ended up living back at the San Francisco Zen

262
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:19,079
Center in San Francisco living in the in the temple and it was nice to be there but

263
00:53:19,079 --> 00:53:25,359
then um my zen teacher Mel whitesman was the Abbot at that point at some point he

264
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:30,559
took me for a walk and um and uh he did

265
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:38,359
uh we had an interesting conversation uh first he asked me about there was two major abits at Zen Center at that time

266
00:53:38,359 --> 00:53:44,880
and so he asked me about my relationship with the other one and I said uh that um

267
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:50,839
um uh I trusted his the other ones I trusted his Dharma his teaching but I

268
00:53:50,839 --> 00:53:57,280
didn't quite trust him but then he asked what about me talking to himself to about himself and

269
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:02,319
I said well you um um I trust you but

270
00:54:02,319 --> 00:54:08,839
I'm not quite sure about your Dharma and then he did a remarkable thing we were walking on the sidewalk and he turned

271
00:54:08,839 --> 00:54:15,200
around and faced me and when I said I'm not sure about your Dharma he said uh he

272
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:23,119
went put his hands together almost like with a clap and said um that's and that's where we'll

273
00:54:23,119 --> 00:54:29,319
meet he wasn't he wasn't a upset he wasn't concerned he was kind of delighted that I didn't quite see eye to

274
00:54:29,319 --> 00:54:35,359
eye to him about the Dharma I said that's where we'll meet and um and it was not like we were going to meet and

275
00:54:35,359 --> 00:54:40,720
he was going to convince me something that's where he wanted to meet me and like was felt like a really respectful

276
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:45,960
thing and also in Zen when you put your hands together in this you know Act of

277
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:52,040
respect and then um and then uh later in that walk he suggested that I start

278
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:59,880
training with him specifically or studying with him to prepare for Dharma transmission which is to become a foen

279
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:05,400
teacher and um and I kind of said well I think it's too early to talk about that

280
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:12,400
but why don't I come over and start studying with you and so I started studying basically for that purpose but

281
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:18,680
I kind of had put off a decision and so here I was practicing studying a PhD in

282
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:26,119
Buddhist studies involved in becoming training to be as be PNA teacher with Jack cornfield

283
00:55:26,119 --> 00:55:32,039
and training to be a zen teacher with Mel whitesman all at the same time in

284
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:39,599
and then in 1992 kind of when all this was going on in addition that's when I uh got married

285
00:55:39,599 --> 00:55:44,760
and I'd met my wife uh some five years earlier when I'd come living at Green

286
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:52,520
Gulch when I came back from Burma and had met her there on the farm she was farming there and and uh and we got

287
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:59,400
together and we went to T together and she went with me to Hawaii and and um

288
00:55:59,400 --> 00:56:07,599
and then when we came back from Hawaii she went to UC Davis to get a masters in botony and I went to graduate school in

289
00:56:07,599 --> 00:56:14,400
the Bay Area and in 1992 we were married so this was a then the last

290
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:21,440
thing I'll say going to leave it um as part of the homework for teacher training with Jack horfield uh we were

291
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:28,520
supposed to have a sitting group that we taught in weekly group and as it turned out there was one in paloalto that met

292
00:56:28,520 --> 00:56:33,599
Monday nights uh with about 12 to 15 people who came and the person who

293
00:56:33,599 --> 00:56:39,440
facilitated it a wonderful man named um um I

294
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:46,039
know in this different flow I can't quite remember oh Howard noodleman he

295
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:51,440
um um had gotten sick and so he couldn't lead the group anymore he wasn't

296
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,760
teaching it but he was facilitating it and uh Jack suggested that he invite me

297
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:01,960
and so he invited me and then in August 1990 I went to started to teach this

298
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:09,520
little group and which grew to this what we are now IMC and so that was uh this

299
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:15,160
wonderful combination of uh things happening then

300
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:20,720
and looking back at it now it seems like I was doing a lot but it felt very

301
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:26,319
spacious and just all matter of fact and it was a diff you know 30 years ago it felt like Looking Back Now a whole

302
00:57:26,319 --> 00:57:31,599
different era and there seem to be lots of time for everything compared to now

303
00:57:31,599 --> 00:57:38,520
where we live in a very different world and it feels like now um there's you know my time is filled in a way that it

304
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:44,440
