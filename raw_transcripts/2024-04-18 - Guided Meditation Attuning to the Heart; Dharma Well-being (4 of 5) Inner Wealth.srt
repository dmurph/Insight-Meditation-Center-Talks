names and some of the new names so today is the fourth of a

129
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:36,679
five-day series on qualities of inner and interpersonal darma well-being

130
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:42,960
Wellsprings within us that can help us be at home and

131
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:49,480
ourselves if we come home to the practice the Buddha taught that

132
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:55,600
practitioners can cultivate these particular kinds of dharmic well-being

133
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:02,639
flourishing even in difficult times s by staying with the practice staying with

134
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:08,280
contentment with the practice and there are five qualities I'm covering

135
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:15,520
today not today sorry five qualities I'm covering this week though I will be covering five qualities today too just

136
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:22,158
not the same ones the five this week Are Spiritual empowerment or the four four

137
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:29,158
roads to power the teaching is sometimes called true beauty

138
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:34,320
happiness inner wealth or heart wealth and

139
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:40,560
freedom and yesterday we covered happiness today we cover that sense of

140
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:46,240
inner wealth heart wealth becoming rich in the heart qualities the forms of

141
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:54,398
Buddhist love and by way of introducing this topic I'm going to continue with another

142
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:01,440
little vignette from Queen Jasmine's life this Buddhist myth or fairy tale

143
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:11,640
that I brought up on Tuesday and I actually introduced it in site Santa Cruz last week and to summarize so far she met

144
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:19,520
King pacity when she was a low cast very poor daughter of two flower Growers out

145
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:28,240
Gathering flowers for her family's business in the field and based on her generosity her kindness her confidence

146
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:36,320
he fell in love with her and it turns out lifted her out of obscurity to become his first and most beloved

147
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:44,400
Queen now earlier this week I talked about how she encouraged him to go to

148
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:49,880
the Buddha and thus prevented a very ill-advised large

149
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:57,960
sacrifice of animals and after this experience he began to trust her even more began to trust her and her um

150
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:04,880
inclinations her compassion a little bit of her wisdom and um perhaps it's after that

151
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:10,160
time that the commentaries don't make it clear but this story happens when the

152
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:17,040
two of us are in a private moment I picture them on the balcony of their

153
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:25,160
Castle surveying their realm it's dusk that kind of indigo duskiness has settled over the

154
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,319
farmland and can just see the Himalayan Foothills and the peaks of the mountains

155
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:35,480
etched against the sky it's kind of a romantic

156
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:41,119
moment and In This Moment the king turns to

157
00:36:41,119 --> 00:36:47,480
Jasmine and he says he asks in all of the world my dear who do

158
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:54,319
you love the most now the commentary is say that this question happened from a place of kind

159
00:36:54,319 --> 00:37:02,160
of smugness or entitlement that he lifted her out of poverty and that she must be so grateful and love her love

160
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:09,359
him above all else because of this but that's not how I

161
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:15,319
read Jasmine Malika was dear to his heart and she

162
00:37:15,319 --> 00:37:22,480
turned to him and took both of his hands in hers and held them and looked into his

163
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:29,119
eyes and he said in all of the world

164
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:35,079
beloved husband it is myself I hold the most dear it is myself

165
00:37:35,079 --> 00:37:42,480
I love the most well the King was a little bit startled by this one

166
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:49,319
imagines but he stays with it and she stays with him hands still on

167
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:56,599
his and after pausing for a few moments for him to drink that in she asks and my

168
00:37:56,599 --> 00:38:02,640
love who is is it that you hold most dear who do you love the most in all the

169
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:08,920
world and upon contemplation he kind of reluctantly has

170
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:15,599
to agree with her it's himself that's the center of things he holds himself

171
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:21,359
most dear this conversation it made an impact and

172
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:27,160
so the King goes to the Buddha and relays this conversation to him and the

173
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:32,520
Buddha nods sagely and says yes Jasmine Malik

174
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:37,839
is Right each person each person holds

175
00:38:37,839 --> 00:38:43,480
themselves most dear holds their life Central within themselves and the

176
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:52,160
significance of that is that this it's a basis for this profound empathy that all

177
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,920
people all beings are the center of their own lives their lives matter so much to to

178
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:06,599
them and that because of that this wish to be alive this wish to be happy no one

179
00:39:06,599 --> 00:39:12,880
should ever harm or kill another

180
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:19,880
so I tell this story knowing that self-love is kind of sometimes dismissed

181
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:27,560
as new age psycho Babble or a modern add-on to ancient Buddhism and it isn't

182
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:32,720
to hold oneself most dear on a conventional level it's not full

183
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:39,240
Awakening by any means however it's an assumed easy

184
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:46,480
basis for the profound cultivation of heart and mind it's the

185
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:53,599
beginning of meta loving kindness for oneself and all beings as

186
00:39:53,599 --> 00:40:01,880
all as to all as to oneself if this is challenging for you consider

187
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:09,240
that one of the most beautiful gifts you might be able to offer in your life is to cultivate healthy

188
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:15,440
self-regard not better than not worse than but

189
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:23,280
incomparable that kind of spiritual Assurance flows out to other people

190
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:30,200
overflows and lest there be protests in the audience want to note that healthy

191
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:36,280
self-regard is something that the Buddha exemplified on a relational level for 45

192
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:42,079
years of teaching well after he had penetrated to full Awakening Complete

193
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,920
deep Insight so if it's too heavy of a lift

194
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:55,800
or if it doesn't feel like a good fit it's okay to start elsewhere but to consider no matter how

195
00:40:55,800 --> 00:41:02,440
buried hidden disguised Ed Twisted that wish to live that wish to be happy

196
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:08,480
weaves through us all and it's the basis the beginning of

197
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:15,800
a profound empathy this kind of empathy the pow

198
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:22,000
anukampa is a spontaneous quivering or movement of the heart a caring

199
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:28,480
impulse a wish for non-harming and it can manifest as

200
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,920
helping yesterday I talked about the tale of suata in the Buddha this woman

201
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:40,160
who walked by and noticed the Buddha to be practically starving and fed him out

202
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:46,880
of compassion kindness ANUK the heart

203
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:54,200
qualities meta loving kindness karuna compassion appreciative joy mudita and

204
00:41:54,200 --> 00:42:02,000
UPA equinity those can all emerge naturally through mindfulness practice

205
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:08,200
dedicated Buddhist practice and they can be cultivated directly as many of you already know

206
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:15,440
through intentional practices for many mindfulness is enough at first and

207
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:23,520
then it could be skillful to interweave direct cultivation of the heart

208
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:29,319
qualities this can be through directed attention with phrases through radiating

209
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:36,920
broadly or through more receptive forms of noticing like we did today noticing

210
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:43,520
in the meditation they've been covered extensively these practices elsewhere

211
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:49,040
including by Liz Powell earlier this spring so I'm not really going to go into them I'm just going to touch on

212
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:55,800
them and how they fit into these Wells Springs of wellbeing for a few

213
00:42:55,800 --> 00:43:01,520
minutes so first to say that the

214
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:08,040
immeasurables the Brahma viharas predated Buddhism they were considered four

215
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,760
facets of brma the ground of all being the Creator in

216
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:19,960
Hinduism but later the Buddha operationalized them as practices

217
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:27,559
and they became known as Divine abodes Divine abiding because they are so Sublime and so powerful at the upper

218
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:33,160
reaches of their cultivation from a Buddhist perspective

219
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:39,800
these are ways of inclining the Mind towards the qualities helpful for

220
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:45,440
Liberation and they can also just arise spontaneously the

221
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:52,079
expression of an awake aware heart and mind towards whatever is arising and

222
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,680
experience if you picture clear light a Sunbeam shining through a

223
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:04,000
prism the awakened awareness is the clear light

224
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:09,359
when it strikes the prism it fractures into these different qualities of the

225
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:15,960
rainbow and these colors are different Expressions based

226
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,640
on conditions of the world different expressions of awakeness

227
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,680
awareness responsivity so the first loving

228
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:33,640
kindness is a baseline friendliness towards self others and

229
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:39,319
experience compassion is when that same responsive heart's

230
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:43,200
awareness responds to

231
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:51,760
suffering appreciative Joy is the response the healthy awake

232
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:58,119
response aware response when others experience Good Fortune good good things

233
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:03,200
like celebrating the success of a child or a grandchild or a friend you're

234
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:09,359
rooting for and then equinity is the awakened response to

235
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:15,599
that which cannot change ESS

236
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:20,880
space and finally gratitude are what some call the fifth B

237
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,640
of vihara and it's kind of a dimension it's so closely related to this quality

238
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:33,760
of appreciative Joy gratitude could be considered inner and outer directed

239
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:40,599
appreciative joy for our own good fortune and those conditions or people

240
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:46,920
that caused it even if it's very modest Good Fortune it's a very beautiful

241
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:53,880
onward leading quality so how is this wealth inner

242
00:45:53,880 --> 00:46:01,839
wealth well in addition to being beautiful in their own right and wonderful experiences to

243
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:10,800
have ancient commentaries and science kind of document some of the benefits of

244
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:16,400
these that a person according to the ancient text is beloved by humans and

245
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:24,119
animals alike and this manifests as greater interpersonal Harmony social lubrication

246
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:31,720
group cohesion which has been documented in metaanalyses of people practicing heart

247
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:38,599
practices after just 6 weeks many people experience more joy and satisfaction in

248
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:46,240
their relationships both the ancient texts and science agree that attentional

249
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:55,119
control and concentration improve immune response improves and a greater sense

250
00:46:55,119 --> 00:47:01,920
purpose so in short cultivating strong heart qualities whether through mindfulness or direct practices

251
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:09,359
nourishes our minds our emotional lives and relationships it's a form of true

252
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:16,880
wealth and it can culminate Express in a freedom chti of

253
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:23,079
the heart in which no one is better than worse than or even equal

254
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:28,880
to and this is also an enduring understanding that the awakened heart

255
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:34,880
fully awakened people have and Liberation that liberation of the heart

256
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:42,800
is something that I will touch on tomorrow so thank you for your kind

257
