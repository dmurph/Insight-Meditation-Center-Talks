1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:09,840
so hello everyone and special welcome to your bodies

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,920
the theme of the week is is uh the different

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:21,920
perspectives by which we can be in our bodies experience our bodies

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:28,720
and how this perspective can change radically depending on the state of the mind

5
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:35,200
and uh the fact that our body experience the body can be so radically different

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:40,640
uh depending on the mind suggests that um

7
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:47,520
our experience of it is not stable but any particular experience of

8
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:53,120
the body we have is um is

9
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:59,440
conditional is contingent is the coming together of various factors

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:05,198
including the state of the mind meditation qualities of our mind

11
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:10,960
and that our relationship to this changing shifting

12
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:17,200
amorphous experience of the body uh can be one of peace

13
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,680
a kind of a radical piece to peaceful about the body not troubled by it

14
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:29,920
and there is a teaching about the body that

15
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:36,720
has brought a tremendous level of peace to some people and maybe

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,399
it's uh brings that peace when the mind is already quite tranquil and peaceful

17
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:48,159
so it might require a certain state of mind to hear this teaching so that

18
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,799
it really penetrates or releases something and that's the teaching

19
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:01,600
that this body is not yours that your hair is not your your face is

20
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,840
not you your body shape is not you your teeth are not

21
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:12,640
you can go on on the list and um

22
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:17,920
and in some ways it flies against the convention we have of identifying

23
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:25,520
with our bodies and that's and it's certainly true to some degree these are part of who we are

24
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,840
but when we mind is quite peaceful we see that the activity of claiming

25
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:38,879
this body to be me the activity of identifying with the body is this is who i am

26
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,959
is um unnecessary in fact to do so

27
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:51,120
uh is agitating and to realize this body is not me to

28
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,800
cease to give up to the incest identifications assess and kind of

29
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,480
defining oneself by one body it can be very freeing

30
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,599
so that's a little bit the background for today's meditation

31
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,400
and uh so to begin

32
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:21,599
and with this body that

33
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:30,319
you are the caretaker of this body that you've received from all

34
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,360
the elements that from this earth

35
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:42,480
that have combined to build up this body we are made of parts of the earth and will return to

36
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,519
the earth when we die so this body that we care for

37
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:57,120
assuming a comfortable alert meditation posture

38
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,360
feeling the weight of the body the substance of the body

39
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:13,519
feeling how the weight of the body settles on what supports it the chair

40
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,840
your cushion the floor wherever you are

41
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:23,759
feel how this your weight is received by some

42
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,919
object that's holding you up

43
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,400
lower the gaze of your eyes to 45 degrees down

44
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,560
into

45
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,479
and then gently closing your eyes

46
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:23,360
and taking a few long slow deep breaths

47
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:30,639
where our volition our decision to breathe deeply

48
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,120
is directed to the body through inviting the body

49
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,039
to take some deep breaths

50
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,320
and to relax on the exhale

51
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:14,400
letting your breathing return to normal

52
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:22,960
and on the exhale relax and release whatever holding that

53
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:28,720
can be released whatever tension you have is not you you

54
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:35,600
are not your attention because if you were when your attention

55
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:41,080
releases where are you

56
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:02,160
relaxing the face the shoulders the belly the arms the hands

57
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,840
wherever you can relax and as you relax

58
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,759
see if you can the same place that you relax if you can feel like you're relaxing into

59
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,560
peace or tranquility

60
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:59,039
feeling the in-breath the out breath feeling the bodies

61
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,199
expand and contract as you breathe

62
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:17,919
in his sense you are not your inhale because if you were then you wouldn't

63
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:25,160
exist on the exhale you are not the exhale

64
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:35,200
but the inhale and exhale is where you can relax and focus

65
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,479
ground yourself in the changing nature of the present

66
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,479
moment

67
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,600
as you exhale see if there can be a letting go of the

68
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:07,360
thinking mind letting go of thinking a calming of the thinking mind

69
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,720
the settling of the mind

70
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:50,360
it is a gift to the body

71
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:58,480
to leave it alone not always but

72
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:07,360
sometimes in meditation just to leave it alone without judgments

73
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,120
without claiming it

74
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,959
as mine and for me

75
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:28,558
without being at war with it opposed to it

76
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:34,480
wanting to fix it and change it just leaving the body alone

77
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,360
to have its own experience

78
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:59,760
and it's to give the body this freedom from our attachments

79
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:06,080
freedom from our projections and entanglements

80
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:14,679
that's possible to do in meditation

81
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:27,640
especially if we can have insight understanding

82
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,360
that this body changing shifting

83
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:41,039
body is not you

84
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:44,639
you are not your body

85
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,960
you are not your face

86
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:57,799
you are not your eyes

87
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,960
you are not your hair

88
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:10,120
you are not your feet

89
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,360
you are not your legs

90
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,799
you are not your torso

91
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:29,720
you are not your arms and hands

92
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:57,120
and as it's not you

93
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:08,960
to let go of defining yourself by your body

94
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:19,600
freeze the mind of the body and freeze the body of the

95
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:21,840
mind

96
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:51,039
letting go of all identification with the body

97
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:56,919
so the body can have its own experience

98
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:08,120
and you not defined by the body

99
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,600
so

100
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:55,600
one of the things we can learn from meditation

101
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,559
is to give time and space and

102
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:06,720
to the body to settle to open

103
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:13,360
to heal we can offer our patients

104
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:19,799
we can offer our non-identification non-reactivity

105
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:27,279
learning that meditation is a training for doing that in our life

106
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:33,039
with other people to give others the gift of

107
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:39,279
space and time our patience our non-identification

108
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:42,279
non-reactivity

109
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:53,039
to make room for others by speaking a little less

110
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:56,600
being more attentive

111
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:06,240
being quieter stiller just so we can take in and feel and

112
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:13,039
sense others in a deeper way and maybe the gift to them is that they

113
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:19,279
can relax and feel comfortable feel safe

114
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:23,679
feel heard and feel respected

115
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,440
may it be that will be learned from meditation in many in some way or other in many

116
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:37,440
ways we can think and reflect how it could

117
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:43,039
support us in our interpersonal lives

118
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:49,360
how the benefits of meditation can be shared with others out into the world

119
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:54,720
rippling out from us wide and far

120
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:01,279
may our meditation practice of our seven aim community

121
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:09,120
spread from each of us into the world to

122
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:17,600
support the happiness of others support others to feel safe

123
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:26,158
support others to be peaceful support others to be free

124
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:36,600
may we live for the welfare and happiness of everyone including ourselves

125
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:49,839
[Music]

126
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:06,240
so so far we've done we've talked about the karmic body the

127
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,919
joy body the tranquil body tranquil body

128
00:32:11,919 --> 00:32:19,039
and today i want to talk about the insight body and that is the way that their body

129
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:25,440
is experienced uh under the gaze of mindfulness and

130
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:32,640
when there's when we start having deep insight when the real ability to be quite very quiet in the mind

131
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:37,919
very little mental projections discussions going on in the mind so we

132
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:44,320
can settle back and just observe the body in a deep way to observe the body

133
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:51,039
unencumbered by our ideas of the body unencumbered by

134
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:58,080
our preoccupations our fears our judgments of the body

135
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,840
to kind of clear the clear the sight the inner sight the mind's eye

136
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:09,120
to perceive and sense the body in a

137
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:16,880
in and of itself and and so it's a it's a careful

138
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:24,720
sensitivity to the changing fluid quality of the body's experience of

139
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:32,799
itself our senses the nerve endings that pick up all the different sensations that we

140
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:39,200
feel in our body are operating kind of all the time

141
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,559
but certain things come into prominence and then are there for a while and then

142
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:50,559
fade and something else comes into prominence and then fades and and there's a constant shifting of what we

143
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,720
of what comes into experience in our body on top of that the body shifts and

144
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:03,600
changes uh we uh in the course of a single meditation practice maybe the body is gotten

145
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:10,240
relaxed maybe occasionally it's gotten more tense it shifted changed changed

146
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,000
maybe over a course of a year or two your body's gotten older and

147
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:23,358
and certain things have shifted to changes about how you are and you can feel the changes and goes on

148
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:29,520
part of the inside body is to have a quiet mind

149
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:36,560
a relatively quiet mind focused mind settled here in the present moment that's observing the changing

150
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,960
nature of the body and and at some point we realize as word sit

151
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:48,720
down and relax that in fact all the exp the so-called experiences we have the

152
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:56,480
body all the ways in which we can know and feel the body directly is constantly shifting and changing

153
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:03,119
it's a kaleidoscope it's a it's a process it's a constant flow it's a stream of

154
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:09,040
sensations stream of experience that's shifting and changing and moving

155
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:15,280
and when this first happens in meditation it usually comes when the mind the body

156
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:22,560
meditation is somewhat concentrated often happening happening in the wake of something like the joy

157
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:28,640
body there can be a lot of joy and subtleness maybe even some peace

158
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:36,079
that comes first and that allows the mind the thinking mind to quiet more and more

159
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:43,200
and the advantage of that is the thinking mind then is not projecting its ideas onto the body

160
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,320
the mind has a lot of ideas some of them which are not so accurate

161
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:53,680
ideas of permanence like this is always going to be this way you know that

162
00:35:53,680 --> 00:36:00,079
i'll always be this way and and the body won't be unchanging and then the body changes

163
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,800
sometimes suddenly in an accident or something an injury sometimes it's slow and gradual

164
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:14,800
and um i've known i've been blessed with being able to sit cross-legged into my old age

165
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:20,720
but i have wonderful colleagues deep meditators wonderful meditation teachers

166
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:27,440
who started this way when they were young sitting cross-legged and now they sit in chairs

167
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:33,599
and um it's fine to sit in the chair but it's just an example of the body changes and

168
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:39,040
so we're kind of there to feel and sense and and adapt

169
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,520
ourselves to the changes but the changing the changing stream of

170
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:51,599
experience when it's an insight body is not the changes that we see over

171
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:58,079
extended period of time but rather it's kind of like looking at a river and seeing that the surface of the river the

172
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:05,119
current is constantly shifting and changing and flowing and so at some point this body of ours

173
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,920
without the projection of thoughts and ideas that we overlay on it begins to reveal itself

174
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:18,720
in kind of its native capacity native expression

175
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:25,440
which is all this changing fluid moving field of sensations that the nerve

176
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:31,680
endings take in and process and with each nerve ending

177
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:39,200
taking in a particular data point and then we feel the individual data

178
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:46,560
points coming and going as a sound there's a itch there's a feeling of warmth there's a tightness

179
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:53,200
and and then we feel into these deeper and deeper and we find that within each one

180
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:59,040
there's something that's constantly in flux and moving a fascinating place for some people who

181
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:06,079
do vipassana practice is to do this with pain i've done it with a variety of pains but

182
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:12,480
with knee pain is most classic for me and to bring my attention very carefully

183
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:19,839
that non-reactive attention the attention is not afraid or angry reactive to the pain

184
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:27,280
there's not projecting ideas that oh i'm going to hurt forever or i can't do this or this is terrible i'm probably

185
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:32,560
going to have to have my leg amputated all these kind of or self-pity was one

186
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:39,280
that i used to have when i was younger oh poor me that's in pain but to somehow have the mind that kind

187
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:46,240
of uh projection or or veil between us and the pain be put

188
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:53,599
aside and just experience the pain in and of itself and find out exactly where it is in the

189
00:38:53,599 --> 00:38:59,200
knee it's fascinating as we get closer to it maybe it's a little square centimeter it

190
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,280
may be it's not always in the same place it's moving around it's pulsing and

191
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,040
sparking and shifting and dancing around and we get closer and closer we see

192
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:16,560
that's not the solid pain that we might have thought it was from the distance when we were reactive to it

193
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,079
concerned about it it's not a solid unchanging pain in fact

194
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:28,079
maybe we shouldn't even call it pain because pain is kind of an abstraction

195
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:35,119
uh an abstract kind of umbrella term because underneath that label there is uh uh

196
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:40,640
uh pulling and stabbing and burning and

197
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:46,160
uh and uh and uh you know pressure and tightness and all

198
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:53,520
these kinds of more particular sensations that are intense the intensity because of the intensity

199
00:39:53,520 --> 00:40:00,800
of it we call it pain but pain is made up of many different kinds of sensations

200
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:07,119
not every pain but the different kind of pains we have are made up of different sensations that are intense

201
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:13,520
and so to bring our attention just to that particular sensation and see the dance of it the spark of it and the

202
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:19,040
movement of it and see that it's not so solid sometimes it's a lot easier to be

203
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:25,040
present for but it was very difficult to be present for something that we're kind of apart from

204
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:31,520
and we see it though the pain much easier to feel it in a deeper level

205
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:37,680
underneath that idea and the pulsing searing burning sparking stabbing

206
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:44,240
intense you know feelings but it sounds terrible these words but it sometimes it's a lot easier

207
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,839
than just relating to it as the pain even more difficult is when we relate to

208
00:40:49,839 --> 00:40:56,800
the pain as my pain i'm having pain when we add the baggage

209
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:02,800
the association of me myself and mine to the pain we're adding another

210
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:09,839
layer of obstruction which is accurate enough but it's not really needed and it does

211
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:16,640
involve a different order of the mind mental activity which keeps us removed keeps us reactive keeps us

212
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:22,640
actually increases the level of pain sometimes and you might experiment with feeling

213
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:28,160
the shifting changing pulsing nature of pain and see the difference between

214
00:41:28,160 --> 00:41:33,440
viewing it as my pain or viewing this thought pain

215
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:39,040
but it's not just pain that we see the shifting stuff it's just that's an interesting exercise to do it in

216
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:44,800
but uh even pleasure you could feel a pleasure as a meditative pleasure if you really tune

217
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,839
into what it's like it's a stream it's a flow it's a glow it's a shifting and changing phenomenon

218
00:41:51,839 --> 00:42:00,000
the inside body is when we experience the body but it's all everything is flowing

219
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:05,040
some people would describe the body as being like um um

220
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:12,000
sand you know sand you know sand or or rain or snow kind of flowing down all these little

221
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:18,000
particulates kind of flow of particulate sensations that was flowing and moving

222
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:24,880
and and and so and when it gets really deep this

223
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:31,040
kind of inside body there is the boundaries of the body the shape of

224
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,319
the body has no meaning anymore it just uh it's oftentimes the body feels kind

225
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:42,000
of boundary-less or just it's irrelevant the sense of boundaries of the body and

226
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,400
the shape of the body the all kinds of the ideas of body fall away

227
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,480
uh just settling into the raw data of the senses that senses provide that

228
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:00,800
are constantly shifting and moving in that raw data that's where

229
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:05,920
the in this insight body that's where there's a particular unique

230
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:12,079
flavor to the insight into not-self where we see that in this

231
00:43:12,079 --> 00:43:17,599
the whole body experience is just a flow of these sensations

232
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:23,520
any one sensation be clear that's not myself that you know if that was the case

233
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:29,680
when that sensation disappears i would disappear too in a sense but you realize that's not the self

234
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:37,040
that's not the self and this freeing up of the movement of the mind to this is me this is myself this is mine

235
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:42,960
is very freeing for the mind very relaxing and peacemaking and

236
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:49,280
and so to begin recognizing the not-self of this whole field

237
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,839
of the body sensations as it flows is part of the insight body

238
00:43:55,839 --> 00:44:01,200
and part of that inside body also is is then to realize that any clinging to

239
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:08,480
it is uh is pointless or is painful it's not really necessary

240
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:13,920
and that's kind of like if you have a put your hand it's the waterfall of water coming down

241
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,720
and you put your hand in the waterfall to grab some water you might get a little bit on your hand but you're done but

242
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:27,839
but it all gets squeezed out and and um and you can't really grab a whole bunch of you know handful of water

243
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:34,720
and so you realize this movement of grabbing doesn't work and so this inside body

244
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:41,119
is um when we're seeing this radical nature of change is a powerful

245
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:48,400
way of learning not to identify with our experience and beginning to have an experience of life

246
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:55,280
without the filter or the burden of identification and it's a powerful lesson in the

247
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,960
possibility of non-clinging that the the things we cling to are unreliable

248
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:08,079
unsatisfactory that it just brings more suffering to cling and to see that for oneself when we're

249
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:13,680
sitting in the inside body then it's it's uh

250
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:21,280
obvious it's not a logic it's not rational it's i mean it's not because you've reasoned it out

251
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:28,559
and not because you read it in a book it's just it's so clear and obvious this is how it is

252
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,760
and and that's the direction that insight meditation is going

253
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:39,520
someday you know really beginning to taste or feel this insight body

254
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:44,720
that is again a very different way of experiencing the body than the karmic

255
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:51,119
body which tends to be the one that solidifies and uh it carries the burden of all these

256
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:57,760
uh projections and reactions and identifications that we have

257
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,720
so the insight body

258
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:10,240
so i hope this comes you come to appreciate

259
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:15,280
and value and care respectfully for these bodies that we

260
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:20,720
have and by not identifying with being mine

261
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:26,560
it is also your [Music] your part of this universe

262
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:34,440
for you to care for care for your body care for yourself thank you
