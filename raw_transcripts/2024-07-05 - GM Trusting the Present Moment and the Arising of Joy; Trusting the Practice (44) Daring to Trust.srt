00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,719
greetings dear ones this week we've been exploring what

2
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:16,600
it means to have trust in the practice and for this we also need to

3
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:22,119
trust the present moment when awareness is well

4
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:28,960
established it becomes possible to just remain receptively aware of the present

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,439
moment in whatever way it

6
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:42,239
arises when we trust our practice we express that by saying yes to the

7
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:50,399
present moment whatever arises we trust that it's

8
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:57,239
okay and also that we have the capacity to deal with

9
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:03,840
it no need for tuning out being here and

10
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:12,000
now resting the present moment is

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:18,520
also to trust the Dharma in our tradition the Dharma

12
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,920
refers not only to the teachings of the Buddha but also to trusting whatever is

13
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:30,240
on offer to us in each moment

14
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:36,240
if it feels right for you you could begin your meditations

15
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:44,240
with I surrender to the Dharma as a reminder to deeply

16
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,880
trust how things

17
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:56,439
unfold it's the tremendous relief when we can know and rest in the present

18
00:01:56,439 --> 00:02:02,079
moment without being triggered with judg ments

19
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:09,800
opinions selfing and the body breathing is the

20
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,319
place where we train ourselves to calm down enough to settle

21
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:20,640
the mind so that we can begin resting

22
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,360
peacefully in the present

23
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:36,120
moment in our meditation yesterday we practiced calming the whole body

24
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:41,480
while staying present with the [Music]

25
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:49,000
breathing in the scheme of anapanasati deeply calming the body gives rise to

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,720
experiencing joy and the Buddha's next

27
00:02:55,720 --> 00:03:01,480
instructions after calming the body are

28
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,080
one trains I will breathe in experiencing

29
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:14,799
Joy one trains I will breathe out experiencing

30
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,959
Joy you may wonder why does the Buddha encourage us

31
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:28,879
to train by experiencing [Music] Joy with the momentum of the meditation

32
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:36,760
practices we done this week culminating in deep relaxation of the

33
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:44,799
body Joy can often arise quite spontaneously at least in a subtle

34
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:52,760
form also since we're reward-based

35
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,480
creatures our ability to remain anchored in the present moment is

36
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,879
strengthened when we perceive our experience as

37
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,640
pleasant noticing these subtle Pleasant feeling tones in

38
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:17,439
meditation can then serve as a foundation for the arising of

39
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:26,160
joy and this creates another virtuous cycle where joy and turn boosts our

40
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,720
ability to stay in our lived experience

41
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:43,680
so to begin our [Music] meditation calmly closing the

42
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:50,360
eyes and ex assuming a posture that expresses your highest

43
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,360
aspiration

44
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,600
gently straightening the spine perhaps imagining that you're held

45
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,919
up by An Invisible Thread suspending your

46
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:24,039
head from the crown from the sky all the way down to the

47
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:31,800
toes so take a moment now to do a slow gentle body

48
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:39,840
scan from the crown of the head all the way down to the

49
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,600
feet e

50
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,240
establishing your priority to leave all your concerns

51
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:43,120
outside the door and to stay grounded in embodied

52
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:51,039
awareness asking yourself if you can trust abiding in the present

53
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:56,440
moment letting go of past and future

54
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,080
just staying with this body

55
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,479
breathing e

56
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,320
when you're settled enough and comfortable trusting the present

57
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:09,079
moment you can try the fifth step in the Buddhist instructions on mindfulness of

58
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:15,519
breathing in which he says one trains I will

59
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:25,160
experience I will breathe in experiencing Joy one trains I will breathe out

60
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:29,120
experiencing Joy

61
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:41,360
if you've never trained by experiencing Joy you might

62
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,920
formulate this simple aspiration May Joy

63
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:53,800
arise and then remain receptively open to whatever

64
00:09:53,800 --> 00:10:03,920
happens allowing space in the mind for joy to man EST in whatever form it may

65
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:35,760
take tension or becoming distracted will prevent Joy from

66
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:44,720
arising but just knowing our distractions or tensions and relaxing them may suffice

67
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:47,920
for joy to our

68
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:02,279
rides e

69
00:11:52,839 --> 00:12:01,519
I found that in times when grief is front and center in in the

70
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:10,079
mind experiencing Joy during meditation May well be

71
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:18,040
unavailable in this case we may still be able to find peace in the Present

72
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:24,560
Moment by cultivating our inner contentment which is

73
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:32,160
softer and quieter than Joy e

74
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:18,240
so staying in the body and staying with the

75
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:27,600
breathing letting the mind be open to the arising of

76
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120
joy

77
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,079
e e

78
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,440
giving yourself permission to Simply

79
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:58,040
Be and most of all enjoy your [Music]

80
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
meditation

81
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959

00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:11,559
caring for ourselves for everyone here

110
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:15,480
meditating and for all

111
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:23,600
beings may all beings be safe and

112
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:30,159
protected being safe may all beings including

113
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:39,840
ourselves be happily at ease may we all abide in

114
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:46,320
peace and may all beings everywhere be

115
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:55,320
free so to end our meditation let's all join our hands

116
00:29:55,320 --> 00:30:03,000
together and bow to one another to honor everyone in this

117
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,399
beautiful

118
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:30,960
SAA e

119
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:14,799
greetings everyone quite a few of you expressed

120
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:22,960
interest in the chat yesterday in having the text of the peach blossoms poem by

121
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:29,440
dogen that I read so at the end of The Talk

122
00:31:29,440 --> 00:31:35,880
the audio visual team will kindly put it up in the chat for

123
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:42,559
you we started last week with training in

124
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:52,159
emptiness well trusting the present moment as we meditate has a lot to do with trusting

125
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:58,760
emptiness we constantly project our ideas Concepts

126
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:04,159
memories and associations onto

127
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:14,320
reality so we need to first of all see that our discursive thinking is not

128
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:22,000
reality and then Savor those moments when we're no longer projecting self and

129
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:28,360
permanence onto our experience because that's

130
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,559
when there's a possibility for the mind to really

131
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:37,880
relax and let go in a deep

132
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:46,850
way relaxing with insight into Emptiness is one of the conditions for

133
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:54,399
[Music] awakening venerable analio says that

134
00:32:54,399 --> 00:33:01,080
compassion and emptiness are like two sides of the same coin as we

135
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:05,039
practice they start to

136
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:15,840
interpenetrate so being okay with not okay is the beginning of Learning

137
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:26,120
self-compassion and when the mind is compassionate it's boundless

138
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:35,000
y says that all the wisdom all the Insight we need for

139
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:42,000
enlightenment will only be found when we're able to stay in the

140
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:50,480
present it's a profound thing for the body and mind to come to

141
00:33:52,559 --> 00:34:00,200
rest when momentarily we're not caught in wanting this and that a

142
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:07,039
sense of well-being and contentment with what

143
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:13,638
naturally arises can

144
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:23,800
arise the contentment of knowing that just being alive is

145
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:32,000
enough with nothing to improve to apologize for or to

146
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:38,720
defend this then inspires confidence which then circles

147
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:45,000
back and further inspires us to be present for this lived

148
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:49,118
life as we're living it right

149
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:56,760
now a Monday I shared with you the quote from the Buddha in which he assures us

150
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:03,440
speak or act with a peaceful mind and happiness follows like a never

151
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:09,119
departing Shadow but our ancestors have given us

152
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:16,520
powerful DNA which tells us that we need to stay stressed in fight ORF flight

153
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:23,720
mode rather than allowing the mind to rest peacefully in

154
00:35:25,079 --> 00:35:31,760
spaciousness but when everything becomes our friend we can then dare to

155
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:38,640
trust letting go into the present moment and we have the

156
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:45,599
support for developing lasting happiness our

157
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:50,960
practice is to untie The Big Knot of

158
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:59,640
selfing and we need Serenity as the foundation and preparation for insight

159
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:06,240
if the Mind remains contracted it's easily

160
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:14,040
Disturbed but if we have a big skylike mind many things can

161
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:22,280
arise and the mind is able to hold them all without being

162
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:32,240
disturbed however if we don't tame the elephant of the mind to be

163
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:38,359
confident calm imperturbable and [Music]

164
00:36:38,359 --> 00:36:45,319
peaceful we'll never dare to trust ourselves or to trust the Dharma of the

165
00:36:45,319 --> 00:36:52,839
present moment Yong

166
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:58,160
Ming tells us if you're determined to think of

167
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:06,560
yourself as limited fearful vulnerable or scarred by past

168
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:12,200
experience know only that you have chosen to do

169
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:17,920
so and that the opportunity to experience yourself differently is

170
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:23,520
always available when you enter the path of

171
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:31,559
Buddhist practice you're ending and abuse Ive relationship with

172
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:38,480
yourself so this is a strong statement but I think what Ming rache is trying to

173
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:44,119
convey is that we can choose

174
00:37:46,319 --> 00:37:53,520
Freedom Gil teaches that the foundation for a practice is knowing sensing or

175
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,760
feeling and relaxing

176
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:07,760
this can provide a radical change from how we usually live our lives because the process of knowing sensing and

177
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,280
relaxing can be free of any pressure or

178
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:18,720
projections and in and of itself just knowing and sensing can be

179
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:29,319
peaceful thanful spacious opening us up to a wider world

180
00:38:30,319 --> 00:38:36,119
so be patient with your clinging when we dare to trust ourselves

181
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:41,160
in our practice then we become a beautiful

182
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:48,359
witness and we can see the beauty inside ourselves and in the

183
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:55,680
world we can trust relaxing into this marvelous body of

184
00:38:56,200 --> 00:39:01,640
ours we dare opening up to the vastness

185
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:07,760
of a spacious mind and to the joy of inner

186
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:15,760
goodness when the mind is at least temporarily free of greed hate and

187
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:24,160
delusion in this practice of embodied awareness we're letting go of the

188
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:31,359
holding and identification that freeze the mind and the

189
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:38,520
Heart everyone is looking for a safe

190
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:46,440
place and we can know the real safe place is within us all the

191
00:39:47,319 --> 00:39:53,359
time the well-being of our Pure innate

192
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,400
awareness is our safety

193
00:39:59,079 --> 00:40:04,720
and we begin to be less driven wanting to be someone to

194
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:09,880
accomplish results there's a big difference between

195
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:16,400
setting a powerful aspiration and trying to get

196
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:21,560
somewhere as mammals our biological instructions for

197
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:29,318
survival are to be goal oriented and to lean into the future

198
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:37,070
and our culture teaches us to keep on focusing on getting the next task

199
00:40:37,070 --> 00:40:42,400
[Music] done as a

200
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:48,400
consequence many of us have internalized endless striving

201
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:51,640
consciously or

202
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:02,920
unconsciously The Reptilian part of the brain tells us to remain stressed and

203
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:12,280
fearful the neuros psychologist Rick Hansen author of Buddhist

204
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:18,400
brain says the Mind tends to transfer unfulfilled needs from

205
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:26,599
childhood into the present needs such as to be safe worthy

206
00:41:26,599 --> 00:41:33,640
successful or loved and what's surprising is that

207
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:40,880
these ancient longings often continue even we've after we've already

208
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,599
resolved the original

209
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:56,920
issues it's important how we live in this troubled world we know that everything we think

210
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:03,078
say say and do is influencing the world around

211
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:12,440
us and I'm convinced that the practice we're all engaged in is teaching

212
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:20,040
us how we can live for the benefit of all beings

213
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:38,559
I'll close with the beautiful atmology of the English word

214
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:47,480
arrive it comes from the old French AR which means to come to

215
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:53,040
land and this in turn comes from the Latin to touch the

216
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:58,559
shore after a long Voyage at sea

217
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:07,359
in our meditation today we practice trusting the present moment and

218
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:14,720
cultivating joy and if you'd like some more

219
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:21,480
homework after this week you're invited to adopt the

220
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:28,000
Mantra relax you've arrived

221
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:38,160
whenever you see that the body is moving a bit too fast or you feel uh a little

222
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:48,520
stressed so the homework going forward is simply to

223
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:54,280
relax and Trust

224
00:43:54,280 --> 00:44:03,319
knowing that you've already arrived on the other shore of supreme

225
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:17,200
safety thank you for your P participation this week thank you for your practice
