00:00:02,179 --> 00:00:07,160
so hello everyone and

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,080
and as we begin the meditation I want to suggest that um

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,180
especially when we're this week considering fear

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:26,340
that meditation is meant to be done

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:33,000
in a location in time when it is safe

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,780
it's not always possible of course but ideally

7
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:44,460
that here and now is a safe place

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:51,780
and that are safe enough that you don't have to solve

9
00:00:51,780 --> 00:01:00,000
anything that you're afraid of you don't have to fix it you don't have to figure out how to deal with it

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:08,780
and that's true for almost anything that the meditation is the time when it's appropriate to not need to think about

11
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:14,760
the rest of your life about even big issues or small issues or

12
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:20,580
what you're you know what you're going to have for supper or anything at all

13
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,920
and it doesn't mean you won't do those things it doesn't mean you won't have fear or have

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,280
concerns that are not here but because you're clear when you sit

15
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,759
down and you look around the place you're at that here and now nothing is needed

16
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:44,939
it's the opportunity to look upon what's happening in a new way

17
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:50,659
and that new way for some of us would be to not fix anything

18
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:57,899
not analyze it but per se not judge it

19
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:05,399
um but also not to participate in it to be able to meet our inner life in a

20
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,940
new way and the new way that Alexa suggests today is maybe not so new for some of

21
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:21,300
you is to meet yourself meet whatever is happening

22
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:29,040
with a silent mind with a quiet mind a Calm Mind

23
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:36,120
even if you can only manage it for half a second but the idea is to meet and encounter

24
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:43,080
your experience in a very different way and this Quiet Mind is not meant to be

25
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:49,140
disrespectful but rather respecting what's happening so you can

26
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:54,739
hold it and be with it in a new way in a different way

27
00:02:54,739 --> 00:03:00,180
and what I like to do I like to refer to it sometimes that there are times in

28
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,420
life when it's appropriate for us to be quiet because the situation has called

29
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:11,819
upon us to support or to meet or to attend or to

30
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:19,319
receive what's happening in that silence sometimes uh you know the big turning

31
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:26,760
points in life that way young children putting a child to bed a young you know

32
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,900
a toddler to bed and be or when they're napping and getting really quiet going into a library

33
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,840
going to a funeral going into a Sacred Space someplace and

34
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,060
we allow ourselves to get quiet going into a majestic place in nature

35
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:50,580
and we allow ourselves to get quiet to feel it and sense what's going on

36
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,400
to maybe sit and have tea and look at the full moon

37
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:04,620
so there's many things that allows us to become quiet and um so to become quiet

38
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:12,599
to meet whatever is happening with a quiet mind maybe a maybe the silent mind

39
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:17,880
or maybe if the mind could not become quiet and silent

40
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:24,479
become aware with that form of awareness that attentiveness

41
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:32,479
that is quiet so if this makes sense

42
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:39,240
we'll start and we'll see that this ability to

43
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,699
attend to meet to hold to be present for things

44
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:52,220
with a quiet mind or a quiet attention opens a door to a vast

45
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:57,919
wise deep way of living Our Lives it's not

46
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:05,400
superficial it's not truncating experience it actually allows something really profound to begin happening

47
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:10,880
so in this sitting perhaps um

48
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:18,660
the um maybe experiment C

49
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,660
where can you sit how can you sit with whatever is happening with a quiet mind

50
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:30,660
and maybe it's just for a moment and then do it again and I'll guide you

51
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:36,000
a little bit here at the beginning so to

52
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:44,479
take an upright posture literally or metaphorically

53
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,160
and gently closing the eyes

54
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,740
and the right off the bat taking a

55
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:08,880
caring respectful scan through your body

56
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:16,740
to feel and sense what's happening for you and seeing you if you can do that

57
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:21,080
with a quiet mind a silent mind

58
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:34,440
the kind of Silence it maybe allows you to be more sensitive to what's here notice

59
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:40,620
more the details scanning through your body feeling

60
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:43,759
what's here for you

61
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,620
and within this body taking two or three deep breaths and

62
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,300
relaxing as you exhale

63
00:07:18,419 --> 00:07:22,639
and then letting the breathing return to normal

64
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,440
hey

65
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:37,740
and as you exhale let the Mind become quiet let go of your

66
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:43,819
thoughts especially near the end of the exhale

67
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:52,020
let all the sinking mind becomes still and quiet or feel the Stillness and the quiet at

68
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:58,639
the end and then with that whatever Stillness

69
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:05,160
calm quiet you have feel what's happening for you

70
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:11,520
on the inhale feel the sensations of your body your

71
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:17,520
emotions just feel it respectfully

72
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,039
with as much of a quiet mind as you can

73
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:29,280
thoughts might return on the next exhale

74
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:37,399
let go of your thoughts and that's the Rhythm

75
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:44,519
Here and Now nothing you need to think about on the

76
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:51,480
exhale on the inhale feel more fully

77
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,820
as if you can listen deeply in that silence

78
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:02,720
to your breathing to your body your emotions

79
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:10,940
to your mind let go in the next exhale

80
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:21,560
so there's a rhythm of Letting Go and feeling letting go and knowing

81
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,899
gently repeatedly

82
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:44,959
letting their thinking mind become quiet on the exhale

83
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:54,660
and whatever you're supposed to feel on the inhale operate as if that's the only time it

84
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:59,899
needs is that moment those moments of inhaling

85
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:06,120
you know doesn't need any more just this

86
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:10,100
and then let go and the exhale

87
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:19,459
and if it's there again on the next inhale that's okay it's like a new time

88
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:33,180
and with the repeated doing this maybe you'll get into the Rhythm

89
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:39,180
Letting Go quieting and then respectfully feeling and

90
00:16:39,180 --> 00:16:46,740
sensing what's happening without thinking much about it

91
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:54,199
maybe staying close to the quiet and the calm damn

92
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,900
and if anything troubles you or is difficult

93
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,220
or activated

94
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:55,559
in this gentle way of practicing letting them thinking by and become

95
00:22:55,559 --> 00:23:01,860
quiet on the exhale and feelings with the body

96
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:07,919
what's here let what troubles you

97
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:14,000
feelings the sensations experience the direct experience

98
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:21,419
help it feel safe let yourself be safe

99
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:27,360
a safe place for what is

100
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:31,400
actually happening in you

101
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:37,759
the emotions the sensations

102
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:47,960
just the quiet the mind so you can work

103
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:54,620
feel what's happening letting it feel safe

104
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:04,460
it's okay for it to be there during this inhale

105
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,740
foreign

106
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:15,360
foreign

107
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:59,000
huh

108
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:37,799
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to

109
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:43,820
now on the exhale

110
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:49,580
let go into the world

111
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,539
as you inhale take this world in

112
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:03,240
its Joys and its sufferings challenges

113
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:12,000
and its wonderfulness take it all in and then in the exhale

114
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,100
let the breath be exhale

115
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:24,919
be your kindness

116
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:32,520
your care your gentleness take in the world and breathe out

117
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:37,880
kindness care

118
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:41,779
love compassion

119
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:54,240
May It Be that as our awareness our attention

120
00:29:54,240 --> 00:30:01,380
spreads out into the world that we're able to meet it

121
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:07,860
with our good will may all beings be happy

122
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:13,140
may all beings be safe

123
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:18,600
may all beings be peaceful

124
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:24,980
and may all beings be free

125
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:43,559
[Music]

126
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:13,919
so my internet here at IMC started being a little bit

127
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,380
not working uh during the end of that sitting and but I think that this all

128
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:25,620
worked on YouTube anyway so it seems to be working again now

129
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:31,799
so uh see all the greetings and thank you so I'm assuming that it all

130
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:39,080
worked fine for you and I'll start in a minute again

131
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,860
okay

132
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,760
so

133
00:32:17,399 --> 00:32:25,100
so what I said at the beginning of the meditation is quite important

134
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:31,440
or quite useful say it that way that meditation is a Time

135
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:38,340
to experience our life ourselves in a new way in a different way than as usual in

136
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:45,539
everyday life and um so in everyday life kind of the maybe

137
00:32:45,539 --> 00:32:52,519
generic version of it is we're doing things thinking about things taking care of things fixing things avoiding things

138
00:32:52,519 --> 00:33:00,299
concerned about things and and many of that stuff is purposeful

139
00:33:00,299 --> 00:33:07,080
is sometimes thinking about the future thinking about the past trying to change

140
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,440
something in meditation the idea is to have a very

141
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:21,539
different way of respecting our life as it's being lived it's not to deny anything but in a

142
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:27,480
sense to be present for it in a new way and maybe a radically new way

143
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:35,640
and so as we learn this new way of being present for experience we have available to us all kinds of new

144
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:41,820
possibilities new possibilities of understanding of wisdom of Investigation

145
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:49,559
of questioning our life in new ways and new ways of allowing a deep deep

146
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:58,320
much deeper processes within us to heal us to unfold us to grow Us in new ways

147
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:04,620
so the new way which is an ancient way

148
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:12,240
I think it can be represented by this idea of meeting our experience with a

149
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:19,200
quiet mind maybe a silent mind meeting our experience to be present for

150
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:26,760
it in a full way with a quietness of a of a clean window

151
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:33,500
a dirty window you maybe can't even see out but when the window has been cleaned

152
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:39,599
then the window itself is silent but the window enables us to really then

153
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:47,638
see clearly what's outside the window so as the awareness becomes quieter it

154
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:55,940
also the idea becomes clearer and we can see more fully what's here so in relationship to fear

155
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:03,000
to be to really be able to find a wise way in a creative way to be with fear

156
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:08,040
and find our way through fear and um this kind of new way of seeing is

157
00:35:08,040 --> 00:35:14,760
really useful and important the so when we sit to meditate

158
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:22,380
I ideally we're sitting in a place where Here and Now is safe

159
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:28,020
so we don't we're not the building is not burning down um

160
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:34,560
people are not attacking us it's just nothing's going to happen within reason

161
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:41,880
um now sitting here it's relatively safe and the reason to have that clarity about the safety of Here and Now

162
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,579
it might not be safe if you leave your place where you're sitting it might not be safe in an hour what you're going to

163
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:52,980
do but in the where you're sitting and uh

164
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:58,440
it's uh you become clear oh this is safe right now here and now

165
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:04,619
the advantage of that is then you can see notice that if there is fear

166
00:36:04,619 --> 00:36:10,200
it's not about Here and Now and so in a sense it doesn't have to be

167
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,599
figured out rather we want to meet it

168
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,960
fear is something that is we want to respect with our mindfulness something

169
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:28,920
we want to be present for not avoid not fix not try to attack

170
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:36,000
but to it's a very worthy focus of mindfulness for living a Deeper Life a

171
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:43,800
fuller life and so we want to be able to turn our attention and when fear is Salient if

172
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:50,180
here is the main is a strong experience or important enough to learn to bring the attention

173
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:56,160
mindfulness to feel the fear and it might be that you're sitting in a safe

174
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,500
place but for 30 minutes you're doing mindfulness of fear

175
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:06,720
and it might be time very well spent many people don't really stop and look

176
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:13,740
at fear the bumper sticker now would be um I break for fear I stop for fear

177
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:19,079
really stop and take a good look at it what what is this here

178
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:25,500
and the principle that I think is very powerful or the practice we're very powerful we're trying to do with fear is

179
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:31,619
when we're able to stop and really feel our fear feel it in an embodied way

180
00:37:31,619 --> 00:37:37,880
that we're trying to help our fear feel safe

181
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:43,200
so there might be a real cause for the fear it might be a real fear out in the

182
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:50,880
world in half an hour there might be something happening that's dangerous But Here and Now in this safe place that

183
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:58,920
we're in uh how can we help the fear feel safe how can we allow it to be there

184
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:05,280
and now and so it doesn't have this sense that we're it's wrong or it's bad

185
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,640
or we're trying to run away from it or trying to attack it and fix it like we're supposed to doing the

186
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:18,540
practice in order to get rid of it um the uh if you're if you're doing the

187
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:24,480
practice they get rid of it if you're going to anthropomorphize your fear a little bit the fear is not going to be

188
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:31,320
happy it's not going to be comfortable it's not going to feel like it's has a place it's going to feel unwanted it's going

189
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:37,740
to feel unrespected and so the idea to help the fear feel

190
00:38:37,740 --> 00:38:45,480
safe means to allow it to be there as if it now has time time in the sun of

191
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:51,660
awareness as if it's uh someone's never lived in the sun it's always been in the dark and

192
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:58,740
they finally able to come out in the sun then um you know it's like oh now let me take it in let me

193
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:05,900
you know receive it and so the son of awareness so that as if the fear has never been

194
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:13,200
seen really really not gotten to know the task is to get to know the fear to

195
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:21,720
recognize it to see it help the fear feel seen help the fear feel like it's

196
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:28,859
being known just like maybe for you if you're really anxious one day or really afraid a friend might come sit next to

197
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:34,859
you and see and say I see that you're really afraid I'll sit here with you would you like a

198
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:42,180
companion I'll just you know clear the friend is not fixing you or judging you for being afraid but they recognize it

199
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:49,200
and they're going to sit and be a safe person for you we then just be there with you and can accompany you and

200
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:56,820
having that company makes a world of difference so this new way is to accompany the fear

201
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:03,180
to be with it for a while and what this does is it allows the fear

202
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:10,740
a room to do what it needs to do to unfold to relax something begins to

203
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:16,260
shift and change when we give that kind of permission to for the fear to be there

204
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:23,280
and um and to give that kind of permission for the fear to be there and be known to be accompanied

205
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,619
it does help if we have a quiet quieter mind it doesn't have to be completely

206
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:36,420
silent but a quieter mind that's not ruminating and repeating stories and

207
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:43,859
judging and criticizing and all kinds of things that the extra things of mine doing the thinking mind is just almost

208
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:48,920
like they're saying they're there I'm here with you I see you

209
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:55,440
I'll be your companion here now let me feel you where the thinking mind is very

210
00:40:55,440 --> 00:41:01,319
gently saying where do I feel this in my body where does the fear lived

211
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:06,540
because one of the ways to help the fear feel safe and really be seen is to

212
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:13,140
recognize where it's being most activated in the body is it in the belly is in the chest and

213
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:18,240
the hands uh you know in the jaw where might it be

214
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:24,480
and and then bring a careful loving attention to that area

215
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,660
and the image that I like to use for that is cupping the hands together and holding something for underneath

216
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:35,819
that's just holding so holding the fear so sometimes I'll imagine my mindfulness

217
00:41:35,819 --> 00:41:43,079
my awareness is like this two hands that are coming together underneath wherever the fear is located in the body and

218
00:41:43,079 --> 00:41:49,800
holding it being with it as if it is allowed to be there forever

219
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:55,980
and uh so it's this is a radical different way of being with fear than most people know

220
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:02,880
if in doing that we start to panic it gets very uncomfortable to fear then it's not a

221
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:09,000
useful thing to do and then maybe we need to do something to settle the fear the quiet the fear maybe stop meditating

222
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,280
and and do something else but if that you're able to do that to

223
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:21,240
come and sit and be with the fear this allows us now to as I said allows

224
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:27,480
the fear to process itself which is often wiser than us processing it

225
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:32,880
more often than not the thinking mind is reactivating the fear and perpetuating

226
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:40,140
the fear so for the mind to be quiet to allows a fear to process itself

227
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:47,160
and then it also then begins helping us to do deeper mindfulness into the

228
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:53,480
Ecology of fear the different elements of it that are important to also pay attention to

229
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:59,700
besides just the direct experience of the fear and that'll be the topic for the next

230
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,980
couple of days and I'm hoping that this will also give you kind of a a new angle

231
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:10,500
New Perspective in which to look at fear because the old perspectives often keep

232
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:16,680
us trapped keep us caught in fear and um and fear anxiety can follow

233
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:25,079
someone along for decades and um and so to learn a new way is a

234
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:31,740
can be phenomenally useful so you might try over this next day if

235
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:38,579
you if you have some anxiety or fear pay attention look for it if it's easy

236
00:43:38,579 --> 00:43:45,060
to find great then you're on track if it's not easy to recognize then maybe you have to be extra sensitive so you

237
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:51,540
recognize where it might appear and um and so to and then see if it's a

238
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:57,540
situation allows for it to just stop and pause for a while and maybe sit down and close your eyes

239
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:04,079
and and see if you can spend some time helping the fear feel safe

240
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:10,079
you have to find where it is in the body to bring attention to it carefully and then maybe almost like you're

241
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:16,140
breathing through the fear with the fear as a way of accompanying it and helping it feel safe

242
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:22,500
it's almost like the breathing with it is kind of like it's okay now you're safe now you're safe here with me

243
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:29,780
and then see what happens to it with this kind of uh helping the fear feel safe practice

244
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:37,200
so um thank you and uh with that as a foundation I look forward

245
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:43,640
to what we'll be doing um the next couple of days thank you
