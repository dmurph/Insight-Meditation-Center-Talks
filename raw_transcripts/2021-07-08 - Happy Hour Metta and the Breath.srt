1
00:00:01,199 --> 00:00:06,879
okay got it here so hi hi formerly hello

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:15,280
and welcome to happy hour everyone so so for the theme for

3
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:22,000
our practice tonight um i wanted to bring in something that i

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,599
have recently learned from this book i've been reading called

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,200
breath by james nester i think i mentioned it some

6
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:41,200
sessions ago and um interesting fascinating book

7
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:48,079
um and one thing that's interesting is some some study

8
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:54,719
some research that he cites about um exhale

9
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,879
exhale being very important and salutory so i want to bring this theme in

10
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:06,400
together with our practice and and merge them together so here we go

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:13,200
so so what i knew but discovered again from this this book

12
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:20,240
is that we can only speak when we're exhaling we can't speak or sing

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:27,520
when we're inhaling inhale then we talk and then we take another inhale and

14
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,840
and um it turns out that uh again according to to some studies

15
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:41,360
that exhaling fully exhaling completely and elongating the exhale

16
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:49,119
can calm settle quiet the mind and have some effects

17
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:56,719
on not just breathing but the parasympathetic nervous system um

18
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:03,840
and and so physiologically can be supportive and helpful now combine that

19
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:11,440
with a tradition of chanting i'm not a big chanter but the big tradition of chanting in

20
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,720
both in buddhism and christianity and there are many different traditions in the world

21
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:26,959
and and it turns out that apparently um

22
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:32,879
five and a half in-breaths and out-breaths

23
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,480
per minute is kind of the optimal cycle and also some people some studies

24
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,760
suggest having a quicker in-breath and a longer out breath

25
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,760
so it turns out that what he was suggesting is that if you take some of the

26
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:56,239
famous familiar buddhist chants and christian chants they are roughly the same length the

27
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:02,720
length that it takes to do the chant is about five and a half six seconds

28
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:10,480
which translates to this five and a half in breast and out breaths per minute so oh i thought wow that's an interesting

29
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:15,840
um discovery a coincidence so i've been exploring this the past few days and

30
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,760
i've been chanting and and elongating my exhale

31
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,200
um and exploring the you know the calming physiological

32
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,620
effect with the cultivation of meta cultivation of goodwill cultivation of

33
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:40,480
[Music] well-being in a way while being internally well-being internal

34
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,120
externally for the benefit of all beings so this is the theme i'd like to explore

35
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,159
um invite us to explore together tonight and or this morning whatever

36
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,519
your time zone may be and see how it goes so

37
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:07,360
so um and given that our practice here primarily is about meta let us

38
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:14,159
explore let us play around with the metaphases elongating them as

39
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,600
if we were chanting singing them and you're welcome in the space you are to

40
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:26,960
either say them out loud if you want at first or maybe

41
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:34,320
kind of hear them in your mind um in your mind's ear uh but be silent but

42
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:41,759
kind of make your exhale elongated so this this idea of of well-being internally good will

43
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,360
internally goodwill externally so you know in the past we've played

44
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,759
around just to put this in perspective um when especially when we did the series

45
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:01,440
on meta we've explored images we've explored different nuances

46
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:08,160
of the words we have explored radiating we have explored so many things and now here

47
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,880
we're going to explore the breath the duration of the breath together with

48
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:22,560
wishing well for ourselves for others so something new

49
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,039
in this exploration i'm excited i've been having fun exploring it and excited to share it

50
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:34,320
with you so so

51
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,520
let's begin let's settle let's settle into

52
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:53,840
ah let's settle into our bodies

53
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:07,840
arriving arriving

54
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:16,319
feeling the breath feeling the breath

55
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:22,880
the in-breath and the out breath

56
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,059
[Music]

57
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:37,360
nourishing this body

58
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:52,800
inviting the sit bones

59
00:06:52,800 --> 00:07:03,599
ah to relax to give their weight

60
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,160
to the cushion to the chair to the earth

61
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,280
fighting our lower legs to offer their weight

62
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:21,440
to the earth and our feet

63
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,840
the entire lower body

64
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
so

65
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,960
i'm inviting

66
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,680
the inner abdomen as if

67
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,440
there were a line a vertical line

68
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:28,639
internally ah aligning our body

69
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,120
relaxing around that this vertical line is both having a

70
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:41,599
sense of integrity around it with our spine straight

71
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:55,839
and also relaxing around it

72
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:05,360
softening the chest neck shoulders

73
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,839
arms and hands

74
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:24,160
our face our jaw the eyes resting in their socket

75
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,959
letting the breath move through the body as it well letting

76
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:51,760
it be natural for now

77
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:58,399
in the practice of mindfulness we let the breath be natural receiving

78
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:03,920
it just as it is later in our cultivation practice

79
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:11,680
today with metta cultivating metta we will explore lengthening

80
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:19,839
the out breath with the metaphases but for now let the breath be natural

81
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:10,480
now if you would bringing i felt sense the image of someone you

82
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:16,160
care about someone who's easy for you you don't have a complicated

83
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,560
relationship with them when you think of them

84
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:30,079
sense of safety care warmth maybe a smile shows up

85
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,839
bringing them to your mind's eye

86
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:53,839
their felt senses alive as present as possible

87
00:12:54,160 --> 00:13:01,200
now best to choose someone who's alive if possible if you know your way around

88
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:08,959
this practice and there's no longer grief it's okay to bring up someone deceased also

89
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:14,880
as long as they bring up joy and gladness

90
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,880
the sense of the felt sense of this being [Music]

91
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:35,519
this person this being could be a pet or a child

92
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,839
let's offer them the metaphases

93
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:48,399
you can say them out loud or just say them silently your mind's ear

94
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:54,720
hearing them elongating the exhale

95
00:13:54,920 --> 00:14:01,040
experimenting i'll offer the long phrases for this

96
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:03,839

may you have ease may your life unfold with ease dear one

116
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:04,798
in your home time experimenting with a longer exhale

117
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:10,558
and the inhale can be half inhale it doesn't need to be a full

118
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:18,959
inhale it turns out a half inhale is fine but exhaling fully

119
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:27,000
in your own time with the phrases as you wish whatever works for you

120
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:34,240
experimenting maybe slowing it down

121
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:48,400

you have ease dear one

133
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:25,039
experimenting perhaps with saying the phrases out loud see what it feels like if you can

134
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:31,600
if you wish notice the calm that can come

135
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:39,840
the elongated breath when the feeling of air

136
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:48,320
lacking air that might come up it will kind of it will go away the sense of calm

137
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:55,600
stillness the air hunger will go away interestingly

138
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:01,360
may you be safe dear one

139
00:20:03,039 --> 00:20:09,600

may you be healthy hear what

157
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:26,000
may you have ease dear one notice the air hunger will go

158
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:33,559
away sense of calm synchronicity as if the breath becomes

159
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:42,720
synchronized with the wishes the images

160
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:48,559
sense of alignment arises after a while

161
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:55,840
after a sense of air hunger goes away

162
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:20,960
now bringing a felt sense of yourself an image of yourself together with your

163
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:27,600
dear being as if the two of you are sitting

164
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,840
together practicing together

165
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:43,440
directing the metaphrases to both of you and again let's experiment today

166
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:49,840
with saying them out loud extending the exhale

may we both have ease dear one imagining both of you and your

184
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:07,840
mind's eye receiving these blessings

may we both have ease

189

may we both be healthy dear one

193
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:14,399
may we both have ease dear one noticing how saying the phrases out loud

194
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:31,840
has a different impact than reciting them silently

195
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:45,840
this

196
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,320
now switching to ourselves and if you wish you can put the palm

197
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,440
in your heart center in the middle of your chest to connect with yourself

198
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:24,480
and for this part if you have been saying them silently in the past so far

199
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:32,960
i do invite you to try saying them out loud now see how what how it goes what you notice

200
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:41,840
may this being who is me be safe receiving the blessing

201
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,120
may this being who is me be happy

202
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:59,759
may this being who knows me be healthy receiving the blessings

203
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:08,960
may this being knows me have ease in this moment

204
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:15,679
may this being knows me be safe letting go of the end of the

205
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:22,240
exhale may this being go as me

206
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:26,559
be happy and joyful

207
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:36,320

may this being who is me i have ease in this moment

209
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:48,960

in your own time with your own rhythm

235

now turning the wishes or good will or menta radiating it outward to the entire world

236
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:51,118
from our heart our heart center touching ourselves first radiating out

237

touching all those who are near us near and dear

238
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:05,838
and far away may all beings everywhere be safe

244
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:58,800
outbreak may all beings be healthy

245
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,200

may all beings have ease

253
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:15,359
as we bring this practice period to a close

254
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:25,119
offering the goodness of our practice to all beings everywhere

255
00:37:25,839 --> 00:37:33,599
sharing the goodness generated even if we might consider or

256
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:40,320
judge our practice to have been shoddy trusting there is goodness here there's

257
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:48,839
goodness generated in this cultivation and aligning our actions with our

258
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:57,200
intentions of good will sharing this goodness together as a

259
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,880
sangha foreign wise

260
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:07,760
generosity and gratitude for this breath

261
00:38:09,119 --> 00:38:16,720
letting go of the merits generously letting go of the outbreaths

262
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:33,838
may all beings everywhere be happy may all beings everywhere be free

263
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,839
thank you for your practice

264
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:55,920
so today we experimented

265
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:03,560
with the metaphrases saying them out loud actually and exploring

266
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:08,880
elongating the out breath as if we were chanting

267
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:14,720
not quite chanting but but as if we were chanting elongating the

268
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:20,160
out breath especially and the in-breath letting it be

269
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:26,960
as it was half-full and exploring exploring how the mind can

270
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:35,040
actually be more quiet become more quiet with this kind of breathing make more space

271
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,480
for the cultivation of meta because the mind is not going here and

272
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:46,160
there and everywhere in some ways you know i've explored i've

273
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:53,359
described the practice of menta as a three-ring circus whereas there is the image of the loved

274
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:59,839
one the deer being there is the feeling of metta and then there are the phrases here now

275
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:04,880
tonight we had the four rings here because we're juggling four balls and the fourth one

276
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:11,440
being the rhythm of our breath so what i noticed and would love to hear what you

277
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,280
discovered that as as i've been experimenting with

278
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:24,560
this breathing [Music] technique at first there's a sense of

279
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:30,640
air hunger that comes up when the out breath is elongated and in breath is half full and then there's a

280
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:38,319
sense of calm and peace the mind becomes more quiet and i

281
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:43,599
feel as if i've meditated for a long long time

282
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:50,079
right now even though it's been 30 minutes and i've been talking most of the time teaching so so

283
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:56,640
interesting so i'm curious what you explored what you discovered what worked what

284
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:02,720
didn't and you can type in chat if it's to everyone

285
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:09,040
i'll read your name as well as your reflection if it's just to me then i will only read

286
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:15,599
your question or your comment not your name you can also raise your zoom hand um

287
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:21,839
yes and bring your voice into the space so please don't be shy

288
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:28,560
especially if you haven't spoken shared in a while would love to hear from you what did you discover

289
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:35,839
this is new bleeding edge

290
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:51,760
neil please so i found saying the phrases aloud

291
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:58,319
made this complicated right there was like it felt like there was a lot going on

292
00:41:58,319 --> 00:42:03,440
for me you know and you know i don't even always say the phrases

293
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:11,280
when i practice meta sometimes i will you know just say like the last word you know happy or something you know so

294
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:20,240
saying the whole sentences and saying even the longer versions to try to drag the breath out you know it yeah it made the meta less

295
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:26,160
accessible to me i think yeah yeah thank you for that observation

296
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:31,839
and and how are you feeling now afterwards given all the complications of the juggling of

297
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:36,960
these balls at the end of your practice well right i

298
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:42,880
mean there was a settling right i mean you talk about you know feeling settled

299
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:48,319
right i could say you know things started to be less bad at the end

300
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:54,480
right it's not quite the same thing as feeling settled um you know so so

301
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:01,440
so right so it left me you know you know wondering you know if i were to do this more and you know you know

302
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:07,920
get better at it you know perhaps you know perhaps yeah i don't know perhaps it won't be as bad i guess

303
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:15,200
yeah yeah yeah yeah interesting well it's it's an interesting exploration and

304
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:21,760
maybe some other things need to be explored so so let me mention something so i really

305
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:28,240
appreciate your reflection neil so um so

306
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:35,760
maybe something to explore is is elongating the breath but with reciting them silently maybe that

307
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,920
would make it less busy uh in the mind because saying is or maybe just

308
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:47,920
maybe it's too much to add in in one go so so that might be actually

309
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:54,160
something to explore and experiment with um and and

310
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:00,240
yeah getting another reflection here saying similar to you don't go away neil saying i had a similar experience my

311
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,720
mind was trying to keep up with the pacing of the phrases but it felt like i wanted to go slower so i muted the audio

312
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:15,920
so that i could try it on my own great okay so it seems like maybe the the phrases out loud and this

313
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:21,040
pacing um could seem could feel like too much

314
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:26,480
could feel like too many balls juggled so and i appreciate the person who sent me

315
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:34,319
the reflection so yeah trying to go out on your own pace trying to slow it down trying to go um and

316
00:44:34,319 --> 00:44:40,400
yeah and and another thing that could actually maybe exploring this would be to try

317
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:47,520
just one phrase just try one phrase and that could be the repetition it could be that you know we're rotating or you know

318
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:53,040
going through the four phrases and the breath and it's just too much to keep in mind and i confused the phrases

319
00:44:53,040 --> 00:45:02,839
at some point where i was too it's it is a lot to so so with the um what i was exploring actually um

320
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:08,720
um um what i was exploring earlier this week was was in another

321
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:14,640
uh chant which is actually mahayana chant is um which was mentioned in in this

322
00:45:14,640 --> 00:45:20,160
book because the the meta chant again the metaphases can be more complicated so

323
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:27,580
so i'm just thinking about ways to explore so um [Music] uh omani padme om is what i was

324
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:32,880
[Music] exploring

325
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,000
and that has a rhythmicness or rhythmicity that can be helpful in maybe doing meta

326
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,319
to that so we can explore this is fun thanks for bringing this up neil we're exploring this together

327
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:50,560
uh stephanie says not sure if my camera is off or on uh i can't see you stephanie i'm not

328
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:56,720
sure uh so but but you say saying the phrases out loud felt so good

329
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:02,880
it felt energetic and i enjoyed my hearing my voice blending with yours nikki

330
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:09,119
visualizing my friend added energy as well thank you great thank you stephanie thank you for that

331
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:14,720
reflection also for adding that the energizing aspect

332
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:21,359
because that's also another thing that saying the phrases out loud can do kind of this energizing

333
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:27,520
we can't fall asleep because actually that's what chanting does usually on retreats we do chanting at

334
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:34,560
the end of the evening so that it brings up energy so you don't fall asleep so so so many

335
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:41,359
different you know we're exploring here together and figuring out what can work uh for ourselves so diana i see you

336
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:46,480
let's make this brief because we're running out of time for the groups so

337
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:53,760
at the beginning of the meditation i didn't feel right with the world at all at the end i had just much calm

338
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,839
and was really at peace i have a question about the in-breath what happened because i was trying to get enough going

339
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:05,440
and like sucking up and then how do you pace the in-breaths

340
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:10,480
yeah so thanks for that report and and and the question diana so so

341
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:18,240
according to this this these studies um the in-breath so it's um in-breath can be half-full and

342
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:24,079
this is kind of a practice so in-breath can be half-full it doesn't have to be full and the out

343
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:31,440
breath the exhale needs to be more uh more complete and in fact this method

344
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:39,200
is taught to athletes to to run or swim and kind of like in training to take a

345
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:46,960
half breath not fill the lungs fully but can a half breath and exhale uh extend exhale as

346
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:53,280
long as possible as a training so so that the body can take in more air and the calming effect i feel like

347
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:58,960
i'm running out of breath i know it feels like that but yeah but then

348
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:05,359
but it does then it kind of there's a sense of calm that overcomes the body when one gets used and again

349
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:12,000
we're exploring here we're being scientists of our own mind and body jerry says the extension of the

350
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:17,359
exploration over the inspiration was very calming yeah

351
00:48:17,359 --> 00:48:24,960
yeah thank you jerry yeah it it tends to be very calming so so great thank you all for these

352
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,280
reflections very interesting what we discover how to tune it for ourselves how we figure

353
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:37,520
our own way through this these are just skillful means just skillful means of what might be

354
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:45,280
supportive for you so so let's turn and practice in small groups in

355
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:52,960
breakout groups of size of three and as always we start with um

356
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:58,480
15 seconds of silent um meta for one another and then share as

357
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:05,520
much a rest a little exploring this and um and here the rooms are created

358
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:15,200
with meta for yourself and meta for your fellow travelers okay have fun okay everyone welcome back

359
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:20,400
the rooms are closed so we have just a minute if there are any

360
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,760
