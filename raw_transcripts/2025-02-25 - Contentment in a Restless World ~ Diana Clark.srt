1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:08,319
good evening welcome welcome nice to see you

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:17,240
all last week I had the great opportunity to go for a

3
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:25,119
hike down off a Skyline Boulevard maybe you guys know and it was just quite something it

4
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:30,439
was walking on the Ridge and like looking down into Sian Valley like oh

5
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:37,440
look there's that place and that place and then walking a little bit further and see like wow look at the fog

6
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:44,440
coming in off of the Pacific it was just beautiful it was just so

7
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:52,120
beautiful and this was a park you know that's freely offered just drive up park

8
00:00:52,120 --> 00:01:00,440
your car put your shoes on off you go I just felt like my heart just uh

9
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:08,080
filling up with so much gratitude so much uh appreciation just for this

10
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,960
simple thing of spending time outside having these views and having the opportunity

11
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:23,240
the capability capacity I won't always have this I haven't always had this capability to walk right some

12
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:31,720
distances and just this recognition that the fullness of the heart

13
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:37,200
of the appreciation and maybe the nourishment in some kind

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,840
of way of the beauty just created the conditions in

15
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:49,520
which there could be something else like it stayed with me

16
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:55,320
for quite some time just this uh feeling of being filled up like you know not

17
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:59,119
needing anything more

18
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,680
so it's with that it's a little bit of a backdrop that um kind like chose what

19
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:13,040
I'm going to talk about tonight and also with this recognition

20
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,840
that you know I there's that I'm offering one little

21
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,440
piece of uh the Dharma one little angle in there could

22
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:30,480
be another time in which I'm approaching it from a different place with a different emphasis

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:38,400
and different uh pointings maybe I'll do that next week I

24
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,040
don't know we'll see but to start us off I'd like to uh

25
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:50,280
read a poem by Rosemary traumer of course right for those of you who've been here well

26
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:58,000
you know that I really appreciate her poems and I'm interpreting this poem

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:05,120
that she wrote after meditating out in nature and part of what she's talking

28
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:13,760
about here and the title of this poem is on a day when Stillness seems

29
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:22,040
possible again this is by Rosemary traumer on a day when Stillness seems

30
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:29,879
possible and the river is a long white stroke of roing and continuous surge

31
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,519
and the grass gone to seed waivers in the wind then

32
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:42,040
Stills waivers then Stills and the swallows

33
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,040
spiral the leaf Shadows spangle and the Ants sprayed a path

34
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:54,159
across the stones but I rhyme today with the

35
00:03:54,159 --> 00:04:01,239
Cottonwood trunks my own body unmoving in the breeze

36
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:10,400
it feels good in this moment to be more tree than Cloud more silence than

37
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:17,840
song so easily the Stillness opens me softens

38
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:23,280
me how simple really to do

39
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:32,560
nothing how is it I so often resist there is no know in me now I do

40
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:41,080
not notice it Stillness has made a home in me and there seems to be nothing the Stillness

41
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:47,320
refuses comment seems to say there's room here for

42
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:54,360
everything it opens me wider the world rushes

43
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:03,320
in I love this idea I rhyme today with Cottonwood

44
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:11,199
trunks like what a playful way to think about you know I feel I'm more like a aligned with uh these trees that are bit

45
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:18,039
more stationary isn't that great to think about oneself as just like I'm rhyming

46
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:25,600
with something as opposed to I'm like this more kind of like you know there's a rhyme here there's a might rhyme with

47
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,280
a whole number of things but uh right now there's maybe kind of like an align ment

48
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:39,840
with and then this idea Stillness has made a home in me and there seems to be

49
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,880
nothing the Stillness refuses come it seems to say there's

50
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,800
room here for everything so this idea that there can

51
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:57,240
be some settling some Stillness some

52
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:03,160
quiet and this quiet is not from barricading oneself

53
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,759
separating oneself putting tucking oneself away you know from anything that

54
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,240
might be disturbing instead the Stillness is saying yeah the Stillness

55
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:21,319
is here it doesn't matter what's coming doesn't matter what's uh being experienced there can still be this

56
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:27,759
stability and steadiness that allows the world that is

57
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:34,240
with the world not pushing it away not demanding that it be different she says there's not a

58
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:42,840
no inside but instead just allowing some

59
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,680
settledness so there's this way maybe you've uh encountered this that with

60
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:55,319
meditation there can be this these moments of some of this Stillness and I

61
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,720
might call this some contentment some sense of that we don't

62
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,800
have to change anything right now we don't have to like Express anything

63
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:11,039
right now we don't have to run away from anything right

64
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,479
now we don't even have to assign some special meaning to the experience we can

65
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:24,199
just be with what's being experienced and some with some Stillness

66
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:28,759
we can let things be

67
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:36,160
so this idea of contentment this feeling that uh everything is

68
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:42,000
okay sense that things don't need to change right

69
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:48,879
now and it's maybe this contentment is without this agitation of needing more

70
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:55,520
and more and more and without the agitation of oh no things have to be different this isn't good enough this is

71
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,680
inadequate this is insufficient this is not good enough

72
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:09,479
sometimes the sense of agitation may be subtle and sometimes it might be obvious

73
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:15,000
obvious that we experience in our daily lives or that we experience in

74
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,599
meditation and the same way contentment might be subtle it might be just a small

75
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:25,879
little corner of our experience or it might be

76
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:33,360
obvious if you happen have the good for to be out for a hike and seeing some

77
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:41,279
views and feeling your This Heart being filled up with

78
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:50,000
appreciation or whatever it is might be for you maybe it is a meditation session that uh allow some of this Stillness to

79
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:57,720
be experienced this whole idea though of

80
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:03,279
contentment for some people this idea is actually kind of a dangerous

81
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:11,680
idea because there can be this way in which we think well if there's any contentment then that must undermine any

82
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:18,440
effort to make things better then then there would just be

83
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:23,519
this passivity there would be um this way in which we would just sit around

84
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:30,959
and eat Bon bonss or something all day this type of thing

85
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:38,240
there's this way that we might feel like well if there's some contentment then we won't be out there fighting the good

86
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:44,560
fight we won't be out there working with the terrible oppression and

87
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:49,959
tyranny Injustice right this stuff is out there we see

88
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:58,040
it and so people feel like no there can't be any contentment because then people will just allow the status quo to

89
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,320
get worse and worse and worse

90
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,680
so there are certainly things that we should not be content

91
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,959
with but there's a way that we can allow this Stillness some sense of contentment

92
00:10:19,959 --> 00:10:26,560
to fuel us to support us while we work with some of these things that

93
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:32,680
aren't right I use that word

94
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:41,120
right and certainly our economy depends on people feeling like

95
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:47,480
they have to have more right so there's this uh discontent

96
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:54,760
and like no no no no you need more you clearly you need more and so there's this sense of like

97
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:59,959
well go out and purchase things or work long hard hours

98
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:06,360
you know this kind of like nonstop keep buying stuff keep working

99
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:12,200
and so we might say that this idea of just to experience and allow some sense

100
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:18,800
of contentment is a radical thing to do I know certainly in my earlier

101
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:25,959
professional life that's contentment certainly was not uh promoted or suggested or even if

102
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:33,240
I had said that to my boss probably would not have gone over very well I'm very content with how things are you

103
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,040
know even that if I had done really well or something like this

104
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,639
right so there's this way in which contentment can be such a support for our

105
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:49,600
life but often it doesn't you know have this sense of that it's um you know

106
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,160
supported by our general Society or something like this and that's okay

107
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:02,360
that's okay so I want to say that contentment maybe I want to just be explicit about

108
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:08,959
this it's not about complacency it's not about just

109
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:15,079
tolerating it's not about this resignation it's not about passively

110
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:20,519
accepting everything it's more

111
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:27,600
about you know allowing the I I am uh this for me it's kind of feel like the

112
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,360
heart is filled up like there's a sense of

113
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:42,000
enough but there's a way in which even the whole notion of contentment can feel like a booby prize too right we feel

114
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,360
like no no no I want that big flashy bubbly big happiness I want that

115
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,839
champagne corks popping off and bubbling things or something like that and if you

116
00:12:53,839 --> 00:13:00,720
have that idea then contentment doesn't sound very interesting at all

117
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:06,079
or maybe you have this way that if you just find yourself always wanting more

118
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:11,480
and more and more and that there's a certain amount of uh craving or whether

119
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:17,720
it's like on the internet click click click click click and you just find yourself you know finding more looking

120
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:24,720
for more information or some figuring something out or maybe the whatever those short little videos

121
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:31,920
are that they kind of feed you one after the other so that before you know what hours have gone by or you know it's something like this if you have that

122
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,360
kind of idea of like no no no I like this more and getting stimulated so much

123
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:44,720
then contentment that's just the idea of it could feel horrifying right because it's not about

124
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:50,120
that or maybe you have this way of that showing up where you feel like

125
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:56,880
complaining or grumbling or things you know aren't this way I didn't realize I

126
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:02,240
used to be a person that complained a lot I didn't recognize this I don't complain

127
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,120
so much now but I just thought that was what people did I mean that was I don't

128
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:14,199
know I just thought I I don't know why I what I thought actually I just complained a

129
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:20,600
lot things were never quite right and if you have this idea or if this is your

130
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:26,480
way of showing up then this whole idea of uh contentment also it just feels

131
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:33,079
like I don't know like you're failing and some kind of way or something like

132
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:40,480
this and then maybe I'll also say if we're filled with aversion to

133
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:48,160
others there's a way in which contentment can feel like no no no I can't feel content because then there's

134
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:54,519
a way I'm it kind of feels like I'm letting them get away with something like

135
00:14:54,519 --> 00:15:00,680
my agitation is somehow affecting them which you know of course it doesn't

136
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:09,680
logically when we think about it but there can be this way no no no if I experience contentment somehow I'm

137
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:16,240
that's not being loyal to my aversion to an individual or something like this and

138
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:22,320
often we're just not recognizing the toll that takes on us how taxing it is

139
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:29,000
to always be agitated so contentment is really

140
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:34,160
related with happiness we could say it's a version of

141
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:41,480
Happiness we could say but happiness in the usual parlance not the Buddhist way

142
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:48,319
we might talk about it but again out there what the media might say or magazines or social media or something

143
00:15:48,319 --> 00:15:54,600
like this might say that happiness is a lot about getting what you

144
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:01,560
want whereas we would say contentment is more about than not

145
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:07,600
wanting so it's more like this uh shift in this

146
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,399
perspective whereas you might say happiness is more like a shift in ownership that you now have something

147
00:16:13,399 --> 00:16:19,639
that you didn't have or you got rid of something that you didn't want or you know something like

148
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:27,839
this so there's this way in which contentment

149
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:36,519
is this absence of craving this absence of U you know things needing to be

150
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:42,560
different because there's this way when we really feel like oh I need something

151
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:49,040
whether it's an object an experience recognition uh attainments you know

152
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:55,480
whatever it might be whatever it might be whenever there's this feeling like oh yeah I definitely need

153
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:03,759
something there's this way that we can have this fall under this enchantment that well as soon as I get

154
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:09,360
whatever it is out there there's this way that whatever it is out there kind

155
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:15,839
of gets sprinkled with some magical thing that thinks like okay well

156
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:23,640
as soon as I get that then I'll be happy and it'll be a lasting source of

157
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:29,039
Happiness so there's this way in which contentment

158
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:38,840
is pointing to this absence of craving and craving is this feeling of

159
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:45,440
insufficiency and so it's letting go of this or is it an act of letting go it's

160
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:50,840
allowing this uh insufficiency or inadequacy or something like this to not

161
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:56,120
blossom to not uh take hold and of our minds and hearts and think that

162
00:17:56,120 --> 00:18:02,159
something magical out there is going to to be a lasting source of

163
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:10,480
happiness I mean I've said this before if there were things out there that were lasting sources of happiness you would

164
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:17,360
not be here on a Monday night in a meditation center you would be happily with whatever it was that brought you

165
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,000
the blasting source of Happiness right but there's a way in which we kind

166
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:28,480
of forget this okay well just the next thing is going to work

167
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:34,960
so this idea of contentment as I was like alluding to

168
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:41,320
earlier this this practice is not just about to just be

169
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:49,039
content with everything but it's about having a wise relationship between contentment and

170
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:55,880
discontentment if we want to say that there is a time for contentment and there's also maybe a time for we could

171
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:04,120
say some wise discontent M and that is to be with our suffering

172
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,400
to notice oh yeah there are difficulties some of them are subtle

173
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:15,120
some of them are obvious some of them are really quiet and we don't even

174
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:20,559
notice them until maybe there's a certain amount of Stillness maybe we don't notice them

175
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:26,640
until we are rhyming with a cotton wood tree and we start to feel some of that

176
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:34,280
agitation so there are definitely times to be

177
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:42,280
actively addressing some of our suffering actively addressing some of our craving actively addressing some of

178
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:45,520
our attachments or

179
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:06,279
acknowledge and work with and be with uh some of this uh

180
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:14,000
discontent and is there a way that maybe we could say can we be content that uh

181
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,759
here we're offering a practice in which we can do that which we can be with some of the

182
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:27,039
difficulties mindfulness and mindfulness is part of

183
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:33,679
the aold path which can help find us support this way to more and more ease

184
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:36,158
more and more

185
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:49,679
freedom there's this way that we can meet our difficulties and notice what's actually

186
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:55,039
happening to be with the reality of the

187
00:20:55,039 --> 00:21:03,039
moment as best we can holding it being with

188
00:21:05,080 --> 00:21:10,360
it so what are some of the ways that we can cultivate some of this contentment

189
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:15,960
that allows us to hold or maybe creates the conditions than which we can our

190
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:22,320
Capa we can hold some of the difficulties that our capacities

191
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,159
increase one way we can do this is during meditation

192
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:35,880
or just in our daily life we can just ask ourselves sometimes What In This

193
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:42,279
Moment In This precise moment is truly

194
00:21:42,279 --> 00:21:51,440
lacking not in a conceptual way like in this precise moment just to experience

195
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:58,679
in and for the moment we might feel like well I'm alive I have a breath

196
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:05,158
those of us in this room it's not super hot it's not super

197
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,679
cold we hopefully have a feeling of

198
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:16,000
safety hopefully we have enough

199
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,360
food so this way of inquiring well what is it that we really need what do we

200
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:29,480
sense that we're lacking if anything and

201
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,320
what do we feel like we need can we do with less can it be okay

202
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,400
to have less sometimes we might have

203
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,120
less can that be

204
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,639
okay can we honor our commitments to

205
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:59,840
non-harming not harming ourselves not harming others sometimes with c cing

206
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:08,799
that uh creates the conditions in which there can be harming and subtle ways and obvious

207
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:15,159
ways so it's not a personal failing when we have craving when we recognize yeah I

208
00:23:15,159 --> 00:23:23,120
guess there is anything that I technically lack but I still want more chocolate

209
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,840
brownies whatever it might be

210
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:36,440
it's part of our conditioning a part like as I was saying earlier to really have this sense of uh you know you need

211
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:43,919
more and so it's we can just recognize that that uh often this feeling of

212
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:47,759
needing more we don't have to take it

213
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,880
personally so we could just ask in this moment this precise moment what is truly

214
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:02,559
lacking we can also

215
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:09,840
explore when do you feel the least content when is it what are the

216
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:17,880
conditions in which you're feeling kind of the absence of a contentment maybe when you're in a

217
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:24,760
hurry or maybe when you're on a spending spree or some that can be easy as click

218
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:30,720
click click or it can be like oh impulse by near the cashier oh I already spent

219
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:37,679
this much money I might as well buy this oh wow look at this okay I'll put this in the basket as well or

220
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:45,679
whatever when when do you feel like the least content when you when do you feel that like you need the more more and

221
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:52,600
more could be maybe when you're on the internet sometimes I I find that uh the

222
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:59,480
internet it can be has this uh forward leading momentum it's kind of like

223
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:06,039
designed to do this right it's hard to just go on there look at one thing and then turn it off or you know something

224
00:25:06,039 --> 00:25:14,200
like this so maybe that inter maybe that's when you feel the Le least contentment when you're reading an

225
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:20,559
article or something and then it has some links in there and then they're just like oh well maybe I'll follow that link and then you go to this that

226
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:28,640
whatever it might be so that's something else we can do to

227
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:35,840
support a sense of contentment is just get curious about well when do I not feel it when when do I feel the least

228
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:41,279
amount of it and that could just be some information for you to recognize well if

229
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,360
I want contentment in my life just be sensitive to these areas how I'm showing

230
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:51,039
up to these areas how often I'm doing these

231
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:58,720
activities I would say is maybe that poem that I read at the beginning suggested meditation

232
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:06,360
can be a way in which to cultivate some contentment which to allow some of this

233
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:12,520
stilling or this settling of the agitation of wanting more and

234
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:19,559
more this could be a way that could be support and also the meditation can um

235
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:26,840
help us to maybe uh touch into experience have insight about understand

236
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,919
better our desire like what is it that uh or that we feel

237
00:26:32,919 --> 00:26:39,520
like we need or that we want or maybe it's uh our uh aversions what is it that

238
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,559
we feel like we just can't tolerate and can't be with and it's making us feel

239
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:50,520
discontent with uh what's

240
00:26:52,039 --> 00:26:57,080
happening there's also this way in which uh meditation if we have this commitment

241
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:03,279
to like stay meditating for a certain amount of time maybe all of you have had this

242
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:09,080
experience maybe there's a time when you're meditating and there's like this grip of I really want something I don't

243
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:15,080
want to be meditating I want to be uh doing something else anything else

244
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:20,760
maybe there's this way in which we have this commitment like no I'm actually going to wait until the timer goes off

245
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:30,279
or the Bell Rings or whatever it might be so meditation is also an opportunity for us to discover can we be at ease in

246
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:35,799
the midst of wanting in the midst of yeah okay

247
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:42,240
craving really a lot of desire a lot of wanting is here and it feels like this

248
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,559
it feels like uh maybe like a leaning forward in the

249
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:57,039
body might say or maybe there's the uh mind uh starts to have a real Focus away

250
00:27:57,039 --> 00:28:05,000
from the present moment experience and more on like the object like oh yeah as soon as I get this thing or I do this

251
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:11,039
thing or it's all about something that's going to happen in the future and you're kind of like disconnected from what's

252
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:16,600
happening right now so meditation is a way in which you can start to notice that where there's

253
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:21,759
this movement uh towards just thinking about the

254
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:31,000
future and then the last thing I'll say about something that can be supports this uh contentment this cultivation of

255
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:37,679
contentment is maybe some gratitude practice this isn't specifically a

256
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:44,080
Buddhist practice but there's something about just having

257
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:50,840
appreciation it just makes it so much easier to be have some contentment and

258
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:54,840
to be present with what's

259
00:28:56,039 --> 00:29:01,760
happening so there's this way in which maybe to appreciate the

260
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:08,360
good things that others have done for you that you have benefited

261
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:13,440
from for some people they keep a gratitude Journal I've heard from a

262
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:18,480
number of people have that has been like really transformative for them to

263
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:26,000
regularly do that I had that as a practice for some time do have a gratitude journal or or

264
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:31,240
maybe there's this uh also can be a practice of

265
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:37,159
uh appreciating what you have by imagining how your life would be if you

266
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:44,279
didn't have some things it's like just mentally subtract some things and how

267
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:50,960
your life how would it be different this is a way that maybe you can support some

268
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,559
sense of

269
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:02,960
gratitude and then maybe it's also

270
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:10,000
um can be helpful for gratitude is maybe to acknowledge and honor and respect

271
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:16,840
some of the difficulties you've had in your life too don't have to dwell on them but just

272
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:22,240
to recognize like yeah you know it has been a journey

273
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:27,519
to get to this moment here and there's this way that kind of

274
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:35,880
like appreciating like that there have been some rough patches maybe really really difficult

275
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:44,240
things maybe you're in the midst of a rough patch I'm using this word rough patch as uh something minor but maybe

276
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:49,399
you're in a some really midst tragedies in your life in

277
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:56,440
your family or something like this but just to it can be helpful to

278
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:01,639
maybe sometimes think or cons re honor and respect that yeah okay there have

279
00:31:01,639 --> 00:31:07,399
been these in my life maybe I am experiencing one right now and is there

280
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:13,880
this way that um can help us appreciate things that maybe at other without that

281
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:19,360
framings we would be dismissive of or not even

282
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:28,600
acknowledge food is an obvious one if there have been times when there weren't enough food

283
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:37,360
and then when you do have food you just appreciate it like it's quite something if you had times when there wasn't

284
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:45,360
food so I think I'll end with reading this poem

285
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:53,880
again it's called on a day when Stillness seems possible by Rosemary

286
00:31:53,880 --> 00:32:01,480
traumer on a day when Stillness seems possible

287
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:07,960
and the river is a long white stroke of roiling and continuous

288
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:15,519
Surge and the grass g to seed waivers in the wind then

289
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:22,360
Stills waivers then Stills and the swallows

290
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:31,039
spiral the leaf Shadows spangle and the Ants braid path across the

291
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,320
stones but I rhyme today with the Cottonwood

292
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:44,039
trunks my own body unmoving in the breeze it feels good in this moment to

293
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:51,480
be more tree than Cloud more silence than

294
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:59,039
song so easily the Stillness opens me

295
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:05,840
softens me how simple really to do

296
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:13,840
nothing how is it I so often resist if there is a no in me now I do

297
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:20,000
not notice it Stillness has made a home in me and

298
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:27,880
there seems to be nothing the Stillness refuses come it seems to say there is

299
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:34,039
room here for everything it opens me

300
00:33:34,039 --> 00:33:38,559
wider the world rushes

301
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:47,320
in thank you I'll open it up to some comments and

302
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:52,320
questions on this uh idea of

303
00:33:55,159 --> 00:34:02,639
contentment so how much of finding peace is the inner equilibrium versus your

304
00:34:02,639 --> 00:34:09,040
external life like for example marrying the right person having the right job you know things that bring fulfillment

305
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:14,599
right how much is the inner and how much is the outer in terms of being at

306
00:34:14,599 --> 00:34:21,240
peace yeah this is a great question so right all of us we trying to have the

307
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:26,320
outer marry the right person have the right job and these kinds of things but

308
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:32,720
I'm sure you've noticed we don't get to control the external things right even though you marry the right person and

309
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:39,760
have the great job it doesn't mean you know tragedy doesn't strike somebody else in your family for example or

310
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,839
something so this practice is pointing to where can we find the peace this

311
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:53,240
equilibrium that where that doesn't uh allow us to get off balance when the

312
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:59,240
when tragedy does hit when things aren't working in the external world

313
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:05,720
so we work with the the external world but we also work with our relationship

314
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:13,320
to the external world and that relationship is where we can find the peace are we always demanding that it be

315
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,280
different if so that's you know it's exhausting and agitating

316
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:24,000
so thank you thank you

317
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:37,920
you mentioned how you used to complain a lot I

318
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:42,960
remember a time when I got angry a lot

319
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:48,520
and I would not have said I was an angry person I would have thought just the

320
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:54,040
opposite and then if I got so angry that I couldn't deny

321
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:00,079
it you know I still diffused it by saying or discounted it by saying well

322
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,480
of course I'm angry these people over here are behaving like that of course I'm

323
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:13,160
angry um I didn't understand yeah yeah right it takes a this self-

324
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:19,400
understanding is such a big part of practice too right these things that we understand about ourselves and it's not

325
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,000
I think it might have been Gil I heard say once it's a self- understanding and then these things that we understand

326
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,800
about ourselves is rarely good news it's like we have this version of

327
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:37,599
ourselves and then realize oh yeah like I didn't think I was a complainer I realized oh yeah I'm complaining a lot

328
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:43,839
wasn't until somebody pointed it out to me oh wow you're right so and when they

329
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:51,040
pointed it out did you say oh yeah you're right or or did you resist I complained of course I'm complaining

330
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:58,920
because this isn't right and that isn't right right yeah yeah thank you Bill

331
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:12,119
as you were saying content the word contentment over and over again I um I thought maybe contentment is a dose of

332
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,200
self-actualization and um you know as you're younger maybe you're

333
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:24,400
content not as much as you are when you get older hopefully hopefully the path will take you to a place where when

334
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:31,440
you're older you can feel more content and perhaps self actual

335
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:36,800
self-actualized just the thought I had I see and Stan I missed the verb so

336
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:42,119
contentment and some and self-actualization but I didn't miss I missed what you were saying I think

337
00:37:42,119 --> 00:37:47,839
they're synonymous speak a dose I think I said a dose

338
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:55,880
of contentment is a dose of self-actualization oh so you think like maybe with maturity

339
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:05,440
and uh some yeah if you're on a path whatever that path is and um maturation

340
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:11,760
process just a thought yeah it's an interesting thought so are people uh

341
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:18,880
content when they're young when they're in high school when they're in midle they have doses of contentment doses

342
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:25,440
yeah but then they have this feeling of wanting to get out there and do

343
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:32,960
something what's more like this when you're younger I see I see yeah this very interesting idea kind

344
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:39,319
of the relationship between like psychological health and uh contentment yeah it's an interesting

345
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:44,640
idea and maturity yeah thank you for bringing that

346
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,640
up anybody else have a question or

347
