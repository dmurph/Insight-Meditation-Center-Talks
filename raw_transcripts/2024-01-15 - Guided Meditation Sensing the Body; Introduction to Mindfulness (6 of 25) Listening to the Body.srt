1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:04,639
a warm and

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:15,640
celebratory hello on this Martin Luther King Jr Dr Martin Luther King Jr

3
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:22,800
holiday and um I believe it's my favorite uh public holiday national

4
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:31,119
holiday here in the United States because of the phenomenal values

5
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,719
That animated and guided Martin Luther King and

6
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,719
because of his clear commentary about the

7
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:50,039
or highlighting of the challenges of our society the poverty the war the

8
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:55,840
racism and for uh the actions he took to

9
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:05,239
rectify these problems especially the racism so um and to do it with the values of

10
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:13,399
nonviolence is uh phenomenal so I celebrate it thank

11
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,560
you

12
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:26,920
so one of the gifts that Buddhist practice has

13
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,840
provided me is a

14
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,759
clear deep connection to my own

15
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:46,079
body and that um I didn't pay much attention to my body before I started

16
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,280
doing this Buddhist practice

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,719
and without it being so explicit when I was my early years of

18
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:03,880
practice there was an Awakening to my body and this was phenomenally important for

19
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:12,360
me and as it remains phenomenally important our body is not

20
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:21,160
a hunk of Flesh it's not just a bunch of material physical material

21
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:32,720
that's combined itself to move us around like a car our body is uh a

22
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:39,879
dynamic organ of perception maybe not every single part

23
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:45,720
of it but I suspect in one way or the other every part of the body in its own

24
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:52,879
way is perceiving its environment and perceiving what it needs is perceiving what comes up against the cell walls and

25
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,120
all kinds of things and um every living cell is

26
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:05,760
nourished by the blood that flows by and um but every every over the body

27
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,080
is is uh there's sensation and some of those capacity to sense and be aware of

28
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:18,440
the environment are come up to our mind and inform us how we feel what's happening

29
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:24,040
in the world how we take care of ourselves and so so much of the

30
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:31,760
experience we have with the body is not the experience of just

31
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:40,239
materiality it's the experience of how this material body uh senses and feels and interacts

32
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:47,519
with the mind and the heart and it's Dynamic and there is much more

33
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:55,400
information available through the senses of the body through the muscles of the body through

34
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:06,959
than most people Avail themselves of and uh and to be begin to allow

35
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:15,040
receive listen be attuned to this Dynamic body is a invaluable part of

36
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:20,479
what practices and for that it helps to not

37
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:27,120
be preoccupied in thoughts and part of the motivation to

38
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:34,759
avoid preoccupation and to Center ourselves in the body is that whatever we're searching

39
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:40,440
for through our thoughts something even deeper is available something even more wonderful

40
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:47,600
is available through our bodies the vehicle through our body even when body is quite difficult for

41
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:54,280
us that um uh it's it's a pathway to

42
00:04:54,280 --> 00:05:01,560
Freedom Liberation so um

43
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:06,120
to assume a meditation

44
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,638
posture which is to engage the

45
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:20,479
body bring awareness into the body so we can adjust the body and the

46
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:27,360
posture of the body's in to be most suitable for

47
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:38,240
us to be aware to be attentive to have a kind of peaceful

48
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:44,199
alertness to the immediacy of our

49
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:58,479
experience lowering your gaze perhaps closing your

50
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
eyes

51
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:14,639
and one of the ways to begin heightening attention to the body is to take some long slow deep

52
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:23,039
breaths comfortably deep or full and as the chest

53
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:28,759
expands the belly expands allowing the belly to expand by keeping the belly

54
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:34,680
relaxed with that

55
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,360
expansion feel the edges of the expansion and how it connects you to

56
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,638
your

57
00:06:52,720 --> 00:07:02,160
body as you exhale as you inhale feel it and as you exhale relax the whole

58
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:11,360
body as you transition to feeling the whole body as

59
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,560
you

60
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:33,800
inhale relaxing letting go on the exhale is a way of clearing the

61
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:41,440
feel of preoccupation and tension to be more

62
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,599
available to feel the body as you

63
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
inhale

64
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:37,640
okay and then letting your breathing return to normal but continue

65
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,240
gently as you

66
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:49,880
inhale to receive the influence of the

67
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:53,519
inhale on your

68
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:05,399
body and relax let go on the

69
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:13,640
exhale so you can be prepared to start fresh and

70
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,920
new with receiving the sensations of

71
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:27,440
body in in a global kind of way as you

72
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:31,120
inhale

73
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,040
for and then for a while

74
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:11,279
now if You' like you can let go of any attention primary attention to your

75
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:17,640
breathing and instead be

76
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:25,160
receptive to whatever Sensations in your body

77
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:34,639
appear without lingering or getting focused on any particular

78
00:10:34,639 --> 00:10:41,639
sensation a light touch of awareness that can

79
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:47,279
float from one appearance to another of different

80
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:08,000
Sensations a gentle moving of awareness around the

81
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:22,639
body do whatever Sensations calls next coming and going of

82
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
Sensations

83
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:48,440
less focusing and more receiving in a relaxed

84
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,160
way for a few

85
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,600
moments allowing different parts of the body to

86
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:10,680
reveal themselves as they do and

87
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,639
you receive and

88
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
feel

89
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,959
if there's a lot of thinking feel the physical Sensations

90
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:55,120
connected to thinking in the same

91
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,839
way

92
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:19,079
and if you keep getting pulled into thoughts on the exhales let go of

93
00:13:19,079 --> 00:13:23,440
thinking Relax The Thinking

94
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:34,399
mind maybe relaxing how you're troubled by the thinking

95
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
mind

96
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:16,360
otherwise allowing your awareness your attention to drift around the body in

97
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:24,560
whatever way it wants whatever way it's called so that you

98
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:35,199
begin Awakening a richer grounding in the

99
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,680
body

100
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
for

101
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,600
for

102
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:13,279
feeling the weight of the

103
00:16:14,839 --> 00:16:19,839
body the three-dimensionality of the

104
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:26,440
body maybe the solidity of the

105
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:32,199
body so that P awareness so that

106
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:39,759
you come to rest in the body in the

107
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:49,560
Torso instead of being Swept Away by

108
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:57,079
thoughts you're nested in the

109
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
body

110
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,400
for

111
00:17:57,400 --> 00:18:00,400
for

112
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,320
for

113
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
for

114
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,240
for

115
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:16,440
as your awareness drifts or opens to the

116
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:24,000
body if you become aware of your breathing that can be part of

117
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,159
the whole

118
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:36,600
no need to linger or focus on the

119
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,880
breathing let it the sensations of breathing come as they

120
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:54,280
do being equally available for whatever else wants to

121
00:20:54,280 --> 00:21:01,559
show itself in your body almost as if your body is speaking to

122
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,360
you and you're

123
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:18,000
listening listening equally to what is painful in your body and what

124
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:22,360
is pleasant and what is

125
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:34,120
neutral not lingering with

126
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,039
anything

127
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,960
for

128
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:43,240
letting go of thoughts as you exhale let go of any fixations of

129
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:46,320
attention as you

130
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:56,960
exhale and open broadly to the body as you

131
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,960
inhale

132
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,880
for

133
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,880
for

134
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,799
for

135
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,760
for

136
00:25:26,679 --> 00:25:29,679
for

137
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
for

138
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:15,840
and then as we come to the end of the sitting to take a few

139
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:21,600
moments to feel what it's like to be in your body right

140
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:29,600
now how are you from the point of view of your body

141
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:37,480
how are you from the point of view of your

142
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:51,880
mind how are you from the point of view of your

143
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:04,880
heart one of the values of mindfulness of the

144
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:12,320
body is that we're more closely connected to the

145
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:18,240
physical sensations of care and

146
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:24,480
kindness love physical sensations of tenderness

147
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:29,520
or gentleness or warmth

148
00:27:32,679 --> 00:27:42,398
and as we come to the end of the sitting to gaze upon the world with kind

149
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:50,440
eyes to orient to the world with a warm open

150
00:27:52,440 --> 00:28:00,519
heart aspiring that whatever benefits come come from

151
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:08,240
meditating is for be for the benefit of yourself the benefit of

152
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:14,919
others for the benefit of the relationship between self and others

153
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:21,559
others and self and for the benefit of the whole

154
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:28,960
world may it be that this body of ours supports us

155
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:36,679
in the kind of presence and openness and

156
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:45,640
warmth that aspires for the welfare of all beings may all

157
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:52,880
beings be happy may all beings be

158
00:28:52,880 --> 00:29:01,840
safe may all beings be peaceful and may all beings be

171
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,720
which is with the breathing and this week it's um mindfulness of the

172
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:37,240
body and for some people mindfulness of the body uh in the way that this last

173
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:45,320
guided meditation was done works but better than mindfulness of breathing there's something about um narrowing

174
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:53,559
perhaps or focusing on the breathing or something about the breathing which some people um evokes challenging feelings

175
00:31:53,559 --> 00:32:02,159
emotions and so it's not necessarily useful to Center on the breathing um but uh to kind of be more

176
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:07,519
Broad and just feel the body without focusing on any particular part but

177
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:14,320
letting it be a gentle drifting and opening and receiving of the different parts

178
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:20,120
sensations of the body as they appear um is H frees up the mind that is

179
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:28,519
usually fixates and then maybe becomes reactive to what's happening um and um and this ability to

180
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:34,000
be grounded in the body to become more embodied is a central feature of the

181
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:41,519
Buddha's teachings on mindfulness he his classic instructions um uh in meditation

182
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:47,880
always begins with mindfulness of the body feeling the whole body and relaxing

183
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:54,159
the body are his two explicit instructions around the body um to uh to

184
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,279
feel the whole body and to relax like like a calming of the

185
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:06,360
body and that prepares the ground for further practice and the the unfolding

186
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:14,120
of meditation uh he also made very strong statements about there is no Awakening

187
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:20,639
without mindfulness of the body and he said there's one passage where he says that in many different ways there is no

188
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:26,480
experience of the deathless there is no U freedom without mindfulness of the

189
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:35,039
body and um uh so um it's a fascinating topic

190
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:40,679
to become more sensitive to your body I think for many of us in modern society

191
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:46,159
there's a lot of momentum and forces in our modern society that um disconnects

192
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:51,960
us from our body in some ways excessive screen time takes us away from really

193
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:58,120
being present here in our body uh sometimes sedentary life lives

194
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:05,360
um we don't benefit from all the different ways the body can move and awaken itself and and um and inform

195
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:13,200
inform the rest of us form our mind but all the different uh um you know uh

196
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:21,158
parts of the body and how they interact and play and come alive um the uh it's you know it's been

197
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:27,079
known that uh for many of us um particular there's usually some of our

198
00:34:27,079 --> 00:34:35,760
stores which are underdeveloped that if we go to um that to people in in some societies where

199
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:41,878
they emphasize uh put much more emphasis on certain uh sense doors are much more

200
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:48,760
attuned to the environment and those sens stores are much more acute just like um many of us in the modern world

201
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:55,800
use as a small part of our capacity to me to remember to memorize uh back in the ancient world

202
00:34:55,800 --> 00:35:02,720
where there were no books to store things and no internet to look things up and so you don't have to remember it the

203
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:08,440
only way to store and um information knowledge stories

204
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,640
songs um was to memorize it and so

205
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:20,440
people had a much better capacity to memorization than we have today uh people sometimes had a much

206
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:25,560
better capacity for sensing the environment around

207
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:31,760
them and um so uh to meditation practice is

208
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:39,040
partly a a um developing cultivating a greater

209
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:45,000
capacity for attention through all our senses not just through kind of the

210
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,839
Mind's Eye not just through cognitive knowing what's happening but uh

211
00:35:50,839 --> 00:35:57,480
heightens the capacity to feel the whole body and to awaken the whole body

212
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:03,560
people who' have had very difficult experiences trauma or very difficult emotional trauma

213
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:09,680
challenges sometimes will um uh uh it becomes too difficult to feel the

214
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:15,240
intensity of their emotions and so that they will shut down their body and uh

215
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:21,680
shut down sensing and feeling parts of the body some people because of their

216
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:26,720
their professions there kind of the way they're erased because there was Prior

217
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:34,640
prioritized in society mostly live in their neck up in their thoughts and ideas and in their

218
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:42,319
eyes um and um and uh but so much of our emotional life lives in our full body in

219
00:36:42,319 --> 00:36:49,160
our torso especially in our chest and our belly and uh by not really cultivating

220
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,640
and developing a heightened sensitivity of our torso uh we receive so little so

221
00:36:54,640 --> 00:37:00,720
much less information about what's happening to us and uh the impact the

222
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:08,160
world has on us the kinds of responses we have um a zen teacher many years years

223
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:15,640
ago kageri roshi uh said that um our body is an antenna and I love that idea

224
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:23,000
it it's it's a it's a body is just uh primed to take in information take in

225
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:28,319
Sensations and from the environment and process it it it's also Prime to take in

226
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:34,880
or to express um what's going on with us emotionally what's going on with us reactively what's going on with us in

227
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:41,960
the mind and there's an intimate relationship between the state of the mind and the state of our

228
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:51,400
body as the state of the Mind changes in meditation the experience of the body will change as well um if um sometimes

229
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:59,599
when the mind is really peaceful and calm and spacious the body will feel the same way and then if the Mind suddenly

230
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,880
remembers um you know some um slight

231
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:12,000
some offense that someone did a long time ago and suddenly things contract you can feel how the body contracts too

232
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:20,839
we have a thought the memory and the body just tightens up in response to that or gets hot or tense and um as the

233
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:26,160
body relaxes and softens so does the mind and the advantage of mindfulness of

234
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:31,920
the body is that as we it provides so many subtle cues of what's happening in

235
00:38:31,920 --> 00:38:39,319
the mind and those subtle cues are not just cues but as we feel and are open to

236
00:38:39,319 --> 00:38:46,280
receive them and allow them um things tend to relax and soften giving

237
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:51,560
breathing room to our experience uh allows something to soften and relax

238
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:57,839
it's kind of like if we were tense in the shoulders and really tense somehow in a friend friend who cared for us we

239
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:03,880
trusted and a lot just gently kind of came over and put their hand on our

240
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:09,839
shoulders only then do we realize how tense we are and then something relaxes

241
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,079
it almost like you don't have to think about relaxing oh okay something relaxes

242
00:39:15,079 --> 00:39:21,440
there's something about bringing this kind of kind available awareness receptive

243
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:27,839
awareness to what's happening inside of us in our body that moves ention to

244
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:33,960
relaxing and moves um um the the the

245
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:40,640
emotions the feelings that are emergent that don't come with tension but come with kind of a feeling of suffusion or

246
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:49,560
flow or um Radiance uh to grow and spread out so uh

247
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:54,760
you know so um um you know as things get

248
00:39:54,760 --> 00:40:01,760
uh when gases get warm they expand and um the

249
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,800
um so when ice warms it melts so that

250
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:12,640
which is Frozen as as the warmth of attention that opens up to us then the

251
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:19,319
places where we're Frozen begin to thaw the places which are already soft

252
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:26,960
and open expand outwards so anger greed hatred are all

253
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:34,760
parts of kind of being frozen or tight or constricted that as we bring attention to it uh they tend to relax

254
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,520
anything that involves clinging can relax uh anything that involves

255
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:47,720
suffusion kind of a gentle warm kind of Radiance like love or kindness or

256
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:54,000
generosity that grows in that space of awareness so to more we can be in our

257
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:01,040
body this receptive open uh way the easier it is some

258
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,040
people find that it's easier to be with the sensations of the body if there's a

259
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:12,800
the the the Rhythm or the beat of breathing is keeping us there in

260
00:41:12,800 --> 00:41:17,920
centered in the body just so breathing in breathing out breathing through

261
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:24,880
whatever is happening breathing with whatever is happening in the body kind of keeps the grounding Keeps Us centered

262
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:31,839
other people find that it's just not useful to be so much with the body with the breathing but it's easier easier for

263
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:37,920
them to just kind of be relaxed and not focused or not not inclusive of the breathing the breathing may be

264
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:44,160
Sensations may be in the background and for the time being it's they're not useful to feel and so just feeling the

265
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:50,480
rest of the body more globally is what is helpful and then eventually the people

266
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:58,760
who find it best to avoid being with the breathing because it's triggering of something fear or something um uh at

267
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:06,079
some point there's a shift and at some point they're ready to kind of take in the breathing and I've been that way

268
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:12,240
sometimes where I would ignore the breathing uh but then some point the breathing kind of came in through the

269
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:18,599
back door and then I was able to stay with it and it was nice to be with and

270
00:42:18,599 --> 00:42:25,280
the breathing itself is a very rich ecosystem that in itself kind of is a

271
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:31,839
some some way kind of a aggregate of all the different uh reactions feelings

272
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:37,559
Sensations that are happening in the rest of the body and so they it's it's almost like a meeting point of

273
00:42:37,559 --> 00:42:42,839
everything so it's a the breathing itself is a really an invaluable part of

274
00:42:42,839 --> 00:42:49,920
this exploration of the body so this talk now is was meant to be

275
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:57,040
a to provide the the reasons why it's so valuable to be connected to the body

276
00:42:57,040 --> 00:43:04,720
of course it's not always easy to do this the body can be a difficult place for many reasons but to begin opening up

277
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:10,640
to the body begin being interested in it and and um and listening to the body in

278
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:15,839
a deeper way like you'd listen to a friend is invaluable and very important

279
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:24,240
part of this mindfulness practice so much so that I feel that's unfortunate we translated Sati as

280
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,800
mindfulness sometimes I wish we had translated it as body

281
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:36,240
fullness so um if this meditation was interesting that we did today you might

282
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,680
practice it one more time today before tomorrow and if um and as you go through

283
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:49,599
your day today you might uh do a very simple thing and that is um

284
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,680
periodically uh maybe with some reminder uh check in with your body and say

285
00:43:54,680 --> 00:44:01,400
What's Happening Here what what's happening here and uh maybe if you're maybe alone a little bit so you don't

286
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:06,720
trouble other people if you have a device where you can set a timer for and

287
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:13,920
you decide how often once an hour once every 30 minutes once every 10 minutes so that uh you get a little ping and

288
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:20,920
then you kind of check in it doesn't have to be more than a 5-second checkin What's Happening Here in the body

289
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:29,079
oh and that regular check-in into the body oh that's what's happening that's what's happening um will slowly over

290
00:44:29,079 --> 00:44:36,240
time provide you with a uh greater literacy of your body greater ability to

291
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:42,079
listen and recognize what's happening and I'm pretty confident um that

292
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:48,440
listening to your body will uh provide a lot of wisdom that a lot of wisdom come

293
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:57,079
in Buddhism comes from this grounding in the body so uh thank you

294
00:44:57,079 --> 00:45:04,599
very much and I appreciate a lot uh this chance and um look forward to it

295
00:45:05,599 --> 00:45:08,599
tomorrow
