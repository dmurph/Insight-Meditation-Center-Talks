3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:20,220
um we just start with practicing together we start with without a little dharmette at the beginning and and maybe

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,500
I say a few words at the end but I introduced the theme uh during our

5
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:36,380
meditation so let's let's just practice together be surprised by this being human so

6
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,500

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,539
together both individually

8
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,120
in this seat in this body that is

9
00:00:54,300 --> 00:01:03,020
that is felt by me and and also together as a community arriving coming together

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:11,840
perhaps turning our awareness for a moment with this

11
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,560
or the beauty of the togetherness

12
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:24,740
on this little blue planet we call home from different places

13
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,700
and coming together with Our intention cultivate goodness kindness

14
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:43,159
for the sake of ourselves and others and turning and turning our way our awareness now

15
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,100

16
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:15,720

17
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:19,160

18
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:25,700

24
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,500
letting it go we can always pick it up later but for

25
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,780

a lie for you for this being flows with ease maybe you feel safe

54
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:42,560
when you think of this being maybe your body relaxes

55
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:49,740
choose someone with whom you have an uncomplicated relationship ideally

56
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:55,980
pets her simple children and if they're teenagers now you can

57
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:59,300
imagine when they were young

58
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:08,579
simple someone you appreciate could also be a

59
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:11,240
benefactor

60
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:20,540
a teacher a coach

61
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:30,660
maybe even someone who's touched you through their work

62
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:38,899
their writing their talks Etc wherever it's easy

63
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:47,839
to feel good will for this being for this person or being

64
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:58,440
still connected to your body to your sit bones to your feet

65
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:05,399

66
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:10,040
of your heart mind and inviting them close

67
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:23,480
and see what arises in your body and your heart

68
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,459
maybe on your face maybe a smile shows up

69
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,540
and in this practice today

70
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:45,959
as we evoke as we invoke the phrases of Goodwill and matter we're

71
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:50,240
going to imagine them

72
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:58,519
feeling that way so may you be safe

73
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:07,200
bringing an image of this being where they are cozy maybe it's raining

74
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:14,300
outside and they're safe from the elements

75
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:20,100
of the rain from the cold and the image that

76
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:25,760
there's some safety may you be safe

77
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,459
from inner and outer arm for the inner harm imagining that

78
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:40,079
dread peace their thoughts are not bothering them you're safe from inner and

79
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:42,860

83
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:13,620
you're doing some imagined activity they like

84
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:17,899
maybe with people they appreciate

85
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:33,540
may you be happy and see them happy see this being happy

86
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,800

90
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:05,579
seeing them healthy foreign maybe see them strong healthy

91
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:12,099

94
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:37,740

may you take care of yourself happily and imagine that with a sense of ease

96

99
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,779

and may you and these on the image of them with ease

106
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:06,298
these images we connect with our good will strengthening our good wish our meta

107
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:12,860
our kindness for this person it's not wishful thinking

108
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:22,199
or or imagining something so that it

109
00:17:22,199 --> 00:17:27,720
definitely becomes true with attachment no it's just so our hearts

110
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:33,120
and connect with this wish of meta really feel into

111
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,480

you might notice that it makes you feel happy and well imagine this being

113
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,400
happy and well

114
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:05,000

115
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,240

118
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,700

119
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:55,880
imagining them well happy and healthy

120
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,679
connecting with this image

121
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,220
though your good will can flourish

122
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:36,140
now Bowing in your mind to this being

123
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:44,360
I'm bringing an image of yourself up as as a beloved other

124
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:53,280
and making the same wishes for yourself and imagining yourself happy and well seeing yourself happy and well

125
00:20:53,280 --> 00:21:00,299
and connecting with mental good will for yourself

126
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:07,039
as this beloved other the same way you did for your dear being a moment ago

127
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:17,000
may you be safe foreign

128
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:30,600

130
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:40,460
of joy in your heart

131

may you be healthy and strong

134
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:22,940
seeing yourself connecting with an image of yourself

135
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:27,500
was healthy strong

136
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,620
well-being in your body

137
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:41,100
again not attaching to any of these images

138
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:46,559
not clinging just offering

139
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:54,059
offering Good Will through these Pablo's to yourself as a way to open

140
00:22:54,059 --> 00:23:01,080
your own heart to yourself the last minute to wish

141
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:07,280
may you have ease seeing yourself with ease in your life

142
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,620

the four phrases are too much just simply may you be well

145
00:23:32,039 --> 00:23:39,200
may you be happy or may you have well-being in every way

146
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:32,100
it's okay to bring a memory of a time when you are happy if it's hard to connect

147
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:38,720
with an image it's easy to connect great if not you can

148
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:48,020
bring up an image of you happy healthy from experience you've had

149
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:56,900
a dwelling on the memory but feeling into the good wish the good will for yourself

150
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:38,600
don't get caught up in reminiscing stay in the present

151
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:49,620
may you be happy healthy

152
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:52,580
in every way

153
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:23,039
we find ourselves searching too hard for memories Let It Go just imagine something completely bold

154
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:29,100
you're walking in a Green Meadow in the full sunshine feeling

155
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:35,820

156
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:42,059
with ease wishing this being well

157
00:27:42,059 --> 00:27:47,299
with all your heart is being who is you

158
00:28:27,059 --> 00:28:34,159
this person who is you carries the sun inside them inside their heart

159
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:41,279
with Good Will with kindness with happiness health wish them well

160
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:44,600
may they have ease

161
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,419
connect with this image of Goodwill

162
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:36,299
and as we close and as we bring this guided meditation it's time to practice together to a

163
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:43,200
close for the next breath

164
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:52,640
perhaps bringing the image of yourself as happy healthy with ease save

165
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:58,799
carrying the sun in your heart bring this image close just breathe it in for

166
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:01,100
a moment

167
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:10,140
sense of well-being contentment through and through every cell of your

168
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:16,039
body just for a moment if we can connect with it

169
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:23,600
wishing ourselves well as being who is me

170
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:31,880
and Shining our light sharing our light our good will

171
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:39,120
our goodness with the whole world cultivating our kindness for ourselves

172
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:46,860
as a basis filling our own cup so we don't go around and tell and ask

173
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:52,220
beg everyone to fill our cups with approval

174
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:59,340
filling our own cup with our own kindness appreciation

175
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:07,580
so that we can fill other people's cup s may all beings everywhere

176
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:15,659
safe happy healthy enough ease may all beings including myself

177
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:21,369
be great [Music]

178
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,720
thanks everyone so

179
00:32:36,120 --> 00:32:41,899
we started by settling in the body with the breath as we always do

180
00:32:41,899 --> 00:32:48,299
and then we um brought someone a dear person to our

181
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:53,460
mindset I and wish them well with tableaus with images trying to connect

182
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:58,679
with seeing them happy healthy with ease safe and then

183
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:05,100
Buddha debate and switch after we had warmed up our our imagination our

184
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:11,640
imagery than we brought in an image of ourselves as this third person that we've been kind of playing around over

185
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:17,820
the past week last week as a beloved other imagining ourselves well and

186
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:25,440
connecting with that wish for wellness and at the very end I wish I invited you to to breathe it in say oh wow the sense

187
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,899
of goodness can I actually bring it close as one way to access Mentha

188
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:37,440
there's so many different ways so so I'm going to invite us to

189
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:44,640
transition now into small groups and there will be time for reflection so remember how this practice was for you

190
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,919
um if you have questions comments complaints confusions aha moments please

191
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:55,500
save all of them and the invitation for small group

192
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:02,940
practice is the following that we that you're invited if you like

193
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:10,378
it's in groups of roughly three I hope you'll stay three um two to say a couple of words

194
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:15,780
um not a couple of words but a couple sentences just a short brief and make

195
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:22,800
sure you're not dominating the time just saying something about how this practice was what did it open up what was

196
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:27,839
challenging there's no right or wrong you'd say I fell asleep I was distracted

197
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:34,378
the whole time it's perfectly fine you can also hold silence perfectly fine and

198
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:40,200
then next person will go alphabetically the next person will say a few words the next person will say a few words and

199
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:45,480
then you'll have the chance again so going round and round for about six minutes

200
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,780
seven minutes so um

201
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:57,300
yeah take care of yourselves take care of each other be kind

202
00:34:57,300 --> 00:35:04,380
um and I'm going to create the breakout rooms now and

203
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:12,240
um as always here we go all right it's taking a moment here okay

204
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:18,420
there all right um again you can offer your silence

205
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,760
um and just hold witness with kindness the idea of these groups is again for

206
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:30,960
the practice to uh um well for it's it's it's really our Good

207
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:36,720
Will it's the our Good Will meets the world it's the Rubber meets the road as

208
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:43,140
the Goodwill meets the world so can we actually show up with Goodwill for ourselves and others that's the question

209
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:48,359
it's not about blah blah blah look at me it's about can we show up with Goodwill

210
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:54,960
for ourselves and others it's Supreme practice it's really Supreme practice okay

211
00:35:54,960 --> 00:36:01,880
all right so I'm going to open the rooms take care of yourselves take care of each other

212
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:07,920
hey we'll wait until everybody's back that was a longer it was actually eight

213
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:14,220
minutes I think the breakout groups within seven minutes um and then an extra minutes an extra

214
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:19,160
minute to close so um

215
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:26,339
and if you have Reflections you can raise your hand especially if you haven't spoken recently uh I'd like to

216
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:35,040
if you have spoken recently I'm going to ask you to please step back um and uh you can also type your uh

217
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:40,859
Reflections in chat if you type them to me privately I will

218
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:48,900
only read your reflection not your um name and if it's to everyone then I'll

219
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:53,940
read uh your reflection too so anything you noticed any aha moments

220
00:36:53,940 --> 00:37:02,099
or any questions or challenges from this practice or something you noticed in the small groups

221
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:08,640
and again if you haven't spoken in a while I'm going to invite you to move forward and if you have spoken recently

222
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:13,460
at happy hour I'm going to ask you to move back

223
