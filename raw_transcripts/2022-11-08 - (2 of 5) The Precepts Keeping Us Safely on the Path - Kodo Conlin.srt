1
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:03,920
so good morning again

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,660
ah

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:09,059
how wonderful it is to be with you

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,080
my name is kodo

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,500
and we are on the second day

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,000
of five

7
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,580
on the topic of the five precepts

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:23,279
our practice with the five presets

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:25,640
Sila virtue restraint

10
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,670
[Music]

11
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,239
taking a moment again to appreciate the

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,399
all the comments that come through as I

13
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:37,739
can't see any of you this is my this is

14
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:39,840
my connection with you

15
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,100
see how you're doing

16
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,700
so in this uh development of our

17
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,059
discussion around the precepts

18
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:53,940
um yesterday I discussed some some of

19
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,860
the general principles of relating to

20
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,920
the precepts and I will continue to do

21
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,379
this throughout the week and then just

22
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:02,520
touch on

23
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,320
each of the five

24
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,080
five presets

25
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,159
um

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,439
of course in these short times we we

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:12,659
will only just be able to scratch the

28
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:14,340
surface with these so

29
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:16,320
I hope

30
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:19,560
that some further reflection unfolds for

31
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,680
you

32
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,880
to begin I would like to um

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,100
I'd like to note that today is the full

34
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,500
moon day

35
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,140
yeah full moon day so

36
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,280
um

37
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,579
[Music]

38
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:39,060
last night in San Francisco this bright

39
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:42,600
Moon behind just a

40
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,600
behaves of some collecting clouds

41
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,240
and I was reminded how auspicious it is

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,520
that we're discussing the precepts at

43
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,340
the full moon time uh you see because as

44
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:55,259
many of you know this is a this is a

45
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,560
very traditional time

46
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,159
to

47
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:01,880
in

48
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:07,140
practice to visit temples and to renew

49
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,060
your commitment to the precepts take the

50
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:12,480
precepts again and to

51
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,319
um

52
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,480
spend a day

53
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,760
committed to meticulous observation of

54
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,379
the precepts

55
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:22,200
and to meditation practice

56
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,120
sort of immersing oneself as best one

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,280
can in the Dharma

58
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,860
so I'm wondering about how that can make

59
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:32,660
its way through each of our days today

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,200
so as I discussed yesterday one of these

61
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,080
key principles with all of the precepts

62
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,360
in practicing with all the precepts is

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,080
that of non-harming

64
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:51,959
and it's it's definitely been said more

65
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:55,379
than once that one concise summary of

66
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,480
the path of practice

67
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,700
is

68
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,660
um

69
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,860
to grow ever and ever more skillful

70
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,980
in the path of non-harming

71
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:10,379
ever and ever more skillful in not

72
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,560
harming others and not harming ourselves

73
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,659
and I think this can provide a basic

74
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,060
orientation to how we relate to the five

75
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:20,599
presets

76
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,159
um

77
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:26,000
five presets again

78
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:29,340
or just these this is a reminder for

79
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,480
ourselves

80
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,200
and

81
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,519
I'll Circle back to the first one in a

82
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,760
moment right there just like this

83
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:41,040
for the sake of our training together I

84
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,560
undertake the precept to abstain from

85
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:46,640
harming living beings

86
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,900
for the sake of our training together I

87
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,580
undertake the precept

88
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:55,099
to abstain from taking what is not given

89
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,420
for the sake of our training together I

90
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,920
undertake the precept

91
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,940
to abstain from sexual misconduct

92
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:05,400
for the sake of our training together

93
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,860
I undertake the precept to abstain from

94
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,700
false speech

95
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,900
for the sake of our training together I

96
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,299
undertake the precept to abstain from

97
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,459
intoxicants that are a cause for

98
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:20,120
heathlessness

99
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,300
thing I thought we could do

100
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,580
is

101
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,300
um

102
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,960
you know with a few minutes that we have

103
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,699
to reflect a little bit on these first

104
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,400
and second precepts together

105
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,199
and I use the word reflect I'm actually

106
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,759
thinking of holding them in a kind of

107
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,680
contemplative way

108
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,780
with you

109
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,639
and to pause and really take them in

110
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,820
almost like a meditation object

111
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:50,340
and to move along phrase by phrase and

112
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:52,680
and see what it is that comes forward in

113
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:53,639
your

114
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,680
your heart of meditation and

115
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,960
contemplation as we move phrase by

116
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,820
phrase

117
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,840
so you may even want to jot down a note

118
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,759
or two or you may want to offer some

119
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,300
phrases to the the YouTube chat as they

120
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,820
as they come up

121
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,919
but to slowly and contemplatively

122
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,259
reflect

123
00:05:16,259 --> 00:05:17,880
how does it resonate for you what does

124
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:20,419
it call forward

125
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,680
just to begin with the first

126
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,180
for the sake of our training together

127
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:34,100
what does that call forth

128
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,160
for the sake of our training together

129
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,080
to me it puts me in contact with the

130
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,160
community

131
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,900
and all of a sudden I have these

132
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,580
memories of

133
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,240
um

134
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,699
various temples or training centers or

135
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:49,979
monasteries and I have the felt sense of

136
00:05:49,979 --> 00:05:51,660
being with people

137
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,520
and that these presets

138
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,560
both support my development and freedom

139
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,660
and they support this connection

140
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,979
the community and safety

141
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,900
for the sake of our training together

142
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,800
I undertake the precept

143
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,479
that's evocative for me there's

144
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,280
something about effort involved in

145
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,479
undertaking there's a resolve or a

146
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,020
an intention

147
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:22,080
which is to say I'm making an effort

148
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,080
to conduct myself in in such and such a

149
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,220
way

150
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:29,479
I'm making this effort

151
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,660
it also that also touches on the fact

152
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:36,000
that the precepts are a practice

153
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,780
the

154
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,960
something about them as we we don't

155
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,440
complete the practice of the precepts by

156
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,180
making an effort once

157
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,860
we undertake them and then we undertake

158
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,180
them again

159
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,520
and we undertake them again

160
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,240
and as far as I understand it the the

161
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,720
purpose of these precepts is not to

162
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,160
solidify a self

163
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,500
for further solidify a self

164
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:08,220
through unwholesome forms of shame or

165
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,740
self-harm

166
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,638
but rather

167
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,660
one of the purposes one of the functions

168
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,120
of the precepts and practicing them is

169
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,240
to more and more free our hearts

170
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,099
so we can show up in skillful ways for

171
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,240
others

172
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,180
and in a sense consummate this path of

173
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,560
non-harming within ourselves

174
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,500
so for the sake of our training together

175
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,080
I undertake I make this effort

176
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,720
if I undertake the precept

177
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,840
thank you

178
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:49,080
to refrain from taking life

179
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,819
in some of the original

180
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:53,400
it's uh to refrain from harming

181
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,539
breathing beings

182
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,099
and I think that latter image to me is

183
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,740
just a bit more evocative

184
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,960
just a bit a bit more evocative to

185
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,759
refrain from harming breathing beings

186
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,660
because I sense into the effect that

187
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,460
that not abiding in this way not

188
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,960
conducting myself in this way would

189
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,419
cause harm

190
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,360
to someone who breathes

191
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,620
it's another breathing being

192
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,360
the freezing of not taking life also

193
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:29,099
is evocative it edges into the second

194
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,740
precept because it shares it shares the

195
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,279
word take

196
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,260
for the sake of our training together I

197
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,899
undertake the precept not to take what

198
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,120
isn't given

199
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,620
and there's something right there in the

200
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,140
word take that's so clear so clearly

201
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,100
about

202
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,680
to me so clearly grasping

203
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,760
you can you can feel sense and to take

204
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,220
and how that's that's quite a different

205
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,320
physical mental

206
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,720
uh posture

207
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,480
from our practice of giving

208
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,240
the practice of open-handedness

209
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:12,920
and the virtues that that brings along

210
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,100
so

211
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,500
kind of slowly reflect and slowly

212
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,560
contemplate on these on these presets

213
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,500
particularly on the full moon day

214
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,519
um

215
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,200
as I mentioned yesterday one of the

216
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,140
closest analogs to the precepts in the

217
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,820
early literature is called the 10 whole

218
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,519
10 wholesome actions

219
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:42,180
you can find these in the the

220
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,940
numerical discourses the book of tens

221
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,800
for those of you you would like to read

222
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,420
along

223
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,580
laughs I came across something

224
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,800
interesting so

225
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,580
um

226
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,760
with the 10 wholesome actions

227
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,100
it uh the Buddha teaches them in

228
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,560
contrast to ten unwholesome actions and

229
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,240
you could well guess the first one would

230
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,440
be

231
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,700
um

232
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:08,279
taking to take life

233
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,620
is unwholesome and it goes through the

234
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,959
rest of the ten to refrain from taking

235
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:15,480
life to abandon taking life to give up

236
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,279
taking life

237
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,839
is wholesome

238
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:20,459
and he does something really interesting

239
00:10:20,459 --> 00:10:23,640
and he presents this idea of their roots

240
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,560
of the wholesome

241
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,660
what's underneath

242
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,339
what's underneath the wholesome

243
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,320
and I was reminded when I came across

244
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,040
this teaching um you know some some

245
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,260
years ago I was living at tasahara

246
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,839
Monastery I was the gardener for some

247
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:43,920
time and

248
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,800
one of my fellow gardeners was inspired

249
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:48,360
to um

250
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,360
plant

251
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,820
something new so there's this lawn

252
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,040
across from the meditation hall there's

253
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,380
a one lane dirt drive that comes into

254
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:00,000
the monastery

255
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,700
and across that drive from from the

256
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,339
zendo is this little yard

257
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:09,620
a little yard that we call the moon lawn

258
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,279
um I'm not sure exactly why it got its

259
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,140
name but it was beautifully illuminated

260
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,380
whenever the moon was full

261
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,079
and my fellow Gardener was inspired to

262
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,800
um sort of dig up this uh disused area

263
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,500
and plant Something Beautiful

264
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:29,220
she wanted to plant a yarrow lawn

265
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,620
and yarrow when they're mature they have

266
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,560
these broad soft leaves

267
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,060
that when you rub them they're quite

268
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:39,060
fragrant and then these tall stems with

269
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,880
clusters of beautiful flowers

270
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,320
I thought yeah this is something

271
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,720
beautiful we can do

272
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,420
something beautiful we can do for that

273
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,040
would nourish us

274
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,140
and nourish

275
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,120
the other monks and the monastery the

276
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:56,640
other monastics and the monastery

277
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:59,040
this comes to mind for me this morning

278
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,800
as we're meditating and we're nourishing

279
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,720
what's beautiful in US

280
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,660
nourishing what's wholesome

281
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,660
foreign

282
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,279
[Music]

283
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,500
maybe in some way

284
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,480
as we're as we nourish what's beautiful

285
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,079
in US these these uh soft leaves can

286
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:20,519
come to sprout

287
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:22,860
these soft leaves can come unfurl in us

288
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:25,019
and ourselves and

289
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:27,660
something fragrant

290
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,440
can come forward

291
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,120
it's said in the dhamapada that the

292
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,940
scent of virtue the scent of Sila for us

293
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,000
the scent of the precepts

294
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,680
travels Against the Wind

295
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,240
even in the way that the scent of

296
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,760
lavender and rosemary Jasmine don't

297
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,660
travel Against the Wind

298
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,740
so may we have a

299
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,660
reflective contemplative

300
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,120
dharmic day

301
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,660
keeping ourselves safely on the path

302
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,060
in touch with these precepts on the

303
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,079
auspicious full moon day

304
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,300
and right now

305
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,980
for anyone who would like to stay just a

306
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:12,240
moment

307
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,980
I'm going to put a link so we can all

308
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,200
see the precepts together and then if

309
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,660
you'd like We Can chant them together

310
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,279
this may take a moment to load for you

311
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:40,800
so this is um this tends to be done in

312
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,420
column response so this can be our

313
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,740
closing

314
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,540
and we'll say

315
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:48,540
farewell

316
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:55,620
for the sake of our training together

317
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,720
they undertake the precept to abstain

318
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:01,160
from harming living beings

319
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,800
