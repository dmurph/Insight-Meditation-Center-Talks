29
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,819
introduce the theme for this evening during the meditation

30
00:03:47,819 --> 00:03:54,000
as I sometimes do just to mix it up so so let's begin

31
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,060
let's arrive let's arrive in our bodies

32
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:07,860
ah arriving in this body maybe start by three deep diaphragmatic breaths we'll

33
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:13,019
take a deep breath hold it for a few seconds and then let

34
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:21,019
out with a sigh let's do it together breathing in into the belly

35
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,638
hold and release

36
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:35,300
your shoulders come down your whole body release one more

37
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:49,740
releasing deeply let your breath be received in the belly

38
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:56,780
third one hold

39
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:05,220
and release you can do more if you want on your own

40
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:12,419
time oh I return I return to natural breath

41
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:19,580
as we do in mindfulness practice letting the breath be natural

42
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:27,199
after you have settled after you found it

43
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:54,000
and opening up the body the body especially the lower abdomen

44
00:05:54,000 --> 00:06:01,740
the whole body starting from the lower abdomen to receive the breath to receive the

45
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:07,160
breath all the sensations whatever is present

46
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:14,100
opening your heart to whatever is present foreign

47
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,039
settling arriving

48
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,300
foreign

49
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:01,979
the question can I be content right here in this moment just taking Refuge with

50
00:08:01,979 --> 00:08:10,340
the breath in this moment Solitude and silence can there be contentment can I meet it

51
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:16,020
and I stop running needing more seeking

52
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:23,060
becoming Just In This Moment can I try it out

53
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:50,100
and if the answer comes back now can I be content with the resistance can I

54
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:56,220
embrace that can I hug the resistance with kindness

55
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,220
and warmth if there is any and if not

56
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:06,440
can I make space for myself to just be

57
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:09,620
rest

58
00:09:52,680 --> 00:10:00,600
can I put down planning wanting needing becoming foreign

59
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,140
I can always pick it up later right now can I experiment

60
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:15,380
with releasing into peace into just this

61
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,939
radical acceptance

62
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,440
foreign

63
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,160
has picked up something else I thought I'd plan

64
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:49,920
and becoming it's okay totally fine can you be kind

65
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,560

69
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:21,060
being enough whatever has happened or not happened

70
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,839

foreign

116
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:19,559
foreign

117
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:25,220
as we turn to bring this meditation to her clothes

118
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:31,679
and we embrace and be content with whatever

119
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:37,340
this period of practice was like whether there was

120
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:43,679
contentment or not maybe a whiff of it or maybe not the

121
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:50,940
mind was wondering wanting this and that can we be content with that as a radical Act of contentment In This

122
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:56,640
Moment this practice showed up for me exactly

123
00:31:56,640 --> 00:32:05,279
as it needed to In This Moment In Time given all the causes and conditions can I accept that

124
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:10,820
can I release into peace with contentment yes

125
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:18,960
and trusting that there is goodness here co-created through our practice our engagement our

126
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,559
effort and sharing this goodness offering it freely

127
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:33,360
for all beings everywhere including ourselves may all beings everywhere no

128
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:40,679
the taste of contentment ease goodness not as a way to resign it's not a

129
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:47,840
resignation but as a stepping stone for growth

130
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:58,559
may all our Collective practice be of service to all beings everywhere

131
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:04,080
may all beings be well may all beings be free including

132
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,620
ourselves

133
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:29,539
thanks everyone thanks for your practice

134
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:36,419
so so a couple of words

135
00:33:36,419 --> 00:33:43,200
one is in societies and cultures where there's always one thing more and more

136
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:50,399
and more and more and more practicing with exploring contentment is

137
00:33:50,399 --> 00:33:55,559
a radical act it feels quite radical sometimes even unfamiliar feels like

138
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:00,659
resignation and it's not it's not resignation it's a way of

139
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:06,480
accepting contentment turning towards what is enough what is good and oh yes

140
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:11,700
it doesn't mean we don't engage with with growth we don't engage with the

141
00:34:11,700 --> 00:34:20,099
practice we don't engage with cultivate and continue to cultivate wisdom compassion our hearts our minds

142
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:27,118
it doesn't mean that we say oh it's I'm content with just what is it doesn't mean that but there is a level of of

143
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:34,800
contentment that's needed with what is so that we don't become a Hungry Ghost and there is this um the story of in

144
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,099
Buddhism there are these creatures on on one of the hell realm levels

145
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:48,500
they have a very very long neck and it's a very narrow narrow long neck

146
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:56,460
and also a very narrow small mouth and they have a huge stomach

147
00:34:56,460 --> 00:35:03,359
and they're called the realm of the hungry ghosts they're always hungry they cannot get enough to eat they're never

148
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:08,820
satiated uh they're they have a huge stomach so they're hungry they want more

149
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:17,760
and more and more but but their necks are very tight their mouths are very small so the realm of the Hungry Ghost is a

150
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:24,540
pretty tough one and and whether we believe in the Buddhist cosmology we can actually see it as as

151
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:31,920
in this world sometimes we become a Hungry Ghost we want more more more more more this more of that thing more that

152
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:38,160
so we we are in this realm of suffering of more and more more so turning turning

153
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,400
towards contentment to release that hungry ghost-ness

154
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:51,900
and again just to repeat myself one more time it doesn't mean that we don't engage we don't

155
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:58,619
we're resigned it doesn't mean that we give up we continue to to cultivate a

156
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:06,119
practice but if you explored it tonight the sense of exploring contentment it gives rise to a

157
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:13,079
release it's letting go like ah okay sense of stability and then actually the

158
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:19,859
mind the heart can be more available more ready more open to uh to engage in

159
00:36:19,859 --> 00:36:27,420
a different way not in a hungry way not in a graspy way want this plan this remember this it's kind of an open it's

160
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:34,880
a different way of being anywhere so for tonight's um

161
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:40,200
inquiry together the question that I'd like to invite you

162
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,500
to explore is how do I ex how do I

163
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:52,079
um experience how do I experience contentment In This Moment how do I

164
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:59,280
experience it and we'll go around and each person will say just one word or a

165
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:05,460
phrase maybe I experience it as release I experience it as freedom I express it

166
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:11,220
as ah my breath feels more free and then the next person offers something the

167
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:17,940
next person you can also say pass and just hold witness compassionate witness kind

168
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:23,820
witness to everyone you don't have to speak um but let's explore maybe a couple of

169
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:29,880
rounds and then you can open it up for exploring reflecting together and

170
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:35,700
remember you're just sharing for me your own experience you don't ask other people's experience even if what they

171
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,920
say you don't understand it all you don't explore you don't like ask them

172
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:48,060
just just offer from yourself and and receive whatever is offered in the space

173
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:53,359
with contentment so not directing the space

174
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,760
so so again the question that uh the inquiry question is how do you

175
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:06,300
experience contentment in your body in your mind in your heart how do you

176
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:11,880
experience contentment how is it experienced for you okay

177
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:18,119
all right I'm creating the rooms the breakout rooms be kind to yourself

178
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:24,440
be kind to each other here we go

190
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:46,740
observations aha moments challenges questions and especially if you haven't uh spoken

191
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:52,560
for a while in the big group would love to invite you to move forward for the

192
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:57,720
benefit of yourself and others what did you notice with this practice both with

193
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:03,420
the sharing and the guided meditation Gene

194
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:09,420
yes it was more of a question Nikki that came up and just it prompted in my small

195
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:15,900
group of just the idea that is contentment a synonym or involved

196
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:21,000
with acceptance surrender and love even

197
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:27,240
just wondered what you might think of that yeah yeah thanks Jane interesting

198
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:35,160
um it's it has a contentment is definitely

199
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:42,780
um you know I think of a Venn diagram with circles and and it's not exactly the same as the ones that you named but

200
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:49,260
there is some overlap there is some overlap with acceptance but it's not exactly that it has more nourishing

201
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:58,140
quality to it there's more an uplift there's more of a sweetness to it um and and it's not exactly synonymous

202
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:03,319
with love though there is this aspect of contentment feels no feels loving feels

203
00:49:03,319 --> 00:49:08,579
kind but it it's so so I I think it's

204
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:15,000
it's fun it's it's it's such a I'm so glad you brought that up because it's it's um

205
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:23,280
it's a lovely curiosity to explore um what's these different beautiful hard

206
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:30,660
qualities they're all they're all a little different and similar and and I share this because um in the way that uh

207
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:37,560
when I was practicing with my Burmese teacher punks I had a um years ago and there were these very

208
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:43,859
very nuanced uh states of mind that he would have me explore and look at and

209
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:50,220
just really really feel and uh feel into what they were like and at the

210
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:56,099
first you know at first you're like oh this is like that but then you really feel into it or you explore it you're

211
00:49:56,099 --> 00:50:01,440
curious like oh yeah this this feels different and qualitatively different so

212
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:08,339
I so with the question that you raised Gina I invite you to be curious about the similarities and and nuanced

213
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:16,079
differences between all of that how does that sound thank you Nikki that sounds good yeah I

214
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:24,079
appreciate this practice yeah thank you thanks for that question Charles Lee please

215
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:31,800
oh yeah thank you thank you I missed uh meditation practice but I did uh was

216
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:38,460
here in time for our small groups and uh had a wonderful uh content

217
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:43,800
experience so very recursive uh and uh

218
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:51,000
I guess what came up for me is just uh kind of yeah that feeling of warmth

219
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:56,119
but also an idea that you know contentment is is

220
00:50:56,160 --> 00:51:04,640
always available I think prior to my practice of Buddhism uh I kind of you know maybe accidentally

221
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:10,980
ran into contentment you know every so often but I had no idea that

222
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:16,140
there were ways to to [Music]

223
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:21,900
bring about contentment um you know in in in some ways almost that

224
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:29,579
almost at will um and uh and and so so it's just been you know

225
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:34,980
it's just been so wonderful to you know to be able to do that and then uh one of

226
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:40,079
uh the people in my group had mentioned that contentment was like a

227
00:51:40,079 --> 00:51:46,920
like a home and uh you know I I thought you know is it another or is it is it a type of Brahma vahara

228
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:52,680
you mentioned you know love and kindness and mind States and so

229
00:51:52,680 --> 00:52:00,119
um it gave me a lot to think about but uh yeah contentment um kind of the Buddhist Joy

230
00:52:00,119 --> 00:52:06,319
um it's not you know fireworks it's not you know this you know

231
00:52:06,319 --> 00:52:14,099
very like you know super sense pleasured place but

232
00:52:14,099 --> 00:52:22,440
but gosh it feels you know it just feels so easy yeah yeah see beautiful thank you so

233
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:28,619
much for these Reflections Charlie just just a beautiful

234
00:52:28,619 --> 00:52:34,500
um so many important points you raised one of them being that um it's available

235
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:39,599
it's here it's always available and and

236
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:46,800
there's something about the Buddhist practice about the beauty of the beauty of this practice that lets us appreciate

237
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:53,640
that it doesn't doesn't mean that all conditions have to be perfect you know this and that and relationship and

238
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:59,160
finances at the moment it doesn't have to be per Perfection you know there's

239
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:04,380
this sense that an ordinary mind has that oh yes I'll be happy I will be

240
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:10,140
content when X and wines even well be in the perfect relationship yeah that's when I'll be content when I get my

241
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:15,300
degree or all of that and yet there's obvious contentment it's just this this

242
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:21,720
beautiful soft easy as you said and and also it real as you were talking also

243
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:26,760
realize it in addition to what Jane was the beautiful states of mind it also

244
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:35,640
relates to Equanimity there's a sense of equanimity resting in this oh yeah spaciousness of the heart and mind and

245
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:40,680
um yeah thank you beautiful wise Reflections charisley and and I smiled

246
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:47,760
when you when you said in the group it was it was lovely and it was recursive you said Rick Rick are you a computer

247
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:55,440
scientist that's the recursion I was just delighting I haven't heard recursion in this context

248
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:02,099
oh sorry dropped my device uh I'm a neuroscientist that was my degree in

249
00:54:02,099 --> 00:54:08,579
college so not as smart as a neural as a computer scientist because recursion is

250
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:14,579
a particular term I I thought all the Nerds on this call would probably I've seen Neil who I know is also fell and I

251
00:54:14,579 --> 00:54:19,800
was like oh yeah recursion but anyway just uh enter a joke of a particular way

252
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:26,160
an algorithm is is is is coded it's kind of recursive but anyway thanks for bringing that in Charles Lee that that

253
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:31,260
that brought a smile to my heart that was fun

254
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:38,280
great thank you [Music] um bill says this was educational I don't

255
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:46,140
remember ever seeing the Mind still hungry and to then realize that it is the normal State of Mind Of My Mind 99.9

256
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:52,020
of the time can we do more of this yes and somebody hearted that request yes we

257
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:58,680
can do more this was such a fun exploration thank you all and Serena says I don't think any path

258
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:04,319
owns contentment everyone human can be capable of contentment even with the

259
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:10,260
people who don't follow a particular path oh of course yeah contentment is

260
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:18,480
part of the human you know all the range of emotions are part of the range of uh

261
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:25,140
our human [Music] capacity I think what what I was saying

262
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:31,740
and and agreeing with Charlie is that many of us don't realize that it's available to us we're all we if we don't

263
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:38,160
have a training and it could be any kind of training Buddhist training uh Christian any kind of training that

264
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:43,380
points to to or or stoic training I don't know there's so many philosophies

265
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:48,540
points to contentment if we don't have a training we're usually stuck in in

266
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:53,640
negative states of mind and so so for me

267
00:55:53,640 --> 00:55:59,579
also this practice really supported me to to get in touch with contentment so

268
00:55:59,579 --> 00:56:06,000
so thank you all I feel full and delighted and happy and content with

269
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:12,119
with our practice this evening it's so much joy so much joy as we come together

270
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:18,900
and practice so thank you all thank you for showing up cultivating your heart

271
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:24,859
and mind exploring Equanimity exploring

272
00:56:24,859 --> 00:56:31,380
contentment for benefit of yourself and in service of all beings everywhere may

273
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:36,640
we all know contentment may we all be free

274
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:45,680
[Music] thanks everyone take good care

275
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:49,520
