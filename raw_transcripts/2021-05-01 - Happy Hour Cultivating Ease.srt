00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,039
joining us lovely to sit with you in this moment in

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:22,000
time whatever the time might be

5
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:31,199
so for today's practice i'd like to invite us to um

6
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:37,920
to sit to to explore to to simmer to let let

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:45,120
the fourth phrase of meta really um simmer hang out with the fourth

8
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,160
phrase of meta given that it's friday i like to

9
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:57,160
say less today and have a lot more space for quiet and just for

10
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:04,000
unwinding unwinding i've noticed that's a nice

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:11,840
space nice beat for friday or friday practice to leave more space but i'll say just a

12
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,720
few words to set the container

13
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:25,360
so with metaphases the four traditional metaphases the

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:33,520
first one being about safety may i may you be safe feel safe

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,920
the second may i may you may we may they

16
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:45,600
may all beings be happy so having to do with mental happiness

17
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:53,600
the third phrase having to do with physical happiness i.e health may i

18
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:02,719
you they all beings be healthy and strong and the fourth phrase

19
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:09,679
may i have ease may you have ease having to do with ease

20
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:16,560
our lives unfolding with with ease may there be ease in our

21
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:25,200
lives may we take our care of ourselves happily so the fourth phrase has to do with

22
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:33,200
how our lives unfold in the world and

23
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:39,200
we've this we've discussed explored the previous three phrases in the previous

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,160
days and last week so if you're curious about those please there are all on youtube and

25
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:51,200
audio dharma and now today we'll explore the fourth one

26
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:57,360
and of course whatever wherever you jump in doesn't matter

27
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:05,280
so so don't feel like you've missed out there's it's not like they're building on each other each each exploration

28
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,000
is beautiful and and worthwhile in and of itself

29
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,720
so so today let's wish his fourth wish for

30
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:24,959
our lives unfolding with ease what does that even mean so

31
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:34,159
so maybe we consider the opposite for a moment that there are times that perhaps life feels hard things feel hard

32
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:40,480
it's at times there's a sense of ease we take care of ourselves happily

33
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:46,959
feels like life is humming along for us or for others and that's the wish that's the

34
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:55,519
wish oh kind of like there would be there to be uh grease in the in the crankshaft and then

35
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:02,239
the wheels that you know like oh everything just kind of like runs smoothly

36
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,599
that idea of oh may may i take care of myself happily

37
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:16,400
may my livelihood for example unfold with ease

38
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:22,960
so it has to do with our worldly ways of being the way we are in the world or the

39
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:28,240
conditions so so may there be ease peace

40
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,199
ease so

41
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,840
as a gift so if we consider these wishes these blessings these phrases of

42
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:47,280
meta as these generosities of heart generosities of heart

43
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:54,400
that we offer ourselves and we offer others it's just a wish it's just a wish and

44
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,880
it could be that there are areas in our lives or for others that there is

45
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,440
no ease it's tight it's hard it's there's ah there is contraction and

46
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:13,440
it's okay similar to the other three wishes of

47
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,759
meta phrases of meta we're not offering this phrase to make it go away

48
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:25,280
where it's it's not attachment to outcome because if there

49
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,800
is attachment to arkham we keep saying okay may i have ease may i have e's may i have ease and feel

50
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:38,240
tight about may i have ease ah do i have easy at ouch and you see how it kind of gets a

51
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,840
little strange whereas we offer it with generosity

52
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,919
as if we're blessing ourselves may there be ease in my life

53
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,680
ah no fully well knowing that there might be areas that there is no ease

54
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:02,479
and it's okay we still offer this wish we still offer this wish this blessing

55
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,680
fully well knowing their areas with with no ease maybe there will be ease maybe

56
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,360
there may not be ease knowing that conditions of life are impermanent

57
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,400
and ease comes and goes and it's not something we can hang

58
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:26,240
on to because if we try to hang on to to ease we get rope burn

59
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:32,080
rope burn is similarly for for like trying to hang on to

60
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,880
impermanence when the row keeps running ouch ouch out and you try to hang on you can't

61
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:46,560
hang on you let go you let your heart release and yet this wish is

62
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,479
offered with generosity to yourself if we're doing meta for ourselves

63
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:58,800
generosity for others may you have ease dear one may you have ease dear human being may

64
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,160
you have ease dear stranger so

65
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,440
again fully well knowing that life is impermanent and things there might be ease or not

66
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,080
but just offering this as a cultivation of our own heart

67
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,880
so i've said plenty we'll start this practice by

68
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:31,680
settling in our breath in our body and inviting the mind

69
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:37,039
to settle and then we'll turn to the practice so

70
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:44,319
so let's let's start let's start our practice formally and i'll invite you to

71
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:51,680
ah get into your meditation posture whatever that is if you need to sit

72
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:58,240
differently a different implement or lie down

73
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:05,120
it's all okay see what your body needs in this moment

74
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:13,840
see how this body

75
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:20,960
can express ease

76
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:27,840
can be held in ease in this moment

77
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,479
as much as it is available right now

78
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,839
you might be surprised how much is available

79
00:08:53,839 --> 00:09:09,839
can the forehead the tightness of the forehead release into ease

80
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:19,279
the eyes resting in their socket can they relax

81
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,839
ah into ease

82
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:37,839
muscles of the face behind the face

83
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:51,839
neck and shoulders arms and hands

84
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:05,839
release into ease

85
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,240
just chest abdomen

86
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,680
as they expand and contract with the breath

87
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:35,839
ah whole upper body

88
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:47,839
releasing releasing more and more and more into ease

89
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,760
the lower abdomen

90
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,839
the sit bones

91
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:17,440
the contact points between the bottom and the cushion ah

92
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:23,040
dropping dropping their weight

93
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:29,839
into the cushion

94
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:34,210
releasing [Music]

95
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:43,839
upper legs lower legs and feet

96
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:08,320
the whole body released into ease

97
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,720
ah with each breath

98
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:19,200
nowhere to go nothing to do

99
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:27,040
in this moment but to just be

100
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,839
breathed

101
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,519
and if thoughts arise for this moment of practice can they be

102
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:20,240
released into ease

103
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:27,120
gentle releasing gently opening the hand as if holding

104
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:32,959
[Music] the string of helium balloons

105
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:40,720
releasing to the big sky

106
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:49,839
of awareness with ease

107
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:13,600
letting inviting the lower abdomen

108
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,959
to be breathed to be breathing the breath in and out

109
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:27,839
ease breathed into the lower abdomen

110
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:41,839
ease breathed out

111
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:59,120
as if happening on its own no doing forcing required

112
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:09,839
and if you notice any resistance or forcing tightness in the body in the mind

113
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:16,959
can there be a fluffy cloud of ease

114
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,040
that can hold gently softly

115
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:37,360
wherever there is lack of ease

116
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,880
with breath being breathed around it providing this fluffy

117
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:52,000
cushion it's okay it doesn't have to go away it can just

118
00:16:52,000 --> 00:17:05,839
be held this lack of ease if any

119
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:04,158
may my life unfold with ease

120
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:11,200
dropping this phrase in [Music] lightly

121
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:20,080
may my life unfold with you as if a blessing

122
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:31,840
sacred blessing just dropped in may this life of mine

123
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:39,360
made unfold with ease as much as

124
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,840
possible

125
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:57,280
may i have peace may i have ease see what version works better for

126
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,840

127
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:12,320
i wish ease for this person who is me

128
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,600

take care of themselves himself herself happily

130
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:40,640
if you like you can imagine someone who cares about you

131
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:48,559
or an archetype of care and love

132
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:58,158
unconditional love wishing you wishing you ease and you just receiving

133
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,840

134
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:26,960

may you have ease in your life

136
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:52,559
or whatever version works for you

137
00:24:54,960 --> 00:25:02,720
maybe they wish you spaciousness in your heart and your mind

138
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,840
lightness

139
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:43,840
brightness in your heart

140
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:53,119
the sense of presence to how your life [Music]

141
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:01,120
unfolds aware of the miracle that it is

142
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:11,840
in each moment

143
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:25,840
receiving these gifts these blessings

144
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:32,000
as if sacred gifts

145
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:40,080
from this loving caring being

146
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:53,840
without attachment to outcomes

147
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:35,840
letting your heart your body relax receiving each blessing

148
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,840
this

149
00:31:53,360 --> 00:32:01,840
may i have ease may this life of mine unfold with ease

150
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:15,120
may there be ease in my life my heart and my mind

151
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:18,158
my livelihood

152
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,840
the unfolding of my life

153
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:57,840
either wishing for yourself or receiving it from the caring being or both

154
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:39,840
may there be ease may there be

155
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:19,118
now considering someone that you care about

156

and you would like to wish them ease in their life

157
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:35,839
turning the meta outward externally

158
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:43,919
bringing the image the felt sense of this being this friend

159
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:53,599
this being wishing them ease may you have ease

160

may your life unfold with ease dear being i wish you ease

161
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,240
offering these wishes like blessings without attachment to outcome offering

162
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:31,838
them freely with generosity of heart

163
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:38,640
as if you're sprinkling [Music]

164
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:45,839
good wishes of ease all around them all over them

165
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:53,040
like magic dust may you have ease

166
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:13,839
with generosity of art

167
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:54,320
and now internally and externally

168
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,079
may we both have ease

169
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:23,839
in our lives may there be ease may there be ease

170
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:46,079
for the last moment of this practice

171
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:51,838
letting there be ease

172
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:04,400
the way you consider this practice period let there be ease no judgment whether

173
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,599
the mind was distracted sleepy whether there was

174
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:15,520
lack of ease it's all okay let there be ease

175
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:24,480
let there be ease holding supporting spaciously

176
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:28,880
with each breath holding the lack of

177
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:37,280
ease let there be ease

178
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:47,839
let there be ease

179
00:38:50,160 --> 00:39:01,839
may all beings everywhere including us have ease

180
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:21,519
thank you thanks everyone for your

181
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:33,440
practice so

182
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:43,838
i wonder if you feel more ease in your body and your heart and your mind

183
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,280
or maybe less ease

184
00:39:51,599 --> 00:40:00,480
so we have time for reflections what do you notice what you learned you can raise your hand

185
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,240
if you wish you can type them to me if they're typed privately i will not

186
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:12,000
read your name if they're typed to everyone i will say your name out loud

187
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:18,319
and one reflection that just came in is thank you

188
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:25,119
your warmth oh your warmth is so wonderful you're so welcome thank you for your practice so mirage

189
00:40:25,119 --> 00:40:27,680
please

190
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:41,200
i want to thank you from the depth of my heart for your nurturing presence and guidance

191
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:46,480
and everyone for your presence i have been going through challenges in

192
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:52,960
my practice today on my retreat and this is so beautiful

193
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:59,760
such a beautiful synchronicity that i decided to show up today actually in person instead of doing

194
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:06,079
youtube with you because this is the topic exactly of my challenge of being too

195
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:12,560
hard on myself and i knew it on the mind level i was aware

196
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:17,920
of my mind being very strict and of a harsh inner

197
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,359
dialogue but today i was able to drop onto my body level and

198
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:30,079
experience that heart ache and that pain of years of pushing my stuff and almost

199
00:41:30,079 --> 00:41:36,720
like everything i did was because i was pushing myself too hard

200
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:44,720
and it's so beautiful to just release that and cry and i was laying down

201
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:51,440
and hugging myself for the practice and i felt i was being held by all of you

202
00:41:51,440 --> 00:42:02,240
with your awareness so thank you so much

203
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:08,880
my eyes are feeling moist mirage thank you so much for the grace of your presence and

204
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:14,480
your practice and sharing yourself

205
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:20,318
holding and feeling held what a gift thank you so much

206
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:31,839
[Music] thank you

207
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:37,520
paul please

208
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:48,079
thank you nikki and everyone one thing that emerged in this practice

209
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:53,680
today was the image of how

210
00:42:53,680 --> 00:43:00,000
ease interacts with exertion or intention

211
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:05,440
and for example in health practices

212
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:13,680
doing something challenging becomes easier as we hydrate ourselves as we eat well as we

213
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:21,520
sleep there's this whole set of practices that can make exertion and ease come together in a flow

214
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:29,119
and it's almost like that resistance get gets worn away by water flowing over it and wearing it

215
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:35,760
over time and i feel the challenge for me is you know so often called into

216
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:42,720
work that is transformational whether it's sustainability or social justice where there's this

217
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:48,960
inherent resistance in the work it's a work of

218
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:55,440
changing something that is stuck in a way that it is and the challenge for me is always that

219
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:02,560
i absorb that uh resistance into myself and it creates a lack of ease in me

220
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:08,640
because i feel like i'm fighting against the very nature of intention for transformation is pushing against

221
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:15,359
something that is a way that you want it to be different and so what came up for me today was how

222
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,960
to create that same sense of ease in effort or ease in transformation that

223
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:27,440
the water flowing over these resistances through practice and not knowing

224
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:32,880
necessarily what all those practices can be that lead to that but by

225
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,119
doing the meditation in the way that you were guiding today just instead of trying to figure out

226
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:44,480
what practices are what to do just being open to looking for

227
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:51,599
and exploring and receiving that ease as i put myself in a place of

228
00:44:51,599 --> 00:44:56,640
resistance in order to be part of change so thank you

229
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:04,319
thank you paul thank you and hearing what the beautiful reflection you brought in

230
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:10,240
with ah resistance inside this this external this wanting to make change happen and

231
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:16,079
then this contraction actually coming inside and wondering okay what could be those conditions to actually

232
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:24,079
support it so i have a suggestion and invitation for you to explore and it's very simple so the invitation

233
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:29,680
is this notice when there is contraction inside and you know what i mean when i say

234
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:36,640
contraction inside yes notice when there is contraction inside

235
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:42,480
and just gently ask oh can there be ease can there be ease

236
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:49,040
holding this it doesn't have to open can there be ease and maybe the answer will be yes maybe

237
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:56,960
the answer will be no but just ask just gently humbly ask can there be ease can there be can there

238
00:45:56,960 --> 00:46:01,839
be ease and you might be surprised

239
00:46:02,079 --> 00:46:05,599
thank you thank you

240
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:10,160
thank you all

241
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:22,640
yeah one reflection on youtube you are so very welcome yeah

242
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:30,240
glad it was impactful so um let's turn

243
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,800
to practicing in community from internal as i was inviting us to external how can

244
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:43,200
we wish others ease while we're holding ourselves with ease and if you notice contraction in the way

245
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:49,680
you're relating oh can there be ease can there be ease in this little sandbox if you

246
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,200
notice yourself you know the ego wanting to prop itself up or feeling small or like

247
00:46:55,200 --> 00:47:02,319
oh sweetie can there be ease can there be ease can can this contraction be let go

248
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:09,280
into ease so you can practice with that in this field which is

249
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:15,280
great because it's just a little tiny bit more challenging than sitting quietly but not as challenging

250
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:21,359
as practicing with people who are not practicing so here in the sandbox i invite you so

251
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:28,240
the invitation is to start with um 30 seconds of silent meta

252
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:35,280
actually let's make it 15 seconds 15 seconds of silent wishing ease for each other whoever is

253
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:41,839
in the room you wish them ease and then um

254
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,559
and then yeah sharing whatever you like and notice if there is ease when you're

255
00:47:48,559 --> 00:47:55,760
discussing or if there's tightness if you're discussing and yeah practice with it in okay

256
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:02,160
welcome back everyone the rooms are closed so we have a couple of minutes for

257
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:09,280
reflections um what what did you notice in community practice especially if you

258
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:14,960
haven't spoken today or in a while would love to hear from you what

259
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:20,800
what did you notice with this practice of ease especially

260
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:34,240
internally externally we'd love to hear your insights or questions or challenges anything

261
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,839
yes please richard

262
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:47,280
can you hear me yeah oh a friend of mine um

263
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:54,079
compared ease or ease of well-being with equanimity i wondered if you uh

264
00:48:54,079 --> 00:48:59,839
sync up with that what was the last part that you said

265
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:06,079
about whether or not that that makes sense to you oh ease and equanimity

266
00:49:06,079 --> 00:49:12,400
um it's i think there there is a relationship

267
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:18,960
yeah um i would yeah this is how i would say it's an equanimity i think of as

268
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:24,559
equipoise as a sense of ease with the comings and goings of things

269
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:31,040
right it's ease with conditions just as they are with comings goings

270
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:37,920
etc there's a sense of ease so yes in that way i'll

271
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:45,839
i'll sign up for that one thank you richard that's great

272
00:49:46,079 --> 00:49:54,720
any other reflections you can also type them if you wish

273
00:49:56,000 --> 00:50:02,000
