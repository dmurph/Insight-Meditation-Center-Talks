1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:06,000
good evening good evening welcome

2
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:16,198
welcome so the other day I was struck by was uh talking with

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:22,720
somebody and this person was convinced about you know how the future was going

4
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,080
to be had the certain amount of certainty you know this is going to

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:38,360
happen and then this is going to happen happen and and that's going to happen and I know I was really struck by well

6
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:45,879
how do you know I like of course you know we can imagine how things are going to be but

7
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:51,719
you know why do you have such a sense of certainty and this individual had a you

8
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,879
know a lot of emotion around it too so I've just been thinking about

9
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:07,640
this idea of certainty and then um the other day I had uh some

10
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,960
discomfort on my face and I thought oh it's that

11
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,159
tooth and I made this whole story my dad my brother and I the three

12
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:25,360
of us just don't have such good teeth it comes to find out and uh we have all

13
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,000
these Dental issues and I had this whole story about oh there there's this pain

14
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,640
which means you know this which means that and then this is going to happen and oh my gosh you know and I knew it

15
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:42,040
was a story I knew I was making it a story I was making it up but there was a

16
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:49,399
way that I was kind of like invested in this story like oh because it means this

17
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:54,759
then I'm going to have to do that or you know all this kind of

18
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:02,680
stuff and you know because I had this story I called the dentist I went to the

19
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:10,720
dentist and they're like have you had any problems with your sinuses lately those of you in the room

20
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,959
here did you hear me cough there's it's not uncommon this

21
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:25,800
time of year I have some allergies uh that come up they like it's just sinuses and like oh of

22
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:31,440
course you know I had the certainty that it was going to be a certain tooth in

23
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,800
this whole story about it turns out not to be that

24
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,120
way today is Veterans Day November

25
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,519
11th I guess this uh holiday started out as Armistice

26
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:58,560
Day way back when celebrating the end of World War One celebrating that it was the end of

27
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:06,959
the war that was great going to end all wars yeah has maybe the certainty or

28
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:13,400
maybe a certain optimism but there have been Wars since World War

29
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:20,480
I so that you know this predicting of the future turns out not to work so

30
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,400
well I mean sometimes it does sometimes uh it works

31
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:33,680
well but there's this way in which uh when we are facing

32
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,720
uncertainty which I'll come to talk about turns out to be all the

33
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:47,560
time but we somehow uh neglect to remember that or aren't tuned into that

34
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:52,680
but in the face of uh uncertainty of things that we're not quite sure about

35
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:59,920
then we make assumptions and then based on those assumptions we make predictions

36
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,239
I'm assuming it's my tooth has the same tooth I had problems with blah blah blah

37
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:12,799
you know all this kind of stuff and then uh I'm going to predict that something very uncomfortable is going to happen

38
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:20,759
you know with the dentist's office or something like this this is a perfectly legitimate thing to do this is what

39
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:28,800
humans do this is partly why we have a discursive thinking this is what our minds and brains are been trained to do

40
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,199
in our life is to make some assumptions and make

41
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:42,360
some predictions but there's this way in

42
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:49,880
which we are making assumptions so often in so many ways and

43
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:54,960
in so many places things that will be similar to

44
00:04:54,960 --> 00:05:02,600
how they were before is this implicit assumption maybe underlies so many of our

45
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:09,199
days we're just thinking like yeah it'll be like how it was

46
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,280
yesterday in some kind of way I'm reminded of uh sometimes when I

47
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:23,759
I use uh this um digital assistant and I sometimes ask

48
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:29,360
what's the weather and then they'll say uh you know blah blah blah later today

49
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:36,160
we'll be more of the same you know every day it's kind of like later today will be more of the same it's not I'm

50
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,600
exaggerating it's not every day but this it's not uncommon for it to be that way here in

51
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,479
California and so there's this way in which we so often are thinking like oh tomorrow will be more of the same the

52
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:54,360
day after that will be more of the same so there's this way in that we are we

53
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,720
assume that there's this degree of stability this degree of sameness

54
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:07,120
in our lives and we just we're taking for granted the continuity of so many

55
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:12,960
different things continuity of our possessions that our car is going to start in the morning or that the

56
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,919
computer is not going to die in the middle of some critical uh activity know

57
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:26,560
for the most part we can r on these things these days continuity of our physical

58
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:33,280
well-being right nobody wakes up in the morning think like oh I'm going to get in a car accident this afternoon like

59
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,440
nobody thinks that right I'm going to get a terrible

60
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:44,160
diagnosis somebody uh close to me is going to get a terrible

61
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:52,919
diagnosis and then of course we're making predictions based on this but

62
00:06:52,919 --> 00:07:00,759
what happens when things turn out not the way that we've planned

63
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:10,360
what happens when things completely unexpected happen or when we maybe it's not part of

64
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:15,800
us it's not so unexpected where we had some assumptions we made some predictions and then those predictions

65
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:22,759
turn out to be wildly inaccurate or maybe even just a little bit inaccurate but just their degree of inaccuracy

66
00:07:22,759 --> 00:07:30,120
makes us feel uncomfortable oh why why didn't I see that

67
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:36,479
coming oh I should have paid more attention to this thing or that thing or

68
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:42,120
something like this because the truth is I grew up here in uh California those of

69
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:48,400
you who have been here in California a long time know this idea of earthquakes right I kind of just really

70
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,560
grew up with this idea any moment now there's going to be an earthquake and

71
00:07:53,560 --> 00:08:00,080
when I was in school we had hid under our desks you know we had these earthquake drills and there certain

72
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,280
things you know I keep a certain amount of water a certain amount of food at home certain things that are charged up

73
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:11,479
you know for Batteries just I'm always I don't get down to an empty tank on my

74
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:19,800
car all this kind of stuff just because I think well there may be an earthquake and uh I need to

75
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:27,960
prepare so what do we do even though we're

76
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:34,279
prepared even what do we when we're making predictions that are based on what we think are valid

77
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:41,880
assumptions and yet something really unexpected happens or just even mildly

78
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:50,040
unexpected there's this way in that we this noticing that things aren't the

79
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:58,160
way that we were anticipating them to be sometimes can touch a deeper sense of

80
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:06,560
insecurity a deeper sense of recognizing we don't control

81
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:16,519
things we're vulnerable there's not a safe place the

82
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:21,720
place that you can be completely 100% safe you know guaranteed all the time

83
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:26,920
that doesn't exist and we don't like to feel

84
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,240
this we don't like to feel any of these things the vulnerability or the sense of

85
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:38,920
uh insecurity or the sense that things are out of control we can't control

86
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:47,560
them and so then there's often ways in which we will respond a myriad of ways one is that we

87
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:52,800
just feel like oh no no no I need to some certainty I need something that I

88
00:09:52,800 --> 00:10:00,040
can really hold on to and count on and plan on plan with or okay I I got to

89
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:06,399
find some certainty and we'll look to find it in whatever way that we can or

90
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,160
in whatever way make sense for us we have this kind of like we might

91
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:18,120
become fixated on finding you know the truth

92
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:26,120
the absolute truth because then we can hold on to that and uh that won't uh let us down or

93
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,279
finding okay what's the actually the the uh precise

94
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:37,480
rules what's okay what's not okay and I don't want don't get me any of this gray business you know I just want to know

95
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:43,959
it's a you know perfectly gray and perfect or perfectly black and perfectly

96
00:10:43,959 --> 00:10:51,000
white there's this way in that we find we kind of we get uh fixated on trying

97
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,800
to to like imove remove all sense of Doubt or uncertainty and it's fascinating how

98
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:06,279
just this looking for this certainty this wish like wanting to find the certainty perpetuates

99
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:13,760
uncertainty because we more we look and look and I got to find this in order to feel okay and we won't find it we won't

100
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:19,760
find it we won't find it and this can lead to a spiral of just

101
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:26,600
wait this this isn't uh reliable this isn't reliable so this is one thing that we

102
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:32,839
might respond by just really like craving some certainty and really trying

103
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:38,480
to find out which spiritual tradition is the best one is the true one which

104
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:44,160
teacher is the best which practice is the best which uh experience meditative

105
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:52,320
experience is the best we might have this way in which we start looking for these types of things or maybe there's

106
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,880
this way in that uh we just start searching for information when

107
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:06,760
we discover some uncertainty we might look for just maybe overly relying

108
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:13,440
on opinions or views of other people okay well surely they must know

109
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:19,240
more than I do and we might be like seeking validation or guidance from

110
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:25,880
other people which can be a wise thing to do but there can be a way in which we

111
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:33,320
are kind like giving uh our uh author or our own discernment over to other people

112
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:40,000
think like okay well this person knows whatever they say and this kind of like look for looking for

113
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:45,160
certainty we might you know just well I clearly don't have it I'm filled with

114
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,440
doubt and I'm not quite sure how things go so but this person they claim that they

115
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:56,760
do or they look like they do so I'll just

116
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:02,199
uh look at them what what they are saying or maybe the information we're

117
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:07,480
just consuming information with the news social

118
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:13,920
media wow we we've created a whole society that is just filled with this

119
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:21,920
you want information here you go it's astonishing right how much

120
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,399
information there is and it's also astonishing how much of it conflicts

121
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:33,680
right how much of it like there's some incompatible views going on and then and

122
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:42,360
then this wish for certainty ends up to even having more agitation looking for information but then wait which one is

123
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,279
right which one is right and then that maybe just feels uh

124
00:13:48,279 --> 00:13:54,399
fuels this sense of insecurity that we often

125
00:13:54,399 --> 00:14:00,440
have I mean all of us do this to some regards I mean probably when we have

126
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,759
some new medical symptom Google what are the da d d da

127
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:11,839
you know WR this and we uh look up the symptoms what does it mean and is it

128
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:21,600
time to go to the doctors or what should I do about it or something like this or maybe there's this way in which

129
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:29,279
uh we buy into conspiracy theories because conspiracy theories are part of

130
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:35,440
their Allure is like nope this is the truth everything else is wrong yeah just

131
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:42,600
ignore all that other stuff maybe it's the same reason why people uh join Cults this is true and

132
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:48,279
everything else is wrong this feeling of uncertainty the vulnerability

133
00:14:48,279 --> 00:14:54,360
insecurity it's uncomfortable it's really

134
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:02,800
uncomfortable some other ways of responding when we feel into this or we uh experience it maybe there's just

135
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:10,959
sense of fear like what's going to happen like I don't know this fear of

136
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:18,000
the unknown this recognition like wait if I'm not so good at predicting or if this

137
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:23,320
now I I don't even know what to think about this there can be some fear that

138
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:28,399
comes up this is a natural thing right fear of the unknown but there's this way

139
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:34,880
in which the fear can if it might lead to agitation

140
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:41,319
or this like a paralysis like I don't know what to

141
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:48,839
do people do awful things based out of fear they do nothing know things they do

142
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:54,079
nothing out of fear out of avoidance

143
00:15:54,079 --> 00:16:00,240
maybe or maybe if uh things like if we had this sense of way things are going

144
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:05,360
to be and they turn out not to be that way maybe there's some anger like maybe

145
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:12,120
there's like even it's not so well thought out necessarily but a sense of betrayal but wait I thought it was going

146
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:17,240
to go this way and it turns out to go a different direction and then this anger

147
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:23,079
over like well we have to blame somebody sometimes we blame

148
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:29,440
ourselves what why didn't I pay attention to the signs why didn't I know

149
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:36,079
well it would have turned out the way I thought if only those other people didn't do X Y and

150
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:42,040
Z there's this way in which this um when this feeling of when things don't turn

151
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,600
out the way that we're anticipating that we often are looking

152
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:54,160
outside of us looking for information blaming

153
00:16:54,279 --> 00:17:00,839
others trying to find the answers Somewhere Out There

154
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:07,839
the truth is there really is

155
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:17,438
uncertainty right I mean there's likelihoods of course of course there

156
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:24,520
is but there's this way that the human mind often overlooks the inherent

157
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,840
uncertainty of Life inherent uncertainty to just bad

158
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:36,480
everything we're never guaranteed things are going to turn out the way that we

159
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,960
plan we anticipate that we

160
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,080
expect there's this way that if we had to like kind of like admit that uh

161
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:57,039
things are uncertain they arise due to causes and

162
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,400
conditions but what are all these causes and

163
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,919
conditions I don't know you don't know nobody knows we don't know all of the

164
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:15,480
reasons why things happen there's all kinds this is why you know there's people over here will say

165
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:22,080
Well it happened because of a b and c and then these people are here no it happened because of X Y and

166
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,960
Z well maybe it happened because of element op

167
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,760
but the it just there's a bunch of things that come together to make

168
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:40,520
everything happen I'm sitting here because uh I I wanted to say I didn't

169
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:45,760
die today I was supposed to be here I didn't think I was going to die I don't

170
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,120
know if people usually are thinking that but I mean there's so many things here that

171
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:59,559
came together for me to just uh be here and for you to be here to be listening to a talk wow my

172
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:06,880
had to there wasn't a family emergency that I was required to take care of I

173
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:13,760
wasn't uh away and another Retreat that uh I was needed to teach her or that I

174
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,480
was teaching or I didn't get in an accident on the

175
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:25,120
way here you know all these things that we don't assume are going to happen but they didn't happen for me to be here and

176
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:31,880
then for you guys to be here each one of you individually and then for the microphone system to work and the lights

177
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:38,000
to work right how many of you were here when the there wasn't any power right that was like a whole different uh

178
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:46,679
situation here so we often overlook this uh

179
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:52,400
inherent uncertainty and partly the reason why

180
00:19:52,400 --> 00:20:00,679
it's uncomfortable but it's also really highlights how we we don't

181
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:07,000
control nearly as much as we think we

182
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:12,120
do and partly this feeling of things being

183
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:18,640
uncontrollable is uncomfortable we like to think like okay

184
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:26,600
I can make my own destiny I can make things be a particular way I can

185
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,000
influence outcomes I can make things

186
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:37,799
happen we can help create the conditions that

187
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:44,880
changes the likelihood of things happening maybe it's a way to think about it but there's no guarantee that

188
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,520
there's not something else that's going to arise that we didn't

189
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:59,840
anticipate and so this idea of unreliability

190
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:07,840
the Buddha talked about this he pointed to this as one of the core

191
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:15,679
teachings and like really understanding this and aligning with

192
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,880
it is a way towards greater peace and ease and

193
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:29,520
freedom so the Buddha talked about how things are are

194
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,240
changing an inconstant

195
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:41,679
impermanent and sometimes we hear this and we think like oh yeah of course right it's fall now the leaves are

196
00:21:41,679 --> 00:21:49,240
falling from the trees things change it wasn't full a few months ago the leaves were a different color a few months ago

197
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:56,760
and we just feel like okay yeah that's a change but just pointing how everything

198
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:04,720
is actually changing there isn't anything that's like inert completely in

199
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:11,480
the sense that it will Until the End of Time be the same the time frame on the

200
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:18,960
which ways things are changing is different but everything is changing and

201
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,880
partly like we are changing too all of us have heard you know about

202
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,120
how the how many cells you have in the body and they change every seven years I

203
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:37,919
don't know if this is true or not but our minds are thinking changing

204
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:43,000
we're learning things every day we're making assumptions and our assumptions

205
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:50,360
uh are supporting some predictions that we're making so even if uh the Bell seems like

206
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:58,600
it's exactly the same but the person who's ringing the bell is maybe a little bit different and

207
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:04,279
I learned from uh maybe at a retreat center I was teaching that recently how

208
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:11,480
uh delicate one needs to be with the striker so now maybe the the experience

209
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:16,960
of the Bell isn't exactly the same because I'm a little bit different and now I'm striking it a little bit

210
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:23,840
different but the Bell you might say but it looks the same but is only the way that something look is that everything

211
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:29,760
about the Bell maybe it's also sounds maybe it'll sound different

212
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:37,039
I'm just making this up just things

213
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:42,679
change but that was only one of the characteristics right that the Buddha talk about there's three characteristics

214
00:23:42,679 --> 00:23:49,679
one is the changing nature and then following from that is Dua the

215
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:56,559
unsatisfactory nature because things can't be reliably predicted upon there's

216
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:05,840
a sense of une easiness that goes with this there's nothing that is not

217
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,840
changing changing is the constant we might

218
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:20,039
say so there can't be this source of reliable happiness in the way that we

219
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:25,520
are looking for it in the way that we are expecting

220
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:32,520
it and then as I was saying the part of us means that we can't control it we

221
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:39,760
can't control well we can't control ourselves we can't stop the Aging we can't stop

222
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:45,480
getting sinuses uh sinus sinus

223
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:51,679
issues we can't stop you know illnesses they arise even though we

224
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:57,840
might be doing our best to protect ourselves and this kind of like lack of

225
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:03,360
control at the fact that we uh can't completely control this Human Experience

226
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:08,720
the Buddha pointed to this too and it's partly what he's talking about a self

227
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:14,159
he's saying if there were a self the way that it was being defined

228
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:21,559
at this time in Ancient India and partly how we can understand it in contemporary times then a self would be something

229
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:28,559
that we could control if it's actually yours you could control it that's part of the definition of something that you

230
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:36,559
own that you have you own is you can control it and well we there's we don't completely

231
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:42,960
control this this self how many times have you had thoughts that uh you didn't

232
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:51,480
want to have or expecting to have emotions that you didn't want to have or or this as I

233
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:57,000
said this body right these bodies they're they're doing their own

234
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:00,000
thing

235
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:07,279
so what do we do about this and I'll say this is partly why we

236
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,799
have spiritual practices really is to help us to be with some of

237
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:19,559
these uh difficulties with this feeling of insecurity this feeling

238
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:25,640
of uncontrollability this feeling of

239
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:32,679
vulnerability part of this spiritual practices to recognize

240
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:38,840
difficulties yeah this is uncomfortable not to repress it not to

241
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:44,760
deny it not to Gaslight ourselves I love this expression Gaslight ourselves try

242
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:50,880
to pretend like oh no no no that's nothing but instead no to say no no yeah

243
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:57,200
this ouch I don't like this at all and part of a spiritual practice is

244
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:05,320
to be able to See Clearly to see okay this actually is the

245
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:14,880
reality and to be able to meet it and hold it in a way that makes one's life Fuller

246
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:21,080
makes one's life richer makes uh the On's I don't know

247
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:27,480
brings some beauty and Grace to one's life as opposed to collapsing and or

248
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:35,399
trying to make uh something different something completely different so part of a

249
00:27:35,399 --> 00:27:41,679
spiritual practice is so we can have a mature response to when we're noticing that oh

250
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:46,120
yeah this didn't turn out the way that I thought it was going

251
00:27:47,559 --> 00:27:53,200
to can we have a mature response that says it didn't turn out the way that it

252
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:58,320
didn't want to and not to collapse but then not to also go the opposite way way

253
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:04,960
and say well everything's uncontrollable and unpredictable therefore I'm not going to bother wearing a seat belt or a

254
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:10,360
helmet or or uh exercise and eat well

255
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:16,519
and you know all these types of things that we do to try to uh protect ourselves we could say well we we don't

256
00:28:16,519 --> 00:28:24,480
know what's going to happen that's so why should I even bother to uh do things that uh might provide some safety a

257
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:30,440
mature response is to recognize we don't actually

258
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:37,120
know so we plan and recognize we don't know it's going to work out that way we

259
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:44,240
take precautions and recognize we don't no it's not a guarantee it's going to protect

260
00:28:44,279 --> 00:28:49,360
us so there's this way this kind of aligning

261
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:55,559
ourselves with this truth of impermanence the truth of

262
00:28:55,559 --> 00:29:01,039
uncertainty is a way that actually provides the

263
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:08,080
security it's not by um finding that one thing that we can just hold on to like

264
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:14,840
okay great I found it I don't have to search

265
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:22,799
anymore but instead just to recognize yeah things are always

266
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:28,919
changing and so it's about our relationship to that

267
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:35,080
can we hold our expectations

268
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:41,360
lightly can we still make them and recognize them as expectations recognize

269
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,679
them as predictions based on assumptions and those assumptions may or

270
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:55,120
may not be true but just to hold them hold them

271
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:01,440
lightly and then let go of all these attempts to try to control things that

272
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:07,080
actually we can't control letting go of trying to control

273
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:15,320
other people have you tried it did it

274
00:30:15,399 --> 00:30:23,120
work do you like it when people try to control you I don't I don't like it I'm just

275
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:30,440
going to say it I really don't like it when people are trying to control me I have this little inner rebellious person

276
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:36,640
that uh inside here that some just Roars when there's a some of that kind of

277
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:44,039
thing H trying to happen so how do we work with this uncertainty align ourselves with the

278
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:51,200
truth of impermanence I'm going to use this word truth I'm holding it

279
00:30:52,279 --> 00:30:59,559
lightly let go of the attempts to control things that are beyond our control

280
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:07,559
and then one thing that will support us in doing this is just a mindfulness practice just to be present for our

281
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:14,120
lives just to be present for recognizing that the stories that we're making the

282
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:21,960
Fabrications that we're doing about the future they're 100% fabricated they're not based out of

283
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:29,039
nothing most likely but just to recognize oh yeah this is a story I'm making up

284
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:35,600
about my this pain what it

285
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:40,960
means so notice mindfulness practice also helps

286
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:47,039
us to notice just the changing nature of things those of you who are familiar

287
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:52,919
with the satiana sua this is the key text in the Buddhist literature that

288
00:31:52,919 --> 00:32:00,919
points to a mindfulness practice and there's this refrain that gets repeated like like 13 times and it talks about

289
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:06,000
noticing impermanence noticing the changing nature of things and this can

290
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:14,480
be a real practice that can be really beneficial just to notice how things are

291
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:20,760
fluid they're not constant and there's this way in which

292
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,679
we when we notice that then uh there's just this natural kind of like loosening

293
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:31,880
of the grip that we have on things on how we expect things to be or how we

294
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:38,840
want to be maybe this mindfulness will also help

295
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:44,559
us this way in which we're kind of like often maybe in a subtle way wrestling

296
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:49,840
with our experience like no it it should be this other way I predicted it to be

297
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:55,799
this way I want it to be this way and there's this way that uh there's a we're

298
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:02,840
pushing with experience and trying to morph it into uh something the way that we think it should

299
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:09,320
be I'm not saying that we shouldn't make changes but it starts with just

300
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:16,200
recognizing okay here's the truth of the moment here's the reality here's how I'm

301
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:23,519
responding to it I don't like it I want it to be different and then starting from there then go with the next thing

302
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:30,519
is but often we don't even notice how much we're trying to push and pull against our experience how much we're

303
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:35,600
trying to make it be

304
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:44,799
different so we can practice some mindfulness that can help us

305
00:33:44,799 --> 00:33:51,399
to notice the changing nature of things and notice

306
00:33:51,399 --> 00:33:56,880
how much we're trying to control and then I would say also to

307
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:02,880
nourish our in our lives there's this way in which you

308
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:10,960
know it's so much easier to have some stability and some maybe uprightness or

309
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:16,398
I'm using uprightness like uh figuratively like to be able to sit

310
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:22,079
upright instead of collapsing maybe is what highlight it's the opposite of

311
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:29,720
collapsing when something unexpected and unwanted happens

312
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:37,000
it's so much easier to do that if we are nourishing our inner lives and what do I

313
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:44,000
mean by that to do something that feeds the

314
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:51,679
heart being in nature looking at Beauty for some of you maybe it's

315
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:58,280
meaningful to uh have a devotional practice something where there's uh or

316
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:05,000
maybe it's simple as lighting a light a candle before you uh meditate or maybe

317
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:13,119
some of you have an altar with things that are meaningful for you or maybe some of you have a chanting

318
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:19,839
practice or maybe just singing or dancing or some of these

319
00:35:19,839 --> 00:35:26,040
things so there's so much it's so much easier

320
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:31,599
to meet meet difficulties if there's a part of us

321
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:37,119
that feels nourished and sometimes when we're feeling this insecurity and things

322
00:35:37,119 --> 00:35:44,680
aren't quite right we're go looking for information as I was talking about information can help a little bit but

323
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:51,440
I'm pointing to also these other ways for me I love to be hiking with

324
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:56,880
redwood trees I just I every time I few times a week I'm out there as much as I

325
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,960
can and I'm if I'm hiking with somebody else I can't help but I'm always saying

326
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:07,280
like wow it's so great to be here where I just feel so lucky to be living in the

327
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:13,119
Bay Area we have these amazing redwood trees that I don't know for me I just

328
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:20,440
feel nourished and supported by them and then there's this way that I

329
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:28,920
also want to highlight that this uncertainty brings promise and beauty

330
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:34,240
also I was talking about how it can be a bummer if you're expecting one thing and

331
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:41,480
then something different shows up but there's this way that poetry and

332
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:48,000
art the ones that are like really touch Us in my view I have like this

333
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:53,760
combination of the familiar and yet a little extra something that's unexpected

334
00:36:53,760 --> 00:37:01,359
that brings a little bit of uh Delight or maybe there's this way that there's a

335
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:08,800
sense of freshness if we are tuning into this sense of yeah things aren't as

336
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:14,280
predictable and this freshness like brings a certain aliveness to our our

337
00:37:14,280 --> 00:37:20,560
life maybe there's a way in which we would have some curiosity about oh I'm

338
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:28,240
not quite sure what the day is going to bring I have this idea it's going to have a b and c but I'm not quite

339
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:33,720
sure and to be like engaged with your life you know instead of like ah a b and

340
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:40,920
c here we go which is easy to do right it's easy to do

341
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:46,599
that so there's this way that this uncertainty brings some of this uh

342
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:54,560
promise and beauty also then maybe I will end with this

343
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,560
poem

344
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:09,920
this poem is called never the same by Rosemary

345
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:16,480
traumer never the same by Rosemary

346
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:24,800
traumer sometimes a person wakes believing they are a storm it's hard to deny it what with all

347
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:31,000
the rain pouring out of the gutters of the Mind all the gusts blowing through all the

348
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:37,440
squalls all the gray but by afternoon it seems obvious

349
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:45,079
they are a garden about to sprout by night it is clear they are a

350
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:51,160
moon luminous radiant

351
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:59,119
faithful that's the danger I suppose of believing any frame

352
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:05,720
let me believe then in curiosity in

353
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:12,599
Wonder in change let me trust how essential it is

354
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:21,480
to stumble into the trough of the unknown Marvel how trough becomes

355
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:29,560
Wings becomes Faith becomes math let me trust un certainty is a

356
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:37,800
sacred path I'll read this

357
00:39:38,359 --> 00:39:46,720
again sometimes a person wakes believing they are a storm it's hard to deny it what with all

358
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:53,680
the rain pouring out of the gutters of the mind all the gusts blowing through all the squalls all the

359
00:39:53,680 --> 00:40:01,160
gray but by afternoon it seems obvious they are a garden about to

360
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:09,960
sprout by night it is clear they are a moon luminous radiant

361
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:15,960
faithful that's the danger I suppose of believing any

362
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:24,040
frame let me believe then in curiosity in Wonder in

363
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:30,839
change let me trust how essential it is to stumble into the trough of the

364
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:37,319
unknown Marvel how trough becomes Wings becomes Faith becomes

365
00:40:37,319 --> 00:40:43,920
math let me trust uncertainty is a sacred

366
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:55,160
path I love this notion of the stumble into the trough of the

367
00:40:55,880 --> 00:41:03,760
unknown and then Marvel how trough becomes Wings Things are unfolding this changing

368
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,800
business this unpredictability we aren't when we're in the trough we're not expecting them to

369
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,000
become wings but they do things like change and

370
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:19,640
then they they become known and then she then she says trough becomes Wings

371
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:25,839
becomes Faith becomes math for me I'm turning math I'm interpreting math as

372
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:34,000
look oh yeah okay now we can make predictions based on this the likelihood is the probability those of you who took

373
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:39,880
statistics you like we could just turn it into a probability problem or something like

374
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:46,839
this because it becomes known and becomes something that from which we can

375
00:41:46,839 --> 00:41:55,359
build upon in our life so maybe we could think about this

376
00:41:55,359 --> 00:42:02,160
idea of moving from prediction about how things are going to be to

377
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,920
presence to being how things are

378
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:14,480
now and part of the way that they are now is

379
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:22,559
uncertain and with that I'll open it up to see if there's some questions or

380
00:42:22,559 --> 00:42:26,760
comments thank you

381
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:56,800
um I was thinking about uncertainty for me and I feel like in certain parts of

382
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:02,000
my life life I really like uncertainty um and those are probably

383
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:07,599
things I enjoy doing you know but I kind of love that I'm cooking without a

384
00:43:07,599 --> 00:43:14,440
recipe and I don't know how it's going to taste or I'm dancing with this band

385
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:19,800
I've never heard before and I like that so I was thinking

386
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:27,160
maybe I can think about that and then the areas of uncertainty that I don't

387
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:32,280
don't like um maybe that will help

388
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:39,960
me you know uh loosen up a bit about it um I

389
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:47,119
mean I already like I have kind of a thing about parking in San

390
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:54,240
Francisco um so I I know I have a problem with this like why am I anxious

391
00:43:54,240 --> 00:44:01,079
it always works out somehow um but I'm just thinking maybe if I

392
00:44:01,079 --> 00:44:06,599
can I don't know kind of think about how areas of my life where I'm really

393
00:44:06,599 --> 00:44:14,760
totally comfortable with uncertainty and then I I don't know if I can uh open up

394
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:22,000
more in those areas where I'm don't like the uncertainty yeah I was struck by uh you

395
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:27,520
made this small little comment about parking in San Francisco well it seems

396
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:34,800
to always work out yeah so it's interesting I think to notice like oh yeah like things often aren't turning

397
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:40,760
out the way that we planned or expected but they did turn

398
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:49,440
out in some other way whether we liked it or not so that things are always unfolding and then we work with them and

399
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:56,400
or or not if we don't work with them then we're stuck and filled with anger or something like this but just this

400
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:03,000
recognition that things are like always uh I don't know now that I

401
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,480
say this maybe it sounds silly but things are always unfolding and there's this way can we just trust

402
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:14,559
that what's going to happen next is going to happen next whether we are like

403
00:45:14,559 --> 00:45:21,359
it or don't like it and is there a way that we can have some confidence and so maybe part of how we

404
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:27,400
gain that confidence is just by noticing oh yeah things are always

405
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:34,720
changing they're not as in the way that we expect but I like what you said about oh yeah other places

406
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:40,280
it's fine cooking dancing I like it parking not so

407
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:47,000
much thank you I think this is the end of our time

408
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:56,040
here so thank you for your kind attention and wishing you a wonderful rest of the evening thank you
