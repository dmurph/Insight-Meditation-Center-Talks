1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:07,160
good morning and a good day everyone so we're coming to

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:12,559
the last day of this week or

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:19,720
weekday um in our series I feel rather quiet right

4
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:27,599
now and just savoring this sense of songer and con

5
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:38,920
connectedness and so so maybe that's enough for us to begin just sense of a welcoming to the

6
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:49,800
Sanka to the collective blessing to be able to practice together like

7
00:00:54,039 --> 00:01:00,440
this and so close your eyes if you like

8
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,559
and coming to a meditative

9
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,439
posture with the celebrations and joy

10
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:23,079
Delight mud with

11
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,799
feeling goodness

12
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,399
already coming home to The Refuge of

13
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:50,560
Thea coming home to

14
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:02,920
ourselves the Dharma is in be good

15
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,479
here and now

16
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,599
awake and aware to this

17
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,560
moment sitting in our own bod mind and

18
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:07,720
heart and also the

19
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:34,879
collective Maybe the sense of boundary of this

20
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,159
being is soft

21
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:08,720
we can feel the connection with the earth a

22
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:27,680
space The Late Late TNA Zam

23
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:34,440
Master coined the T we interent

24
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,478
our we are interbeing

25
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,440
each of us is

26
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:24,639
uniquely ourselves and

27
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:31,639
yet we are in a collective

28
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,639

e for

34
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:10,920
a poem from the late tikn H called

35
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:19,120
interbeing the song has entered

36
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:26,399
me the sun has entered me together with the

37
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:31,040
cloud and the river

38
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:39,800
I myself have entered the

39
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:46,600
river and I have entered the sun with the

40
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:54,920
cloud and the river there has not been a moment when

41
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,519
we do not interpenetrate

42
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:07,000
but before the sun entered me the sun was in

43
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,680
me also the cloud and the

44
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:20,120
river before I entered the river I was already in

45
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:29,279
it there has not been a moment when we have not interb

therefore you know that as long as you continue to

47
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:44,000
breathe I continue to be in

84
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:27,299
[Music]

85
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:09,880
yesterday I spoke about um this notion of living as our own

86
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:20,440
Refuge or make ourselves a refuge and then let the Dharma be one's

87
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:28,799
Refuge uh when we practice with this uh little by little

88
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:34,360
what we may discover is that we become

89
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:40,919
more and more safe to ourselves maybe all parts of

90
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:46,799
ourselves not just the parts that uh we like or are

91
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:55,000
pleasant but also the parts that um may feel challenged or

92
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:06,840
challenging maybe the in secure or the Shy part of ourselves can feel safe and free to

93
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:13,519
be herself himself or themselves within

94
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:20,960
ourselves without feeling that um somehow they might get diminished or

95
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:26,279
they have to be defensive you know somehow I shouldn't

96
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:34,960
be like this I should be stronger or whatever and that's just demanding uh

97
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:42,159
for our ourselves the parts of ourselves to be other than what they

98
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:49,240
are and it's a hard enough to be uh insecure feeling

99
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:55,080
pain uh why add more demands why add more

100
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:59,840
pressure why contract more

101
00:33:00,559 --> 00:33:05,639
and so through uh this process of living

102
00:33:05,639 --> 00:33:10,480
creating as The Refuge for

103
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:19,240
oneself and gradually we can begin to feel the bigness of this process there's

104
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:26,760
something opening up within us it has a capacity to hold uh the whole of

105
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:33,840
ourselves and it doesn't stop

106
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:42,240
there when we are safe and when we are vast for

107
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:51,000
ourselves others can feel safe with us other beings can feel safe around

108
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:58,240
us and so in this way living as a refuge

109
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:03,799
uh of One's Own can also be a refuge for others

110
00:34:03,799 --> 00:34:10,358
other beings The Whole World At Large and this is what I'd like to share

111
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:18,158
today and which is the notion of being refuge for all

112
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:25,240
beings and there is a wonderful sutta in Maj man nikaya called the simile of

113
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:31,878
cloth some of you may know this towards the end of the suta and the

114
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:37,320
Buddha shared this verses I'd like to read for

115
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:46,679
you to make yourself a refuge for all beings and if you speak no

116
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:53,800
falsehood nor do harm for living beings nor take what is not

117
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:59,640
offered with faith and free from Everest

118
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:07,040
in the process of um making oneself a

119
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:12,400
refuge one's own virtuous heart virtuous

120
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:19,760
conduct creates a virtuous field and so when people are around this

121
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:25,440
kind of field they don't have to be concerned that they're going to be light

122
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:31,960
to or they're going to be harm uh in ways uh in different

123
00:35:31,960 --> 00:35:40,720
ways and the person's uh calm and ease uh is a field for others to feel as

124
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:48,359
well and maybe it helps to come and ease others anxieties and

125
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:55,599
fear and I've mentioned the Tik nahan a few times today and the late Master Tik

126
00:35:55,599 --> 00:36:01,480
nanan was a prime example of such a refuge or such a

127
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:08,280
sanctuary for so many people who were struggling at the times of the war or

128
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:13,960
times of the difficulties and so there a process of

129
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:20,119
living or making refuge for oneself has a natural

130
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:25,280
extension to being a refuge for all

131
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:32,400
beings and there is a re uh effect uh as well the more goodness

132
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:39,800
and safety there is uh in this world the more support each of us will have in our

133
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:48,160
own cultivation and then we feed out to the world and so this are kind of two sides

134
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,000
of um the coin um cultivating uh being a

135
00:36:54,000 --> 00:37:00,319
refuge for ourselves and being a sanctuary for all

136
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:08,079
beings and there is one thing I would like to point out this notion of being a refuge for

137
00:37:08,079 --> 00:37:16,119
all beings is not meant to create some sort of identity for ourselves and look

138
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:23,160
at me you know somehow others should come to me because I am so and so and

139
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:30,720
so and that's just turning the Refuge into an ident entity into a

140
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:36,480
s you know just saying that you might begin to feel the tightness the

141
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:43,880
narrowing the contraction that comes down it's losing the the boundlessness

142
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:51,960
and the vastness of this aspect of being a refuge for all

143
00:37:54,200 --> 00:38:02,760
beings and so this is not uh being the ref future for all beings is not uh uh

144
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:07,960
to create Identity or create a sense of

145
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:14,359
self rather uh people feel around the people

146
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:21,240
who expresses Natural Care natural responsiveness and wisdom and

147
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:30,200
compassion and this uh this sense of being a sanctuary is a natural Dharma

148
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,560
manifestation or

149
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:43,480
expression and in our meditation uh you may begin to feel this um through our

150
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:50,599
inner cultivation and the deepening of insight into our own

151
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:59,200
nature it can become increasingly clear that we are truly interb being we are

152
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:05,760
truly interr as Tian uh

153
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:11,800
described there is a deep connection between all beings and the

154
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:16,960
environment the whole planet whole

155
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:24,400
world so when we're not caught up in our own um selfing

156
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,279
edes we can feel this kind of natural

157
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:39,040
interconnectedness uh everything belongs nothing is outside of this vast

158
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:48,440
being and so there is a refuge for ourselves and there is a refuge for

159
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:52,000
everyone for all

160
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:04,280
beings I like to close by reading this a poem again uh poem I dropped in in our

161
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:13,160
meditation and this is the poem of interbeing and I received this uh from

162
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:21,520
um uh a teacher Philip maet one of my teachers on a poetry day uh it really

163
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:26,960
attached to me and so by tikna it's from his poetry

164
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:34,960
book call me by my true names and so here it is

165
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:43,640
again the sun has entered me the sun has entered me together with

166
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:52,200
the cloud and with the river I myself have entered the

167
00:40:52,200 --> 00:41:00,520
river and I have entered the sun with the CL out and the

168
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:07,440
river there has not been a moment when we do not

169
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:16,520
interpenetrate but before the sun entered me the sun was in me also the

170
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:22,800
cloud and the river before I entered the

171
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:29,319
river I was already in it there there has not been a

172
