1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,879
so welcome everyone and wonderful to have you here

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,160
and more people are coming so but i wanted to uh before uh

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,920
so welcome this is what i have to deal with regularly

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:23,840
forgetting to turn the sound off so um in a

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:32,160
in a few minutes uh you know we'll turn the recording on

6
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:39,760
and uh to record it but also i just wanted to make a few announcements before we start

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:46,879
and uh both for all of you here and also for the people who are on youtube

8
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:51,920
it feels like the sunday morning community has now expanded dramatically

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:57,600
because of the pandemic and the youtube and so

10
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:03,120
but how to integrate these two is not so obvious to me uh with the

11
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:08,799
pandemic it became clear that it would be useful to with online to do a lot of these guided

12
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,880
meditations to have a connection and to everyone in support and

13
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,320
but before the pandemic we used to come sunday morning and sit in silence there was no guided meditation

14
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,080
so now that people are coming back in person again what do we do and we still have this online we still

15
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,000
have the online community who's participating in music maybe extremely expecting

16
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,600
uh the don't guided meditation and so how do we do this so i i don't have

17
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:44,640
an answer but uh but it'll be what it is as we as it unfolds

18
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:52,240
and uh and also uh we still have a mask mandate here in san mateo county when people gather and

19
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:59,200
maybe even after the mandate's gone for a while we want to be careful with this so the people on

20
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:04,960
youtube you know will be seeing me with the mask on but uh to my our surprise i think the

21
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:13,280
quality of the sound is okay going through the mask is that right for the people here we tested it last week and the consensus

22
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:20,800
of the few people are here right kevin was that i actually sounded better [Laughter]

23
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,200
so um so

24
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,160
so i think uh as introductory words

25
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,160
and uh then i used to have i still have a laptop here but i used to

26
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:44,720
i used to have a big 27-inch monitor here so i could kind of be a little bit track the chats and all that but

27
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:51,040
i don't have the monitor anymore now but i have my laptop in front of me so

28
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,280
and people online are saying yes it sounds good it's fine with them that's good to hear

29
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,840
maybe the mask will never go off and uh

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,599
so okay so

31
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:16,319
yes oh let me do it today and then we'll

32
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,360
see what happens next time so why don't

33
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:28,000
you can start recording and then we turn it off before the you know the audio recording

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:33,840
at the end of the sitting so then i can offer everyone a little

35
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,440
bit more formal or welcome so those of you here thank you for

36
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:45,280
coming i don't know if it took a little bit of bravery to come but if it's not not so

37
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:52,000
much and uh it's wonderful to have you and uh and having

38
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,439
you know it's limited numbers coming and i see you all as representing them with the wider community for who you are so

39
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:05,920
maybe you just think you're coming as yourself but in my eyes you come as a representative of a community that's

40
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:12,159
actually grown in a sense this large number of people have been watching

41
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:19,919
online is part of our community now it's expanded and so i appreciate those of you who are online that you're here and

42
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,759
hopefully the transition to being or doing live is harmonious enough for you and

43
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:33,680
for the online people and and maybe you'll you'll consider that the people are here it's about 25 people here

44
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,880
that they are kind of representing you as well just a

45
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:44,639
sense of that there are embodied people out there in this world after all

46
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,320
and here you are so thank you for coming so

47
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:56,919
we'll meditate and uh so

48
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,000
if you would give some love and care

49
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:10,639
to your meditation posture and then loving care is not

50
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:16,720
only to be comfortable but there's something about love or care

51
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,680
that you want to sit in such a way that there's a potential for a greater aliveness

52
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:29,520
greater attentiveness that's embodied

53
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,440
and so for some people that means sitting up a teeny bit straighter than you normally would

54
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,320
and uh maybe sitting up a little bit more and

55
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,918
so that uh the chest can be a little bit more open

56
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,520
and so if you take a few deep breaths there's more room in the chest

57
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,400
for the lungs to expand and so

58
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:07,800
to take a few long slow deep breaths

59
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:16,080
and as you exhale to settle in to relax

60
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,520
and part of the function of attention to posture

61
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:29,759
attention to deeper breathing is

62
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:35,840
is to connect to the embodied aspect of mindfulness

63
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:44,560
sometimes i wish we had translated the word sati not as mindfulness prioritizing the mind

64
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:50,240
but to body fullness and so to whatever degree that's

65
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:55,599
available to you to

66
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:04,400
spend a few moments here becoming embodied connected to your body

67
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,759
and then gently letting your breathing return to normal

68
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:34,240
and on the exhales continue this process of embodiment

69
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:42,759
by relaxing into your body and letting your body relax into itself

70
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,560
you can soften and relax the face

71
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,960
the forehead

72
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,680
around the eyes and jaw

73
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,080
okay

74
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:34,240
exhaling and relaxing the shoulders

75
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:42,959
laying the shoulders settle back into the body

76
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,800
rather than maybe being lifted

77
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,240
and when you relax and soften your belly

78
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:19,120
maybe feeling the weight of your body settling into the pull of gravity

79
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:25,440
settling your body your with your belly more deeply into the

80
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,160
bottom of your torso

81
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,080
and one way that people become disembodied

82
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:52,560
is through a lot of thinking but a lot of thinking often has an

83
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:58,080
embodied equality there can be physical tension or

84
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:05,519
pressure agitation associated with that thinking

85
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:12,240
it might be on the forehead in the brain

86
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:20,480
sometimes in the jaws or the shoulders even the hands sometimes it can be slightly tense

87
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:29,120
and if you're able to recognize the physical

88
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,320
effect of thinking a lot

89
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,200
perhaps on the exhale you can relax

90
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,399
that tension pressure

91
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:50,079
in a sense relaxing

92
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,519
and one more time kind of coming back into your body and more fully

93
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:49,360
and then keeping a tether of attention

94
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,839
a connection to the physicality of the body

95
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:03,360
breathing a gentle connection to how the body experiences breathing

96
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:12,959
and as long as you can stay connected to the physicality of breathing the movements of the breath

97
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:22,800
maybe you don't have to worry so much about what thinking you have especially the thinking is in the

98
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:31,199
background and not interfering and if thinking does interfere

99
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:37,240
maybe relaxing the thinking muscle

100
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,880
so

101
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,000
so

102
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:52,839
so

103
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
so

104
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,679
so

105
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,080
so

106
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,919
you

107
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,480
do

108
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:10,120
so

109
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,400
so

110
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,640
so

111
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:34,280
so

112
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:49,159
so

113
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:28,520
so

114
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,000
so

115
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,159
so

116
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,200
so

117
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,279
um

118
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:48,919
so

119
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:14,160
and then as we come to the end of this sitting

120
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:22,320
to mention that i find sometimes that meditation feels like being turned

121
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:28,480
inside out sometimes to a minor degree sometimes to

122
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:35,280
a great degree that as we

123
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:42,640
become more settled here in our bodies in our experience

124
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:48,320
with maybe a kind of inner stability or calm

125
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,000
sometimes there can be a greater sensitivity

126
00:35:57,599 --> 00:36:03,040
so then when we turn our attention outwards towards the world

127
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:08,320
we feel and sense or perceive that world in it

128
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:12,520
with that deeper sensitivity

129
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:20,800
and hopefully with a deeper stability openness

130
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:30,000
and as we get turned inside out and we turn our

131
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,119
sensitivity our calm our stability

132
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:41,838
to bring to mind the people in our lives

133
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:49,838
in our neighborhoods in our communities across the lands

134
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:59,520
and if there's no obligation to be caring for them or be compassionate

135
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:05,039
is there some kind of care good will

136
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:14,800
however small that flows from that inner sensitivity

137
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:21,319
when we perceive people from a place of stability and column

138
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,480
and if there is some good will some care

139
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:38,720
that seems to flow from the embodiment or the calmness or the

140
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:47,119
subtleness perhaps these following words

141
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,838
can help you feel more connected to it

142
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:59,599
may all beings be happy

143
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:07,520
may all beings be safe

144
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:17,960
may all beings be peaceful

145
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:27,800
may all beings be free

146
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:41,359
and may acting on this care for others

147
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:47,838
contribute to your own freedom and happiness

148
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:57,280
may you care for the world and for others in a way that

149
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,200
cultivates well-being welfare and freedom

150
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:10,240
for yourself may all of us contribute to each other's

151
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,440
happiness and freedom

152
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:40,599
uh

153
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:16,000
so hello everyone and welcome

154
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:23,839
so this is the first hybrid dharma talk here at imc

155
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:30,720
so with some of you here about 25 of you here today thank you for coming

156
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:37,440
and for the people online thank you for being here appreciate it very much

157
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:42,960
and uh we're still in this our county has a

158
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:51,440
mask mandate and also out of caution so we're even giving the talk will be with a mask

159
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,480
and uh i find it kind of cozy to meditate with the mask on actually

160
00:40:56,480 --> 00:41:02,000
i keep my mouth slightly open and uh the humidity of my my

161
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:08,400
feels kind of cozy for me and uh so anyway each person has unique

162
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,800
response to this mask thing and meditating with it

163
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:19,559
and uh so um

164
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:26,079
so the whole so we're beginning to shift here and hopefully this shift in this direction

165
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:31,359
will continue and we'll slowly open up more and more and here at imc and

166
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:38,160
offer start offering some of the programs we offered before and new programs and

167
00:41:39,359 --> 00:41:44,800
so the

168
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:51,520
but for those of you online it means that some of the format will shift probably a little bit

169
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:57,760
and uh we'll see how much guided meditation i do it used to be before the pandemic that

170
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:04,720
we didn't do it sunday morning and now um so we'll see if how we continue or don't

171
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:10,800
continue with it and then uh the other thing is that um

172
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:17,680
i felt like during the it was all on zoom or on youtube it felt

173
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:22,720
too long to speak for the full time we used to do sunday morning i felt like

174
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:30,880
just i felt more appropriate to talk less and so it was a half an hour on sunday and but the old format was uh closer to

175
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:38,079
45 minutes or 40 minutes or something it was more variable we we were scheduled to go until 10 45 so

176
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:44,720
for those of you who are on youtube uh that'll that'll shift we'll go back to the 10 45 ending and whether the talk

177
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:51,280
will be that long or not or whether we talk for a shorter time and have a question period for q a and

178
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:59,040
it's variable depending on the situation so for today um the talk i want to give

179
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:04,079
i i want to do i'll tell you what i'm going to try to do

180
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:10,800
uh i want to first recite a four line verse that captures what the buddha

181
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,839
had to teach in a nutshell and that kind of sets the stage for the

182
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:21,680
talk and then i want to kind of uh just name

183
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:28,319
this whole period from march 7th or something like that until now that we've been closed

184
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:33,680
uh and what a big impact it's been in our for individuals for our society and

185
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,680
and here we're coming together after we've all been through this thing that people will be talking about for decades

186
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,880
you know what were you doing back then it was like when i was young younger people who

187
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:50,800
said where were you when john f k died when he was killed john f kennedy

188
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:56,960
and people would you know talk about oh i was there you know or 9 or 9 11. where were you what

189
00:43:56,960 --> 00:44:04,880
happened then people were talking about what were you doing during that pandemic and it'll be kind of like a reference point

190
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:11,119
and then um i want to talk a little bit about one of the little

191
00:44:11,119 --> 00:44:19,040
subsections of our society a big subsection of society that had its own impact around the pandemic

192
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:25,839
but which is the medical field but but in particular i'm inspired by medical

193
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:32,400
ethics and uh the kind of the what we can maybe uh tap into and learn from that as

194
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:37,440
buddhist practitioners and and also as we open imc about how we can be as a

195
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:43,200
community perhaps that uh would give us kind of a different orientation for how maybe

196
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:49,119
we can be as new opportunities opening up to kind of open up in a fresh way a new way with new perspective and so i

197
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:55,760
wanted to borrow from that medical ethics and see if we can maybe get a different angle on what we're

198
00:44:55,760 --> 00:45:02,240
doing here and then at this time try to then apply that also to our practice

199
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:07,680
and into imc so that's kind of the plan

200
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:14,400
so um that so the verse uh is uh

201
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:19,520
is kind of significant because it the last verse the last line

202
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:25,440
says this is the teaching of the buddhas so it's something plural in buddha's you

203
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:30,560
know some idea that this buddha has been buddhas for you know periodically down through the

204
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:36,720
eons the buddhas appear in the cosmos in buddhist cosmology

205
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:42,800
but they all have this teaching and it's kind of so the teaching is

206
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:48,800
don't do any harm very simply it's not quite literally exactly right but it's close enough for now

207
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:57,359
don't do any harm do things which are wholesome

208
00:45:57,359 --> 00:46:05,760
purify the mind this is the teachings of the buddha that's it you should memorize that

209
00:46:06,319 --> 00:46:11,839
don't do any harm do what's wholesome purify the mind

210
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:18,400
and this is the teachings of the buddha if you want you can forget about memorizing the last line

211
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:24,960
and so that's kind of kind of the background for with this today

212
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:30,800
and uh you know i think that uh we shouldn't underestimate

213
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,839
how big this whole pandemic time has been and continues to be

214
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:42,400
for probably all of us some of us have been in more fortunate circumstances during this time

215
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,400
and some people have not and but even the people unfortunate circumstances i think it's probably a

216
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:54,560
much bigger impact on the psyche on the heart than most of us can realize

217
00:46:54,560 --> 00:47:01,119
and if you have been impacted by it in all kinds of ways uh you should probably also assume it's probably bigger impact than you actually

218
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:06,880
realize uh at this point that um you know it's uh remarkable to

219
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:14,800
me that just in the united states um one and five hundred no it's all right

220
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:20,160
i think it's one in five hundred americans have died from covet

221
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:25,838
it's uh quite something it's quite a large amount of people

222
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:31,359
700 000 people and the

223
00:47:31,359 --> 00:47:37,760
in the world it's almost 5 million people have died and that's just the people who've died

224
00:47:37,760 --> 00:47:44,480
and there you know there's a ripple effect those people who lost someone if you didn't lose someone you loved and

225
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:51,040
cared for and probably you know someone who has and you know it's not so far steps away

226
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:56,800
and then there's other effects of uh the pandemic that you know you know ripple out that have been difficult you

227
00:47:56,800 --> 00:48:02,400
shouldn't there was a health we certainly just covet has been hard for people who didn't die

228
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:08,160
and uh and then there's uh but there's all kinds of other things you know like i had several family members in

229
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:13,200
hospitals were different not for covid during this time and it was hard to have them in

230
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:19,599
hospitals or because you couldn't visit sometimes and then there was kind of certain kind

231
00:48:19,599 --> 00:48:24,880
of fear around like what does it mean to be in hospital this time just around this time especially

232
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:30,160
before the vaccine came out and uh and then not not going to the

233
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:36,400
doctors or not having access to the doctors and uh i had to have a tooth extracted

234
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:43,359
and it turned out it was hard to find as someone who would do it because everyone had put off i did i put it put off for

235
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:48,640
things right all these people put off things and so then finally when i got around to it everyone

236
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:53,839
had was getting back in the summer and uh doing things so

237
00:48:53,839 --> 00:48:59,040
this has been the biggest recession in the united states since 1930s

238
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:04,960
so the people economically have been impacted huge people have lost their jobs and

239
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:10,880
some people their homes and all kinds of things so just the pandemic's been huge and

240
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,880
then in addition to that maybe and kind of compounded by it the tension of it all

241
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:23,760
is some of the social challenges of the of these last years

242
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:31,680
the you know the the you know the tremendous focus on racism and the pain of that and

243
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:37,680
the disparities that exist in this country that have become more and more evident

244
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:43,280
the tension between different political factions has gone up much more dramatically and so much has been

245
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:49,440
politicized in the way that maybe it was never before and so regardless of what side of a

246
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:56,640
political divide we sit on we feel the tension and the challenge of it

247
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:03,440
and then there's uh here at california and other places all these fires like fire after fire after

248
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:09,440
fire and um and uh it's quite impressive

249
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:16,720
and other places there's floods and hurricanes and all these challenges and

250
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:22,640
and then just a challenge of some getting getting supplies supply chains being disrupted and you know and like

251
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:28,000
what does that mean we can't get the things we usually want and there was a time

252
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,319
pandemic that was kind of some people are kind of frightened about getting just basic goods

253
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:40,400
and uh so these these are all challenging times and one of the places those challenges were huge was in the

254
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,599
medical field before the vaccine hospitals and

255
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:51,680
even after the vaccine it's been quite challenging and there was a time 100 you know 100 years ago

256
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:57,680
a year ago that feels like a long time when there was a real emphasis on

257
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:03,760
medical workers being heroes superheroes

258
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:11,839
you know and i think they deserve that name because it was quite a dedication to show up at the hospital and work

259
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:18,160
before the vaccine for example just do what it took to try to meet the people who came who were dying and very sick

260
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:25,599
and offer the best care they could and and now uh in some places in the country

261
00:51:25,599 --> 00:51:31,440
they're still doing that and they're surges but now they're also they're dealing with hostility

262
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:36,960
from people who don't believe in vaccinations or don't believe in the medical establishment field feel

263
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:44,000
excluded or feel criticized or feel somehow they're going to be abandoned by it and so they're angry

264
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:49,839
and one friend of mine who works in a hospital in in some

265
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:56,319
senator that to go to work just to go through uh protests outside the hospital and these are people people who hate to

266
00:51:56,319 --> 00:52:02,079
hate us we're just going to try to save lives and we're hated for what we're doing

267
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:08,240
so so there's you know so and some of them say i've read that some of them will take off their uniform and

268
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:14,079
their badge when they go shopping in a grocery store in some communities because if they're seen as a medical worker

269
00:52:14,079 --> 00:52:20,400
people express hostility to them so that makes it the job of you know

270
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:26,960
offering medical care much more difficult when you you know they were heroes a year ago now in some

271
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:33,119
communities they're the opposite so the with medical i've i've been i've

272
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:38,319
had some conversations with people and i'm on an ethics committee for a local hospital so

273
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:44,480
i hear a little bit of this as well and um and one of the things that inspires me

274
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:50,559
is how often the medical people i've talked to evoke medical ethics

275
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:56,240
um and um and one way they they've talked about it is uh

276
00:52:56,240 --> 00:53:02,079
they're they're commit they're committed to care for anyone who comes in through the door

277
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:08,240
to the emergency and anybody who comes they're going to offer the best care they can and they're committed to that to offer

278
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:13,599
equal care and one of the people said explicitly it means that if someone has been a

279
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:19,359
rapist or had murdered someone our job is to offer the best care we can we don't turn

280
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:24,400
anyone away we know everyone's treated equally um whether they're vaccinated or not

281
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:31,280
vaccinated we're committed to caring for them best we can it's not our our job to distinguish who should get or we

282
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:36,319
should not be getting care and uh and this kind of is complete

283
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:41,599
willingness and or willing a commitment to just be available for everyone equally and

284
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:48,960
and to care in these challenging circumstances i think is quite inspiring to me

285
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:54,000
so in the field of medical ethics there are four principles

286
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:59,680
for medical care and they have kind of latinish kind of

287
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:05,040
big name words in that field i'll tell you kind of the big words

288
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:11,200
and they are because medical folks will will use these big words because it's part of

289
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,559
their understanding so the first is autonomy

290
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:22,160
the second is beneficence the third is non-maleficence

291
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:27,839
and the fourth is justice and uh autonomy means as we in that kind

292
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:33,040
of setting as i understand it refers to the idea that um every patient

293
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:38,240
uh has the right to make their own decisions unless they have something like dementia

294
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:43,440
or something they can't but uh

295
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:48,480
and then there's a you know if someone can't make a decision for themselves it usually evokes often invokes the ethics

296
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:54,079
committee the hospital to really consider is that really the case and make sure that it's not the whim of someone who

297
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:59,520
that's really really caring for that sense of autonomy that people have

298
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:06,720
and uh and uh so that's kind of a fundamental value at least in this country around around

299
00:55:06,720 --> 00:55:12,319
medical ethics and then beneficence means that the dedication is

300
00:55:12,319 --> 00:55:19,680
to do what's uh beneficial for the patient for the person there whatever is beneficial to support them and help them

301
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:28,559
and is it does it help the persons that benefit the person non-maleficence means do no harm

302
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:33,599
and occasionally there's a conflict between those two and so you know then sometimes the

303
00:55:33,599 --> 00:55:38,720
medical ethics committee is brought in to discuss that or we have to say you know

304
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:45,440
what to do if there seems to be a conflict and then uh and then justice in this

305
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:51,920
context seems to mean that a fair use everything's offered fairly to everyone

306
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:57,839
it's a fair access to the medicines procedures everything in the

307
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:03,920
hospital especially is offered equally to everyone with no distinction between

308
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:10,079
any kind of you know economic status you know any any kind of distinction

309
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:15,599
race whatever everyone is treated equally and so that's sometimes a challenge

310
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:22,000
because sometimes there's limited resources in hospital and so um and so how do how does it

311
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:27,119
limited resources distributed in a fair way to everyone and so again sometimes

312
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:32,799
the ethics people in hospital have to come in and really kind of consider this carefully and

313
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:38,799
figure out how do we do this and this became particularly important during the cove at times

314
00:56:38,799 --> 00:56:45,200
when hospitals reach their you know beyond their peak limit and how do you do they had triage kind

315
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:50,240
of situation set up because they had to figure out how to do this as

316
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:55,359
far as fairly as they could but they couldn't do everyone because it was impossible and so how do you make this

317
00:56:55,359 --> 00:57:01,680
decision so uh so it's it's a little similar to that

318
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:07,359
buddhist verse do no harm the non-maleficence

319
00:57:07,359 --> 00:57:12,960
the buddhist thing is do what's wholesome which can be considered what's beneficial

320
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:18,799
do what's skillful what's useful helpful and uh

321
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:24,559
but the uh the two things which are not you know in that verse the same way is this idea

322
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:30,240
of autonomy and justice and and

323
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:35,760
i find that you know this idea of and you know one of the challenges around autonomy especially if we take it

324
00:57:35,760 --> 00:57:42,720
outside of the hospital setting to grant everyone in the autonomy it's it lends itself or can be very supportive of a

325
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:48,640
certain kind of selfishness and uh whatever i want i'm supposed to be autonomous and i can get what i want

326
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:55,839
i want what i want and and there's a lot of selfishness a lot of self-centeredness

327
00:57:55,839 --> 00:58:02,400
but some of that autonomy and some of that insistence on being able to make choices for oneself is also very healthy and

328
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:08,880
appropriate and how do we distinguish between that and find our way with it

329
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:16,319
and uh i don't have a good answer in the abstract but i think that that's one of the advantages of embodied mindfulness a

330
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:24,720
really careful and settled attention is that we can start feeling very very carefully

331
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:31,520
what is beneficial and what is harmful what promotes stress

332
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:36,799
and attention and and undermines our well-being

333
00:58:36,799 --> 00:58:42,720
and what promotes it and it turns out that selfishness undermines our well-being if you're

334
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:50,480
really attentive you can feel that a healthy sense of autonomy healthy sense of self

335
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:57,119
you can fee you can feel and sense the difference and what that when it feels right and the greater the mindfulness the more

336
00:58:57,119 --> 00:59:03,680
settled and focused we are in meditation i think that it's remarkable how the better and greater reference point we

337
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:09,920
have for for finding the difference between these two modes of being

338
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:16,640
and so and so eventually in meditation the

339
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:21,920
sense of autonomy becomes more and more interesting because in the end

340
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:28,480
it's not that we become autonomous but that like i look how i'm autonomous person

341
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:34,720
i'm going to be my own person in a sense but rather it's the awareness

342
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,839
that becomes autonomous it's awareness set free

343
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:46,480
and sometimes they talk about in buddhism the mind set free the mind liberated from

344
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:52,960
through my the mind liberated through non-clinging but i like to think that what exactly

345
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:58,319
the mind is is a little complicated but i have this clear clear idea that if we

346
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:04,400
understand it to be awareness that we're saying awareness is becoming autonomous

347
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:10,720
and what's it becoming autonomous from it's becoming autonomous from ourselves

348
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:16,400
any kind of baggage of self any kind of association beliefs we have about it

349
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:21,760
so i give you an example from myself is that at some point

350
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:28,079
in my practice i recognize that that i could be aware of things i could be

351
01:00:28,079 --> 01:00:34,559
mindful and be present but i recognized that that mindfulness came along

352
01:00:34,559 --> 01:00:40,480
with um an attitude like with baggage of kind of it kind of penetrated or

353
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,599
kind of suffused the awareness itself and that was something like um

354
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:55,359
whatever i'm whatever i'm doing whatever i'm aware of it's the wrong thing

355
01:00:55,359 --> 01:01:01,280
well i if i'm if it's happening to me it's not the right thing

356
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:07,119
if it's um if i'm being aware i'm not aware the right way

357
01:01:07,119 --> 01:01:12,240
so so uh and it was kind of subtle but it was kind of like a policy that

358
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:17,680
mind had made up and so and so as i got quieter and quieter at

359
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:23,280
some point i could see that that i was operating through this filter of that all the time

360
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:28,720
and it kept my awareness my mindfulness a little tense a little

361
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:35,440
pulled back from the experience and and so as i started feeling being this

362
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:41,440
pulled backness this tense tension and how the awareness is and the kind of contraction around it

363
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,799
that had to do with this kind of view then i was able to relax that

364
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:52,240
and for a short time i actually played around with kind of just assuming the opposite

365
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:58,400
you know if it's happening to me it's okay if i'm aware i'm doing it just right

366
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:03,920
and that was actually useful for a little while to have that kind of try the opposite because it helped help me

367
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:08,960
stay free help me find a different way and then at some point at some point

368
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:15,520
they started to stop doing that and it was easier me to have this kind of awareness than be autonomous

369
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:20,799
independent from this policy these ideas this baggage i had about what i needed

370
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:26,319
to do what was happening to me my judgments about things and so it became the awareness started

371
01:02:26,319 --> 01:02:34,319
to become simpler and simpler and this idea of awareness becoming simpler without any baggage associations

372
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:40,480
judgments even a sense of self that came along i'm the doer of mindfulness was part of the

373
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:46,880
wonderfulness of this kind of awareness set free so

374
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:52,480
so you know to have the awareness be autonomous is uh

375
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:57,520
kind of comes along with this liberation process in buddhism

376
01:02:57,520 --> 01:03:05,599
but the fourth medical principle of uh justice is a and fairness

377
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:11,440
how does that play out in buddhism and i think that's one of the ones i think

378
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:18,000
our society has maybe the greatest need for is uh as a society community

379
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,280
is a community a society that's fair that somehow everyone seems to have a

380
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:28,480
fair access to to the opportunities that

381
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:34,559
many times only the people who are very fortunate circumstance has available to it

382
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:41,599
and how does imc offer itself fairly to the world how do we make we give access to a wide

383
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:47,520
circle of people so that it feels like we're just open and available and

384
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:53,119
and uh and how do we if we turn imc inside out if we turn

385
01:03:53,119 --> 01:03:59,760
ourselves inside out as i said in the meditation is that as we settle and as a today so

386
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:06,880
awareness is set free it's also setting the heart free it's also this great deeper sensitivity

387
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:13,200
as we go down to out into the world and it doesn't make sense to meditate

388
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:18,480
be subtle and peaceful and calm and be kind of open and sensitive to what's happening

389
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:24,400
and then leave the meditation and immediately shut down immediately kind of get caught up in our

390
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:30,640
desires and our business of stuff and and kind of then have a barrier to

391
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:36,960
really block to really feel and sense and be and care for this world around us

392
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:44,400
and it doesn't make sense because it's a way of not caring for ourselves when we when we shut down we close up we

393
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:50,319
get so preoccupied and caught up in our thoughts our feelings our concerns our business

394
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:57,839
we lose something about ourselves and this is something also that can be felt if you're mindful

395
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:04,559
but sometimes we're so distracted we don't know that we're distracted but if the mindfulness becomes second

396
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:10,799
habit second nature and you're really sensitive and aware you feel that as we get caught up in

397
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:16,079
distractions uh it actually is a kind of

398
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:24,079
kind of harm a kind of self limiting there's kind of a undermining of ourselves of something

399
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:31,839
that we discover in meditation perhaps or in other ways that feel so healthy and so appropriate and so wise

400
01:05:31,839 --> 01:05:37,760
to be settled and peaceful and present and so even though social world is a

401
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:45,280
complex and difficult world part of the task of mindfulness practice is to learn how to bring this kind of

402
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:51,680
presence and attention open-heartedness perhaps into the world with others as well

403
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:58,240
and so to turn ourselves inside out so the part of that sensitive to us like

404
01:05:58,240 --> 01:06:04,799
like if we go walk around with a closed fist the most sensitive part of the hand is protected

405
01:06:04,799 --> 01:06:09,920
that's very nice no one's going to harm my sensitive hand ever again because i'm going to walk

406
01:06:09,920 --> 01:06:15,680
around this way but that doesn't make sense right and but you want that sensitive part of your

407
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:21,280
hand to be available you know if you have a cat you want us or if you want to touch the shoulder or

408
01:06:21,280 --> 01:06:28,079
someone who feels kind of has in difficulty in their lives and just i'm here with you and

409
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:33,280
or hold the hand of someone you care maybe care for like a little maybe there's a

410
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:40,160
little kid in your life and so the kid wants to hold your hand no sorry i'm keeping my sensitive part of my my

411
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:45,760
hand you know safe no but you know so you're available for all kinds of things so the same thing

412
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:50,880
with the heart with the inner life if we keep it closed up

413
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:58,160
then we limit ourselves but if we turn ourselves inside out like the hand turns itself opens up

414
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:05,039
but then we learn how to be stable we learn how to not contract

415
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:11,599
we learn how to take care of ourselves from that place we learn how to

416
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:17,280
recognize all the subtle policies and attitudes that we have brought with us

417
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:22,559
to being aware to being attentive and we realized i mean there's a lot of

418
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,760
reactivity beliefs judgments that are sometimes quite subtle

419
01:07:27,760 --> 01:07:32,960
that in ordinary life most people don't see because they're so busy with

420
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:39,119
you know too busy with doing things but the advantage of getting quiet and still in meditation

421
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:45,520
is we can start seeing these subtle ways things attitudes we bring along that

422
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:50,960
often don't make us safe this lack of safety that many people

423
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:57,280
feel some of it's real the world's an unsafe place but for many people also

424
01:07:57,280 --> 01:08:02,319
the greatest danger for our safety is not the other people but ourselves

425
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:07,440
and so to understand how we bring our safety with us not insisting that the

426
01:08:07,440 --> 01:08:12,720
world become a safe place for us which is a little bit of a difficult

427
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:18,719
you know a little bit complicated issue but sometimes we become less self the less less safe if

428
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:24,719
we insist that other people make us safer but how do we carry our safety with us

429
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:30,880
how do we discover that it's a challenging thing not easy but it's uh boy is it a powerful thing

430
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:38,238
to discover that and then it's easier to be open-hearted it's easier to have this keep our our

431
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:43,679
sensitivity open and allow other to allow ourselves to be to register

432
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:50,480
the presence of other people the existence of other people and let it register in that place within

433
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:55,679
where we care uh where there's good will where there's

434
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:02,318
generosity and but not in a way that we're obligated to care not in a way that

435
01:09:02,319 --> 01:09:08,640
we're obligated to be generous or have good will because i think that doesn't work so

436
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:15,440
well what's phenomenal and kind of a miracle is the degree to which sometimes we can

437
01:09:15,440 --> 01:09:21,040
feel that it's just a it's part of our nature to have good will it's part of a natural

438
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:27,679
kind of flow or natural responsibility to feel warmth to feel care to feel good

439
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:34,480
will and uh and to stay close to the close to that place

440
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:39,679
where that it just seems to flow it arises and

441
01:09:39,679 --> 01:09:45,758
in a non-obligatory way and one reason to stay close to it

442
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:53,359
is that um the that's where the freedom is

443
01:09:53,359 --> 01:09:59,440
that's where this uh autonomy is found the autonomy of

444
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:04,880
awareness set free the mind set free and you you kind of can't have it both

445
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:11,120
ways you can't discover this radical liberation this radical autonomy that

446
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:17,600
liberate that mindfulness brings about and stay closed and shut out

447
01:10:17,600 --> 01:10:23,280
and be distracted from being sensitive to this world and so

448
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:29,840
how do you know but to how to discover to do both you know that's the art of buddhist

449
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:35,920
practice and and then

450
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:43,280
and if we're sensitive if we have this open-heartedness then i think it's easier

451
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:48,800
to figure out justice to want justice for each other to want

452
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:56,000
to be fair and how we use our resources and our activities and not just live for ourselves

453
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:02,159
but to live for ourselves and for others and this is uh

454
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:07,840
one of the central principles i believe that the buddha taught

455
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:13,120
that to live our lives for the welfare of our self

456
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:20,480
the welfare of others the welfare of self and others and the welfare for the whole world

457
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:28,000
this the buddha defined a wise person as someone who has those four concerns

458
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:35,600
concerned for the welfare of themselves for others for self and others and for the whole world

459
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:41,840
and and it can seem like a big heavy thing to be told that like i got to get busy

460
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:47,600
now that's a lot to do but again it's coming from that place

461
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:54,640
of freedom it's coming from the place of autonomy of of subtleness that we did hopefully discover through this practice

462
01:11:54,640 --> 01:12:01,600
so it's not a duty it's not work it just seems to be an expression natural expression of what's already in

463
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:06,800
there when it's been set free when what's here

464
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:11,920
and um and certainly that's uh it was a big surprise to me when after some years

465
01:12:11,920 --> 01:12:17,280
of my practice in my early years when um uh

466
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:23,840
there was more integrity in this psychophysical system that i am

467
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:30,640
when i wasn't self-preoccupied it was more integrity when i was just

468
01:12:30,640 --> 01:12:37,600
available or the system was available to be responsive to the world around me

469
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:43,920
and then and that response that seemed to just arise to surface uh kind of effortlessly

470
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:50,440
and then to act on that to live live live from that

471
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:57,920
so what does it mean for us as a community in uh imc as a community and now is

472
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:05,360
a much larger community than we were before the pandemic with all the people online what does it mean not as

473
01:13:05,360 --> 01:13:10,560
individuals but we also come together in community it's kind of special to be here

474
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:17,040
those of us are here in person and it's been special the sense of community that's formed

475
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:23,280
on youtube over this time and uh so what does it mean that that's the

476
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:28,960
uh when the buddha said the wise person thinks about the welfare of self welfare of others and the welfare of

477
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:34,400
self and others the self and others i see to be i can i think of as the we the

478
01:13:34,400 --> 01:13:41,440
community that we are and and how do we care for this community and how do we live as a community and

479
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:47,040
care for each other and uh and how is a community

480
01:13:47,040 --> 01:13:53,040
uh do we turn ourselves inside out and so our community sensitivity is

481
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:58,560
is also out into the wider world and uh caring for this wider world that

482
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:05,040
we live in wider community so how does um

483
01:14:05,120 --> 01:14:11,760
how does it look and uh for us to have these four principles

484
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:17,120
available for you know the foundation of our community of autonomy and all the different things it might

485
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:22,480
mean non-harming

486
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:30,400
be dedicated to do what's beneficial to welfare for all involved

487
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:36,480
and justice fairness and how do what does that mean and what does it mean in a social way and for the

488
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:42,719
wider communities that we're part of and what does it mean like we're here in redwood city

489
01:14:42,719 --> 01:14:49,600
what does it mean to be part of this redwood city community san mateo community california community

490
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:54,960
is the what what kind of issues comes up when we think about fairness or justice

491
01:14:54,960 --> 01:15:01,360
as an expression of who we are as a concern or that we have and carry with us

492
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:07,199
i don't have good answers for that but i would like to believe that asking that

493
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:14,080
question is part of this natural expression of this autonomy this place of subtleness

494
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:18,480
of being turned inside out by this practice

495
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,679
so here we are uh

496
01:15:26,239 --> 01:15:32,880
in person here we're still very much evidence of living in the pandemic times

497
01:15:32,880 --> 01:15:38,960
all of us are wearing masks and but we've come together

498
01:15:38,960 --> 01:15:45,040
in a community in a way that for some of you perhaps this is the most number of people you've been together with in this

499
01:15:45,040 --> 01:15:50,800
kind of way maybe for a year and a half um i think the

500
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:56,159
i've been in one group that was maybe a little bit bigger than this in august but that was only a couple of

501
01:15:56,159 --> 01:16:01,360
months ago right and uh you know there are months i hardly had any any contact direct

502
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:08,080
contact with people outside my family and uh so it's a big deal and here we

503
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:13,120
are coming and i want to mark this time we're coming together in community and

504
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:18,960
and imc as a as a connected community is grows

505
01:16:18,960 --> 01:16:24,560
because of this and uh you're contributing to not just being here

506
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:30,320
and you're connected you're contributing to that not just for those of you here but i think it's also a sense that

507
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:35,360
people are not here i kind of are now feeling that something is becoming

508
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:41,760
embodied or something is growing again that has not been happening for many months

509
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:48,159
and so in what way can we be mindful of community and what's happening in

510
01:16:48,159 --> 01:16:55,600
community is uh one of the you know one of the

511
01:16:55,600 --> 01:17:02,800
i think interesting and important questions at this time so that's what i have to say

512
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:10,719
and uh any of you would like to say anything that uh we have about six minutes or so

513
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:17,360
and uh anything that you'd like to ask or bring up or say and there's two ways

514
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:22,800
of you can do it you could or three ways you can try to speak loud but then i won't be heard by

515
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:28,640
the people on on youtube there's a mic here we can pass to you or

516
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:36,960
if you wanted to have the minimum physical contact the mic that's on the stand back there um oh you know you you stand hold it the

517
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:42,239
mic is held by the stand all you do is push the button on and once it's on it can stay on

518
01:17:42,239 --> 01:17:47,320
so i don't know if anybody would like to say anything or ask something

519
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:12,679
there's some very nice expressions of gratitude and warmth coming from the youtube community

520
01:18:22,400 --> 01:18:27,840
that's a bill do you mind using that

521
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:39,360
i want to say how helpful it is for me to be back here past year and a half my

522
01:18:39,360 --> 01:18:44,960
discipline when it comes to meditating at home

523
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:52,480
as cratered and my life is good but my mind you know

524
01:18:52,480 --> 01:18:59,600
state of mind isn't as a quantum economist as it could have been uh i seem to need to uh have this

525
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:05,840
structured setting great yeah i mean the community makes a big difference and just be honest so uh lovely to be back

526
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:13,040
here thank you great great to see you and have you back thank you so harry richard there

527
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:18,320
hi richard so uh my experience has actually been somewhat different

528
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:24,480
i had kind of wandered away from the community because you had moved one direction i had moved away and it's a

529
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:31,440
little farther to get here and when i found out that the daily sessions were online i began

530
01:19:31,440 --> 01:19:37,920
started my practice again and it actually has helped me tremendously and i've really enjoyed

531
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:43,280
being part of the larger saga nonetheless it is still wonderful to be

532
01:19:43,280 --> 01:19:49,120
back in person and this is very important and i think i'm going to renew my

533
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:54,239
intention to connect more more often in person

534
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:59,280
wonderful but thank you very much for creating the the larger song as well and

535
01:19:59,280 --> 01:20:04,960
i certainly hope that that will continue great thank you and then someone over here i saw and then

536
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:11,040
molly yeah i just wanted to say gil that um

537
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:18,159
that has been a pretty easy time for me i think it sounds strange but cheryl and i live in a senior retirement community

538
01:20:18,159 --> 01:20:24,480
of about 200 people and of course we had you know isolation and all that kind of stuff and now we're able to get together

539
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:29,520
in the dining room but what i want what i really noticed was how helpful

540
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:35,840
my 50 years of meditation has been and 25 with you in this community it's made

541
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:42,800
a very big difference and helped me to stay pretty equanimous and and that being said there are times

542
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:50,080
when i've lost it from time to time glancing at my wife for the youtube yes that that that's

543
01:20:50,080 --> 01:20:56,080
occurred but you know i feel like this is this has been um uh a learning and growing experience for

544
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:02,800
me great thank you and i appreciate your help in that thank you yeah i think we would expect some testimonials that

545
01:21:02,800 --> 01:21:08,639
50 years of practice you know even two years would do it though i

546
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:15,520
remember the first five years i'm thinking wow my life is things are falling in place and and i think that my

547
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:22,560
just my mindfulness and one of my early teachers said that it turns up the volume on your intuition nice and i

548
01:21:22,560 --> 01:21:27,560
think that was true for me so maybe

549
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:41,280
thank you sure um when you announced that you were going to be opening the center i felt a

550
01:21:41,280 --> 01:21:48,400
little bit closer oh when you announced that you were going to be having sessions we could sign up uh once a month or whatever

551
01:21:48,400 --> 01:21:54,239
i felt extremely privileged because i know that there are hundreds if not thousands of people on

552
01:21:54,239 --> 01:21:59,280
the internet that would just give anything to be able to come here and

553
01:21:59,280 --> 01:22:04,800
experience this and to live here and i've always felt very welcomed and

554
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:10,480
one of the things that you said today struck me um when when there have been really

555
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:17,120
difficult circumstances in my life at one point before coming here

556
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:23,040
i felt like i was coming out of my skin and it was a terrible terrible feeling

557
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:28,880
and then after coming here the message that you gave today was

558
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:35,600
that you i think it was something to the effect that you're turned uh your insides are turned inside out

559
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:41,520
and you feel comfortable and it's just a wonderful way to be in the world

560
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:48,840
and i want to thank you for all of your support fantastic thank you

561
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:04,080
i also feel so lucky to be here and privileged

562
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:09,679
i'm also really appreciate your asking the question you did at the end of the talk

563
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:16,800
uh and it seems to me maybe you use this phrase yourself but it's asking how this community can turn inside out

564
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:22,000
and we were at a memorial service yesterday at a christian church very activist christian church

565
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:27,760
and the talk that was given was very moving and the kind of moving of talk that throughout my life would have had

566
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:34,159
me go right onto the streets in march protest and i had really mixed feelings because

567
01:23:34,159 --> 01:23:41,600
i thought how it was very lovingly given but how that's dicey stuff when you

568
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:48,159
have that kind of great passion and how and it's harder

569
01:23:48,159 --> 01:23:56,480
in a buddhist perspective to have the equanimity and yet to act so i

570
01:23:56,480 --> 01:24:02,800
really appreciate your ending with that that very hard question i don't have any answers

571
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:08,639
thank you great thank you right behind you there

572
01:24:09,120 --> 01:24:16,719
um i just want to say you know thank you for you and the bigger community which helped me get

573
01:24:16,719 --> 01:24:22,400
through not just last year but many years and unfortunately i lost my father

574
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:28,400
earlier this year to go with and being in a different continent i couldn't even go

575
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:35,679
but i think what kept me was your meditation and and a lot of the teachings i would go and listen to some

576
01:24:35,679 --> 01:24:42,320
of the you know the talks you had in in those like grief or those kind of um

577
01:24:42,320 --> 01:24:48,480
context so i think all i want to say is it's been thankful to be

578
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:54,639
even though remote but i never felt you know i was remote because you know i would listen to them all all the time

579
01:24:54,639 --> 01:25:02,320
and the meditation every day i think kept me going so honestly thank you thank you so much i love hearing that

580
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:08,560
so maybe maybe that's it for anyone no no you want to say something

581
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:14,960
animals yeah yeah i also want to give voice to the

582
01:25:14,960 --> 01:25:20,639
people who have during this pandemic not have had the ecs experience

583
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:25,920
and i will never it's only the privileged only they're privileged to have had this

584
01:25:25,920 --> 01:25:31,280
experience i remember a gentleman from india being interviewed

585
01:25:31,280 --> 01:25:37,280
during the pandemic and he was asked was he worried about covet

586
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:45,440
and this is unforgettable he said are you kidding me i'm worried about my next meal

587
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:53,040
yeah so only the privileged i think can share this kind of sentiment

588
01:25:53,040 --> 01:25:59,280
yeah and um and so how to hold that

589
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:05,360
yeah great yes thank you that punctuates very much very nicely

590
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:11,440
how do we live in this world in community with each other what does it mean to feel community with

591
01:26:11,440 --> 01:26:18,400
everyone and how do we know the whole range of

592
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:23,679
joys and gifts and challenges and sufferings that this community hawaii

593
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:29,040
