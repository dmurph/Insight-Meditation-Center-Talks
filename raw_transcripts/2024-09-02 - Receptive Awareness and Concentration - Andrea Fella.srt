1
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,440
good morning or for those of you

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:15,280
on the live stream whatever time it is for

3
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:22,439
you I'll start with a little bit of a guided meditation this

4
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:29,519
morning and I'm going to offer perhaps a style that may be a little less familiar

5
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:36,239
to some of you it's an open awareness style of

6
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,760
meditation and so we won't be at least for the first few minutes in my guiding

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,239
of it I won't be um inclining you towards stabilizing with the breath

8
00:00:47,239 --> 00:00:52,520
it'll be more of a stabilization of awareness with whatever is

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:01:00,039
arising and then after some time I'll I'll I'll suggest if you feel more comfortable you can shift back but you

10
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:07,760
might just go along for the ride for the first few minutes at least see how it how it lands for

11
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,758
you in any form of

12
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:28,240
meditation relaxation of body and

13
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,118
mind are very supportive

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:45,798
condition for the connection of mindfulness with

15
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:54,399
experience and so I often find it helpful at the beginning of a sitting to take a few moments to

16
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,040
consciously relax

17
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:06,880
this can be done in a kind of a systematic

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,959
way starting perhaps at the top of the

19
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,959
head relaxing the head and

20
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,640
face neck and shoulders

21
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,400
arms and

22
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,680
hands relaxing the chest and upper

23
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,879
back all those muscles around the rib cage

24
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:07,080
sometimes as I relax that area quite naturally a deeper breath

25
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:13,799
happens maybe allowing a deeper breath to expand and stretch those

26
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:22,599
muscles and then notice the softening of those muscles on the out breath

27
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:41,000
exploring a softening across the stomach and abdomen middle and lower

28
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,280
back maybe the hips can

29
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:59,560
relax the legs the feet

30
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:13,360
and then perhaps there can also be a softening more deeply

31
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:24,160
inside the body maybe the inside of the throat can

32
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:36,000
soften maybe the area around the heart can

33
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:48,080
soften maybe the stomach and intestines can

34
00:04:50,280 --> 00:05:00,680
soften allowing there to be a kind of a relaxation a letting go

35
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:08,160
in all of those organs inside the

36
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:20,560
body we don't have to hold them up our body naturally supports them

37
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:42,840
as the body softens and relaxes

38
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,919
whatever however much it's softened

39
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:56,080
or relaxed that supports a mental

40
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:04,240
relaxation so you might have noticed a little bit of relaxation of mind a

41
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,120
little bit of less pull to thoughts or worries or

42
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:19,919
concerns and we can also explore relaxing the

43
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:29,720
mind one of the best ways into that has for me been a

44
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,720
encouragement by Gil as if the brain were a

45
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,919
muscle maybe the brain can relax

46
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:10,520
as we've been exploring a conscious relaxation we have been aware

47
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:16,520
mindful of this process at least at times

48
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:24,680
perhaps noticing the body noticing the mind this is

49
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:33,039
awareness and so now there's a kind of I'd like to encourage a little bit of a

50
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,080
shift to recognizing are you

51
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:43,159
aware you don't have to think about it if you're hearing my

52
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:50,360
voice knowing the sound knowing Body Sensations you are

53
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,879
aware you may not know how you know you're aware but

54
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,080
just open to that awareness is

55
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:15,440
here and awareness will connect quite

56
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:23,879
naturally is connecting quite naturally already with some aspect of

57
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,960
experience maybe Body Sensations

58
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,200
with a breath or

59
00:08:50,080 --> 00:09:01,440
sound maybe thoughts even or a mood or an emotional tone

60
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:16,399
having a sense of settling back and

61
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:23,160
receiving whatever is obvious In This Moment

62
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:37,519
awareness will be receiving something we don't actually have to aim

63
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:42,320
or point the

64
00:09:52,399 --> 00:10:02,040
attention I think of attention attention is a factor of mind

65
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,800
that connects with some aspect of our

66
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:19,320
experience it's a little different from awareness awareness is that aspect that

67
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:26,720
receives experience

68
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:34,640
attention connects with some part particular aspect of

69
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:43,639
experience and while attention is amenable to our conscious choice we can

70
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:51,199
choose aim the attention at the breath or the body or

71
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:58,760
sound any experience if we don't choose to do that

72
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:05,240
and kind of let go of the active choice of where to aim the

73
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:11,279
attention the attention will connect with

74
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:18,959
something so what is obvious without you're trying to find

75
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:24,839
anything relax

76
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:31,720
receive often it is something like the body especially at first because the

77
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,240
Body Sensations are pretty

78
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:46,720
obvious and as we receive step back from aiming or

79
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:55,519
choosing where to place the attention we will notice that the attention

80
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:02,920
shifts new experience are received in each

81
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:14,160
moment maybe a breath and then another body sensation a

82
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:21,040
pressure maybe the Sound hearing

83
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:44,279
receiving it's okay if the experience changes we're

84
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:52,600
cultivating awareness being aware with whatever is arising

85
00:13:07,399 --> 00:13:14,360
and also if the attention lands in a familiar place like the breath for

86
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:22,560
instance you don't have to keep it from being there if that's naturally where the attention is going that's

87
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:30,360
fine receive the breath

88
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:37,839
receive whatever the attention is naturally connecting

89
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:46,600
with and the attention is likely to shift at some

90
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:53,000
point do a sound another body

91
00:13:53,959 --> 00:14:01,320
sensation a thought and noticing that be curious

92
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:07,920
about the shift of attention and let the attention then

93
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:14,880
receive let the awareness receive wherever that attention has

94
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,160
connected with we don't have

95
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:29,759
to let go of that and return to any particular experience

96
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:37,680
if we notice the shift and allow the connection of awareness with whatever that experiences

97
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,199
we are

98
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:56,079
aware relaxation really supports this kind of exploration

99
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,959
what is obvious In This

100
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:20,519
Moment In This Moment

101
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:37,120
sometimes the attention will connect with something very

102
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:43,319
specific a specific sound or a body sensation a breath or a

103
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:49,480
thought very clear sometimes what the attention is connecting

104
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:57,720
to and other times the attention feels more Broad

105
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:05,399
it maybe feels like connecting with the whole

106
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:11,839
experience or something more diffuse something less specific or

107
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:16,279
precise we may not even know what it

108
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:22,560
is but there's the recognition that we are

109
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:32,160
aware we don't have to find a specific clear

110
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:41,079
experience if we know we're [Music] aware that's

111
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:48,720
enough are you aware

112
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:10,360
maybe have the sense of following the attention that shift of

113
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:32,039
attention and of course the mind will

114
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:40,640
wander as with any practice we'll get lost in some

115
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:47,320
experience get start thinking about something and not be aware that we're

116
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:59,280
thinking and at some point awareness will return

117
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:08,120
in that moment you know when awareness returns can you

118
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:14,320
recognize aware again aware

119
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:21,320
again awareness has returned and it's knowing something in that

120
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:27,880
moment it may be knowing something about where it was wandering to the

121
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:32,200
thought or an emot an

122
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,039
image so awareness of

123
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:48,880
that relax and

124
00:18:53,120 --> 00:19:00,200
receive now you may feel a pull back to thinking

125
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:05,760
you may be able to notice that pull that's just another experience arising

126
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:12,440
that pull it's kind of where the attention is wanting to go you're noticing how the attention is drawn you

127
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:16,440
might be able to recognize that

128
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,520
pull and sometimes the pull is stronger than our capacity to really

129
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:31,559
know it and if it feels that way then and it's fine

130
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:37,919
to relax and connect to some very easy

131
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:44,520
experience maybe the breath for you or hearing or body

132
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:53,200
sensation as a place to kind of remember awareness refresh the connection with

133
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:56,519
being aware

134
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:11,760
and continuing relax recognize

135
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:22,240
awareness what is obvious in this

136
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:30,400
moment and this moment settling

137
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,880
back and

138
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:44,520
receiving this flow of human experience we can be

139
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,159
aware with all of it

140
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:11,279
if this receptive awareness of Just moment to

141
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:17,640
moment experience of what is obvious feels easeful for

142
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:24,120
you you're welcome to continue exploring

143
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:35,600
that if it feels more agitating or

144
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:42,760
chaotic you're welcome to return to whatever practice or style

145
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:50,000
of connecting with experience is most supportive for you

146
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,240

Retreat centers around the country thank you thank

198
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:06,359
you I want to make one correction I'm not a co-founder of

199
00:38:06,839 --> 00:38:12,040
IMC I was a

200
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,040
student

201
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:27,640
here so in this um style of practice I offered in the guided meditation the

202
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:33,440
receptive awareness settling back and just receiving momentto moment

203
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:39,800
experience not aiming or pointing to stay with one particular

204
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:47,480
object people often will ask how does concentration fit in to this practice

205
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,800
how does it how does it work and so I'd like to respond to that question in in a

206
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:59,040
little talk here um so kind of talking about different form forms of

207
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:04,680
concentration in general concentration I would say

208
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:10,920
there's different ways we can think about concentration we often think about it as Focus that's that's what I think

209
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:16,720
we we tend to think about the word as what the word means but in terms of um a

210
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:22,640
quality of mind we could say it's a stability of mind and in terms of the

211
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:28,720
meditation practice it's a stability of Mind a comp

212
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:34,160
osure a sense of collectedness of non-d

213
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:39,400
distraction those are some some other words that resonate with what

214
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:48,240
concentration is unbroken attentiveness another another

215
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:54,480
word concentration um

216
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,680
arises it's not something we do so much concentration arises as a natural

217
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:09,560
condition it arises when we explore energy and mindfulness

218
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:14,599
together making the effort to stay connected with experience moment after

219
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:20,400
moment and often we do that by staying with one particular object the breath

220
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:28,040
for example so the the um concentration I would say

221
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:33,280
in in terms of these these words non- distraction composure

222
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:38,839
collectedness unbroken attentiveness another definition we could say for

223
00:40:38,839 --> 00:40:44,599
concentration is mindfulness present moment after

224
00:40:44,599 --> 00:40:49,640
moment now it may be present with one particular experience the breath moment

225
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:56,359
after moment or it may be ex uh present with changing experience moment after

226
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:02,119
moment so these are two different kinds of

227
00:41:02,119 --> 00:41:07,680
concentration and I'll talk a little bit more about those two different kinds

228
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:13,280
just to kind of highlight some of the differences and how they're practiced and how they're cultivated but

229
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:18,800
concentration itself comes about through cultivating

230
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:27,119
mindfulness with some effort you know with making energy to stay connected to the present moment

231
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:36,200
there's a couple of places in the sutas where the Buddha points to concentration being

232
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:42,319
a natural consequence of practice so there's a a

233
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:47,880
statement it's to be expected that one who has Faith whose energy is

234
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:53,640
aroused and whose mindfulness is established will gain

235
00:41:53,640 --> 00:42:00,240
concentration will experience concentration so we don't make concentration

236
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:05,960
happen we do connect with experience moment after moment we make that effort

237
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:12,560
we make that kind of we engage in that way and sometimes that's a kind of an

238
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:19,200
active engagement and directing or aiming of the attention to the breath or some

239
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:25,839
particular experience and sometimes it's more of a connecting with awareness

240
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:31,880
itself knowing that we're aware and receiving experience moment after moment

241
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:39,119
that was the way I was guiding the first 15 minutes or so of the guided meditation today that

242
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:45,400
receptivity we're not choosing to um aim the attention at a particular experience

243
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:50,800
but we are connecting it takes some effort to connect what's obvious now

244
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:59,078
what's obvious now or maybe noticing when the attention shifts from one experience to another

245
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:07,079
so we make that effort we engage with energy and mindfulness as the as the

246
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:13,280
suta quote says whose energy is aroused and whose mindfulness is established will experience

247
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:21,240
concentration so we don't make concentration happen we gently encourage mindfulness

248
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:26,680
moment to moment and concentration the purpose of

249
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:33,960
concent ation isn't the concentration in and of itself concentration does feel good it

250
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:40,240
it uh creates a sense of ease in the mind it creates often creates a feeling

251
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:47,720
of Tranquility there's sometimes experiences of delight or um Happiness

252
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:53,880
joy that can arise with the arising of concentration but all of that is not why

253
00:43:53,880 --> 00:44:00,000
we do it in this in in Buddhist

254
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,599
practice we look at establishing mindfulness and cultivating that

255
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:12,359
concentration so that we can see clearly we can understand our minds we can

256
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:19,599
understand how our minds struggle how they get caught and how

257
00:44:19,599 --> 00:44:25,279
they can move in the direction of more ease more peace

258
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:33,200
more happiness less suffering and so the concentrated mind

259
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:38,920
allows mindfulness it's kind of like a like um sharpening a knife we could

260
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:44,520
think of mindfulness kind of being like a a a knife that kind of clearly can see

261
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:49,559
what's going on in our mind and the uh the concentration is like the sharpening

262
00:44:49,559 --> 00:44:55,079
of that knife it creates more capacity more

263
00:44:55,079 --> 00:44:58,800
clarity perhaps

264
00:45:01,319 --> 00:45:08,200
so the recognition of what is skillful what

265
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:15,319
is unskillful the the qualities we begin to see with mindfulness we begin to see

266
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:21,000
what's going on in our mind sometimes patterns related to Greed aversion and

267
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:26,520
delusion and we feel we see we we see those patterns we feel them and we know

268
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:32,680
directly in the moment wow those things do not feel good they are

269
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:37,760
suffering they create tension they create stress they create contracted

270
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,160
those qualities of heart and mind and then when we also see our a mindfulness

271
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:49,559
can also see other qualities of Mind open-heartedness connectedness care

272
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:55,559
patience happiness Tranquility calm and when we feel those with

273
00:45:55,559 --> 00:46:01,520
mindfulness we feel the ease that's associated with

274
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:06,920
those we feel a a spaciousness we

275
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:12,480
feel openness non-constricted

276
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:17,599
and so this difference we notice this

277
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:27,160
difference between these habits and patterns of greed diversion and delusion and the arisings of with non-

278
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:34,079
greed non aversion non- delusion love compassion wisdom patience Tranquility

279
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:39,240
Joy the light we feel the difference between

280
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:44,599
those and we don't have to turn away

281
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:50,720
from those challenging states of mind the the the teachings of the Buddha

282
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:56,720
point to the first the first Noble Truth

283
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:03,359
there is Dua there is suffering and the Buddha's encouragement

284
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:11,279
around that Noble Truth understand it we should understand

285
00:47:11,920 --> 00:47:17,839
Dua so this understanding of Duca is precisely what concentration and

286
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:23,359
mindfulness together support so when we see the arising of

287
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:28,720
anger or frustration or confusion or or desire

288
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:37,319
greed when we can see that with mindfulness and concentration yes we feel the dooka of it and the one of the

289
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:43,720
beautiful things about mindfulness and wisdom together this mindfulness

290
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:49,680
concentration and wisdom as they come together when we

291
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:55,599
know and can see these UNH wholesome qualities of Mind arising these

292
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:01,079
qualities based in greed diversion and delusion when we see them

293
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:11,839
arising it creates the conditions for them to get weaker mindfulness and wisdom do that we

294
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:19,920
don't have to turn away from it if we can know it if mindfulness and concentration

295
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:25,240
are established concentration is present and

296
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:31,160
there's this stability of undistracted attention

297
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:39,359
knowing the arising of those UNH wholesome states of mind is no longer

298
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:45,000
UNH wholesome because it's being witnessed

299
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:51,040
with wholesome qualities of mindfulness wisdom and concentration so we're cultivating those

300
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:59,280
wholesome qualities and learning about those habits and patterns of mind

301
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:06,799
and when mindfulness wisdom and concentration recognize

302
00:49:06,799 --> 00:49:12,480
suffering they understand this is not the way to happiness this is not the

303
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:18,680
direction and so it begins to support the mind letting it go now Maybe not

304
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:25,400
immediately Maybe not immediately but it it inclines in that

305
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,000
direction and then when mindfulness concentration and wisdom meet those

306
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:36,319
wholesome qualities of Mind states of Mind based in non- greed

307
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:42,160
non aversion non- delusion those ones that feel expansive

308
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:50,559
feel beautiful feel uplifting there's a s there's a sense of

309
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:57,720
well-being when mindfulness wisdom and concentration meet those they understand

310
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:06,280
this is the way to happiness and those qualities are

311
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:16,359
strengthened so mindfulness wisdom and concentration are wonderful supports

312
00:50:16,359 --> 00:50:22,400
they are we we don't have to try to

313
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:28,680
weaken those qualities of mind that are UNH

314
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:36,119
wholesome or try to strengthen the qualities of mind that are wholesome it's natural that these quality these

315
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:42,760
the UNH wholesome qualities diminish and the wholesome qualities increase as we

316
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:49,359
cultivate energy mindfulness concentration with wisdom with this

317
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:53,759
curiosity about what's here

318
00:50:57,799 --> 00:51:04,720
so the the um the concentration there does not need

319
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:10,760
to be just on one experience as we turn as we as we open

320
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:17,400
to what's arising in our experience we will see all kinds of things going on in our

321
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:24,480
mind frustration confusion anger hatred love compassion kindness we'll feel all kinds of things

322
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:31,200
going on in our bodies and so there is a form of concentration

323
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:38,599
that allows for that so there's I'll talk about two

324
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:45,480
forms of concentration just a little briefly here um the the one we're more familiar

325
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:50,960
with perhaps we could call one-pointed concentration that's where we aim the

326
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:57,559
attention to one particular experience like the breath the practice there and

327
00:51:57,559 --> 00:52:06,960
cultivating this kind of concentration well this kind of concentration I would say um it results from a focus on on a

328
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:15,319
particular experience where we turn the attention to it could be the breath it might be a

329
00:52:15,319 --> 00:52:20,960
particular body sensation it might be um an

330
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:29,680
image and we we give preference to that so the the stability of mind with a

331
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:36,319
particular experience what we often call Focus we focused on one experience and

332
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:43,400
the practice around that I'm sure most of you are familiar with you know when we notice that the attention shifts away

333
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:51,520
from that we we as best we can let go of what is not that and come back so if we're

334
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:57,319
attending to the breath and we notice that the attention goes to a thought

335
00:52:57,319 --> 00:53:03,400
we try with as much ease as possible to say not now and return to the breath and

336
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:10,640
so we let go of anything not the focus of attention in this form of meditation

337
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:18,079
practice that creates a stability of awareness or mindfulness on the object

338
00:53:18,079 --> 00:53:23,960
itself on for instance the breath moment after moment that's where the attention

339
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:31,200
is and that we let go of what is not the breath and come back to the breath the Mind tends to begin to

340
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:38,960
gravitate more to the breath we're training the mind to come back to the breath and so that be you know begins to

341
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:46,039
be more easeful we can just stay with the breath and the kind of concentration that's developed

342
00:53:46,319 --> 00:53:51,680
there is uh very stable because

343
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:58,440
we're we're stabilizing the object as well as the mindfulness

344
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:04,880
but the the the the concentration itself is still simply a continuity of

345
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:13,720
mindfulness moment after moment it just happens to be a continuity of mindfulness moment after moment on the

346
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:21,240
breath when that concentration deepens and it can deepen very

347
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:27,079
very to a lot of Stillness a lot of depth the the the the movement of that

348
00:54:27,079 --> 00:54:35,280
kind of concentration is towards more and more Stillness Tranquility can be a Hallmark of that Stillness a Hallmark of

349
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:38,480
that kind of

350
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:50,720
concentration the hindrances fade away there's much less reactivity in the

351
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:56,880
mind and there's a lot of stability it feels pretty good A lot of the feeling

352
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:05,440
of it feeling good has to do with that the fact that these hindrances are not arising desire the sense desire ill will

353
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:13,760
sloth and toror restlessness and worry and doubt are not arising and the absence of those feels pretty

354
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:20,920
good so that's a the one-pointed concentration it becomes very very still

355
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:26,920
very quiet and and we like it actually it it feels really good

356
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:33,119
it's such a relief not to have so many things going on in our mind

357
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:39,960
sometimes and there is this other form of concentration it's called momentto

358
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:46,520
moment concentration this kind of concentration

359
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:52,319
is it it has many of the Hallmarks of the other form of concentration it

360
00:55:52,319 --> 00:56:01,079
there's a lot of stability of the mind it's not distracted it's not being pulled out into non-m

361
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:07,359
mindfulness not losing um the connection with the

362
00:56:07,359 --> 00:56:13,920
present moment experience there's a but there's a stability of the awareness that we're

363
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:21,920
cultivating here rather than a stability of object of

364
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:29,480
experience so we're cultivating a non-judgmental

365
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:37,200
non-reactive awareness moment to moment with whatever is arising in the present

366
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:42,400
moment staying present with a flow of

367
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:50,119
experience so this kind of of concentration it it it also brings a lot

368
00:56:50,119 --> 00:56:55,440
of ease the hindrances fall away when we're not when we're not involved in

369
00:56:55,440 --> 00:57:03,680
what's arising by thinking about it or reacting to it the hindrances will fall away also in

370
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:08,760
this and that feels that feels quite lovely when the hindrances Fall Away

371
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:14,480
there's there's ease with what's here also I'll say that this form of

372
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:19,920
concentration is available not only on the cushion but in daily

373
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:25,720
life in the midst of whatever is happening it's possible for this form of

374
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:32,720
concentration the stability of mindfulness to carry through the day now it's it's it's not

375
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:38,480
easy we have to work at this there's a kind of an intention we need to to set

376
00:57:38,480 --> 00:57:43,680
to be curious about how how can we carry mindfulness through the day how can we

377
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:51,200
cultivate that continuity of mindfulness which is concentration throughout our

378
00:57:52,799 --> 00:58:00,200
day this kind of concentration has a lot of similar qualities in the

379
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:07,240
the feelings that arise the Delight The Joy balance of Mind ease

380
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:12,400
non-reactivity and yet what it is what's very different about it is that it

381
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:20,280
doesn't have that same Stillness of

382
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:28,240
object The Experience can feel very Dynamic with this form of concentration

383
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:37,000
now we can tune in a stability of the awareness that can feel quite

384
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:45,520
still but a lot of the what what's happening in experience is

385
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:52,559
changing and yet we're not distracted by that change

386
00:58:59,039 --> 00:59:07,480
so I'd like to take a few minutes to talk a little bit about this form of

387
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:13,000
concentration and how it can be cultivated not only on the cushion but

388
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:20,240
in daily life because to me this is a lot of where the rubber meets the road

389
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:29,318
in our daily lives we so often get you know caught by what's going on in our

390
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:37,039
minds so what can support look if we think of

391
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:44,760
concentration as being the continuity of mindfulness moment to moment not so much on one thing you know

392
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:49,920
the continuity of mindfulness moment to moment what can support

393
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:58,200
that with changing experience with the flow of our lives with just what what's

394
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:09,440
arising on the cushion a gentle effort to recognize

395
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:15,720
awareness I would say is one of the first the first

396
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:21,680
things we're exploring trying to just remember remember awareness when I when

397
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:28,000
I learned this technique most fully I was practicing in Burma with

398
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:35,319
Sania and the first instruction that he gave me was the only thing you need to

399
01:00:35,319 --> 01:00:40,480
do with your mind is to remind yourself to be

400
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:46,440
aware everything else will follow there's a little more than that

401
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:53,319
but that's that's a a kind of first level of exp of of practice

402
01:00:53,319 --> 01:01:01,119
just reminding yourself to be aware he would to say remember yourself just remember yourself not as a

403
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:09,599
turning back and looking at like this but more of a opening oh yeah I'm aware awareness is

404
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:15,960
actually quite obvious so recognizing awareness I'd say beginning to learn

405
01:01:15,960 --> 01:01:22,480
what awareness feels like is one of the main supports for

406
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:29,640
this for this kind of practice and one of the easiest places to begin noticing that

407
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:39,240
difference noticing the quality of being aware is in the moment when after you've

408
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:47,319
gotten lost awareness returns that moment we often are judging

409
01:01:47,319 --> 01:01:52,839
ourselves about that moment because we think we should have been staying

410
01:01:52,839 --> 01:01:58,400
mindful but you know conditions arose and we got caught by something and now

411
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:04,039
conditions have new conditions have Arisen that mindfulness is back let's

412
01:02:04,039 --> 01:02:09,960
celebrate here it is what does it feel like what does awareness feel like what

413
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:17,960
is it like to be aware now there's a there's a contrast in that moment there is a contrast between what it was like a

414
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:24,200
moment before when the mindfulness was not there and what it's like now for the

415
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:29,640
mindfulness to be here be curious about that difference we can't we don't

416
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:37,200
actually know you know what it was like when we weren't mindful we can't be mindful of when we're not mindful but we

417
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:44,760
can remember in the moment when mindfulness returns there's a lingering memory of what it was like for the mind

418
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:50,240
not to be mindful and so there's a contrast so get curious about that

419
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:57,838
moment of mindfulness returning when I started this exploration

420
01:02:58,240 --> 01:03:03,559
it was it was really fantastic because because I was just curious about well

421
01:03:03,559 --> 01:03:09,119
what is it like for mindfulness to come back you know and so it did not matter how many times my mind

422
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:16,720
wandered in fact every time my mind wandered gave me another opportunity to notice what is awareness

423
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:25,960
like so you know just practicing like that you know maybe the mind wanders a 100 times in a 40 minute sitting that's

424
01:03:25,960 --> 01:03:31,319
100 opportunities to notice what's awareness like when it comes back and as

425
01:03:31,319 --> 01:03:37,599
I shifted to that Curiosity of what's awareness like when it comes back the judgment about the

426
01:03:37,599 --> 01:03:43,760
mind having wandered really diminished so that practice was really helpful for

427
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:49,760
me in in the in the sitting in the form of sitting you know just maybe take a

428
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:54,799
sitting sometime where that's your practice you don't try to stay mindful

429
01:03:54,799 --> 01:04:00,599
you just notice the return of mindfulness just notice that and see

430
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:06,200
what it's like I don't I don't recommend that as

431
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:13,760
your only mindfulness practice but you might explore it just to kind of get the flavor of mindfulness returning of what

432
01:04:13,760 --> 01:04:18,920
awareness is like what it's like to be aware what it's like to be mindful this

433
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:24,240
you can also do in your daily lives this recognition of mindfulness

434
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:30,440
returning it happen happens a lot more than we think it

435
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:35,839
happens what happens often when when mindfulness returns

436
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:42,880
is we start thinking about what we've become aware of we do something with it and so we

437
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:49,599
don't really uh connect with oh this is awareness I become

438
01:04:49,599 --> 01:04:55,839
aware so you you can just it's kind of like just setting an intention or curiosity kind of like I suggested for

439
01:04:55,839 --> 01:05:02,319
the sitting you know sit down and and you know don't try to be you know staying mindful but notice when

440
01:05:02,319 --> 01:05:08,440
mindfulness returns you could start with a little stabilizing so that you you you have a

441
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:14,160
little bit of a container to start with and then let go and then then see be curious about that moment of mindfulness

442
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:20,520
returning so there's an intention to to connect with that moment of mindfulness returning you can do something similar

443
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:25,720
in daily life now it's probably not going to happen as frequently but when

444
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:31,720
when you begin to get familiar with it in daily life you'll find you know mindfulness returns when you're walking

445
01:05:31,720 --> 01:05:37,319
down the street crossing a sidewalk opening a

446
01:05:37,319 --> 01:05:43,520
door washing the dishes hearing a dog dog

447
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:48,680
bark talking to a friend mindfulness can

448
01:05:48,680 --> 01:05:57,480
arise you can become aware that you are aware in any activity

449
01:05:57,480 --> 01:06:03,160
and so some curiosity about that you'll you may start you know if you if you set

450
01:06:03,160 --> 01:06:08,960
that intention so you know this is one of the supports for the cultivation of

451
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:15,079
concentration because we don't make concentration happens we set the conditions up

452
01:06:15,079 --> 01:06:21,079
for energy and mindfulness and one of the supports for

453
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:27,440
energy is an intention to notice when my mindfulness

454
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:33,200
returns so have that be an intention remind yourself about that intention and

455
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:38,480
any time you notice that mindfulness returns it's like oh here it is as you

456
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:47,599
begin to get familiar with what it's like in daily life for mindfulness to return you will start noticing it more

457
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:55,319
because the Attunement to that quality of it kind of feels like the light is coming on there's a brightening in the

458
01:06:55,319 --> 01:07:03,278
mind mind as you start to get attuned to that it will Point itself out to you more and

459
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:09,960
more so this is this is one of the the ways to begin to to cultivate

460
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:16,079
mindfulness and it's so simple you you don't have to work actually that moment that mindfulness returns it's great

461
01:07:16,079 --> 01:07:22,440
because you didn't make it happen you didn't have to do anything to make it happen it just

462
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:28,838
happened there's a little bit of effort to connect with the fact that it did

463
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:37,920
happen that moment when mindfulness returns also can give you a flavor of how easeful it can be to be mindful to

464
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:43,079
be aware and that we can be aware with anything because mindfulness will arise

465
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:49,520
in the midst of all kinds of activities all kinds of states of mind so curiosity

466
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:56,279
about that moment of mindfulness returning and that you know in the sitting practice really supports the

467
01:07:56,279 --> 01:08:02,319
recognition of awareness which then once we have a sense of awareness itself what

468
01:08:02,319 --> 01:08:09,960
it's like to be aware that that recognition helps us

469
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:16,359
to not be so concerned about the object of awareness and the shift of attention

470
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:22,600
the shift of EX of the mind moving from one experience to another we can know I'm

471
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:27,838
aware it doesn't matter if there's some other object that's

472
01:08:29,319 --> 01:08:35,600
appearing the other key piece I'll I'll point to or another

473
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:42,679
piece is um is around the attention and again this may be a little bit more in

474
01:08:42,679 --> 01:08:48,199
in the sitting practice but it it's useful in daily life as

475
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:57,000
well in the guided meditation I pointed to how we can Rec recognize the

476
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:05,679
attention shifting from experience to experience attention is the factor of mind that

477
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:12,920
connects to some aspect of experience mindfulness is the connection

478
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:19,758
the knowing the the receiving of experience these are different functions

479
01:09:19,759 --> 01:09:26,000
of mind I used to think that if I was not consciously directing my atten ition

480
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:31,640
that I was not being Mindful and that's not

481
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:39,040
true so beginning to understand the difference between attention and mindfulness is useful and we can know

482
01:09:39,040 --> 01:09:46,278
this actually you know if you're walking down the street and you're lost in thought entirely not

483
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:55,800
mindful often you know we're navigating the street fine

484
01:09:55,800 --> 01:10:02,760
we're seeing we're hearing we're not like running into trees or walking in front of cars even though we're lost in

485
01:10:02,760 --> 01:10:09,719
thought even though we're not consciously aware attention is

486
01:10:09,719 --> 01:10:15,080
working attention is noticing seeing and

487
01:10:15,239 --> 01:10:21,920
hearing and mindfulness is not present so we can see that attention and mindfulness are different things now

488
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:27,320
when mindfulness is present it's connecting to whatever attention is

489
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:34,800
noticing also that example points out that we don't have to make attention happen you know when we're not

490
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:40,320
mindful we're not choosing where attention is it's doing its thing

491
01:10:40,320 --> 01:10:45,360
conditions arising pointing pointing out various things that are useful to attend

492
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:50,400
to as we walk down the street that's happening it's not

493
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:58,040
self it's an arising so attention does not require us to aim the

494
01:10:58,040 --> 01:11:04,880
attention and so when mindfulness is arising it's basically connecting with whatever attention is connecting with in

495
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:11,840
that moment so that um recognizing the

496
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:18,000
attention and noticing when attention shifts from one experience to

497
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:23,239
another that that um

498
01:11:23,280 --> 01:11:28,640
recognition there's a distinct quality you know there's a feeling of when the

499
01:11:28,640 --> 01:11:34,480
attention shifts from one thing to another and I think we know this too I mean from meditation the we we kind of

500
01:11:34,480 --> 01:11:40,800
get attuned to this shift if you're practicing in a a more focused way with

501
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:46,000
being at with the breath we know the shift away from the breath that's a

502
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:51,480
shift of attention in our concentration practice

503
01:11:51,480 --> 01:11:57,040
and our more focused practice when we notice that shift of attention

504
01:11:57,040 --> 01:12:04,320
we let go of what the attention has shifted to and come back to the breath we aim the

505
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:12,239
attention in this more receptive practice when we notice a shift of attention we get curious about

506
01:12:12,239 --> 01:12:18,440
that what's that the attention has shifted we're mindful of the attention

507
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:25,400
shift why not know that and this kind of quality of the shift of attention as we

508
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:34,040
get familiar with it we can kind of have a sense of following the attention moment after moment and again

509
01:12:34,040 --> 01:12:39,639
the mindfulness can stabilize if you're more familiar with

510
01:12:39,639 --> 01:12:47,440
the bring the attention back it can feel a little bit unstable at first

511
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:54,080
to just watch that shift of attention you can feel a little bit

512
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:59,440
jumpy or or you know wobbly or something

513
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:04,960
like that but over time we can begin to

514
01:13:04,960 --> 01:13:11,199
appreciate we are aware so that the stability of the awareness and noticing

515
01:13:11,199 --> 01:13:20,199
the um where the attention is moment after moment and notice the the non that that

516
01:13:20,199 --> 01:13:27,360
that we we can be with experience moment after moment without reacting to

517
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:34,800
it because of the mindfulness and the stability the concentration

518
01:13:36,679 --> 01:13:42,159
together so this shift of attention noticing that

519
01:13:42,159 --> 01:13:49,639
shift and in daily life this also I mean you know we might we might

520
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:57,280
recognize we're we're focusing on something and something happens out outside or something and we we get we

521
01:13:57,280 --> 01:14:03,360
may get annoyed right I mean it's like oh the attention is shifted I'm supposed to be doing this and and if we don't

522
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:12,360
notice the shift of attention we're not consciously aware of the shift of attention reactivity often arises

523
01:14:12,639 --> 01:14:19,880
there and I'd say too that not noticing the shift of attention is one of the main reasons our

524
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:27,600
minds wander in sitting meditation practice so familiarity with that shift

525
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:33,679
you're getting curious about it and then you know there's a choice if you're doing a more focused practice then with

526
01:14:33,679 --> 01:14:41,560
that noticing that shift of attention you can let go of what it has shifted to and come back to cultivate that more

527
01:14:41,560 --> 01:14:46,719
stable one-pointed concentration but you can also be

528
01:14:46,719 --> 01:14:54,560
curious about oh I'm aware of this at one point I was doing this in um

529
01:14:54,560 --> 01:15:00,440
or I was doing more focused practice at one point um and noticed that the kind

530
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:07,000
of It kind of felt like the mind got really broad or kind of felt like a drop and a spread or something like that and

531
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:12,360
it was like oh come back it almost felt like falling asleep you know just

532
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:19,679
like and um and so every time I felt the beginning of that drop I would come back

533
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:25,560
come back come back and at some point in this process I noticed that I was quite

534
01:15:25,560 --> 01:15:32,520
aware at the beginning of the drop it's like okay I'm aware let's just see cuz

535
01:15:32,520 --> 01:15:37,760
it kept happening it was so you know it was almost it was like

536
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:43,040
almost a pull towards something a mindfulness was being pulled toward

537
01:15:43,040 --> 01:15:48,159
something it's like well let's see where is it going and so you know in that moment of

538
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:54,719
feeling I felt the drop and the spread and was completely aware and and found

539
01:15:54,719 --> 01:16:01,560
the I did not fall asleep I was completely aware and mindful and the the space was

540
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:08,320
vast expansive it was a completely different space and it it almost startled me it

541
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:14,239
actually pulled me out of it he like whoa what was that but that was the kind of the

542
01:16:14,239 --> 01:16:20,360
Curiosity of following the attention and since I've understood and

543
01:16:20,360 --> 01:16:26,920
have been able to follow that more it's like a deepening of it was a deepening of letting

544
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:33,840
go and this kind of noticing the shift of attention can also be

545
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:41,280
very valuable in daily life because as we begin to get more

546
01:16:41,280 --> 01:16:48,199
familiar with that there's much less reactivity that can enter Because the mindfulness and the concentration are

547
01:16:48,199 --> 01:16:56,840
more present and there's so much learning

548
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:05,520
the this the the still concentration pra the still concentration practice where we're really stabilizing the body and

549
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:11,920
mind on one experience depends on how deep or how

550
01:17:11,920 --> 01:17:20,280
you know how you know still you're going for but the the direction of that is to

551
01:17:20,280 --> 01:17:26,120
kind of stability not a lot of change

552
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:33,480
in that space And so there's not as much opportunity to learn about the comings

553
01:17:33,480 --> 01:17:39,320
and goings in our mind in that space now the the the movement to cultivate it

554
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:46,920
going into that state and coming out of that state there's a lot that can be learned about the changing nature of our

555
01:17:46,920 --> 01:17:52,639
minds and that's typically the encouragement with one-pointed

556
01:17:52,639 --> 01:17:58,480
concentration practice that we're learning you know about letting go of the hindrances as we go in we're

557
01:17:58,480 --> 01:18:05,360
learning about stabilizing the mind and um as we go in and then as as it ends as

558
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:12,440
it falls apart we're learning about the impermanence of that state itself we're learning something about

559
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:20,800
that so it is in the space of changing experience that the Learning Happens the

560
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:29,120
learning about wholesome and UNH wholesome the learning about what our minds do can cause and effect

561
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:40,560
impermanence in this momentto moment concentration practice we're

562
01:18:40,560 --> 01:18:47,360
learning all the time it's it's um you know we're we're

563
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:55,440
starting and we don't have to we don't have to some people feel or think that you know it's it's um

564
01:18:55,440 --> 01:19:02,280
you need to settle the Mind first before you open up you know settle into one-pointed concentration before you

565
01:19:02,280 --> 01:19:07,760
open up to this changing nature of experience and that's definitely one way

566
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:14,120
to go you know that's a that's a way to cultivate the Vasa practice the Insight

567
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:20,360
practice into changing experience but it's not necessary to start with one pointed

568
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:26,159
concentration the one-pointed concentration kind of takes us down deep and then we

569
01:19:26,159 --> 01:19:31,360
open the open awareness practice we're kind of learning as we

570
01:19:31,360 --> 01:19:36,520
go uh about everything that's going on in our minds and so it's a little bit of

571
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:42,040
a slower settle can take a little bit more time to really

572
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:47,239
settle deeply but we're always learning

573
01:19:47,239 --> 01:19:54,239
about what's happening in our minds learning about the suffering of

574
01:19:54,239 --> 01:20:01,960
reac ity learning about the beauty and well-being of the non-reactive

575
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:08,960
states so the cult the point of cultivating the concentration is this

576
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:15,360
understanding whichever way you come at it it's not the pleasant experience of

577
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,760
concentration itself it's what can be

578
01:20:21,639 --> 01:20:30,719
learned and it's time to stop so thank you for your attention
