21
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:16,019
chat if you're new to happy hour we have a uh uh low traffic mailing list where

22
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:21,300
quotes resources information is shared

23
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,420
um and at this time I change the setting so accidental unmuting won't be possible

24
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,180
and the chat will just come to me host only but still let's keep it quiet uh

25
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,120
the the that channel quiet unless um something uh drastic happens like my

26
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,599
voice sound drops out and you need to let me know otherwise let's keep all the questions until the end it can be quite

27
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:52,379
distracting and I turn on recording for the sake of Audio Dharma

28
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:59,159
here we go okay all right hi hi and welcome to this

29
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:07,440
edition of uh happy hour so so for today's practice I wanted to to

30
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:15,060
um uh bring in uh a couple of different themes but but I

31
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:20,459
think the lead the way I would lead into it or the title I would give to this uh

32
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,800
practice session is um choosing the high road choosing the high

33
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:33,380
road choosing the road of kindness and compassion choosing the high road

34
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:40,280
we live in a world we live in a world where we interact with people

35
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:46,620
it's it's part of Being Human It's a Wonderful part of Being Human all these

36
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:53,280
interactions and of course some interactions sometimes can be challenging interactions or difficult

37
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:59,340
interactions or surprising interactions and we always have a choice we always

38
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,460
have a choice with every interaction whether it's challenging whether it's actually easeful whether it's loving

39
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:11,759
whether it's it's neutral all the interactions we have we have the choice

40
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:18,060
we have a choice of uh in for the sake of this this pra today's practice the

41
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:27,060
high road or not the high road the low road and the high road here is is uh the road

42
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,400
of compassion the road of care the road of Good Will the road of wisdom also I

43
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:39,900
want definitely want to bring that in because um compassion and and kindness without

44
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:47,100
wisdom can become idiot compassion as as especially I love this term from

45
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,979
from the Tibetan tradition uh it can it can be cuddling too much if we're

46
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:59,520
coddling um but the high road is one of wisdom compassion and sense of Integrity really

47
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,740
a sense of Integrity in our actions so that when we look back at our lives at

48
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:11,699
the very end um we have a sense that we cried with every interaction as best as we were

49
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:17,460
able to yeah maybe not every interaction it went flowingly well but but at least

50
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:22,560
we tried as best as we were able to to take the high road

51
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,460
to take the high road the road a wisdom Compassion Care

52
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:34,380
even if even if it went terribly bad terribly terribly wrong at the end but

53
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:41,400
at least we tried at least we had the intentions so when I bring another aspect in here

54
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:48,720
and that is with respect to the difficult and challenging interactions that can arise because

55
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:55,319
sometimes it's um no it's easy to respond from a place of

56
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:01,380
reactivity it's so easy to respond from a place of reactivity

57
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:07,199
and and to to take our time to sit to

58
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:14,639
really literally sit or or do what is needed to take the time to um to respond

59
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:21,180
with compassion with wisdom and and not just responding but also

60
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:27,599
responding to to what comes even if it's challenging um uh

61
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:33,240
in interaction but um but also another thing I want to add

62
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:38,639
is sometimes um I think or or actually all the time it's

63
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:44,639
important that we don't just kind of stuff stuff our our pain down like oh

64
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:51,300
yeah I'm gonna take the high road and I'm just going to be wise and compassionate and then continue to Stew

65
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:57,479
continue to Stew and maybe it'll show up in other ways so that's not exactly the

66
00:07:57,479 --> 00:08:03,960
high road but um for the sake of our own heart we also if

67
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:11,520
there is a pain that is left over or hurt we need to to

68
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:18,960
um honor that work with that acknowledge that or sometimes maybe the right response is to bless it the right

69
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,860
response is to bless it so what the heck do I mean by that so I

70
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:31,740
want to give you an example um often when we give uh Dharma toxin

71
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:37,960
dharmids we use ourselves as an example so I'll give a story so

72
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:43,380
[Music] um I received a a text that was very

73
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:49,260
surprising to me from someone um and

74
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:54,959
what it it was surprised it was surprising and also hurtful and and the

75
00:08:54,959 --> 00:09:01,380
way I interpreted it actually was that this person was in so much pain in so

76
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:08,220
much suffering that um they were igno they were saying that and

77
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:13,500
yet they were pointing fingers because there was so much pain so the the when I

78
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:20,220
received uh this text in the morning there was a sense of oh I need to write this is what's going you know this is

79
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:27,000
wasn't the intention this is what's going on and I thought wait wait no no you need to sit with this don't don't

80
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,720
respond right away I actually did a little bit of yoga I sat and and later I

81
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:42,240
thought no this is not the kind of the place this person clearly is right

82
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:49,800
now is that they're hurting so much things are so hard that that reason this

83
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:57,959
case of reason and explanation is not exactly what's needed just to send Goodwill just to send Goodwill I wish

84
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:04,620
you well may you be well may this may you be well it's just and what I had decided was that no

85
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:10,080
explanation is needed because explanation is like all right it gets to more explanation that's like around but

86
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,899
they're in a place that they're really really hurting really really hurting so

87
00:10:15,899 --> 00:10:23,220
so after a couple of hours they decided okay just just send Goodwill and there was still real people reacted but just

88
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:30,779
let let you know sending good will taking the high road of wisdom compassion and then I realized oh there

89
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:37,800
was still this hurt for me like okay I something was called out that just didn't feel Justified didn't feel right

90
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,320
didn't feel appropriate and right now doesn't feel like the right time to

91
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:50,880
point this out to this person so so sitting with this hurt and I didn't want to stuff it and and act out of it later

92
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:57,899
and this this idea of blessing this hurt oh yeah it's it's

93
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:04,200
um there is care there is care for this person there is care there in this

94
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:12,000
relationship to see to see the goodness to see the and the perhaps the Divinity

95
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,300
in this in this hurt even that has come from a sense of care so blessing yes

96
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:24,660
seeing the goodness um maybe I can unpack that little little

97
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,360
more in the guided meditation but uh that's what I mean that's the intention

98
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:37,260
for this meditation today and this this dharmint song so I'm going to to

99
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:42,300
pause with the dharmet because I think I've said plenty to set the stage so

100
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:50,160
let's just practice together let's practice together so so I invite you to let go of all the

101

coming back to your own perspective

174
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:07,260
can you just feel into not into actions or what to say or what to do

175
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:13,159
but into your own goodness into your own kindness generosity

176
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:24,720
wisdom just breathing breathing into it not

177
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:29,960
thinking but just breathing trusting it's there

178
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:11,899
and offering in your heart's mind

179
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:20,399
just as if a dear friend or someone you care about was going on a long trip and

180
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,518
you wanted to give them a gift

181
00:33:27,419 --> 00:33:31,820
a small gift token to take with them

182
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:39,120
as protection thought carrying your thoughts good well and

183
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:46,140
say you would hold that gift in your hands and in your heart your mind you would bless it with all

184
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:51,960
your good intentions for this person all you care All Your Love

185
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,919
is object

186
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:10,760
being blessed are your good intentions

187
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:20,820
before it's given to your friend going on the long journey

188
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:29,339
in the same way this interaction that we've been sitting

189
00:34:29,339 --> 00:34:35,940
with consider a gift

190
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:41,358
of kindness not a physical gift but in your heart

191
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:47,659
a good well something

192
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:56,300
an empty infinite box of Goodwill

193
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:18,720
that you offer that's blessed with your kindness blessed with your goodness with your

194
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,320
good intentions

195
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:38,660
of course this imaginary box is empty there's a sense of Goodwill kindness

196
00:35:40,980 --> 00:35:46,380
and you realize in the process of giving this gift blessing and giving this gift

197
00:35:46,380 --> 00:35:53,420
do you feel blessed too recognizing your own goodness

198
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:04,859
your own capacity to be expansive

199
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:07,880
your best self

200
00:36:47,099 --> 00:36:55,320
and just in case there's still any hurt or difficult feelings left from

201
00:36:55,320 --> 00:37:00,680
this interaction this too can be blessed

202
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:07,039
held with care with good will

203
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:17,720
and offered offered up

204
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:40,760
offered up and the altar of your Humanity

205
00:39:33,420 --> 00:39:38,480
we don't have to carry all the hurts

206
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:43,280
like rocks and Bricks

207
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:53,060
in our sack making us heavier and heavier

208
00:40:17,099 --> 00:40:22,500
when feeling ready each Rock

209
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,579
be blessed

210
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:37,260
touched with intentionality heart Goodwill goodness

211
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:43,200
let go of offered up placed on the altar of

212
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,900
Humanity so many hurts

213
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:54,680
part of our Human Condition

214
00:41:07,859 --> 00:41:12,980
to both benefit each other hurt each other

215
00:41:14,579 --> 00:41:20,820
not unique so maybe this rock too could be blessed

216
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,260
and left offered up

217
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,359
if the time is ready

218
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:37,578
and as we bring the sitting to a close

219
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,099
when we are ready may all the rocks

220
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:49,760
be released may all beings everywhere

221
00:41:54,119 --> 00:42:01,279
be free including ourselves

227
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,220
thanks Nikki squanda offer up a joke I made yesterday about the

228
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:56,280
effort of taking the high road and my wife to mentioned a person

229
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,920
without knowing she said don't you find them so annoying and I said

230
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:09,260
I'm trying to dislike people less but they make it so hard

231
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:21,660
[Music] it's you know it's so interesting um

232
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:27,780
one thing that comes up for me in situations like that is I I

233
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:33,000
have this usual reflection this reflection that gosh I I get to interact

234
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:38,040
with this person I don't know one once in a blue moon or

235
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:43,500
one hour a week or whatever it is or or five hours a week or whatever it is right I get to interact with them this

236
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:48,780
limited amount of time whereas this person gets to be in that mind and that

237
00:43:48,780 --> 00:43:57,060
heart get they get to be them 24 hours a day ah I could have been born as them I

238
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:05,040
could have been born as them It's So Random right our causes and conditions of who we end up being

239
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:11,940
um so I offer that reflection this is what I tried to bring in like oh my

240
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:17,220
goodness this must be so hard it must be so hard for them so and it's not pity

241
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:22,800
and it's not pitting them it's it's really like I'm I'm I could be them I am

242
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:27,960
them in some ways so I offer that thanks for their reflection

243
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:33,859
if there's anything you'd like to add you're welcome to very good okay

244
00:44:35,099 --> 00:44:41,060
yeah any other reflections Claire

245
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:47,280
thank you Nikki I just want to say that it's very very a very funny coincidence

246
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:53,760
brought this up tonight because I do volunteer work yesterday I found out

247
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:59,339
that some people were added to a team without my knowing it but I didn't

248
00:44:59,339 --> 00:45:05,579
really want to have happen and my go-to place was how dare they and my little

249
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:12,660
ego went way up how dare they and what am I going to and how am I going to get them off or whatever and then I paused

250
00:45:12,660 --> 00:45:19,560
and I thought you know it's not going to go anywhere and it's just gonna make a lot of people unhappy and so you

251
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:25,740
know the nice the great the the right thing to do would be to send them a note and tell them how happy I am with their

252
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:30,960
work they're working with us and how you know how pleased I am to have them and

253
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:37,859
that's why I just wrote it like before I came here um because that's I know that I'll feel

254
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:47,040
you know however they feel I'll feel better okay sorry thanks Claire thanks for the

255
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:54,240
report from the field that you just went through this this contemplation though okay this is okay this is what I could

256
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:59,339
do or this is what I could do okay let me reflect what do I really want to do

257
00:45:59,339 --> 00:46:05,760
who do I really want to be in this world yeah beautiful thank you Claire thanks for that example sharing that that's

258
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:11,960
lovely yeah yeah the reflections

259
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:24,359
and also type them in chat if you like they could be privately to me in which case I won't read your name

260
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:31,319
Neil so you were kind of talking about like

261
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:36,839
feeling hurt or offended what happens if you feel anger how does what's the

262
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:42,599
connection because right the example I picked there's a lot of like anger

263
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,760
right and it didn't quite feel the same as matching what things you were saying

264
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:54,480
yeah yeah yeah yeah so so what if there's anger um so so I'll share with you that yeah I

265
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:02,280
feel angry too for me there was anger too when I felt like yeah this this feeling no the feeling of anger can can

266
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:08,160
have many reasons but in this case I don't know if it's the same for you but it was feeling

267
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:14,160
um uh you know um unfairly this is you know something that

268
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:19,619
feels unfair like that's not it like uh it doesn't fear right uh and so for me

269
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:25,200
where um where I've been sitting with that and I'll offer this

270
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:30,540
maybe relevant or supported supportive for the situation you're working with is

271
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:37,079
um I think it became more released more more easy to work with when I really put

272
00:47:37,079 --> 00:47:43,020
myself in their shoes like what they are saying how they're seeing the world right now what's happening to them

273
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:50,280
they're in such a difficult circumstance that when I put myself in that situation something happened to the anger like I

274
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:56,640
could start to see like wow that's so painful where they how what they're

275
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:03,720
going through how they're seeing in the world is just oh and that's something it's something happened to the anger it

276
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:10,560
softened it and then also it felt like um holding the anger as a blessing as as

277
00:48:10,560 --> 00:48:18,420
a to as as I was saying again I tried to unpack it during the guided meditation it's hard to say but but blessing it as

278
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,460
yeah I see you I see there's there's there's a goodness there's a there's a

279
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:30,420
beauty in here and that also released it uh in in a way and and putting it on the

280
00:48:30,420 --> 00:48:37,740
altar so I'm offering these um some of the ways that I've been working with with it in in this and and

281
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:44,520
it's not one size fits all of course but um what um

282
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:50,520
yeah I am I don't know if any of this this this you've tried this kneel or it

283
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:56,040
hits home or not yeah

284
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:01,619
I I some of it hits right it it feels difficult

285
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:08,940
right it's it's comfortable to be angry with this person it's comfortable it's comfortable to be

286
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:15,240
angry yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah right right you know I've worked with them for a

287
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:20,280
couple of years and they're like the most disgusting human being that I've ever met in my life

288
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,319
um you know you know I don't mean like you know they don't watch right I mean they just do

289
00:49:25,319 --> 00:49:32,040
horrible things yeah so but but it's you know it costs me to be angry too yeah

290
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:37,220
exactly but that's the other thing yeah yeah

291
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:45,599
yeah thank you yeah there's there was more there and yeah thank you Neil

292
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:51,599
um there's one quick uh let's see um Rada I see your hand but I um let's

293
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:58,260
come there's very little time I see we need to go to the practice meetings and there was one question that's been posted in the chat very quickly I want

294
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:05,520
to address which is in your view where is the line between blessing hurts and conflicts and toxic positivity very good

295
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:12,180
point there is there is a difference and that's where the wisdom comes in uh that's where the wisdom comes in to know

296
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:17,880
what is appropriate what's the appropriate response and sometimes it's not appropriate you know what the

297
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:23,460
appropriate response is to say no this is not appropriate you can do this

298
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:30,839
um and and sometimes it's it's appropriate not to pick a fight with someone who's already so hurting that

299
00:50:30,839 --> 00:50:36,300
that they're just hurting um so that's where the wisdom comes in

300
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:41,700
but so I think that's where I would say that wisdom can tell you where the differences between toxic positive

301
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:46,980
positivity which not helpful and um

302
00:50:46,980 --> 00:50:52,380
and uh and and and and and appropriate compassion Jerry says this practice

303
00:50:52,380 --> 00:50:58,440
gives me hope that we may develop a different way personally and more widely of working through difficult situations

304
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:04,619
that this would May survive and thrive hopefully may it be so may it be so yeah

305
00:51:04,619 --> 00:51:11,880
so uh we usually turn to practice to small groups a minute or two earlier but

306
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:18,420
here we go I'm going to make out the breakout rooms and the invitation for

307
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:24,000
