this is the fourth

15
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:20,160
fourth night uh out of five an introduction to mindfulness meditation my name is kodo this is tanya

16
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:27,120
it's a real pleasure to share in this i'm noticing as i say that it's a pleasure to share in this

17
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:34,560
in a way that is it's a it's a sense of pleasure that is more like well-being or more like

18
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:41,760
a deeper sort of happiness than the pleasures of chasing after and getting what we want

19
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,120
so settled so nice

20
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,959
so these last weeks just to situate us these last weeks we've been giving a

21
00:02:52,959 --> 00:03:00,640
sort of progressive instruction in mindfulness meditation and the way we've been doing it is um

22
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,120
beginning in a sense at the center of our experience with our breathing

23
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,800
using this very simple faculty of attention to direct direct to the breathing settle

24
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:20,239
in with the breathing find a home or a companion with the breathing and then gradually with that basis

25
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,760
including more and more of our experience in this in this mindfulness meditation

26
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,720
nothing is left out everything is included so we've extended from

27
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:38,239
breathing then we included the body it emphasized with the body

28
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:45,040
this feeling sensing awake aware through the body

29
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,799
sensing that kind of sensibility this body alive it's wondrous

30
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:58,840
so including including the body and our and our wise attention and

31
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:05,680
then opening the circle even a little wider to include emotions

32
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,439
wise relationship to emotion such a rich territory gives so much

33
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:18,880
color and shape and beauty to our lives and part of our task is to learn to train

34
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,199
how to relate wisely to our emotions so one of our instructions last week

35
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:31,759
with regard to mindfulness of emotions was a sort of guideline to

36
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:38,240
to aim toward a very simple relationship with one's emotions

37
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,800
the idea here is that the emotions will come part and parcel of our human life

38
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,000
if they're uncomfortable if they're uncomfortable that may be like

39
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,880
uh getting pricked with a dart or the metaphor is an arrow the emotion itself if it's uncomfortable

40
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,400
that's like the first arrow and then how we go about complicating it

41
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:11,199
with our interpretations our reactions our responses identification just layer after layer

42
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:17,280
making what was one arrow into two two arrows into three into four

43
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:25,280
and on and on and on so as best we can to use our wise attention to recognize oh i'm adding i'm

44
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:30,320
adding difficulty to this direct experience of emotion

45
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:35,039
and return as best we can to a simple relationship

46
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:43,280
and tanya introduced some of the ways that we can do that using this acronym raft

47
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:49,120
one r one a one f and two t's raft

48
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:56,560
each could be thought of as different ways to relate wisely to emotion and they all kind of work

49
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,320
together so the r was to recognize simply to recognize oh there's an

50
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:09,600
emotion here maybe to recognize what it is a is to allow or accept

51
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:15,680
and i like to think of allow or accept as not having any conflict

52
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:21,759
with the fact that this emotion is going on not being in confl conflict it is indeed

53
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:27,199
true this emotion has arisen and then f feel

54
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,759
just what we were practicing with mindfulness of the body

55
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:37,600
how is it that this emotion is showing up in and through the body through the language of the body what's

56
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,800
being said so recognize

57
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,840
allow feel and then the

58
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:54,160
tease apart i love this image that tonya used of a tapestry

59
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:01,280
a tapestry made up of many many threads and as we as we hold or attend to this emotion with care even if you rub it

60
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:07,199
between your fingers maybe these threads start to loosen up and show themselves the different colors

61
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,800
you can see green for green and red for red so on

62
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:20,080
and this whole process is supported by the last t trust trust

63
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,560
one of the things we can trust is that the body is always experiencing in the present

64
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:32,720
moment if we can be in contact with the body we know we're right here

65
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,919
and we're receiving the resource of right here and right now

66
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:43,199
so recognize accept feel tease apart

67
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,360
and trust some of the some of the guidance we talked about last week and i'm really interested to hear how it

68
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,639
went for you anyone who was practicing over the week

69
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,840
anything you might have done with this raft practice or anything you want to report in your sitting

70
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,919
questions you have or if you had an experience of what we talked about writing out an emotion

71
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:13,919
if you felt an emotion arise set yourself down and be still and just say i'm going to sit here and ride this out

72
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,560
so anything you'd like to share please

73
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:24,560
do you want me to pass um so i wanted to share that

74
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:31,039
it's very useful for me and i've been trying the techniques i learned in the first three classes

75
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:37,360
and i already had familiarity with trying to feel my emotions from other practices

76
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,399
and um it's just really liberating because for example one of the things

77
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,320
that's been a long time in the background it's been different types of fear like

78
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,040
social anxiety or dreading things and um today i did my meditation

79
00:08:55,040 --> 00:09:00,480
practice and it was just really amazing to feel the fear

80
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:08,160
feel my heart beating fast and just sitting with it and then afterwards i just felt so

81
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:15,839
liberated even like um 10 minutes later and for the rest of the day i was able to be just more

82
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:22,720
present to other things and enjoy things and um yeah just even doing my work i was

83
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,839
enjoying that as well so yeah thank you for teaching us wow wow i feel i feel so

84
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:35,680
much a joy for how that's happened for you thank you so much for sharing thank you i don't know

85
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:42,640
if anyone else feels that but it's like it puts encouragement in the room to hear a story like that thanks yeah great

86
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,279
observations

87
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:56,279
maybe there were other things that came up maybe questions or even challenges

88
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:12,320
um i find that i have if i look really closely i have a lot of

89
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:18,480
aversion especially to any kind of discomfort

90
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:24,800
so it's almost like it's an automatic thing for me to um

91
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:30,079
think of something else or so

92
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:36,720
and it's mostly with um subtle things

93
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,160
if it's a strong feeling in my body i usually will try to

94
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:49,040
um let it go through my body but it's it's those subtle things that happen more

95
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:55,360
often where i just find there's a lot of conditioned

96
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,200
mind habit aversion [Music] it's uh

97
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:08,160
it's so fortunate that you're you're seeing you're seeing a process is what i hear and and discerning

98
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:14,399
um yeah what i'm what i'm hearing is that there's this experience of discomfort

99
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,959
and aversion and it seems like you're getting closer to it and seeing that there there's a there's

100
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:26,480
a variety of aversion that you can stick with pretty easily in another where

101
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:32,079
it's almost like because it's subtle uh it it doesn't register that oh

102
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,360
there's a version here and i'm going to slip away yeah yeah

103
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:44,399
but i hear you feeling it in your body and returning returning to your body and that's exactly the practice

104
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,800
it's it feels it registers for me as akin to the way we train with the breathing

105
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:57,920
where frequently there's a part a place in the breathing cycle where we tend to lose contact

106
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,640
often at the very end it gets really subtle and soft so the instruction there just as the instruction i'm i'm thinking

107
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:10,800
about for this a version that you're working with when you when you notice

108
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:16,639
you're in that field where the slip usually happens what's a way you can give just like a

109
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:23,680
half a notch tiny little bit of deliberate energy to hang in there just a little longer and

110
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,959
that intention will sort of work itself through the practice

111
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:33,800
thank you thank you sounds like it's going great

112
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:55,040
i have a little question um i noticed that um

113
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,279
quite often when there's a lot of thinking going on

114
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,800
um [Music] and i i ask myself so what's is there an

115
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,079
emotion is this something on the line and

116
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:18,399
usually like 90 90 of the time i don't feel anything

117
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:25,600
there's this resistance no we're not gonna go there or i don't know i would call this we're not gonna go there but i

118
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:31,839
don't know what it is actually like we're staying here in the thinking realm

119
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:40,800
and and then i feel like it's like a war i feel and so what i do is i'm

120
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:48,000
i'll shift to my body and i feel this i would i would call it resistance at

121
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:54,079
the body level it's not pain which is in some specific place but it's kind of

122
00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:00,000
like this tension everywhere and so

123
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,199
but one thing that i tried deliberately recently what if i just

124
00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:11,920
kind of generate a thought like i voluntarily think about something

125
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:19,920
like i know what things i what topics i usually you know my mind goes to so what if i just seed something

126
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:25,040
that i know is emotional for me and

127
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,360
it's kind of intense so i just recently yesterday i just kind of

128
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:37,360
thought about i was not home and i thought about the stove did i turn up

129
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:42,959
i i knew i turned off the stuff i made a mental note but i just kind of thought about it

130
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,959
and i felt this wave of fear through my body like

131
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:54,800
it was pretty intense yeah but the interesting thing is that

132
00:14:54,800 --> 00:15:00,720
it's not it's not easy to you know to go there or like to even

133
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:07,600
you know just thinking and thinking is wants to be there and i feel like i'm emotionless

134
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,680
very often do you have a comment

135
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:22,000
thank you for describing your process feta

136
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:29,760
so one just drop in the bucket thought is

137
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:36,480
the resistance is worth spending time with itself so

138
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:41,760
when when the time is right and you have a thought come up and you're

139
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:48,240
sort of oh what's the emotion or is there emotion what do i even just starting with

140
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:55,279
if i have this thought can i feel where it lands in my body so um maybe even

141
00:15:55,279 --> 00:16:01,440
getting rid of the what am i feeling but just go thought oh okay

142
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,480
when i have this thought what do i notice anything attention oh a little bit here that's

143
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:13,279
you know and you might not notice where you feel it until the next thought comes because then you you know so but just

144
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:19,440
so that's one thing just starting to track how a thought impacts your body

145
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,120
the other is when you feel like because you felt that resistance is very clear that you felt

146
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:31,519
by trying to turn toward the emotion something was saying no so ju that right there you can just that

147
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:37,360
is an emotional response and so just giving that some space like

148
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,320
oh being with the resistance feeling the resistance where do you feel it you know like because it's it has a purpose it

149
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:50,160
has it's in trying to protect you or it's you know trying to defend from something

150
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:57,839
we're afraid of so maybe getting to know that and why you know like being curious oh wow this is

151
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:03,600
so quick to come up i can't even feel what i'm feeling oh

152
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:11,120
so that that is uh maybe the emotion that's the most immediate actually

153
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:17,360
there might be other emotions but they're not activated at the moment the motion that's activated is the is behind

154
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:23,760
the resistance great

155
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:29,039
great a lot of times i think

156
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:36,080
resistance is really important to pay attention to sometimes we're trying to practice

157
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:41,679
with something and you know we know we're sad or upset or

158
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,280
we know that this thought isn't good for us but there's resistance to anything

159
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,480
going deeper or changing it and so just being with that resistance can reveal a

160
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,840
lot so we don't need to run away from resistance it's actually also can be

161
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:04,000
thought of as how we're clinging how we're wanting things to be different than the way they are

162
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:10,559
and there's a lot that's a beautiful place to hang out it's really working with the first noble

163
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:17,200
truth and then it can help us kind of recognize the second noble truth or the cause of

164
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:23,520
our clinging what is it we're resisting which is we want different right

165
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:29,840
so where are we for time

166
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:36,000
a couple more minutes okay i was just going to invite even if you haven't been in the class you know

167
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,559
haven't been attending maybe you've watched on youtube youtube or not but if you had a question

168
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:50,440
about working with emotions now is a great time to ask it otherwise we can move

169
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,679
maybe i can swap eggs with you

170
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:19,000
thank you thank you

171
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,360
so tonight's topic is mindfulness of thinking

172
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:40,400
and i just want to invite you to do an imaginary exercise

173
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:45,520
to start i'd like to imagine yourself as a young

174
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:52,400
child like really little two three

175
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:57,760
and i'd like to imagine story time with whoever you feel felt

176
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:01,840
safe with and cozy with as a child

177
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:11,039
imagine that one of your favorite books was brought out and the name of thought the book is you are not your thoughts

178
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:18,000
imagine being read this book from the time you were two or three

179
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:23,679
years old you are not your thoughts

180
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:32,559
you open up and you see this beautiful little baby

181
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:37,760
in this picture and it says thoughts come and go

182
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:46,360
they never last long one minute they're here the next they're gone

183
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,720
imagine learning that that little

184
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,559
right and then and then you read the next page and it says

185
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:08,159
when you look up at the clouds in the skies of blue try to see the whole sky

186
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:14,840
as the clouds pass through the clouds are like

187
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:20,480
thoughts the sky is like you

188
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:25,759
can you imagine if you've been taught this

189
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:32,799
and you knew this your whole life that you are not your thoughts

190
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,960
that thoughts come and go that they move through and that

191
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:45,039
awareness itself is like the sky and knowing we can know the thoughts the

192
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:51,840
clouds can move through our sky move through our awareness

193
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:59,840
what if you really knew that now because somebody's been reading you this book for all those years

194
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:08,400
be pretty cool here's another book i'm going to read

195
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:13,600
you a little bit from it's called can't stop thinking

196
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:19,840
it's by nancy collier and the subtitle is how to let go of anxiety

197
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,760
and free yourself from obsessive rumination she's clearly a meditation practitioner

198
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:32,320
she's endorsed by sharon salzberg and tara brock and others

199
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:37,760
and so she she didn't get she wasn't read this

200
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:44,400
story either she was a kid but she writes about some an experience

201
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:50,720
that i'll share with you i'll read you a couple of paragraphs from the beginning of her book

202
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:57,280
and the title of this introduction is addicted to thinking

203
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:03,440
she said it was a magnificent let me do this actually i think it will

204
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,440
help

205
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:18,080
it was a magnificent spring morning and i was walking in the park near my home

206
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:25,679
well that's not really true i was walking yes but not exactly in the park

207
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:31,679
i was oblivious to the colorful flowers blooming the warm sunshine

208
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:38,400
the smell of cut grass i was missing all of it having disappeared inside my own head

209
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:45,600
into my own personal prison thinking no matter how delicious that may day may

210
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:50,960
have been i wasn't experiencing it

211
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:56,080
i was trapped inside my mind obsessing about what was not working in

212
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:01,280
my life replaying and rethinking the same problems

213
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:06,158
i've been replaying and rethinking for years

214
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:13,360
and then something remarkable happened my inner lens spun on its axis instead

215
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:20,559
of being inside my thoughts i was now the one looking and listening to my thoughts

216
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:26,880
instead of being inside my thoughts i was now the one looking

217
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:33,520
at and listening to my thoughts and you see the shift

218
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,640
yeah can you feel into experiences where you've gone from being

219
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:47,159
inside the thought to being able to witness great

220
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:55,919
great so that's that's what we want to support

221
00:24:55,919 --> 00:25:03,600
in our practice with mindfulness of thinking is the connection with awareness

222
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:09,760
being aware of thinking as it's occurring or

223
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,799
is it starting sometimes we get lost and then as it's ending or later we start to become more aware because we it's a

224
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,840
little perm it's like there's not a firm boundary between

225
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,120
the thinking and being aware of it we can absorb into it and we can come out

226
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,320
of it right there's no fixed line that helps us keep that

227
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:38,640
boundary or other awareness aware aware aware right

228
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:47,840
another way um to think about this that's often talked about is foreground

229
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:54,240
versus background so you know when the the

230
00:25:54,240 --> 00:26:01,039
letting the thoughts be more in the background right when we're when we have a little more awareness the

231
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:09,440
thoughts can be a little bit more sort of in the background that can help us not get so merged with them

232
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:22,240
i think another really important thing to start

233
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:28,720
to pay attention to when we're working with thinking is

234
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:34,480
there's there's two things that i find people tend to do i do we do

235
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,640
one is to try and change the thinking

236
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:46,400
another is looking at our relationship to the thoughts

237
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:54,159
so sometimes it feels like there's more we can do it's a little easier in a way to like

238
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:59,520
i mean i'm gonna get really busy trying to change the way i'm thinking i want to be

239
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,960
have more kind thoughts or be more supportive be less critical and that all helps

240
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,080
that all helps and we're still kind of merging with

241
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:18,240
thinking often in that way so another way

242
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:25,919
to try and relate to thoughts is actually to look at our relationship to the thinking to notice

243
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:34,799
we like this thought we don't like that thought

244
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:41,440
i am this thought this is me this thinking is who i am

245
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:46,960
this is all a reflection of our relationship to our thoughts this is how

246
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:53,279
it should go right these are all ways that we relate to our

247
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:59,200
thoughts and many of those ways i just described lead

248
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:04,240
to emerging and agreeing and a building with the thinking

249
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:10,559
right so there's another thing to think about is there's thoughts

250
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,799
which are like the clouds and then there's the thinking which is like a chain

251
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:21,840
little engine that can you know i'm thinking i'm thinking i'm thinking i'm thinking i'm thinking i'm thinking

252
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:26,880
there's this energy of of keeping it going

253
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:33,120
so it's a lot easier to be mindful of thoughts than it is to be mindful of the thinking

254
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:39,600
make sense but to be mindful of the thinking well that's you know we're usually

255
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:45,679
starting to get in it become it to merge with it so

256
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:52,480
but noticing this noticing when you feel like the little engine that could you know that's that's climbing up the

257
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:57,919
hill with those thoughts pumping them out oh i'm actively thinking pretty much

258
00:28:57,919 --> 00:29:03,120
means i'm bought in i'm biden i'm buying in it's me i'm i'm agreeing i'm working

259
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:11,120
on it and so uh then we can sort of in that moment there's a way to shift oh okay

260
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:17,200
how do we like let it ourselves open up a little bit around the thinking

261
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:23,919
oh there's this thought oh there's agreement more like watching

262
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:29,600
like the clouds and then what happens is when we're not so engaged with them they

263
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,880
start to lose their momentum they peter out they dissolve they

264
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,720
transform guess what a new more tempting thought will come up

265
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:48,720
you know it's it's sort of a wonderful thought-making machine in here and its intention is to engage us

266
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:54,320
the work is in learning how to witness

267
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:00,000
and you know when we're sitting on the cushion as much as possible

268
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,000
to watch and not become the engine that powers it

269
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:17,760
so some of the you know one of the things that's um easy and nice to say is i'm not my

270
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:23,840
thoughts remind ourselves you know we all we have so many thoughts

271
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:29,279
every day and many of them are repetitive but there's no one thought that is going

272
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:34,880
to capture who you are sometimes you have thoughts you don't even agree

273
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:42,159
with yeah so how is it you are a thought how can i

274
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:50,399
be that thought right so it's helpful to kind of work on

275
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:56,880
seeing thinking as part of my experience but it's not who i am i'm not my

276
00:30:56,880 --> 00:31:04,320
thoughts in this book uh

277
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:10,240
the woman has a question that i really liked she said ask yourself

278
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:16,799
what if i am not my thoughts what if i am what hears and sees the

279
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:23,919
thoughts the awareness within which the thoughts are appearing

280
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:30,799
like that sky metaphor i'm like the sky and the thoughts are the clouds that move

281
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:33,840
through the sky

282
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:42,799
so one of the things that can be really helpful when we're

283
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:48,960
trying to recognize we're thinking which is not always so easy to do because of that

284
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:54,640
you know permeability and the merging that happens with our thinking

285
00:31:54,640 --> 00:32:01,679
is to kind of recognize um there are different kinds of thinking

286
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:07,360
and we all think in different ways actually so

287
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:13,039
who hears who here thinks in images you see images in your mind

288
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:18,240
not everybody right some people sometimes some people like this

289
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:24,640
like okay maybe like this who thinks an image is not very much a little bit a lot all the time

290
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:32,640
right right there you go right okay so that's one way we think

291
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:38,080
who hears words being spoken

292
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:43,120
ah okay so some people are peer and other people who were up here before are now

293
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:50,320
here or down here right so there's that's the auditory the hearing

294
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:57,398
of the speaking is one way we think not the only way

295
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:03,919
there's also kind of can be a subtle layer of thinking that's kind of almost

296
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:10,159
like this is one i've been working with lately it's it's almost like an opaque

297
00:33:10,159 --> 00:33:15,919
feeling or image in the background that just is enough to generate an emotional

298
00:33:15,919 --> 00:33:22,399
response in the body it's sort of like it's like

299
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:28,720
for me uh what i've noticed the best way i can describe it is like knowing there's a

300
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,240
yellow light flashing caution caution you know just like so then there's this

301
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:42,080
feeling in the body of like oh you know and what do i need to be paying attention to you know oh oh oh like

302
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,360
and that's you know there's not um when i look in my mind and i watch in my

303
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:52,720
mind it's not like i'm sitting around talking there's no conversation happening

304
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:59,919
maybe every once in a while a word or two or a sentence might string together but it's just more of this like

305
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:05,120
holding of this perspective

306
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,039
right a sense

307
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,358
what what else have you noticed about thinking have you noticed any other ways that you think

308
00:34:22,720 --> 00:34:28,000
imagining myself doing things in the future and then i can catch myself and like oh

309
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:34,960
i'm not here i'm trying on different scenarios yeah great so i like uh the movie-making

310
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,560
mind it's how i tend to and i'm the star of the show you know like i'm trying on

311
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:47,440
things and i'm imagining them and how it's gonna go and how i'm gonna respond to this or that so rehearsing or

312
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:53,599
or visualizing and it's going to be very powerful actually it can be really really helpful it also can be really

313
00:34:53,599 --> 00:34:59,040
harmful right we can get lost and almost sometimes i feel like i'm working

314
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:05,359
with people and it's almost like they're living in that instead of in the real world

315
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:10,480
yeah i see it's nutting yeah i feel like just even having more spaciousness from

316
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,839
that yeah is useful so maybe when i want to be there i can but

317
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:23,680
being aware and if i choose to not being there yes yes beautiful

318
00:35:25,599 --> 00:35:31,839
okay you want to say something yeah so um

319
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:37,280
it was very interesting to hear this third like as you said third way

320
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:44,000
uh that you mentioned like holding on to something a little bit like i i often find myself like i have a

321
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,720
combination i maybe have an image and a couple of keywords yeah it's like a little cluster yeah

322
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:56,079
and it represents a topic for me and i don't really hear sentences or see like

323
00:35:56,079 --> 00:36:01,359
a sequence of images i just have this cluster yeah and it comes to my mind and

324
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:07,680
and it's kind of the air yeah and i don't even know what exactly is happening but i can recognize the

325
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:13,680
cluster of yeah you know these data points yeah a mix of words and that's

326
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:20,960
right absolutely so this is what um [Music] you know thinking is different for us

327
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:26,800
it's also when we have memories versus when we're imagining can be different

328
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:33,520
when we hear somebody else's voice versus our own voice sometimes we don't even notice our own narrator because

329
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:39,359
it's so normal to us it's just like we don't even recognize or

330
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:45,680
meditating and talking to ourselves okay just keep breathing keep reading you know which is a you know we're trying to

331
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:52,480
keep we're trying to help ourselves but we're actively thinking and narrating right so that's another form of it and

332
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:59,440
sometimes we need it right so but but still being able to recognize that that's what's happening is thinking

333
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:05,760
can be very very helpful liberating um too you know

334
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:13,040
so let's do a little bit of practice yeah

335
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:21,119
so finding a meditation posture that supports you being in in your body

336
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:26,880
in your body here in this space in this time and

337
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:33,200
you know taking your time to get comfortable to adjust your posture

338
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:41,440
right and to find maybe something like lifting the shoulders up rolling them back to help counter the

339
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:46,800
forward and closing habits we have

340
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:52,240
oh and just let the breath come in

341
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:59,280
so feeling that sense of uprightness but relaxed

342
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:05,839
in a position and posture that you feel you can hold for 15 minutes

343
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:12,880
and seeing if you can't start to connect more deeply with

344
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:20,320
whatever your anchor is and we've been using referencing in general the breath is the anchor

345
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:25,760
so taking a a few minutes to help ourselves settle like

346
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:31,119
when we come into the harbor in our boat we find the right spot

347
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:38,000
and then we lower an anchor into the water and it takes a while to lower it down

348
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:45,599
and then we've got to kind of pull on it a bit and make sure it's nice and firmly caught

349
00:38:45,599 --> 00:38:52,320
and then you can feel the tension pulling on the anchor holding the boat in place

350
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:58,640
and so as we cultivate that our connection to the breathing if that's our anchor

351
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:06,240
it starts to feel like that anchor the tug the rope that's connected to the anchor and the

352
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:11,119
bottom of the ocean that's holding us here

353
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:18,320
the water is moving things are happening sounds and there's that feeling of connection

354
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,240
to right here right here

355
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:35,400
and it's just happens one breath at a time one sensation at a time

356
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:56,240
and maybe like if you were a sailor on this boat and you put your anchor down

357
00:39:56,240 --> 00:40:02,160
and you tug on the rope and you know you've got the anchor kind of settled

358
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:07,680
there's a feeling of trust that can come up

359
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,839
a feeling of like okay okay

360
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:18,880
okay so inviting this sense of

361
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:25,440
okayness the sense of i've taken care of my body

362
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:33,040
my presence i'm orienting myself to the practice

363
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:41,119
and then noticing the attitude and the way you're speaking to yourself might be a form of thinking

364
00:40:41,119 --> 00:40:47,359
and see if there's some kindness invite some kindness in there

365
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:53,838
some kind orienting kind thinking

366
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,079
invitational

367
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:05,240
let me just be here breath by breath

368
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:58,560
at some point you will find yourself thinking

369
00:42:00,079 --> 00:42:08,160
yay mindfulness of thinking yeah here i am seeing a thought yay i

370
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,880
see a thought

371
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:19,520
it's okay thoughts happen we don't have to stop them

372
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:25,359
let them be those clouds moving through the sky

373
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:32,160
some of the things that can help us with that or to distinguish

374
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:38,800
the kind of thinking that's happening so maybe just oh talking

375
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:43,839
or seeing or movies

376
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:50,319
so just first oh subtle background thinking just sort of first noticing what kind of thinking

377
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:59,000
it is kind of the process of thinking that's happening in this mind at this moment

378
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:22,480
a second thing that we can be aware of that's different than the process of

379
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,359
thinking is the content

380
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:38,160
so you might just say a story or remembering or

381
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:45,119
planning or just just somehow noting the content it might need to be

382
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:49,640
named lightly labeled

383
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:12,670
[Music]

384
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:21,599
and sometimes the thoughts just kind of keep moving and slipping through and sometimes they kind of stick around they

385
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,960
feel sticky and so sometimes if that's happening you

386
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:32,400
might say is there an emotion connected

387
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:39,760
here with this thought is there a physical sensation

388
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:45,880
in the body connected to this thought

389
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:19,720
and if it feels really really sticky in your little engine that could and your power and those thinking thoughts

390
00:45:20,079 --> 00:45:27,680
and can be helpful to consider dropping the anchor back into the ocean and reconnecting with a breath

391
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:34,640
re-establishing that anchor breathing here right here

392
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:52,480
and then once we reconnect to the breathing when we're ready

393
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:57,920
we can more just sort of open up again a little bit more

394
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:04,720
gently just watching for that next little puff of a

395
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:11,520
cloud how is it showing up

396
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:18,078
what's the process of thinking that's happening

397
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:27,280
maybe noting the content maybe noting planning

398
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:33,680
remembering imagining

399
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:43,000
and see if you can just breathe right into it and through it

400
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:57,720
being gentle and kind patient

401
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:15,359
maybe thinking's not me it's not who i am thinking is happening

402
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:21,079
thinking is here thought is here

403
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:09,200
my mind's job is to think thinking just is something that happens

404
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,440
it's natural

405
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:21,720
so

406
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:59,078
maybe just dropping in the question when am i aware of now

407
00:50:38,380 --> 00:50:45,440
[Music]

408
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:48,440
so

409
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:03,599
so what did you what did you experience what did you

410
00:51:03,599 --> 00:51:09,760
learn about the mind and how it's thinking or engaging with

411
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:15,319
thinking tonight in the last 15 minutes

412
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,240
okay hello good evening sorry i was late um i noticed that i was noticing that i was

413
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:46,400
thinking a lot um apart from that too just with the meditation practice i

414
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:52,240
found that i can if guided or not guided i'm having

415
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,520
it's nicer to it's easier for me to be able to just sit with it and not try to

416
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:03,599
resist or force anything but still when thoughts or emotions arise i

417
00:52:03,599 --> 00:52:10,079
can still find myself in the midst of this in the midst of it rather than being the observer of my thoughts so i

418
00:52:10,079 --> 00:52:16,400
i'm still trying to practice it practice that but meditation has helped me with awareness

419
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:23,680
sweet sweet how does it feel different

420
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:30,160
to be more aware and less less entangled i would say i remember in one of the

421
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:36,720
talks the sessions i had attended with you on a sunday like holding on to things like whether it be enemies or

422
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:42,079
something it's if by letting go of that how does it make

423
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:49,839
you feel and this week at work at one point i could just almost imagine myself

424
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:57,440
like seeing what would happen if i reacted in a way that was more so reactive rather than responsive

425
00:52:57,440 --> 00:53:04,000
and i'm like oh that was the first time i'd ever had a chance to do that and it was good but and it would not have

426
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:10,240
happened had i not had i not been doing this had i not been meditating but

427
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:16,160
it's still a practice that i had every day and you know yesterday i was still pretty

428
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:21,520
upset about something and i just had but i also had to

429
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:28,400
let myself like be in in that emotion and not resist it too because

430
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:33,599
if i kept fighting it i'm like okay i know i'm upset right now and i'm frustrated but

431
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:39,440
what can i do with it and as guilt in the handout from gill like you you kind

432
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:44,960
of just have to be with that emotion i think or be with it and

433
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:50,559
not force anything thank you it reminds me of talking about the river

434
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:59,000
being the riverbed right letting the emotions move through yeah beautiful

435
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:19,520
what i noticed is when the resistance comes up

436
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:24,720
the more you pay attention to it

437
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:30,880
uh or the more you try to avoid it the stronger it gets yes that's what

438
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:37,680
happened for me it's the more i tried to tell myself you know

439
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:44,480
stop resisting stop stop paying attention to that don't look at the elephant in the room

440
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:50,480
the more i wanted to stare at the elephant in the room and about halfway through

441
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:56,319
when i remembered what you said about the foreground and the background yeah

442
00:54:56,319 --> 00:55:02,400
all of a sudden the observer

443
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:08,720
came to the foreground and the thoughts went into the background and i felt more

444
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:15,200
relaxed immediately i felt like when i

445
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:22,640
stopped resisting things got easier but i also feel like

446
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:28,160
it we're trained our whole lives to think to you know to do something to be doing

447
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:34,559
something to be thinking about something to it is very difficult to to tell yourself

448
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:39,680
not to think about things and i also want to know about that

449
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,960
children's book is that a book that i can buy for my someday grandchildren or

450
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:51,920
is that a made-up book no this is a real book um i think i bought it at spirit rock but um

451
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:58,319
i'm sure you can you can find it online it was done by mila and john kabat-zinn

452
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:05,680
so you're welcome to come up and look at take a picture of the cover and yeah absolutely please do

453
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:13,799
everybody should be reading this together i don't think so too i think so too thank you

454
00:56:28,079 --> 00:56:34,440
one thing i noticed as i was noting each of these different thoughts um

455
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:39,920
[Music] at first there seemed to me so many

456
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:44,960
different thoughts and

457
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:51,359
eventually i realized they were all variations

458
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:57,119
on a core thought which would be sort of a core belief i

459
00:56:57,119 --> 00:57:02,880
suppose but i i had never thought of that before that a that a belief

460
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:10,160
is sort of a core thought um that your keeps repeating itself

461
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:15,599
you know looking in a million different ways so now i felt like i can see

462
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:21,280
that thought disguised as all of these other manifestations

463
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,799
oh that's so wonderful it's like it's like all these variations are like

464
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:33,280
the leaves and somehow there was a recognition that they were all pointing back down the

465
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:40,319
branches to the something in the trunk of the tree what was that like for you when uh or

466
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:43,119
what what happened

467
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:52,799
it it made it much easier not to um

468
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:58,400
hop on the thought train of this or the thought train of that

469
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:04,240
and it it helped me stay

470
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:09,760
more centered and i i started hearing that one

471
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:14,960
thought rather than 50 60 different thoughts

472
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:21,040
i could hear it more clearly yeah oh wonderful wonderful thank you so

473
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,839
much

474
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:48,079
um i wanted to share something too um so i noticed that at one point i was

475
00:58:48,079 --> 00:58:55,440
i was lost and probably not for a long but it was very obvious okay

476
00:58:55,440 --> 00:59:02,160
and and i immediately and i why i noticed i don't know how like what

477
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:08,079
basically i noticed that because i felt shame i felt shame

478
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:13,520
and okay that's because i was lost and then i i something interesting

479
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:20,160
happened i noticed how my mind was like ready to jump on the shame thing and

480
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:26,319
then go there and like oh that's because well i'm not supposed to be lost it's a

481
00:59:26,319 --> 00:59:32,079
short-guided meditation and tiny is guiding us right and i'm a good meditator i'm not

482
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:38,079
supposed to be lost like that and and what is interesting i noticed

483
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:43,200
this you know i'm kind of prepared my mind prepared me for this new

484
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:48,880
you know cycle around the shame and i just kind of okay that's what's

485
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:54,640
happening and it i felt really amused it was it was actually quite amusing

486
00:59:54,640 --> 01:00:00,400
that i noticed that so it was actually a very pleasant experience to see how these things

487
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:06,960
happened in a sequence yeah yeah i just want to appreciate the

488
01:00:06,960 --> 01:00:14,319
the clarity of observation of process and you hanging in there

489
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:21,760
the place you ended up was a friendly relationship with what could have been a really

490
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:27,520
juicy captivating thought train to get onto

491
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:33,040
yeah nice nice thank you

492
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:43,200
shall we go ahead yeah i'll just add it's very obvious what i'm going to say super super

493
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:48,559
obvious but the main thing that you know one of the main things that i heard that for me would have

494
01:00:48,559 --> 01:00:54,240
helped me was you there was disbelief there was

495
01:00:54,240 --> 01:01:01,040
that space of like i'm not just believing this thought this thought doesn't have to be a fact

496
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:06,160
it does it's a thought that's being produced and oh i can see where it's going to take me

497
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:12,480
but i don't have to go there which is so empowering right so freeing

498
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:18,000
the cover of the book says it all you are not your thoughts

499
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:27,760
oh yeah for us meditators too the identity of good meditator

500
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:41,520
so the experience of thinking

501
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:49,119
and our relationship to thinking little engine that could driving up the hill we're in the thought

502
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:56,000
other options for relationship to thinking i get to introduce one of the classic

503
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:03,760
imc analogies now i'd like you to imagine

504
01:02:04,480 --> 01:02:12,400
maybe you're out taking a walk it's the end of the end of the week or taking a walk somewhere in the

505
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:18,480
say on a trail brought a little snack with you you have everything you need

506
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:23,920
and um you're feeling quite happy and you find yourself

507
01:02:23,920 --> 01:02:29,359
under a tree by riverside you decide to sit down just uh

508
01:02:29,359 --> 01:02:34,960
you can feel the air on your skin the light is just right the temperature is comfortable

509
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:41,839
you want for nothing just perfectly content right there as you are watching the river go by

510
01:02:41,839 --> 01:02:47,760
how pleasant so there you are seated and before you

511
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:52,960
know it up the stream comes one of these

512
01:02:52,960 --> 01:02:59,839
party boats yeah the music the decor

513
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:06,160
the dancing maybe they have a jazz band on board or something

514
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:12,720
and before you know it you're on the boat how did that happen

515
01:03:14,559 --> 01:03:20,318
you're dancing away you're dressed differently

516
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:27,119
having a great time and then you realize oh i'm a little tired from dancing oh wait

517
01:03:27,119 --> 01:03:32,160
i was sitting under that tree that was so lovely okay i'm gonna

518
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:37,680
make my way back so somehow or another you make your way off the boat back uh

519
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:42,720
back up the trail sit down in your tree so nice

520
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:50,480
so nice just there just right here not carried along just watching the flow go by

521
01:03:50,559 --> 01:03:56,880
and then comes a battleship and before you know it you're on

522
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:03,440
the fighting boat little surprise you're the you're the

523
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:11,359
hero you're the star of this show or alternately you're hiding in the hall

524
01:04:11,359 --> 01:04:16,960
but you're on this battleship and you're on it for months

525
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:23,680
maybe then you realize oh where was i where am i

526
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:29,119
i have lost i've lost the riverbank i'm gonna get off this boat go back sit down

527
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:35,359
ah here i am so glad to not be dancing any dancing on this party boat i'm so glad not to be fighting i'm just

528
01:04:35,359 --> 01:04:42,079
here just here here for a while and then comes this

529
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:48,319
meager barely a raft it's like like sticks tied together with a little

530
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:55,838
grass it's hardly holding up and before you know it you're on the raft and you're like oh i can barely float

531
01:04:57,119 --> 01:05:04,318
how did that happen how did that happen before we know it before we know it we're on the raft

532
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:11,200
then we recognize and make our way back just to here just to hear again

533
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:17,760
such an apt analogy for the varieties of really juicy thoughts

534
01:05:17,760 --> 01:05:24,319
that can captivate us some of our favorites right and the relationship that we can have

535
01:05:24,319 --> 01:05:30,799
with them before we even realize we've hopped right on the boat and we're

536
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:36,960
riding right along we're going for the ride we're the little engine that could going up the hill

537
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:42,640
but there's another option another option we can exercise with the practice and that is

538
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:49,440
just sitting under the tree just being content here just here

539
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:55,039
we see a boat coming down we can have the intention oh there's a

540
01:05:55,039 --> 01:06:02,880
boat i know that i could get on it but how many boats have i gotten on this one time i'm gonna try just watching it go

541
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:10,000
by and you know what you got to stay right here stay right here

542
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:19,119
so some little bit of wise relationship to thinking

543
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:22,640
we don't necessarily get taken over

544
01:06:25,359 --> 01:06:33,119
to develop these ideas about thinking something i really want to make sure we talk about meditation gets kind of a bad

545
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:40,240
rap in meditation circles thinking it's a bad rap in meditation circles don't you find that's true

546
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:45,440
or maybe some of you have heard that being around meditation communities for

547
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:52,000
the years that i have been so many so many times i've heard

548
01:06:52,000 --> 01:07:00,079
oh you know meditation is not for me i can never get my mind to stop thinking there's this understanding that like

549
01:07:00,079 --> 01:07:05,680
meditation is only when there's no thinking going on or meditation gets uh

550
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:12,079
uh seen as the problem or i keep saying meditation when i mean thinking

551
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:19,599
excuse me thinking thinking gets seen as the problem

552
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:26,880
nothing gets left out mindfulness meditation thinking is such an important part of

553
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:32,640
our experience so i wanted to give a little time to recognize and respect thinking and it's

554
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:39,280
it's a actually fruitful and really powerful influence in our lives

555
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:46,079
i was i was taking a walk just this afternoon and i noticed a block over there's one of these um

556
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:51,519
like give and take a book you know what i mean

557
01:07:52,319 --> 01:07:57,760
and i thought how much how much joy

558
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:02,960
how much how much depth and profundity in our life

559
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:08,799
has been has come to us through books every shakespeare play

560
01:08:08,799 --> 01:08:14,880
thoughts every poem you've ever read that's touched you those are thoughts

561
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:24,199
they get documented and they represent something they've had an influence in our lives every speech by martin luther king

562
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:31,758
thoughts what an important part of our lives this too gets to be included our whole

563
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:34,718
life gets to be here

564
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:43,120
i think something this is closely connected with is that of course thoughts

565
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:48,640
they have their they have their place in meditation they have their difficulties but often

566
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:55,440
they're pointing at something else really valuable in our experience oftentimes a thought as we've been

567
01:08:55,440 --> 01:09:00,798
exploring might be connected to an emotion underneath or a thought might point us

568
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:06,318
back to some core belief or an identity that we have

569
01:09:06,319 --> 01:09:11,838
maybe a thought connects us to something in our body or it arises based on something in our body

570
01:09:11,839 --> 01:09:17,278
all these different connections in our lives that thoughts may be pointing back to so in some ways a thought might be a

571
01:09:17,279 --> 01:09:20,278
signpost

572
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:32,000
when i was a when i was a boy i was um i grew up in a place where it was very warm and i was learning how to water ski

573
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:37,120
if anyone's learned how to water ski you pretty much hold on to a rope and you have these two boards on your

574
01:09:37,120 --> 01:09:43,838
feet and the boat goes and if everything goes according to plan you go up on the water and you stand and

575
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:48,880
ski now it's lovely i was i was quite young and i was learning

576
01:09:48,880 --> 01:09:55,440
so i got my rope i got my little skis the boat starts to take off and i

577
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:02,000
stumble and i hang on to the rope i didn't want to let go and before i

578
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:07,360
knew it i was under the water i was still tenacious i was like i'm not letting go

579
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:14,159
it's just like that we're thinking sometimes just like that

580
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:19,360
sometimes we think the thoughts and sometimes the thoughts really think us

581
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:26,159
sometimes the thoughts take us for a ride and that um that can contribute to

582
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:31,199
all sorts of difficulties and complications in our lives so again this wise relationship to

583
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:37,199
thinking being able to have some some wise space from our thinking

584
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:44,000
or even to pick up the boat analogy again say we wanted to engage some thought say the the party

585
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:49,760
boat comes down and we're like okay i'm deliberately going to pick up this thought and i'm going to dance on this

586
01:10:49,760 --> 01:10:55,360
i'm going to i'm going to artfully dance with this thought and then when the time comes i'm going to get off the boat

587
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:00,480
but doing it with some choice some choice

588
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:12,960
i was talking to someone recently who has been i think she's been practicing for maybe

589
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:19,520
40 years practicing mindfulness practice and she said the thing that she has

590
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:25,280
gotten from the practice that she appreciates the most

591
01:11:25,280 --> 01:11:30,080
is that now she has an affectionate relationship with her mind

592
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:36,880
an affectionate relationship with her mind and that that opens up some some

593
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:42,719
possibilities in uh i don't know about you but in me and my my heart and mind for

594
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:48,960
this practice with mindfulness of thinking how we can get wrapped up in our identities and really suffer our

595
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:54,239
thinking or there can be the possibility

596
01:11:54,239 --> 01:12:00,960
friendship with our thinking kindness with our thinking goodwill toward our thinking

597
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:06,600
and freedom with it freedom with it

598
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:15,840
maybe one last comment

599
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:26,159
we've talked about a lot of different aspects of mindfulness of thinking

600
01:12:26,159 --> 01:12:32,000
an important thing tanya said that i want to highlight it's not about

601
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:37,440
getting busy around our thinking it's still about simple awareness

602
01:12:37,440 --> 01:12:43,280
awareness with what's right here so say we're practicing with the anchor of the breathing

603
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:48,719
and the thinking can just be there in the background and we can stay with the breathing let's

604
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:54,000
continue with that if a thought is

605
01:12:54,000 --> 01:13:01,440
persistent uh or compelling maybe then turn toward it and investigate its process

606
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:06,560
what's its beginning and ending what's its quality what's the tone of voice like

607
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:12,080
if it's really repetitive is there something physical going on is there an emotion underneath

608
01:13:12,080 --> 01:13:19,600
is there something fueling the thinking you might turn toward that all the while just a simple relationship

609
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:25,040
with thinking so why don't we do a little more

610
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:27,840
practice together

611
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:35,320
can take a moment to renew your posture

612
01:13:52,880 --> 01:14:00,239
finding yourself upright with an alert spine a relaxed body maybe

613
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:03,119
opening the chest

614
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:18,360
feeling your way into alignment through the body with the support of the breathing

615
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:47,320
allowing the earth allowing the seat to hold your weight

616
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:09,960
to invite a little relaxation into the limbs

617
01:15:28,640 --> 01:15:37,080
having a minute to connect with your anchor perhaps the breathing

618
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:21,840
a breath comes in a breath goes out

619
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:29,440
a thought comes in

620
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:34,198
the thought goes out

621
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:48,600
baby

622
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:37,159
let's thoughts begin to blow through like clouds

623
01:17:44,480 --> 01:17:48,320
if they can stay in the background

624
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:54,678
just to allow them to pass by

625
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:19,400
if you find that there is a thought that's persistent

626
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:32,080
perhaps giving it a name planning

627
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:34,560
planning

628
01:18:37,600 --> 01:18:41,800
replaying replaying

629
01:19:39,040 --> 01:19:42,239
if you recognize

630
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:53,679
a thought has visited you many times before

631
01:19:57,040 --> 01:20:04,600
repeat repeat may be giving it a name

632
01:20:06,800 --> 01:20:14,080
and perhaps something in us can trust that it's okay

633
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:21,320
to not pick up this thought this time

634
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:13,800
as we bring this sitting to a close

635
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:23,360
a moment to notice just now what is my relationship

636
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:29,840
to this present thought to this present thinking

637
01:21:40,560 --> 01:21:47,020
as you hear the bell when you're ready you can open your eyes

638
01:21:47,020 --> 01:22:04,150
[Music]

639
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:27,760
so an affectionate relationship to the mind

640
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:34,400
maybe so maybe so how was the practice for you

641
01:22:34,400 --> 01:22:38,840
are any uh questions coming up

642
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:46,559
are any comments you'd like to share

643
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:55,360
hello well i was having a coughing fit but i at the at the same time i realized oh my

644
01:22:55,360 --> 01:23:01,600
gosh i'm i'm finally getting comfortable sitting on the you know meditating on the floor and i've been practicing like

645
01:23:01,600 --> 01:23:08,080
sometimes i do a mix of on sitting on the chair and on the floor and i'm like okay in the midst of all this this these

646
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:14,480
coughing spasms i'm like i can still find myself anchored to the fact that i'm breathing

647
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:20,320
in and breathing out and so i'm like it's okay it'll i can still steal my i

648
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:25,840
thought it was kind of representative or symbolic of the mind too and you know

649
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:32,000
kodo as you said getting on or finding yourself on that ship you know i

650
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:39,840
i i do get on the ship a lot or whatever the rafter a sinking ship sometimes but

651
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:45,360
but it's i do want to stay under the tree under the bodhi tree i

652
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:54,239
really do but sometimes it's a free ride and it is very it is very seductive to just

653
01:23:54,239 --> 01:24:00,639
but i don't but then i i before that before meditation i know i i

654
01:24:00,639 --> 01:24:06,719
would just easily hop on but i know now there's a bit of hesitation but in a good way like you

655
01:24:06,719 --> 01:24:13,440
know like and rose if you get on that it's you know what's going to happen so

656
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:19,040
pause pause for a bit or just breathe and i really like in this practice i've

657
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:25,360
been able to extend it to others or the whole loving kindness put your hand over your heart and just like you know i'm

658
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:32,639
you know i have everything i need and it's it's really cool so i'm very grateful for this and for you and for

659
01:24:32,639 --> 01:24:37,760
tonya and for you for helping me with that

660
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:43,440
so thank you thank you so much for your practice so much um

661
01:24:43,440 --> 01:24:49,280
so much to appreciate there and one one thing that's standing out to

662
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:56,320
me is that there's such a variety of experiences happening and all of it gets to be included

663
01:24:56,320 --> 01:25:02,400
all of it gets to be included in the awareness practice it seems really skillful

664
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:07,920
some of the ways you're relating to of having a bodily experience in the foreground and the background

665
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:13,760
even bodily experience can be related to that way not just thoughts in the background

666
01:25:13,760 --> 01:25:19,159
so thank you for revealing that thank you

667
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:38,239
um what i find sometimes is when i am sitting like this to meditate i'm actually

668
01:25:38,239 --> 01:25:45,040
more still than in my regular life my my thoughts are really going through my

669
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:50,560
mind really fast and sometimes they can feel disturbing if they're

670
01:25:50,560 --> 01:25:57,679
upsetting thoughts and i notice that i notice it in my body first

671
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:02,880
i may not even realize that i'm thinking um thoughts that

672
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:09,440
don't serve me but then i start to have like almost like a pain here in the solar plexus area

673
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:15,120
but for whatever reason when i sit um and i have done meditation before i

674
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:20,560
just wanted to come tonight but when i sit i um

675
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:27,920
sometimes i'm in a a quieter space so i almost feel like i need to like

676
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:33,600
stop and meditate when i'm getting in that whirlwind that's not

677
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:39,199
serving me but a lot of times that whirlwind is not happening when i'm sitting

678
01:26:39,199 --> 01:26:44,800
so you know obviously if you go to like a retreat where you're sitting all day

679
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:50,560
you're gonna get the whirlwind but i just i just thought it was an interesting observation on my part that

680
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:56,800
i'm like oh you know like i'm sitting here now i feel really comfortable and at ease and

681
01:26:56,800 --> 01:27:02,400
nothing disturbing is coming into my mind and i was like okay

682
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:08,000
i don't know i mean what do you think of that and how to work with that

683
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:16,159
it sounds like it's restful it sounds like it's nourishing

684
01:27:16,159 --> 01:27:22,400
and so when we're offered good food eat it enjoy it

685
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:28,880
let yourself be aware that that's your experience right but i was just thinking of when

686
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:35,360
it's the opposite yeah and i'm not meditating how to deal with that yeah

687
01:27:35,360 --> 01:27:40,560
well um are you familiar with any of andrea fellas teachings

688
01:27:40,560 --> 01:27:47,679
no so she if you're interested in her in this she does a lot of teaching about being

689
01:27:47,679 --> 01:27:55,199
mindful of the mind in daily life so you might look at um sort of simply

690
01:27:55,199 --> 01:28:01,760
first of all are you aware of what the five hindrances are yes okay so when you have a lot going on your

691
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:07,360
mind in your mind you might just stop and go okay what hindrances are at work here

692
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:12,400
kind of or what emotions are because they're the fuel right they're the

693
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:18,560
they're the um the lighter fluid right that's really catching

694
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:24,159
and burning things keeping it going and so then you can start to like uh

695
01:28:24,159 --> 01:28:30,719
hopefully have a little more awareness in the midst of it a little more awareness oh there's a lot of aversion

696
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:37,840
and then you know you you said you were aware of your body so just like you said it i loved what you said about i'm often

697
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:43,040
become aware of my thinking through my body yes and that it to me is

698
01:28:43,040 --> 01:28:48,639
really powerful practice mindfulness of the body you could even cultivate that during your daily life

699
01:28:48,639 --> 01:28:54,639
being more tuned in more consciously active uh mindfulness of the body practice and then

700
01:28:54,639 --> 01:29:03,040
as you notice tension you might start to notice things sooner is that helpful yeah okay

701
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:11,360
maybe maybe time to bring it to a yeah a close already yeah

702
01:29:11,360 --> 01:29:16,719
so there is a few people came in late there is a handout on the end of the stage

703
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:21,840
that has um some a good overview and some

704
01:29:21,840 --> 01:29:27,440
homework suggestions so this week we're encouraging you to

705
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:34,080
bump up your practice to 30 minutes did we do that last week actually i think we did okay

706
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:39,760
so 30 minutes and if you can sit that out one time great if you need to break

707
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:47,520
it up great you know just if you can make that amount of practice it's helpful um

708
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:53,600
and and then during the practice and even just during your daily life just

709
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:59,760
kind of noticing more your thoughts and your beliefs just getting a little bit more familiar and

710
01:29:59,760 --> 01:30:07,840
what's repetitive and what comes up what tends to fuel a lot more energy or upset

711
01:30:08,239 --> 01:30:13,440
there's um a suggestion to do a two-hour period of

712
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:19,520
tracking different kinds of thoughts just sort of taking a couple of hours to keep no

713
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:26,480
thinking is still happening with imagining visualizing movie making

714
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:35,840
words talking you know just sort of keep kind of oh type of thinking right tracking that

715
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:41,840
and then there's a suggestion to do two hour period of tracking of intentions and we didn't really talk about

716
01:30:41,840 --> 01:30:48,159
intentions tonight so i didn't read the hand without do did

717
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:54,480
you re-read the handout before before today so i'm not sure what it says in there about intention so if it's not

718
01:30:54,480 --> 01:31:00,639
clear don't worry about it and we can talk more another time um

719
01:31:00,639 --> 01:31:08,000
and then i'll just repeat i really like this question just dropping it in if i'm not my thoughts

720
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:14,320
what if i'm what hears and sees the thoughts just kind of playing with that a little bit

721
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:21,440
sort of dropping that question in what if i'm what hears and sees the thoughts

722
01:31:21,679 --> 01:31:26,400
just seeing how that lands

723
01:31:27,040 --> 01:31:33,120
and may this time together be of benefit to you

724
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:39,520
and of benefit to all the people you come in contact with and then the people they come in contact with and

725
01:31:39,520 --> 01:31:45,679
so on and so forth and uh thank you thank you for being here and cody and i will be here if you

726
01:31:45,679 --> 01:31:52,560
have any questions afterwards or you want to take a picture of the book all right thank you

727
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:55,880
thanks so much

728
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,639
