1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:08,639
very warm welcome to everybody it's nice to see you all

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,719
nice to practice together

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,119
and tonight i wanted to talk a little bit about practice

4
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,960
and there's so many different ways we can consider it and so many different

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:35,840
elements that make up practice but one way that maybe i'll begin with is

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,520
practice is kind of like a journey in some ways it's not helpful to think

7
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:49,840
of it that way but sometimes it's helpful to feel like okay it's a transformative path

8
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,760
and to help introduce this idea i'd like to read a poem like to start with a poem

9
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:04,799
that outlines or highlights this path

10
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:14,000
this poem is from thousands of years ago but somehow it feels for me there's a

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,560
certain timelessness about it and we can imagine that

12
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,840
it's um a similar scenario playing out today

13
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:37,200
and the poem goes like this plowing fields with plows

14
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:43,600
sowing seeds in the ground caring for children and family

15
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,600
people gain wealth

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:55,759
why is it that i thorough and virtuous conduct

17
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,600
doing the buddha's instructions not lazy or proud

18
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,520
have not attained peace

19
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:15,840
i watched the water the foot washing water

20
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,959
as it flowed from high ground to low

21
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,840
with this the mind concentrated

22
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:37,680
like a thoroughbred horse taking an oil lamp i entered my head

23
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,200
looking over the bed i sat down on the bed

24
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,519
taking a needle i pulled out the wick

25
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:57,200
as the flame went out the mind was freed

26
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,680
this poem describes just some ordinary experiences

27
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:14,560
the beginning noticing that other people are getting the results that they want

28
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,159
they are plowing fields they are sowing seeds

29
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:27,519
taking care of their family and they're gaining their rewards from their efforts

30
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:34,319
something that's really tangible you know you plant a seed it grows some grain you can take care of your

31
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:42,080
family and bring some to market sell and have some prosperity

32
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:48,400
so the author of this poem say well everybody else is getting what they want

33
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,080
but why is it that i am not getting what i want

34
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,879
even though i'm practicing i'm doing what she she's doing what she believes she should

35
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:08,239
be doing that following the instructions that she was giving she's working diligently

36
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:15,159
and still she's not attaining what she had been hoped to attain

37
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:22,720
and perhaps she's feeling a little bit of frustration or confusion why is it

38
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,400
that i have not attained release

39
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:35,120
maybe there's a certain like striving or straining or something like this

40
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:42,320
and then when she goes to do the ordinary thing at the end of the day after being barefoot or walking in

41
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:48,320
sandals just to wash one's feet before going to bed so that the bed

42
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:54,400
stays clean just an ordinary humble thing

43
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,800
and watching how the water the foot washing water after in my mind after washing the feed just kind of dumping

44
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:07,039
out the bowl of water and washing how the water flows

45
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:13,680
in some ways just obeying the laws of gravity this reality

46
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,680
things always flow downhill they never flow uphill

47
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:25,440
just this way of kind of quieting the mind and having it to get

48
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,720
um we could use this like this idea of flowing downhill as being reality is

49
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,479
part of what the dharma is about to collect the truth of the way things are

50
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:44,000
is just the way it is so watching the water flow downhill

51
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:50,400
kind of getting settling just being aligned with okay it's just this

52
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,240
time to go to bed it goes to bed and

53
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:03,440
just turns off the light maybe in the same way that we use a light switch nowadays

54
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:09,840
and something about this shift from going from light to dark from being able to see

55
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:17,600
to not being able to see allows the mind to let go

56
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:24,080
maybe it was the mind was clinging or identified with or something

57
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:29,120
whatever it could see the visual field but when the visual field all of a

58
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,880
sudden went away then it was the last thing that the mind was holding on to and

59
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,080
the mind was freed

60
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:46,960
i recently taught a retreat and one of the co-teachers

61
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:54,560
he came up with this um he was talking giving a talk about you know the postures

62
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,759
and then the way that he described it he said well you know the buddha has taught

63
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,440
about these four postures they're perfectly valid all for them

64
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:11,840
sitting standing lying down walking

65
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,160
and we sometimes give instructions for all four we tend to focus on the sitting but

66
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:24,000
and then he slipped in this little comment he said but i think they forgot there's this

67
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:29,039
fifth posture it's called inbetweening

68
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,080
somehow you know when you're moving from one posture to the next

69
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,199
and so we might consider that in this poem [Music]

70
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:47,120
getting into bed leaning over to turn off the light and just this ordinary movement

71
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:53,919
but having this shift in the visual field just when something different happened

72
00:07:55,360 --> 00:08:01,680
ananda buddha's attendant the same story happens with him it's kind of this

73
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:07,680
in-betweening after practicing all day

74
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:12,800
he lays down on the bed maybe there's just something about going

75
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:20,639
to bed it was like ah okay well i'm finished with today

76
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:27,638
with ananda before his head hit the pillow he had this awakening moment

77
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:35,518
so in betweening an opportunity to

78
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:42,800
not it's something it happens i myself have had this experience like been on retreat and a lot of

79
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:51,120
sitting meditation you know really some trying my best with some real diligence while sitting

80
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,959
but then having like well standing up to go do walking

81
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:02,639
having a kind of like a flash of some of an insight

82
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,480
so it's not so uncommon that like putting in some effort

83
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:15,120
and then when there's a little bit of a release when there's some moments of maybe some unguarded moment

84
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,040
but then something new can arise

85
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:28,880
so this poem some of you might have recognized it it's the poem of parachara

86
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:34,959
she sits on the altar some she has been here on this altar

87
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:41,360
it's the awakening poem attributed to her preeminent nun from the time of the

88
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,440
buddha and she was a teacher of others

89
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:53,200
a number of people who report how she helped them find her awakened their

90
00:09:53,200 --> 00:10:01,200
awakening the one thing that's interesting about patachara's a bit of her the back story

91
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:06,640
is that she came to practice after experiencing tragedy after

92
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,760
heartbreaking tragedy her husband dies

93
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:17,120
first one child dies the second child dies

94
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:22,560
then her parents die oh my goodness right it's just hard to imagine

95
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,880
so she was kind of like crazed with grief

96
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:33,760
and she in this crazed state she meets the buddha who gave her some

97
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:41,120
teachings and she decided to practice

98
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:48,000
and we know from this poem that she practiced with the way that she was in the world

99
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,920
she talked about being virtuous taking care with others taking care of

100
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,839
herself some way that we could talk about virtuous ethics is about having care and respect for

101
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:06,880
others caring respect for herself as well as she talked about in this poem

102
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,880
not being lazy or proud so doing what needed to be done but

103
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,440
also not you know lauding it over others or maybe not doing more so that

104
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:26,000
she didn't stand out as being particularly special not you know striving to be the bestest

105
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:31,920
or mostest in some kind of way but instead applying the right amount of

106
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:39,200
effort and creating the conditions in which the mind could be settled

107
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:46,079
could be aligned with just the natural way things go water

108
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:51,360
flows downhill just kind of just tuning into the

109
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:59,759
reality and the simplicity very uncomplicated just watching water flow downhill

110
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,200
so patachora's poem as many of you know come from this collection called the

111
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:16,639
gata these poems of the nuns from the buddhist time

112
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:23,040
something that i appreciate very much about the buddhist literature the sutras the

113
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:31,200
scriptures is that we could make this broad generalization

114
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:38,240
a really gross generalization but maybe it's a little bit helpful sometimes to make these i like to do this i like to

115
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:44,880
kind of lump things together into some really broad categories for me it's helpful

116
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:52,639
and one category i'm sure all of you know is this right one two three four five

117
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:58,880
and maps four normal truth seven factors

118
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:03,920
awakening five hindrances three characteristics ten perimes all this

119
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:11,120
right and the buddha kind of saying there are two things what too there's this and that or

120
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:17,279
you know there's so much of this myself i'm fond of these lists i like

121
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:23,720
them it's i kind of like to have things to be ordered and

122
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:29,680
systematized and categorized and all these kinds of things

123
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,880
so we might say that that's one style of the buddha's teaching

124
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:40,240
important and valuable but there's also another style

125
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:45,920
that includes poems includes things that isn't so systematic

126
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:52,240
and categorized poems stories similes

127
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:58,639
that evoke something else that touch maybe a different part of us

128
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,160
maybe there's a way in which there's um

129
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:09,600
this touches to the richness of our hearts and minds or

130
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,839
that's maybe painted pictures that are more evocative

131
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:20,560
and and dare i say there might be a certain amount of beauty

132
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:27,120
to these stories or similes i know sometimes i've heard similes and i thought oh

133
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:31,839
that's fantastic it's so evocative

134
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:40,079
one one that comes to mind right now is about the hindrances

135
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:45,920
and this sometimes the hindrances in particular described like being

136
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,040
there's a number of different ones but sometimes like the water boiling and

137
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:57,760
there's ill-will and you can't see through the water when it's water is still it can be like a mirror

138
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:04,560
but when there's a lot of ill will it's boiling and you can't see and i thought oh that's so

139
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:11,959
apt so it's you know communicate something very clearly

140
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:19,199
so this there's this to be sure there's a beauty also with the structure and the maps and the

141
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:23,920
numbers and all those kinds of things there's a certain elegance

142
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:31,040
there but is there a way in which we can tune into what the buddha is pointing to

143
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:36,639
with some of the stories some of the poetry some of the similes

144
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:45,360
and i know gill likes to use this word beauty sometimes to translate this word kalyana

145
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:51,680
and which talks about the dharma is beautiful in the beginning

146
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,959
beautiful in the middle and beautiful in the end

147
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:03,199
so allowing ourselves when i think of beauty as something often kind of inspiring

148
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:10,399
sometimes going to art museums which is a different type of beauty that's the visual and maybe

149
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:16,000
aesthetics maybe not which is different than a spiritual beauty which is

150
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:25,680
this can be associated with goodness or clarity or some warmth inside of us

151
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:32,880
but in the same way that sometimes some aesthetic visual beauty and spiritual beauty

152
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,839
they can really support sense of inspiration

153
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:44,880
a way for us to feel like oh i this is a worthwhile to do recognizing

154
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:51,279
sometimes it's difficult just like in this poem with she paracharis tremendous suffering

155
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:58,160
before she came to practice and then even when she started practicing right she's noticing why is

156
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,199
everybody else getting what they want all the farmers i can see that

157
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:09,520
they're able to reap the rewards of their efforts and why can't i

158
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:15,720
these are the words of somebody who is still struggling having difficulties

159
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:27,520
so i would like to suggest in practice that we need both we need both kind of the structured and the guidelines and

160
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,799
maybe maps and lists and holding them lightly but letting

161
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:37,840
them be a support but we also need to be inspired and have

162
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,600
our hearts feel touched and maybe there's something inside of us that resonates with some of

163
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:52,400
the stories and poems and similes these things of beauty

164
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,480
so i'd like to offer another poem kind of like along those lines

165
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,360
and this uh poem is attributed to a nun who her name is

166
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:14,520
chitta which we often translate as heart or mind

167
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:20,240
and for me it's a little bit interesting that um poem is attributed to somebody about

168
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:26,400
this that has this name it's just two uh two stanzas

169
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:31,440
maybe i'll talk a little bit more about it um after i read the poem

170
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:41,360
jitter says though i'm skinny sick and

171
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:47,520
very feeble i climbed the mountain

172
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,960
leaning on a staff

173
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:58,160
having laid down my outer robe and overturned my bowl

174
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:07,200
propping myself against a rock i shattered the mass of darkness

175
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:14,720
so chitta she talks about her body even though her

176
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,880
mind is about i mean sorry her name refers to heart and mind and she talks about her

177
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:27,200
body being sick and this difficulty of walking up a

178
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:33,840
mountain but i appreciate very much that she's losing us a staff she has a cane

179
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,440
she has something to help her we all need help at different times

180
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:46,080
different seasons of our practice and it can take so many different forms but here's

181
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:52,720
you know just kind of something that's uh very obvious maybe to

182
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:58,240
that we can see outside is that she has this cane

183
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:03,919
she's climbing this mountain and in some ways we are all climbing

184
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,440
mountains too we all have difficulties things that

185
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:15,159
maybe aren't so easy aren't so straightforward

186
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:22,559
hopefully everything isn't a mountain in your life but we do have these

187
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:31,120
in my mind she's just taking one step after the other she's sick and feeble

188
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:37,760
she gets to the top or maybe she's not even at the top but she's resting

189
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:47,480
she puts down her robe and her bowl so she puts everything down

190
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:57,360
and then the mass of darkness is shattered the darkness of ignorance the darkness

191
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:04,960
i've not seen clearly again we have this kind of this shift in the visual field before patachara went

192
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,679
from light to dark and now we have maybe going from dark to light being able to see something she

193
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:17,520
hadn't seen before we might

194
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:23,120
ask ourselves what would it be like for us

195
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:29,600
to put things down just like chitta's putting the robe the ohms bowl maybe the cane everything

196
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:36,159
she's carrying she's resting she puts it down she lets go

197
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:39,280
and there's awakening

198
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:49,679
is there a way in which we can put things down or at least uh loosen the clinging so maybe we're instead of

199
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:57,720
holding on so tightly we hold or maybe support with open palms

200
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:06,480
that allows us maybe to see things more clearly experience things more clearly

201
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:17,760
and then maddie weingast another poet who is inspired by this poem

202
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,679
writes another poem based on this one

203
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,240
that poem goes like this

204
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:36,640
somehow i kept climbing though tired hungry

205
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:41,840
and weak old too

206
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:48,799
at the top of the mountain i spread my outer robe on a rock to dry

207
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:54,640
set down my staff and bowl took a deep breath and

208
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:02,559
looked around it was windy up there

209
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:09,039
as i was leaning back against a large gray rock

210
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:16,720
the darkness that i had carried up and down a million mountains

211
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:25,760
slipped off my shoulders and swept itself away on the wind

212
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:40,240
as i was leaning back against a large gray rock the darkness that i had carried up and

213
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:47,360
down a million mountains slipped off my shoulders

214
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,158
and swept itself away on the wind

215
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:03,799
something i appreciate about maddie winegas version

216
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:09,919
is this idea of these darknesses that we carry with us

217
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:16,640
sometimes and this idea that it slipped

218
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:24,480
and swept itself away maybe less of the practitioner here making it go away

219
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:31,360
just with the wind just with nature off it goes

220
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:36,559
so maybe having put down or let go or

221
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:42,480
no longer clinging just allowed things to go where nature takes them

222
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,840
without us having this feeling like we have to make them up work or make them

223
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:52,880
go away but again this kind of interesting thing

224
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:58,799
about this person is climbing the mountain she's putting effort in she's practicing

225
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:06,320
one foot after another and then it's with this in-betweening

226
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:12,080
this leaning back against a rock then something else can happen

227
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:20,640
so this recognition of there's these rhythms of practice times in which we're really

228
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:26,480
maybe the more effort more intentional

229
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:32,159
and then some ease but you can't take the ease if there hasn't

230
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:37,520
been a certain amount of effort a certain amount of intentionality

231
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:43,360
which doesn't mean right that we have to be huffing and puffing and straining up a mountain

232
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:49,919
this is just an analogy but there is a pointing to a certain

233
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:56,480
commitment a certain intention

234
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,799
to spend one's time one energy wins energy doing this work

235
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:14,320
i'd like to read another poem in this uh poem this nun talks about how

236
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,760
she um what the expression is went forth

237
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:24,799
to go forth is to ordain is to become a monastic

238
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:30,320
to dedicate one's life you know full time to

239
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,559
the monastic life which includes going for alms rounds and living in communities especially if

240
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:42,480
you're a nun the nuns have less time alone than the monks

241
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:47,520
for safety reasons and

242
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:52,039
this a real commitment to practice

243
00:26:54,559 --> 00:27:00,159
and i i appreciate that sometimes we might have this idea of like okay well the monastics

244
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:06,400
you know they uh because they've dedicated their life to practice that it's maybe a little bit easier for

245
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:12,400
them or you know they don't have mortgages and kids and partners and the

246
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:20,720
news you know all these things that we have the traffic you know this kind of whatever it might be

247
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:30,240
so here's this poem by sama in the 25 years since i went forth

248
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:36,880
i don't know that i ever found serenity in my mind

249
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:43,679
i'd failed to find peace of heart or any control over my mind

250
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:53,679
when i remembered the victor's instructions i was struck with a sense of urgency

251
00:27:54,080 --> 00:28:00,640
though subject to so many painful things i have

252
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:07,919
through my love of diligence reached the ending of craving

253
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:15,440
and fulfilled the buddha's instructions this is the seventh day since my craving

254
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:22,000
dried up 25 years she talks about right this is a

255
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,559
long time but something about she's right when i

256
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:36,640
remembered the victor's instructions when she remembered the buddha's instructions struck with a sense of urgency sometimes

257
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:42,480
we hear things over and over again but it's not until a certain

258
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:47,520
conditions are in place in which we feel like they resonate or maybe that we

259
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:52,640
understand them in a way that we hadn't understood them before

260
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:59,600
i know this has happened to me so many times we're rereading a suta i love to read

261
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:08,399
the suta so often i'm like rereading them and thinking that i know everything that's in there i'm like oh wait oh

262
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:13,919
oh now i understand what's here hearing a dharma talk

263
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,960
like sometimes one that it was recorded and haven't heard it the first time

264
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:27,840
took something away from it but then again later realizing something else was there maybe you all have this experience as well

265
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:33,520
so just one time in particular she these

266
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:40,000
bringing to mind the teachings they this idea this sense of urgency is this

267
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,080
sense of really wanting to practice that hollywood is some vega maybe some of you

268
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:53,520
have heard of this this this inspiration to practice but with a sense

269
00:29:53,520 --> 00:30:00,399
of urgency a sense of commitment or a sense of i

270
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:06,880
really want to do this this is the this is the what i this is what's important for me in my life right

271
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:09,840
now

272
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:19,200
so also this this practitioner wasn't able to find ease in the beginning but she stuck with

273
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,960
it she didn't disrobe she practiced earnestly she had this

274
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:31,279
she wrote the poem says with my love of diligence so just coming back

275
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:37,640
coming back in whatever way made sense for her at that time

276
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:44,919
and she talks about excuse me

277
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:13,840
thank goodness for mute buttons

278
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:22,640
she talked about um reaching the ending of craving i'm sorry

279
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,120
so maybe there's

280
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:38,000
[Applause] i think i'm making a mess of this there we go i think maybe my mask was over my

281
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,519
microphone okay there we go

282
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:50,000
so for her that freedom was described or expressed or

283
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:55,120
as the ending of craving

284
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:04,320
shattering the mess of darkness or ending of craving there's so many different ways this can get expressed

285
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,240
it's maybe not exactly the same for everybody or maybe it is i don't know

286
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:17,600
but the way it gets expressed or the way it shows up or is different for different people

287
00:32:19,279 --> 00:32:25,440
i'd like to share also another poem that maddie weingast wrote

288
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:33,518
based on the poem that i just read having heard that poem feeling inspired

289
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:41,640
wrote another poem and it goes like this

290
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:49,919
after 25 years on the path i'd experienced almost everything

291
00:32:49,919 --> 00:32:56,880
except peace when i was young my mother told me that

292
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:03,200
i would find true happiness only in marriage

293
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:11,840
remembering her words all those years later something in me began to tremble

294
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:18,159
i gave myself to the trembling and it showed me all the pain this

295
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:24,559
little heart had ever known how countless lives of searching had

296
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:32,720
brought me at last to the present moment which i happily married

297
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:41,039
can you imagine we've been living together ever since without a single argument

298
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:47,120
for this idea of marrying the present moment you know this kind of like commitment to well i'm just going to be

299
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:53,679
here i appreciate this very much uh this person

300
00:33:53,679 --> 00:34:00,159
she has this uh you know had this socialized a certain way these

301
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:05,600
expectations how she should live her life and kind of you know

302
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:11,440
twisted it a little bit modified a little bit and uh made it her own way

303
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:17,040
found her own way marrying the present moment

304
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:21,240
and that's where she found the happiness

305
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:29,200
so maybe all these 25 years when she hadn't found peace she was always thinking that the

306
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:35,280
next moment would bring the happiness you know something

307
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:41,280
that's over there or in another time or something like this

308
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:49,760
but instead kind of when finally finding this commitment to be here

309
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:56,398
i also appreciate in here is this these lines something in me began to tremble

310
00:34:56,399 --> 00:35:02,800
i gave myself to the trembling so just allowing to be

311
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:09,599
what her experience was trembling is uncomfortable i'm imagining

312
00:35:09,599 --> 00:35:16,720
but stayed with it and that maybe gave her the confidence to say oh oh yeah i can do this i can be

313
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:21,920
with the present moment even if it shows up in this way that's

314
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:25,040
with some trembling

315
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:35,920
so in these poems i've read there's a few themes one that one we might say is some

316
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:42,800
diligence and practice which doesn't have to mean straining or

317
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:50,640
doesn't have to mean over exertion it just means like this

318
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:56,320
sense of this is what i'm going to do now i'm going to practice now

319
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:03,200
and this is part of the art of practice is to know like how much effort

320
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:09,359
right this one person became awakened when she leans back against a rock

321
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:15,359
right so there's a certain amount of ease that's required but also she was climbing up a mountain

322
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:20,000
so a certain amount of one step after the other

323
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:28,000
there's also difficulties on the path some of us might have come to this

324
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:34,960
practice because we had difficulties in our life and we were like discovering that there was some ease or

325
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:41,200
some maybe some wisdom that we could relate to that was happening that we could

326
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,119
find in this path of practice

327
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:54,240
but it's not uncommon for i would say this practice but i would say any spiritual practice

328
00:36:54,240 --> 00:37:01,760
there's going to be some difficulties right if we want to be transformation or some shifting in our

329
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:09,839
inner life it's going to be uncomfortable sometimes how could it not be uncomfortable

330
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:17,200
so just a recognition and that that maybe things don't happen on the timeline or the way that we expect or

331
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:22,040
hope or had thought it would be

332
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:30,800
also this another theme this idea that awakening is shows up in many different ways whether we're talking about

333
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:37,839
complete liberation or just some awakening some liberation from whatever

334
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:44,079
is binding us up at that time some of the more

335
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,119
mundane ways in which we find greater ease some greater peace shows up in all

336
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:54,720
kinds of different ways and so many different ways to express it

337
00:37:54,720 --> 00:38:02,440
different people express it differently and maybe at different times they express it differently

338
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:09,760
but one thing also that these poems have that's maybe a

339
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:14,880
more of a mood or a tone

340
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:19,000
is there a sense of confidence

341
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:26,240
and maybe a sense of delight also we hear in this

342
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:34,319
but once they have found greater freedom then there's this sense of

343
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:40,880
i don't know i i get this sense of a certain uprightness and this is what happened you know like that they're just

344
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:47,119
sharing their story describing what happened without being shy

345
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:52,560
without bragging just a certain sense of confidence and

346
00:38:52,560 --> 00:39:01,320
delight and clarity using language that makes sense to them

347
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:10,240
so i'd like to end with this one the last poem

348
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:18,000
that's written by maddie winegast but

349
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:25,440
no i i feel touched by there's something um for me it's very evocative it's

350
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:33,839
it uses a simile i might say that i don't know i feel touched by

351
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:43,000
we'll we'll see how uh how you relate to this but

352
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:52,320
while walking along the river after a long day meditating on vulture peak

353
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,320
i watched an elephant splashing its way out of the water and

354
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:04,480
up the bank hello my friend

355
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:10,640
a person waiting there said scratching the elephant behind its ear

356
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:17,680
did you have a good bath the elephant stretched out its leg

357
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:23,760
the person climbed up and the two rode off like that

358
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:32,640
together seeing what had once been so wild

359
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:38,240
now a friend and companion to this good person

360
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:44,240
i took a seat under the nearest tree and reached out a gentle hand

361
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,599
to my own mind truly

362
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:55,920
i thought this is why i came to the woods

363
00:41:03,599 --> 00:41:10,400
seeing what had once been so wild now a friend and companion to this good

364
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:17,280
person i took a seat under the nearest tree and

365
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:23,599
reached out a gentle hand to my own mind

366
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:32,720
this idea of our practice sometimes our mind feels

367
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,760
like a wild [Laughter] wild creature and

368
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:43,760
elephants right can be very destructive and very powerful

369
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:50,000
but to befriend them instead of this idea that they have to be doing something different or they

370
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:57,480
should do that or shouldn't do that but just to befriend them

371
00:42:02,079 --> 00:42:08,000
so may we all contribute our own poems

372
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:13,920
in whatever way that makes sense to us whether they're actually written poems

373
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:20,880
or maybe there's just the way that we live our life but may we all contribute our poems to

374
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:30,400
the human race and may this verse this poem

375
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:35,760
be for the benefit of all beings everywhere

376
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,000
thank you

377
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:52,240
and i'll stay up here for a few moments if anybody would like to ask a question or

378
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:59,200
come up and ask a question otherwise i wish you all a wonderful evening and thank you thank you for your

379
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:03,240
practice and for your attention
