1
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,059
good evening come here good evening everyone

2
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,220
how is this sound is it too loud or too soft is it okay

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:27,420
it should be a little bit a little bit louder just a tiny bit louder that's kind of what I was thinking too

4
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:32,880
that uh so let's see how did you did it is it

5
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:38,100
louder but uh okay maybe yeah here we go thank

6
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,180
you thank you sveta

7
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:51,059
nice to see you all or to believe right that I just realized that Autumn is this week right it's the

8
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:56,340
Equinox or wow the Equinox the solstice

9
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,480
one of those things one of those Sun and Earth things

10
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:11,460
so tonight I'd like to start with a poem a short poem it's by Rosemary traumer it's called

11
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:18,380
Moose musculus this is the Latin name for a mouse

12
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:27,299
so you don't know Rosemary Tremors she's like one of my favorite artists a poem poets and I'll say that often her poems

13
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:33,720
have a little bit of Whimsy to them and I like this and they're not complicated they're kind of straightforward and

14
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:41,240
you'll see that's the flavor of this poem too but I like what she's pointing to here

15
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:48,420
so the Palm goes like this today fear is a mouse

16
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,540
that scuttles between thoughts and feeds on whatever it finds nibbles on my

17
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:01,380
certainties gnaws the coding of my circuit trees and pulls the stuffing out

18
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:10,459
of each moment those are its droppings in the hallways of if whole ways of my mind

19
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,020
I thought it was worse when fear was a tiger a badger a wolverine but the mouse

20
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:25,020
of fear Finds Its way into everything makes nests inside my minutes discovers

21
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:31,319
passages in my inner walls then scratches against them at night

22
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:37,319
it never goes near the traps I've said no it's scampers around them it's soft

23
00:02:37,319 --> 00:02:46,819
feet pattern it's small it's small dark eyes noting Everywhere I Go

24
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:54,180
so this idea of this little mouse that's going Wherever She Goes

25
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:59,400
sometimes fear can feel like this it has its uh

26
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,599
excuse me here for a moment

27
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:18,440
sometimes fear can feel like this that it's um

28
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:25,620
following us around getting into little nooks and crannies of our days

29
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:33,720
I don't know what's happening with my voice it's and I'm not sick this is just something that happens with my allergies sometimes

30
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,080
earlier today it was fine so fear

31
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,420
often has a large role in our lives bigger than we realize

32
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:50,940
especially if we kind of like uh broaden this whole idea of fear to include

33
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:56,580
things like apprehension or anxiety

34
00:03:56,580 --> 00:04:01,920
or dread or worry if we kind of like expand to

35
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,420
the meeting to include these types of things we discover that actually maybe this little mouse

36
00:04:08,420 --> 00:04:14,340
is all over in our lives is showing up in so many different ways scampering

37
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:19,220
around scratching at night

38
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,520
in the way in the poet she talks about fear seemed easier when it was a tiger or a wolverine sometimes it seems like

39
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,860
it's easier when it's really big and we can point to it and it's right here and

40
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,220
it's obvious when it's there and it's obvious when it isn't there but this idea of a mouse of a way that you know

41
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:43,740
often when there's mice we don't see them we just feel the

42
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:51,259
effects of them so fear turns out to have actually a big

43
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:57,060
role in our lives and some people might even say like if we even wanted to

44
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:05,280
expand it even bigger and say that maybe it's we would say fears that they're rude to underlying all conflicts

45
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:13,259
or maybe even some of our sorrow there's this role that fear has or this

46
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:18,660
way in which it's blocking us from intimacy or you know getting close to others and

47
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:23,479
instead creating this sense of disconnection

48
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:31,500
I don't know if that's true if all of conflict has fear underneath it or if all sorrow has fear underneath it to

49
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:36,539
revolt hesitation about intimacy has fear underneath it but I think it's

50
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:41,880
worthwhile examining questioning for ourselves

51
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:48,479
yeah what role does Fear have in our lives what are the different ways it shows up

52
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:56,039
how would our lives be different if there were wasn't this fear dread apprehension worry

53
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,039
anxiety

54
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:08,820
so I'm talking about some of these things that are in our life but also fear can show up in a really subtle way

55
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:15,539
in our practice that is when we're practicing we have a meditation practice whatever meditation

56
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:20,639
practice you do there might be a way in which you come up to the edge of what's

57
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:25,800
familiar and start to touch into something different

58
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,220
something unfamiliar I know that when I one time I was

59
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:39,479
teaching an introduction to meditation class and sometimes there would be people that really didn't have any experience at all with meditation

60
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:45,000
and this one person on the first day maybe it was the second

61
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,460
day I don't remember that this person was like quite alarmed

62
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:57,120
like after I had done a little guided meditation and as she was sharing she's like this

63
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:05,039
feels odd this is uncomfortable I feel like it's a complete out of body experience and I was talking with her

64
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:12,120
and asking her to share what it was the experience was and it turned out it was

65
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:18,840
really calmness but she was so used to having this kind of this certain amount of anxiety inside

66
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:24,960
that this calmness felt like that she must not be present if there wasn't this

67
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,560
certain amount of calmness but it had some fear for her

68
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:39,120
I know for myself that I've had fear with on especially on some of these long Retreats when the mind gets really

69
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:46,020
settled you know months of on Retreat practice and silence and the mind gets into

70
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:52,080
places it hasn't been before like oh wow what was that

71
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:58,919
there's always for me I don't know if it's in this case for everybody the initial point is like whoa what was that

72
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:04,080
and then this uh I feel like the mind is like is this familiar is it not familiar

73
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:11,039
and if it's not familiar there's a little bit of you know this hesitation this uh not this willingness to like

74
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:17,720
just go for it like whatever is new just trusting it and going right into it

75
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:24,780
and on one of these uh really long Retreats that I sat Joseph Goldstein was one of the teachers

76
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:31,979
and I remember him giving a Dharma talk where he shared that one of his uh

77
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:38,279
biggest difficulties in practice and in life was fear

78
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:44,099
and I remember sitting there being like so surprised those who don't know Joseph Goldstein

79
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:50,220
he's uh probably one of the most senior if not the most senior person in this

80
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:57,439
tradition he helped bring it from India and Burma to the West

81
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:02,760
so you know he's been around for a long time decades and decades but not only

82
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:10,320
that he's like a really strong tall person you know then he kind of walks and moves a little authoritatively so to

83
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:16,260
hear that even he had a lot of fear I thought wow and at the time I thought like

84
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:21,959
I don't have any fear why does he have fear I had no idea how much fear I actually

85
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:29,459
had so I don't know what I'm I think about Joseph often when I see fear like oh

86
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:34,040
yeah okay at least I'm in good company here

87
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,640
but so maybe it's uh the fear of the unknown but maybe it's also the fear

88
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,339
when we are in our meditation practice look at this fear that maybe it's things

89
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:54,060
like oh maybe this uncomfortable sensation in my knee or my back is never going to end

90
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:59,120
you know we kind of like project into the future or

91
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:05,700
or maybe we have this uh fear that I'll never get settled or this mind will

92
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:11,279
never settle down and I will never be able to feel a certain amount of ease or

93
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:19,040
calm like the Mind likes to do this likes to come up with these different scenarios

94
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:26,760
so maybe one of the first ways of the stage of practicing with fears even to

95
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:32,640
acknowledge its presence this won't be sufficient to make fear go

96
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:38,640
away just to have this intellectual understanding but it's where we start

97
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:45,300
maybe it's not it doesn't have to be the very beginning but it definitely has a role and it's tempting to think like

98
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:52,079
okay if I just understand it better if I figure it out it'll go away if I get

99
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:57,779
underneath it what was it from my childhood or my the way that I was

100
00:10:57,779 --> 00:11:04,320
raised or something that happened earlier in my life that's causing this fear and certainly that can have a role and

101
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:10,740
can be supportive but there's often like when the fear is being experienced right there it's not

102
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:16,740
we don't have the opportunity we don't have the wherewithal we don't have the time

103
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:22,160
to do is that type of investigation or inquiry

104
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:28,740
but instead we can just notice that

105
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:34,260
there's fear shows up in all kinds of ways some of it's subtle

106
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:41,760
for example it might be some fear that's really driving our ambition

107
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:47,640
our motivation what's propelling us maybe there's some fear underneath that

108
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,640
or maybe there's some fear that's underneath our anger

109
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:59,399
whether we're angry with ourselves angry with other people or just however it shows up but maybe there's some fear

110
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:05,959
underneath that or maybe there's some fear underneath our sadness

111
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:13,980
so there's this way that fear can show up or support all kinds of these some

112
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:19,699
uncomfortable emotions and aspects of Our Lives

113
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:25,560
and uh Ezra bada who's a zen teacher he says well actually we could just boil it

114
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:31,079
all down to just three fears again I don't know if this is true but uh it's

115
00:12:31,079 --> 00:12:37,680
been interesting for me to think about this so he says that there's only three fears

116
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,560
and that these like underlie all of our uncomfortable experiences

117
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:50,120
number one is the fear of losing safety and control

118
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:56,820
yeah we don't like to lose control how much of our life is trying to control control ourselves control other people

119
00:12:56,820 --> 00:13:03,839
control anything we can yeah I noticed that with my mindfulness

120
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:09,600
with my meditation practice when I first started being mindful I had no idea how

121
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:16,139
much planning I was doing I didn't realize that I would have spent all my time just planning planning planning

122
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:23,820
and it wasn't until I actually noticed oh there's fear underneath this planning

123
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:29,519
like I'm trying to be prepared so that no matter what happens it's going to be

124
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:34,560
okay so you have all these contingency plans that are coming up and well if

125
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:40,800
this happens then I gotta have this and that and you know so then I would like have a big backpack that I had to carry

126
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,680
with me everywhere you know just in case you know all these things you know this fear of boredom or

127
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:52,200
you know whatever it might be so this fear of losing safety and

128
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:59,160
control I have a nice first aid kit in my car which is probably a good thing to do I

129
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,800
want to say but you know maybe there's a little this fear of uh being unsafe for

130
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:11,040
I like to think it's because so I can help somebody if they need it if I happen to come across an accident or

131
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:16,639
something I'm the first one there I don't want to be feel helpless

132
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:25,560
so a second fear that Ezra beta says is a fear of aloneness and disconnection

133
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:31,560
and we could say well maybe serum over this impacts our relationships with

134
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:37,680
people maybe some of our relationships with ourselves or also our relationship with death

135
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:42,899
this fear of aloneness of death maybe we don't want other people to die

136
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:49,560
we don't want to die and then the third fear is this fear of

137
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:55,459
unworthiness not being good enough somehow being

138
00:14:55,459 --> 00:15:02,399
inadequate or insufficient and the things that we'll do to maybe bolster uh

139
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:09,360
the view that others have of us you know wanting to look good in such a way

140
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:14,940
maybe there's this fear of main feeling like we're unworthy or

141
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:19,160
seeming like that we're unworthy to others

142
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:28,440
so there's sometimes people like to lump things together and sometimes people like to split them apart things just

143
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:34,740
like anything and I'm one of those people who likes to just lump things into categories so I kind of like this

144
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:41,040
idea that there's just these three fears because it also uh

145
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:50,279
kind of I find it interesting to think well are there some fears that don't fall into those three back buckets

146
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:56,459
and of course we can get into well it depends how you define safety and control and you know all these kinds of

147
00:15:56,459 --> 00:16:02,519
things but part of why it's helpful is because it's

148
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:07,860
um gives us something maybe to point to instead of fear just being this big

149
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:13,079
black box something that's mightily uncomfortable

150
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:20,459
and that we would do almost anything to not have that experience maybe having a few little labels or

151
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:26,779
flavors of it makes it become maybe a little bit less of a black box

152
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:33,660
because there's a way in which we often of course we don't like fear and we

153
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:39,320
often are trying to like flee from fear or avoid it

154
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:47,339
and maybe I should say also that um you know there's lumping together but

155
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:55,440
maybe I'll also just tease apart I made a little bit to this uh the difference between fear and anxiety

156
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:01,139
for the most part I'm kind of like putting them together but we might understand that a

157
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:08,280
difference is is that fear is more about something that's a known

158
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:14,699
and it has it's been a specific object or specific experience

159
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:22,438
most it's either something that's imminent or maybe something that's far in advance whereas anxiety has more of

160
00:17:22,439 --> 00:17:30,720
this unfocused fear maybe it's this excessive fear that that's a little bit higher

161
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:36,480
than what's necessarily the object if we knew what it was would be related to

162
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,380
would be appropriate for that then maybe as an aside I've just noticed

163
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:49,620
you in my mind and some other teachers who have noticed this also that uh maybe

164
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:55,039
it's after the pandemic but how many people are talking about their anxiety

165
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:00,059
how many people are just feeling uncomfortable I see this and my role as

166
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:07,260
like a teacher on retreats or in other settings or practice discussions and people are sharing with

167
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:14,460
me how their practice is going and this word anxiety comes up a lot

168
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:21,179
so just this recognition that I think this is maybe a time a season

169
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:29,820
this time of post-pandemic and everything else that's happening in the world in which it's not so uncommon

170
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:36,120
but as I was saying fear involves this like this unpleasant sensation so it's

171
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:43,860
an unpleasant experience and we might be able to like tease those apart between the physical Sensations which

172
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:49,500
maybe it's a heart pounding or maybe there's like butterflies in the stomach

173
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:56,820
and then there's those reactions to those Sensations which might also be some clenching or some tightening or

174
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:02,280
bracing or something like this so those are like what's happening in the body

175
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:08,640
but also what's happening in the mind is usually there's a constriction of the

176
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:14,280
awareness like we're just focused on one thing and not in a way that's Pleasant

177
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:21,780
sometimes when we're focused a sense of concentration can bring with it some calm and ease but this is a constriction

178
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:27,660
where the awareness shrinks down in a way that is unpleasant

179
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:35,039
feeling stuck maybe or there isn't a sense of ease or relaxation or malleability instead this

180
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:40,440
really shrinking and again part of this teasing apart and

181
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:47,100
this way is also so that we can work with it I can notice okay there's the what's

182
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,919
happening in the body and there's what's happening in the mind and those are two different ways in

183
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:58,460
which we can practice with fear that we can work with it

184
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:06,480
so because if we have if we don't notice that we have fear

185
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:12,240
and then there's just the aversion to fear which of course I think is a natural response I think it's part of

186
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:17,960
our biology fear wouldn't be effective as a way to protect us which I'm sure

187
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:24,539
evolutionarily is why we have fear if it weren't uncomfortable so it's inherently

188
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:33,660
uncomfortable but part of this what perpetuates fear is this idea of

189
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:40,200
fleeing or trying to run away from it if it's happening right then if we're

190
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:48,840
feeling fear but part of what happens when we're trying to run away from the fear is we run away in our minds into

191
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:54,419
our minds but when there's fear the mind is kind of

192
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:59,880
constricted and there might be this Whirlwind of stories or maybe it's not

193
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:05,700
even clear I got to get out of here what is this happening or there can be this disorganization in our thoughts or a

194
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:12,360
sense of a franticness to them so it's part of the way reason why

195
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:22,020
aversion which often turns to this idea of fleeing just perpetuate perpetuates the fear is

196
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:27,240
because we're just feeding maybe this uh

197
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:33,659
that thought this rumination or this uh way in which we're kind of like stuck in

198
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:40,320
a certain way of thinking so what are some ways to practice with

199
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,600
fear there's a number of different ways and I'd like to

200
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:52,679
say that also we have to recognize that of course there's different intensities of fear so different practices might be

201
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:57,960
appropriate with different intensities things that are just mildly

202
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:03,419
fearful for me there's a thing about spider webs

203
00:22:03,419 --> 00:22:08,460
that I don't like I just I mean let alone spiders right but the spider webs

204
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:14,400
I'm getting much better much better in fact the other day I just was cleaning up some spider webs and I felt rather

205
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:20,580
proud of myself but you know those aren't really terrible ones you know a few years I can

206
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:26,100
work with those in a certain way but uh you know some of these

207
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:33,299
existential fears fears of being alone fears of being out

208
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:39,780
of control fear of death you know they might need a little bit more

209
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:45,480
care with how we practice with them but here's one way to practice both with

210
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:52,140
the minor ones I'll use the word minor less intense and it might be available for some of

211
00:22:52,140 --> 00:23:00,179
the more intense ones too and that is to bring attention to the body

212
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:07,980
but the body in a particular way I would say more like the whole body so not like

213
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:13,440
a focused in but like the whole body the whole bodily

214
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:20,460
experience so one way to do this is just to pay attention to posture

215
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:27,000
and just to notice you know is there an alertness is there slouching is the hip

216
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:34,620
out with your head on your hip or you're tapping your foot or I don't know are you with the shoulders down and like

217
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:43,100
this this or if you're walking to feel the maybe the pressure underneath the feet

218
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,780
because there's this way in which a more generalized mindfulness to the body

219
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:55,860
helps to get away from this constriction that's happening with the awareness instead this uh kind of like opening up

220
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,200
to be with the entire bodily experience

221
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:09,120
and there's a simile that the Buddha gives but we could say is uh definitely

222
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:16,559
an example of being mindfulness of the body with fear and this is a simile of a person

223
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:23,039
who has a bowl of boiling oil

224
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:30,080
on their head and they're walking

225
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:37,860
towards the stage for a performance is going on a dancing performance

226
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:43,980
in my mind that means there's music and in my mind that means other people might be dancing

227
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:49,740
an audience and then just to make it even more stressful that there's

228
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:55,260
somebody walking behind the person that has oil on their head with a knife

229
00:24:55,260 --> 00:25:00,659
saying that they're going to chop off your head if you drop any of the oil so

230
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:06,120
the oil will burn you then off with that fear right there's a way in which all

231
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:13,559
this fear and so walking that way you really have to pay attention to the posture but you

232
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:19,260
also have to be paying attention to what's going around you like it's any of these dancing people around you gonna

233
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:26,039
hit you or run into you or something so maybe this isn't a great simile

234
00:25:26,039 --> 00:25:33,240
because if I were to imagine that I think I would be really tense but the point is to like you just to not

235
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:40,200
to be aware of your surroundings as well as your posture and to still be able to

236
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:49,279
move so this is kind of like a simile that's giving of this mindfulness of the body in this way of way to work with fear

237
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:57,900
there's also a way in which mindfulness of the body can be

238
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:04,500
um have this sense of openness that sometimes teachers will talk about this

239
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:09,659
and I've practiced this way sometimes it's really a lovely way to practice is

240
00:26:09,659 --> 00:26:15,900
to like maybe expand the idea of the body

241
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:22,200
to you like I don't know maybe like six to 12 inches from the body

242
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:28,679
and this can be really Pleasant actually so it's uh not the usual mindfulness

243
00:26:28,679 --> 00:26:34,020
practice but just to still be aware of

244
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:40,260
what's Happening but with the body just a little bit expanded

245
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:47,220
turns out that the Mind likes to be big and open and so doing this with the with

246
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:53,760
the body just encourages the mind to be a little bit more open and then it naturally will want to kind of collapse

247
00:26:53,760 --> 00:27:00,900
down and focus on one thing in particular because that's a little bit easier but there's a way which in just to be a

248
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:06,360
little bit mindful of the whole body including just a few inches off of the body

249
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:12,179
and I know that sounds a little bit odd and but it's worth just playing around with

250
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:16,760
if you'd like to explore something like this

251
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:24,120
so there's a way in which we also that being mindful of one's posture or like

252
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:30,419
the whole uh bodily experience so it can be a way that we can like maybe like

253
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:38,640
relax into this sense of being embodied because so often the fear is we're lost

254
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,760
in our mind about what might happen not all the time sometimes there's fear or you know imminent danger

255
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:50,880
but for most of us probably the things that we're afraid of or have fear about are things that are going to happen in

256
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:56,520
the future so there's a way just to feel embodied

257
00:27:56,520 --> 00:28:03,840
like I'm here now if I'm right here

258
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,900
and to like feel the experience of breathing and to just feel the sense of

259
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:15,659
aliveness or presence that's inhabiting the body

260
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:21,799
and there's a way that that can be comforting and grounding and settling

261
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:27,779
so mindfulness of the body is one way to practice with fear

262
00:28:27,779 --> 00:28:32,880
and I'm pointing to this mindfulness that's a little bit more of the whole

263
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:38,179
body more generalized as opposed to a really focused way

264
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:47,760
so then a second thing that we can do with uh with fear of course is loving

265
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,580
kindness practice there's a way that you know

266
00:28:53,580 --> 00:29:01,620
love I'll just say generally love warm-heartedness and fear definitely have a relationship with one another

267
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:08,159
because um there's this book right it was written decades ago the now the author

268
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:17,340
slips my mind but this idea is the title of the book is love is letting go of fear

269
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:23,460
so there's this way in which if we can cultivate some open-heartedness

270
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:28,679
some warm-heartedness then there isn't fear there or the fear

271
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:35,399
greatly lessens and so there's a few ways to do this and

272
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:42,840
one I will say one is just to have this be a regular practice not waiting until fear arises

273
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:49,260
there's a loving-kindness practice I'm not gonna I'm going to the details

274
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:56,580
of that for those of you who are interested I taught for a number of years and it's uh now Liz Powell teaches

275
00:29:56,580 --> 00:30:01,679
that's with Nikki mergafori but five days a week There's a

276
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:07,919
loving-kindness practice on on zoom and you if you go to the IMC

277
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:16,580
calendar you'll see so there's hundreds and hundreds of recordings and still going on most days

278
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:22,260
but there's this way in which uh with loving kindness practice

279
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:31,279
that we can just bring to mind that absolute easiest

280
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:39,960
absolute easiest way to bring some openness or care to the heart

281
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:46,140
for some this might be internet things that we saw these little kittens or

282
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:52,919
puppies or babies there's a reason right why there's so many kitten videos so it's because uh

283
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:58,500
people like them and puppies and it's perfectly fine to use something like

284
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:03,960
this for practice to like feel into the open-heartedness

285
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:11,100
and the warmth and the Delight and connect with that Sensation that

286
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:17,460
experience and then allow that experience to get as big as it would like

287
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:23,820
there's different ways to connect to it and there's different ways that uh to allow maybe that experience to grow of

288
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:30,960
this care or Delight or love or warmth or respect or however you might experience it and I'll just say briefly

289
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:38,580
one way is just to be repeating phrases for example may you be safe or may you

290
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:43,860
be happy or may you be healthy like sending some good wishes to this lovable

291
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:50,340
being and it can be that simple it doesn't

292
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:57,120
need to be lots of different categories or different phrases or something like this there's a way in which the mind and

293
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:02,460
the heart when they're experiencing some openness and warmth the fear just

294
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:05,778
naturally dissipates

295
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:14,700
so even if we're having a fear of an individual let's say I wouldn't recommend that we do loving

296
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:21,360
kindness for that individual that's a tall order and then we're just setting ourselves up

297
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:31,320
for maybe feeling feeling like oh I can't do this and then I even maybe seem to be scarier instead just do some uh

298
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:38,460
loving kindness where it's easy and then so it related to that is

299
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:43,559
something that we can do when we're experiencing fear is that we can just

300
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:49,980
have this inquiry into about what's happening in the mind I talked about the body I talked about

301
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:56,399
the heart and now maybe we could say about the mind as I said often fear has this

302
00:32:56,399 --> 00:33:02,460
constriction like there's this uh shrinking of the awareness

303
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:10,980
but we could also if we remember if we can remember we can just have this gentle inquiry

304
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,380
is there any wisdom here I mean maybe the fear is like really wise and can we

305
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:22,679
appreciate the wisdom can we say is there any self-respect

306
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:29,580
here and can we appreciate that also okay this fear is part of us maybe like

307
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:35,279
setting boundaries and way that we're taking care of ourselves and can we tune

308
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:40,500
into that is there just care in general care for

309
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:45,840
ourselves care for somebody else or care for something that's really important to us

310
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:51,659
and tune into that because that's a way this uh care or

311
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:58,799
self-respect or wisdom are also ways in which we can broaden the mind

312
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:05,100
I'm pointing to all these different ways in which we can get out of this collapsed feeling that often happens

313
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:12,000
with fear because when we're practicing with fear we don't want to collapse and surrender

314
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:18,060
into it nor do we want to repress it and pretend that it's not there

315
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:26,339
but is there a way that we can work with it acknowledge it but not be overwhelmed

316
00:34:26,339 --> 00:34:31,858
so mindfulness of the body and just kind of like maybe a general way

317
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:38,398
loving kindness practice either that one has done regularly as part of their meditation

318
00:34:38,399 --> 00:34:43,879
practice but maybe even then when there is fear

319
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:50,580
recently I was uh on a walk in this place where I know that there's some

320
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:55,980
dogs that they're behind a fence but I can see them and they can see me and

321
00:34:55,980 --> 00:35:01,260
they they love to bargain like run and run and run and I have a little a fear

322
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:06,300
of dogs here's what am I having been bitten a number of times I have this uh

323
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:12,000
fear of them and I was trying to like look at them and like may you be happy

324
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,960
but you'll be healthy that didn't work very well

325
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:26,400
yeah and somebody recommended that I then was on a walk with somebody else in this

326
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:33,060
same place and they said what if you don't even look at the dogs that are barking and running and stuff

327
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:40,079
like this just like ignore them like look the other way and it turned out that was very helpful so I think dogs

328
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,720
maybe if you're looking at them they're interacting with you more but I don't know that I had learned more about the psychology

329
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:53,339
of dogs then but so is there a way in which we can open

330
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:58,680
our hearts our minds and maybe have a little bit more ease in the body when

331
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:06,180
there is fear as a way to practice with it and then we might discover

332
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:11,880
that if we have experienced some fear and we have worked with it maybe this is

333
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:20,300
a minor one spiderwebs dogs that are barking but behind a fence

334
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:26,579
is there a way that then we can be a little bit more confident

335
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:33,300
because it turns out that really a tremendous way to work with fear is to

336
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:39,480
trust that you can do it you know trust that okay this is fearful

337
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:44,640
it's mightily uncomfortable but that's okay too

338
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:51,599
and so part of the way that we can trust ourselves or trust that being uncomfortable with fears

339
00:36:51,599 --> 00:36:57,960
is going to be okay it's just to have experiences with some

340
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:04,380
of the more minor fears in our lives fear of

341
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:10,260
what is the person that checked the grocery store clerk gonna say or think

342
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:17,579
when they see all the things that are in the shopping cart you're gonna think like they might have some comments about

343
00:37:17,579 --> 00:37:27,320
wow why is she buying so much of that or something like this I don't know just these minor fears whatever they might be

344
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:34,200
so fear it turns out has a big role in our lives it might be really subtle

345
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:40,640
might be underlined some really and really otherwise

346
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:47,160
unrecognized and comfortable experiences it might be really obvious things that

347
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,260
we have fear of but it's really worthwhile spending some

348
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:59,040
time acknowledging for ourselves just even acknowledging the role of fear acknowledge that we don't have to be

349
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:05,280
completely free of fear it's just part of the human experience of course it is like how

350
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:11,160
could it be otherwise of course there's fear and then is there a way that we can

351
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,920
practice with it I I was talking about kind of like how the mind gets small but

352
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:22,140
it turns out our lives get small when we have a lot of fear

353
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:27,240
because we're trying to avoid all these things that cause a little bit of fear and

354
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:33,780
and then trying to avoid that it turns out to be so many things

355
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:41,460
because you're avoiding this well now you have to avoid that because that might lead to this which might lead to that and our lives just start to shrink

356
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:48,599
so it's a way in which to make not only our minds and hearts bigger but our lives bigger and if we're willing to

357
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:54,000
take some risks take some chances do something new go somewhere new that we

358
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,900
haven't before enriches Our Lives bring some

359
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:10,320
some beauty some depth some richness to this experience this Human Experience

360
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:18,420
so fear and how to practice with it so I think I'll end there and uh

361
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:24,359
open it up and see if there are any some questions or comments about what I've

362
00:39:24,359 --> 00:39:26,900
said here

363
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:51,720
thank you um thank you it was a good topic just what I needed to hear so um my question

364
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:57,240
is what if you're dealing with crippling fears

365
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:04,200
and I have tried to pay attention to the body it just

366
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:10,500
doesn't work my mind's run away the fear takes over and

367
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:16,980
so what do you do then and I like what you said about trusting oneself

368
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:23,460
but if the mind's already gone how do you bring the trust back and then

369
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:28,760
what does it mean for the stimulus for

370
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:34,079
what has caused the fear yeah because somewhere you have to do a little bit of

371
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:39,839
problem solving to deal with that fear um

372
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:45,720
so it all becomes this complex mess I'd love to hear what you have to say about

373
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:52,560
that yeah no can you keep the microphone because I have a question can you say a little bit more what happens when you uh

374
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:59,720
bring awareness to the body what happens I can't I can't no it doesn't work

375
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:09,060
the hearts pounding and you know every attendant feelings there but that idea

376
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:14,099
of stepping back and observing what's happening doesn't happen it happens when

377
00:41:14,099 --> 00:41:21,599
I am not that afraid yeah yeah but when I really need it the tools fail me yeah

378
00:41:21,599 --> 00:41:28,500
yeah yeah and is this something that's like debilitating for your life or that happens a lot or is it just like uh

379
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:34,320
occasionally it's incidental yeah yeah yeah so I thank you for asking this this

380
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:39,599
is a really good question I would say for Fears like this sometimes

381
00:41:39,599 --> 00:41:46,500
mindfulness is not the right way because exactly as you said it's not going to work right we just there's certain types

382
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:53,940
of fear where it just uh leaves us our wisdom leaves us and for something like that there might

383
00:41:53,940 --> 00:42:02,940
be uh it might be appropriate for um to work with different modalities other than meditation or mindfulness

384
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:09,060
something like [Music] um limited exposure therapy or something

385
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:15,240
like this you know I'm not an expert in this but I know about this or there's

386
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:20,640
number different modalities so I'll just say this I just kind of want to normalize your experience and it can be

387
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:26,820
frustrating when you hear somebody like me say like ah just be mindful of it and you're like no that doesn't work

388
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:34,859
I would say for those but it turns out to be really helpful to like uh make a

389
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:42,780
real effort to work with the minor fears like to intentionally work with minor fears this does have an impact so I will

390
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:49,140
say that so I offered you know spiders and spider webs or dogs or something like this so maybe there's something

391
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:55,680
that isn't uh crippling that you can practice with

392
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,900
and so that's one thing is maybe to like be intentional another thing is actually

393
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:07,079
to just have a loving kindness practice to have this just be a regular part of

394
00:43:07,079 --> 00:43:13,020
your life or in your meditation practice not so that it absolutely is going to

395
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:19,500
make the fear go away but there's something about a loving kindness practice that

396
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:25,800
um makes everything easier there's it maybe brings a little bit

397
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:31,880
more of the confidence or a little bit more of the

398
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:36,900
decreases the intensity of the fear or something like this so is that helpful

399
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:44,220
kind of like this yeah thank you I I tried loving kindness for a long time and it worked maybe it worked I can't

400
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:49,940
tell but after a while it doesn't work anymore um

401
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:57,960
I think I remember talking to somebody I can't remember who I spoke to

402
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:05,400
she's a part of the IMs community and she had said that

403
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:11,819
if all that you can do is send loving kindness to yourself for months at end every time you sit

404
00:44:11,819 --> 00:44:16,859
then that's enough and

405
00:44:16,859 --> 00:44:21,900
so it it changes after a while it's like oh I don't actually need it maybe I'll

406
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:27,240
send it to somebody else and then maybe that doesn't work so yeah I don't know if I just need to like

407
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,700
stick to things and keep trying and yeah

408
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:38,040
I don't know yeah right I I love and kindness practice I I think I gave a

409
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:44,520
talk on this not too long ago I'm with you it's not always easy and it's sometimes fun and it feels like a drag

410
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:52,380
sometimes I went really I'm supposed to be doing this but if there's a way you can find them which it feels uh

411
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:57,839
and like I said where it's really easy then there's a way that it can be a

412
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:03,060
little bit uplifting and it creates the conditions in which things can get

413
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:09,119
metabolized or processed in a different way and we

414
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:14,339
don't understand or necessarily know what's happening but there is a way that it can really be

415
00:45:14,339 --> 00:45:20,579
portative so just an encouragement I guess okay thank you I'll try it again thank you

416
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:28,440
okay so there we are at the top of the hour so thank you all for your kind attention and if you'd like I'll stay up

417
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:34,800
here if I have some questions so thank you and I wish you knew a wonderful rest of

418
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:37,940
the evening thank you
