1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:07,839
okay hello and welcome everyone to this

2
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:13,280
edition of happy hour as we come together to practice

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:21,039
so for inspiration for tonight's practice uh i'd like to read

4
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:28,240
a um a translation uh from the udana of the verses in udana

5
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:35,040
um translated uh by taniser bhikkhu and udana is

6
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:42,960
from the original poly canon so so here is um here is the

7
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,480
um the quote and so the buddha says

8
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:57,199
searching in all directions with your awareness you find no one dearer

9
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:04,400
than yourself in the same way others are thickly dear to themselves

10
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,520
so you shouldn't hurt others if you love yourself

11
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,840
quite profound so two different parts to this let me read it

12
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,360
one more time searching in all directions with your

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,360
awareness you find no one dearer than yourself

14
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:34,720
in the same way others are thickly dear to themselves so you shouldn't hurt others if you love

15
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,159
yourself ah interesting there's a lot to unpack

16
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:48,000
there as a practice right so looking in all directions you find no one dearer than yourself

17
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:55,680
so that's kind of taken for granted that first part that oh yes that no one is dearer than you

18
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:01,680
to yourself than you are okay that's that's part number one and then yes of course

19
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,719
it's the same for others so if you love yourself you wouldn't

20
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:14,560
hurt others so some invitations that

21
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:23,200
yes it is okay the buddha is actually um saying that as you look around

22
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:30,319
uh searching in all directions with your awareness you find no one dearer than yourself yeah

23
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,519
interesting and the second part that there is something about

24
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:43,280
self-love if we dearly love ourselves so the base the baseline the the conditions

25
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:50,319
um for us really dearly loving ourselves accepting ourselves um holding this

26
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:57,040
being who is me showing up in this way with all the gifts and challenges and

27
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,560
uh idiosyncrasities and i can even say that word which is kind

28
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:09,120
of interesting but anyway so so with all the idiosyncratic ways i show up in the world okay that's better

29
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,159
um and all the funny ways and all the gifts and all the beauties that i show up

30
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,840
if i really truly love myself and hold myself dear

31
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:27,440
that is the base that is the platform for considering that yes other people

32
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:34,959
hold themselves dear their lives are dear to them not just human beings but animals

33
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:41,760
so that can become a precondition a basis of treating others just as we want

34
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:48,959
to be treated just as we hold ourselves dear so a lot to unpack here

35
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:56,319
so without jumping into a dharma talk

36
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:03,599
let's just practice together and draw on this as inspiration for us

37
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:10,000
practicing self like to invite you to get into your meditation posture

38
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:15,840
ah whatever is comfortable for you

39
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,280
landing in this body

40
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:43,840
sitting [Music] standing or lying down

41
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,570
first as always we start by just settling

42
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:59,440
[Music] settling with awareness into this breath this

43
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:11,840
body calming arriving

44
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:53,840
letting the breath breathe you

45
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:07,199
settling arriving

46
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:14,560
more fully more completely more wholeheartedly with each

47
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:21,840
out breath landing

48
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:31,840
and if thoughts memories plans are arising

49
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,479
noticing noticing with awareness what's happening

50
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:47,360
and calming soothing ourselves with the next out breath

51
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:55,280
ah landing in this moment right here lovingly

52
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:59,840
for this being who is us

53
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,319
out of care out of concern

54
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:16,800
putting down putting aside what doesn't need to be thought

55
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:27,840
or figured out right now

56
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:52,320
here here just here

57
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:05,839
right here this breath

58
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,680
this moment

59
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,480
nowhere to go nothing to do

60
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,839
just to give our hearts to itself in this moment

61
00:10:43,440 --> 00:11:01,839
to recognize the goodness the beauty

62
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,880
in suchness of just being aware

63
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,839
turning the gaze inward

64
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:33,120
searching in all directions with your awareness

65
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:42,720
you find no one dearer than yourself

66
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:51,839
no one dearer than yourself

67
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:01,439
what if we imagine that with our awareness we're searching in all directions

68
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:11,839
and we find this being we find this person ourselves

69
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:21,280
whom we perhaps forsaken for others

70
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:37,120
what if we truly recognize honor love not from

71
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:47,840
a selfish egoistic place

72
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:56,640
but from the perspective with truth is saying

73
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:03,120
unconditionally loving

74
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:15,840
this being who is us

75
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:24,480
perhaps

76
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:32,080
imagining our favorite love song

77
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:40,240
when we have sung for others in our minds and our hearts or wish that somebody else some other

78
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:45,280
person would see us would really see us and love us

79
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:50,400
and sing that favorite love song for us

80
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:56,880
what if we sing it to ourselves

81
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:10,640
loving ourselves our beloved other

82
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,679
giving our heart

83
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:25,840
lowly fully wholeheartedly to itself

84
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,880
an infinite echoing and mirroring

85
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:39,840
of love

86
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:31,840
see how this practice might work for you

87
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:38,080
maybe receiving it easier is easier for you can imagine yourself receiving

88
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:44,400
this love poem love song from yourself

89
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:51,120
or maybe it's easier to give it from the embodied seat giving it to this

90
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:58,159
being stepping outside of yourself see whether giving or receiving embodied

91
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:13,840
works better for you or maybe both

92
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:22,640
if unsure maybe try imagining yourself receiving this poem or love song

93
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,840
serenade it to you

94
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:41,840
by yourself

95
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:15,840
for some maybe a younger version of yourself

96
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:29,840
might help be supported

97
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,760
to see love protect care

98
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:43,840
for a younger self

99
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:28,799
searching in all directions with your awareness you find no one dearer than yourself

100
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:38,559
the same way others are thickly dear to themselves

101
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:57,840
so you shouldn't hurt others if you love yourself

102
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:03,440
so as we've been considering

103
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:11,760
how dear we are to ourselves loving caring maybe with the image of a younger

104
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:20,640
version of ourselves caring for this younger version

105
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:29,600
maybe they are sitting on our lap we hold them hug them

106
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,679
ask them if they need rest

107
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:41,200
food sleep love protection safety

108
00:33:42,559 --> 00:33:47,120
offering that wholeheartedly to ourselves

109
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:56,000
realizing all beings may be starting with all the beings

110
00:33:56,000 --> 00:34:04,559
we're practicing with right now on zoom and youtube all these beings

111
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:14,398
with the younger version of themselves sitting on their lap metaphorically they hold themselves dear

112
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:21,838
their lives are dear to them they don't want to suffer

113
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:29,760
so just as we care for ourselves hold ourselves dear and precious the

114
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:35,280
part of ourselves all of ourselves recognizing that

115
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:49,838
is true for everyone else just like me just like me

116
00:34:52,960 --> 00:35:03,838
and i am just like them no different

117
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:16,800
it's natural to hold ourselves there

118
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,240
and the support for non-harming

119
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:31,839
others

120
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:54,160
how can we hurt others if we hold ourselves dear we truly love ourselves

121
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:59,838
we know how much it hurts to be hurt

122
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:13,838
how can we inflict that upon others wish them ill

123
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:30,640
just as we wish ourselves well just as we want to be safe happy

124
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,000
healthy and have ease

125
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,359
may all beings all beings be safe

126
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:51,838
happy healthy and happy

127
00:37:57,119 --> 00:38:05,838
may all beings be well

128
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:19,838
may all beings be free

129
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,920

00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:20,480
you're welcome to share your reflections as well so yeah how was this for you what did

135
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:26,240
you notice in your practice in your practice this

136
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,839
teaching from the udana

137
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:43,838
it's all welcome especially if you haven't spoken for a while we'd love to hear from you

138
00:39:54,560 --> 00:40:00,720
while i wait for you to raise your hand and type i'll share something that came

139
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:05,760
up for me which was kind of sweet so as an example

140
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:11,680
um some point an image of a younger version of me came up sitting on my lap

141
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:19,200
and i shared that with you as an invitation and and also a song came up

142
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:24,240
there is a song by peter gabriel called the book of love

143
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:30,880
and there's a line in there says i love it when you read to me

144
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:36,240
and you can read me anything so that came up for me as a younger version of

145
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:42,560
myself saying oh i love it when you read to me so i guess i like reading books to

146
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:49,760
myself so and you just wanted to share that because that sense of the visualization the sense of tenderness giving

147
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,839
whether through words through song through just all of these are skillful means for us to really connect with

148
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:07,839
ourselves so what happened for you whether it was challenging or easy and what you noticed

149
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:17,279
janie i see your name your hand physical hand for a change here please

150
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:27,760
thank you thank you thank you yeah i had a hard time at first getting my mind quiet and um but when you said the

151
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:35,200
child i recently had run across a picture of myself you know 70 years ago and um

152
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:41,599
and i saw that child in my mind's eye and i could um have her on my knee and you know just

153
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:47,359
be there with her and tell her i loved her and you know all because some good things and so that

154
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:53,839
changed it for me lovely thank you genie it's lovely to

155
00:41:53,839 --> 00:42:00,400
hear what what was supportive and what worked is this image of our younger self great thanks for

156
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:07,040
bringing that in did that work for anyone else you're welcome to share or if that didn't work or something else did

157

tell us share your practice it's helpful for the whole sangha

158
00:42:14,079 --> 00:42:17,839
challenges and what works

159
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:31,440
one reflection coming privately for me it was hard because the only

160
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,440
person i feel like i've loved unconditionally was my daughter when she was a baby

161
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:44,400
a young child great actually that is fantastic so um

162
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:51,440
the the invitation there is to um imagine in in your meditation

163
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:58,560
to bring an image of your daughter when she was a baby as a young child and

164
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:05,359
have the sense of meta she's on your lap and then and then skillful means

165
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:13,119
bait and switch then you're the baby on your lap and the feeling of meta is going to continue unconditionally for this

166
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:18,880
being that is myself and then you will run dry after a while then you'll bring your daughter young daughter back and

167
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:25,839
says oh it's unconditional when she was a baby and just fragile and sweet and then again hold

168
00:43:25,839 --> 00:43:32,319
some bait and switch and then you're the one and you'll notice actually the the unconditional meta will flow for a while

169
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:39,040
so may i invite you to explore that yeah great thanks so much for bringing

170
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:44,880
that in appreciate it helpful for everyone anything else

171
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:51,920
any other observations and maybe it was just challenging period and that's okay

172
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:58,480
too anything about the very end when we

173
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:03,760
turned to actually notice all beings that they're just like us

174
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:11,200
just as we hold ourselves dear now says for me it was a reflection on

175
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:16,318
how everyone is at the center of their own story

176
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:23,839
yeah we are we are the center we yeah

177
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:28,880
yeah yeah and it's interesting because there are two different ways we can see that and then what you're saying is

178
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,720
absolutely true it's all about me self and yet we are dear to ourselves there's a sense of

179
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:42,160
dearness so so um i think i think both recognitions are important

180
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:48,560
uh and and in that way we also realize how much we are in the center of our own story we're the star of our story we're

181
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,839
the victim of the story or the protagonist we're

182
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:59,440
it's all about me maybe and and yet you know it's kind of interesting

183
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,160
because as i say this it almost seems like the teachings on not-self it almost seems like they're orthogonal

184
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:15,440
here but they aren't actually because the selfishness um sometimes actually comes from a sense

185
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:21,440
of scarcity as if there is not enough there there's not enough love there's not enough

186
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:27,040
goodness there isn't enough needs i need to prove myself i need to be bp so

187
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:33,839
so when actually there is a sense of contentment um and fulfillment like yes

188
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:38,880
it's yes it's okay that the sense of self actually drops

189
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:46,800
which is why the um the full expression of love the full expression of love

190
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,400
is is not self and emptiness and the full expression of emptiness is

191
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:58,319
love and compassion it might seem counterintuitive but actually

192
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:06,480
there's no um um they're not orthogonal so so much to say

193
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:13,040
about this and i'm thinking it might be good actually now to turn our attention to practice in

194
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:18,079
small groups and see what might come up and as you discuss with each other what

195
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:24,880
was challenging what was easy and um yeah practice discussions can be

196
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:34,240
quite quite juicy and productive in this way so like to invite us to um

197
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:40,800
offer ourselves offer our heart recognizing that we're all dear to we're

198
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:46,000
so dear to ourselves everybody's dear to themselves so when you are in a practice meeting with two

199
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:53,440
other people recognize that you're dear to yourself and they are dear to themselves so so i'll create the groups let's start

200
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:59,440
with 15 seconds of meta for yourself and others and see what comes up

201
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:04,240
the rooms are open enjoy

202
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:12,640
okay the rooms are closed everyone is back welcome back everyone so we have a few minutes for any

203
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:25,838
reflections that came up while you were in groups take it away why did you notice

204
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:48,319
i think diane wants to talk or diana diana you're welcome to unmute

205
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:56,079
yourself diana um this um meditation was really lovely

206
00:47:56,079 --> 00:48:01,359
this particular subject as always but it brought up something for me where i finally have a

207
00:48:01,359 --> 00:48:07,599
chance to ask a question because every time the idea of holding the child

208
00:48:07,599 --> 00:48:14,880
or being around myself as a child comes up it just brings sadness because i i don't i didn't have a happy

209
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:21,760
childhood and so i find myself then focus on something

210
00:48:21,760 --> 00:48:28,400
where it's not where i want to be and is if the idea is to to

211
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:35,359
bring warmth and a lovely and a loving feeling then then do we

212
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:41,680
bring in something else that makes us happy uh like our cat or something or another

213
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:48,800
person if that is it similar to other because bringing up the child is is not

214
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,559
um the law it would be a long distraction for me i i hear that i hear

215
00:48:54,559 --> 00:49:00,839
that and thank you so much for bringing that that in so so a couple of different things one is

216
00:49:00,839 --> 00:49:06,240
um the idea of bringing

217
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:11,440
you know which a a a someone you care about a cat a dog that's that's great

218
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:19,200
you know for for meta um it might still be helpful unless the

219
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:27,599
childhood has was so traumatic and there isn't really any any space um

220
00:49:27,599 --> 00:49:33,920
to to be with that but even if there's a little bit of space in the long term of practice in the long

221
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:40,559
run it can actually be helpful to re-parent in a way of reparenting yourself in

222
00:49:40,559 --> 00:49:47,760
to repairing to yourself little by little by little um like sweetie i'm here for you yes i

223
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,800
know it was sad i know it was hard and now i'm the adult and and

224
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:58,240
i i protect you i love you nobody's gonna hurt you now so there's a way of reparenting

225
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:04,079
ourselves in our hearts which can be so wholesome really healing

226
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:10,960
in this process um so i invite you yeah yeah i hear so just try a little

227
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:16,160
bit even though it might be sad but i'm understanding what you're saying yeah but i think the

228
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:22,240
love can be bigger than the sadness that's what i'm bringing in because the love from the adult view

229
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:28,000
can be bigger than the you know there is some there's some nuance there's some

230
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:34,640
maneuvering so don't shy away from it just because it's meet the sadness with love it becomes a

231
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:42,160
practice of compassion and it can be very powerful

232
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:47,680
okay thank you you're welcome thank you so much for bringing that in what a great

233
