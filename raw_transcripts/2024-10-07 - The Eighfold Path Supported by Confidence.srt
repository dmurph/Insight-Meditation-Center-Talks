1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:08,040
good morning it's great to be here to be here

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:16,358
at home this is uh uh my home center

3
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,880
and it's been quite a while I haven't been been here in during the morning

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:30,640
Sunday morning so it just really feels like uh I just feel very cozy and

5
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,000
and sweet so

6
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:46,000
um and so you know with that reflection of you know as I was um reflecting on on

7
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:53,480
being here today and um what was emerging emerging

8
00:00:53,480 --> 00:01:02,559
to to share to share with you I just had this moment of uh

9
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,720
memories of different teachings and and different

10
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:14,080
instances uh where it has been wonderful

11
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:21,600
to to be able to recognize the practice in my life and other times

12
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:28,320
where it has been tricky he like what is going on you know those moments of being

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:37,479
in a roller coaster and having something reminding me of the

14
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:46,600
practice and um and and the fruits that that

15
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:55,159
emerges uh the the fruits that emerge when um when there's a a sense of

16
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:02,439
confidence and trust and faith whatever however you want to call it in the

17
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:11,319
practice and one of the teachings that I realized oh in some ways it has been

18
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:16,760
there accessible or showing me showing me

19
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:24,360
where where to start or where to go or is the the novel awful

20
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,319
path and so I wanted to share with you a little bit about it um

21
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:35,840
just because also I think that we're starting or we started already the

22
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:42,959
program yeah and um it's it it just touches my heart it

23
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:50,480
just tells me how many times uh it has shown up and how it how it goes deeper

24
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:58,640
and deeper and deeper in you know in in my life in you

25
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:06,640
know as I engage in the the practice

26
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,799
um so the eight the eful

27
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:18,519
path there um is is the is is the teachings that the Buddha offered to us

28
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:24,239
in the in the Four Noble Truth as part of the four noble

29
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,519
truths and um just to briefly mention on them and

30
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:39,599
and then go deeper into the hateful path um in a very simple way um if we clean

31
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,720
we suffer that's that's one of the interpretations that I have received

32
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:52,920
from U my teachers especially Gil uh there's stress there's

33
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,239
suffering and um the one that is being addressed

34
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:05,879
through the ful path is the one that we add the one that we add as we clean as

35
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:11,280
we um clean to different aspects of our

36
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,120
lives uh and that clinging is the cause is the cause of stress the cause of

37
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,958
suffering the cause of uh

38
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,479
discomfort and there's a moment that it can

39
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:34,960
cease why wow yeah that there's a sensation of

40
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:42,880
suffering that there's a sensation of of

41
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:51,600
um even some beliefs that we need to be loyal or that we're loyal loyal to our

42
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,680
suffering to our suffering there's a sensation of it and

43
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,080
we feel it we there's something that happens within the practice when when we

44
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:10,160
continue to engage in this practice that there's a deep understanding a deep

45
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,479
release a deep penetration of of of of that

46
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:23,039
truth and then there's these four noble truth that I want to talk I want to

47
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:31,120
share with you the hateful path and I would say that it applies to

48
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:39,560
all aspects of life is one of those recipes or teachings that you can adapt

49
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,199
to anything anything that is cooking in the pot for

50
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:51,440
you so um I give you an

51
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,080
acronym Visa LMC Visa

52
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:08,400
LC and uh um is an acronym for this these um eight factors of the novel

53
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:17,960
path it starts with wise view continues with wise

54
00:06:18,039 --> 00:06:26,319
intention wise speech wise

55
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:35,439
action wise life L Hood wise

56
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:43,800
effort wise mindfulness and wise

57
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:49,840
concentration and just take a moment just to check if any of these words

58
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,479
resonated for you and just just make a note of that any of these words

59
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:03,160
resonated more than the other you I talk that about that

60
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:11,319
later so wise view you know I started I started in the practice thinking

61
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:17,960
that any way in which I would be in stress or

62
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:25,479
suffer um was part of me it was almost like a quality like

63
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:32,000
something like well this is um is part of being

64
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,160
bruny and yes there's suffering in the world there are many

65
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:44,000
things that um many causes and conditions happening there's

66
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,080
sickness there's um uh old age I'm

67
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,479
sitting on a chair today because my right knee is a little bit tricky

68
00:07:55,479 --> 00:08:02,120
today um and dying you know there all these but there were also other things

69
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:07,240
that I just couldn't get a grip in it you know all the

70
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:14,000
identities that you know I would Express in the world all you know

71
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,080
relationships work it was like I'm doing something

72
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,759
wrong and so through the practice I learned about wise

73
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:31,000
view wise view that uh actions are consequential

74
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:38,039
and that there is suffering that yes it

75
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:46,440
happens is is I'm I'm going to get old I'm going to age and I'm going to

76
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:56,120
die and there are some things we don't we don't have control over but there are other things that we that we do have uh

77
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:01,519
some agency into setting some conditions that extra suffering what we call

78
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:11,399
sometimes the the the arrow the second arrow and so wise view help us

79
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:16,839
understand that things change that things are

80
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:22,680
impermanent that there's you know not a reason

81
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:29,839
to solidify you know sometimes when we say oh this never going to change

82
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,880
it's almost like we're living in it in whatever situation it is

83
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:40,880
huh but when we see how things change and

84
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:46,000
how um how things happen that you know we

85
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,320
may have some influence but it's not is I'm not controlling how things are

86
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:58,519
happening you know there's not an independent self if I would wish what this mind would think what this mind

87
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:05,399
would experience um wow it would be quite something to be

88
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:11,800
able to choose okay today I'm going to choose to think about this and this and this and this and all that will bring

89
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:22,040
happiness to me but it's not like that right so there's change there's

90
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:27,600
inconstancy there's some things we have control other things we don't it's not

91
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,760
like there's an independence self and a vacuum we are interconnected there are causes and

92
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:38,959
conditions and there's there's Dua in different ways in different

93
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:45,399
manifestations in this life and with the practice is it's

94
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:52,959
almost like the the practice become becomes a BAL in some ways

95
00:10:52,959 --> 00:11:00,440
in when we meet these truths these

96
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,079
standings is help is is it's like it sometimes it take at least for me it has

97
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:14,279
taken me sometimes slowly but surely bruny you're seeing it is sometimes hard

98
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:21,399
to accept but you're seeing it and no I want it another way and I resist it and

99
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:29,440
I fight it and I blame and go back and forth and and then at some point this

100
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:38,839
heart and these mind surrenders surrenders to to that

101
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:45,399
understanding oh it's true yeah it's happening I have the felt

102
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:53,639
experience of these four noble truths of this wise view this

103
00:11:53,639 --> 00:12:01,079
understanding and so from there you know in that surrendering there's like a compassion that Stars arising in the

104
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:06,839
heart some it's been like that many times for

105
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:13,160
me there's a compassion there's an understanding a

106
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,839
kindness towards uh myself to our other beings

107
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,839
and the second Factor comes in hey why is

108
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,920
intention why is intention is here

109
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,480
wise intention of

110
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:43,120
um non- greed non aversion of

111
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:49,120
kindness of Good Will of compassion and of Letting

112
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,880
Go letting go of

113
00:12:56,680 --> 00:13:02,800
renunciation and you know sometimes we just have this

114
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:09,199
moment in our daily lives we see something or or something is happening

115
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:14,399
and and out of that compassion there's this

116
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:22,399
action that arises right um Gil call calls said care

117
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:30,880
anukampa I like that translation other people call it compassion in action

118
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:39,000
but there's this quivering this quivering of the heart that that in some sometimes

119
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,639
dissolve this sense of solid self and

120
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:53,399
like suddenly you're feeling compassion for someone that maybe you were

121
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:59,720
struggling with or that you love or that you may not even know but now it does

122
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:05,240
feel like you do know this being is there's this interconnection

123
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:09,880
there's this Humanity being seen being

124
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:21,199
felt and out of that compassion there may be sometimes also a

125
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:27,720
sense of Letting Go and

126
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:35,920
and a sense of uh shedding shedding all the layers

127
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:42,079
of the heart a letting go into

128
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,560
Freedom a letting go of the clinging letting go

129
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:54,079
of okay my

130
00:14:54,279 --> 00:15:01,120
view it's quite something can become very spacious out of the sou but it's

131
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:08,160
not so sou is you know you're receiving the fruits of the

132
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:16,199
practice the strength of mindfulness really letting you know Brun

133
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:21,639
is right here or de is right here you see it

134
00:15:21,639 --> 00:15:26,040
clearly it is like this right

135
00:15:26,839 --> 00:15:36,079
now and we start noticing that the body tells us it's hard to deny

136
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:42,399
it what feels wholesome and what does not feel

137
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:50,360
wholesome it's almost a checking in a tune up you know within us like of

138
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:56,199
alignment if we're disigned if we're struggling with

139
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,399
something so that's a render I like

140
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:12,240
um aan suito um one of our uh Elders in in our

141
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:17,319
tradition mentions that compassion arises when

142
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:23,399
when our hearts you know start seeing start seeing things clearly and there's

143
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:30,199
there's a sense of even of gratitude there's gratitude that floods the heart

144
00:16:30,199 --> 00:16:37,880
and compassion also arises and what is that gratitude oh my

145
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:43,839
gosh I saw it it's like Suddenly It's a discovery

146
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:49,560
you know oh yes it's wholesome oh yes it's UNH

147
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:56,880
wholesome it's like suddenly we see that there's there's a path there's a path

148
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:03,319
that we can take there's a choice a moment of

149
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:10,480
choice and like oh I didn't know I had a choice

150
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:17,400
yes even in moments of struggle there's a moment of

151
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:24,760
choice of how we relate to it and how we can relate to

152
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:31,600
it we can relate to it in a Wholesome Way with kindness with

153
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,880
compassion with

154
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:44,280
curiosity and so and then guess

155
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:51,840
what this understanding start being manifested in

156
00:17:52,919 --> 00:18:02,080
US you start talking nicely more you know like like like in more clear way or

157
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:07,200
a kind way and maybe now you're

158
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:16,799
like no don't say that don't say that so the factor of wise

159
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,400
speech starts manifesting and that's how I recognize

160
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,159
it there was something in me you know as we as I would be practicing

161
00:18:29,159 --> 00:18:35,799
that would say things that before I would not even

162
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:42,440
notice that I would be Saye or that you know would cause

163
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,600
harm so there's more um care in how we

164
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:57,519
speak in choosing the time that will be most beneficial how we say things

165
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:04,720
and so there's a change we start changing

166
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:11,600
many times people ask me so especially coming out of

167
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:18,120
retreat how do you how do you talk to other people about this practice and and

168
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,880
Retreat or the impact that it has had in you well the same way as in daily

169
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:33,880
life the practice changes you and you start behaving a little bit

170
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,320
differently and people notice and we

171
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:47,840
notice the speaking is through your actions of body speech and mind but you

172
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,960
know there's something happening it happened to me sometimes with people

173
00:19:52,960 --> 00:20:00,440
will say what so what's going on I say well same as you know there are some things are keep going on and happen in

174
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:07,400
my life and other things new things and uh some things are okay other things

175
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:15,600
not so okay and here I am it's okay and I don't feel great today but

176
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:22,679
you know I'm here or whatever it's like but what is going on I remember my mother asking me but what

177
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:29,440
is going on there are some people that really have laser you know like no no no

178
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:39,000
no what is going on so the practice changes you and it will

179
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:47,000
change it will it will have an impact in your relationship with different

180
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:51,200
beings how you're relating the

181
00:20:52,159 --> 00:21:00,640
world and so let's see and then we go going to wise action

182
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:10,200
that I already started talking about and why action actually expands it

183
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,559
give us a framework a

184
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:24,200
guideline another path of how to act through the five

185
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:30,400
precepts sometimes eight in on retreat but the five precepts

186
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:36,919
guidelines guidelines that help us

187
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:44,320
um support us of being in community support us in our lives in causing

188
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,519
causing um in preventing preventing

189
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:58,279
harm the the guidelines the precepts the trainings I love tigan used to call is

190
00:21:58,279 --> 00:22:03,440
still calls it the trainings because his

191
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:09,400
teachings are still with us

192
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:14,520
so the five precepts of

193
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:22,440
um um not

194
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,278
killing not um

195
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:36,679
not engaging into false speech

196
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:42,760
um not engaging in sexual

197
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,200
misconduct um

198
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:56,399
and let's see what are the other

199
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:08,480
um oh thank you not taking what is not given and not Cloud the mind with in

200
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:15,279
toxicant and so you know when I heard these precepts at the

201
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:23,200
beginning of my practice it was like there are too many NOS here he's like don't do this and don't

202
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,559
do that and you know there was a sense of

203
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:33,679
Con well I know that you know I know

204
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:39,840
that but there are moments just like this hateful path there are moments in

205
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:46,679
the practice that there are some words that click and there are other words that do

206
00:23:46,679 --> 00:23:56,159
not and at the beginning I show to take the no

207
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:01,760
out and then make it positive POS you know it has to be positive or something

208
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:11,760
like that but as I went deeper into the practice wo they were moments that I took that no

209
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:19,158
back not because it was negative but because it was a

210
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:27,039
protection it was like don't go there just don't go there and sometimes

211
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:34,799
we need it sometimes we need a dear friend a Cita friend saying to us don't go

212
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:41,919
there or hold me because you know I'm it I may

213
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:48,520
cause some harm so the precepts are like that and

214
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:54,120
my goodness if we can follow at least

215
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:59,679
one precept and everyone will do

216
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:04,720
it sh this will be a different world just

217
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:10,679
with one you can choose you can choose any of

218
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:18,520
them I would choose now wi speech you know but all of them all all

219
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:26,360
of the precepts support support our practice so wise

220
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:32,840
action I sleep better I sleep better with that precept when I when I review

221
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:37,919
my actions like the at the end of the day it's like okay how was the day

222
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:44,000
today and like oh okay this happen oh maybe that okay I do better next time on

223
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:51,440
this one and okay it's a great it's a great factor of the eful

224
00:25:52,440 --> 00:26:00,320
path and so then we go into wise livelihood and you see how all these

225
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:06,720
factors integrate each other to live in a way that supports ourselves support

226
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,320
others and support everyone and support

227
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:19,039
everyone how it is that we relate how it is that we use resources

228
00:26:19,039 --> 00:26:25,640
how it is that we give and receive the practice of

229
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:30,880
generosity how it is that with think ahead of

230
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:38,919
time oh yeah yeah how it is that for me keeps me out

231
00:26:38,919 --> 00:26:42,919
of the field of per

232
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:49,960
Perfection because I cannot

233
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,640
do I cannot do everything I would love to do to you

234
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,840
know to uh

235
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:09,279
support uh you know billions of people but I can see what I can do in

236
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:15,880
this moment I can see how my actions could be a domino

237
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:23,600
effect into the well-being of everyone or a small group of people

238
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:29,399
or a small group of beings or or the of this planet

239
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:45,960
and so then we go into wise

240
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,559
effort wise effort and I will be uh brief on this

241
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:59,320
one because this has been brought up many times in the past teachings

242
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:05,279
here but it comes to what is wholesome and what is UN wholesome and how it is

243
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:14,279
that we can we can support what is wholesome and we can decrease what is UNH

244
00:28:14,279 --> 00:28:21,679
wholesome with wise effort we start learning and understanding how it

245
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:30,440
is that we can prevent and we can abandon actions and habits of

246
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:35,919
mind that create more UNH wholesome or

247
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:42,519
unskillful actions and then we have

248
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:51,080
the wholsome through cultivating cultivating and

249
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:59,480
maintaining states of mind and actions that support us that bring us peace ease

250
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:09,120
including ease in the disase ease when what we are knowing is UNH

251
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,799
wholesome but just in that knowing there could be a way a wise way

252
00:29:15,799 --> 00:29:22,518
to relate to what is happening

253
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:37,480
why is effort is something we tune in is is is is one of these companions in the

254
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,760
practice and sometimes we know okay today we need more I I I need more

255
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:54,039
effort I need to apply more effort into inclining the mind to a path

256
00:29:54,039 --> 00:30:01,640
of freedom and those moments are moments of

257
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:10,440
grief moments of struggle moments of

258
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:17,039
um confusion moments in which we don't have

259
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:23,000
a lot of energy but there's something that we may

260
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,000
have

261
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:35,720
and is the conviction in this

262
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:44,960
practice if in those moments we can

263
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:51,159
remember how this practice have has supported

264
00:30:51,159 --> 00:31:01,120
us just that memory may be enough to Incline the

265
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:08,919
mind to shift it just one

266
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:14,960
degree to reach out to community to reach out to the

267
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:22,880
teachings to remember our ancestors and the qualities that remind us of our

268
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:30,519
inner Buddha our beautiful qualities within

269
00:31:30,519 --> 00:31:36,240
us that make us remind also of our

270
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:43,760
teachers so in those moments in which oh I don't

271
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:49,480
know what oh I don't know what to do I don't know how to do or how to engage just

272
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:56,360
remember your conviction your confidence in the practice and just show up on a

273
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:03,399
Sunday morning or any other day or just click that Zoom

274
00:32:03,799 --> 00:32:13,000
link and then there are other times that effort is just you know not so much to apply

275
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:19,799
but just to receive the practice letting the practice guiding

276
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:28,159
us you been you you you start being practiced

277
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:38,360
and so then we then continue we meet

278
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:43,399
mindfulness why is mindfulness but mindfulness is in all these factors in

279
00:32:43,399 --> 00:32:50,039
one way or another mindfulness and we see very

280
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:56,760
basic we can go back to the body wherever you are on retreat at work in

281
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:03,840
the bathroom thriving eating you name it mindfulness of the body checking in

282
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:12,519
anytime what's going on here okay touching oh sharpness oh tightness oh

283
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:18,639
expansion oh tingling okay pleasant

284
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:25,840
unpleasant neither one I don't know okay feeling

285
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:34,120
tone was the attitude in the mind oh it's open

286
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:41,480
Curious yeah there's a little one thing oh there's compassion there's

287
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:48,320
connection oh and what reminds you this oh I just feel so

288
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:57,200
happy oh wow what a good fortune oh the Brahma viharas oh interconnectedness

289
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:06,320
that take maybe a minute checking in with the four foundations of

290
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:12,480
mindfulness and then it goes deeper that mindfulness goes deeper than we just

291
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:22,480
naturally start seeing Oh this is wholesome this is mindfulness and investigation working

292
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:33,280
together and so then we get to the eighth factor which is

293
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,200
Samari or unification collectiveness of

294
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:45,638
Mind concentration and I will say that this

295
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:53,839
factor I I I met this Factor this Factor found me as a fruit of this

296
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:59,520
practice as a fruit of the practice

297
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:07,240
I was averse to concentration for quite a

298
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:13,720
while because I didn't like that it will you know like they sometimes it was like

299
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:19,200
oh I have these moments of being here very present and absorbing what I'm

300
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:28,440
doing but then it goes away and I'm like that's not worth it w talking about

301
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:35,640
talking about Corruptions in the in the practice and misunderstanding and

302
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:43,720
delusion it's just amazing to see how it is that as we

303
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:53,680
practice with you know an openness of showing up things become clearer and

304
00:35:54,000 --> 00:36:00,079
clearer the the ability to to J just rest in the

305
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:06,160
breath being nourished at the with the breath being nourished by this

306
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:11,319
practice wow I thought that coming to this practice was getting rid of

307
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:19,400
suffering but this other part of being nourished and become wiser and having

308
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:26,680
more joy and and and a sense of lasting

309
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:33,920
well-being blew me away it's like oh my gosh this

310
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:41,280
is much more this is much more that what I

311
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:50,119
thought so this dear mind is

312
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:58,440
malleable it's not that you know it's something that is Stu so call

313
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:04,079
it in one way of being however you call

314
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:09,240
whatever you call the mind I will not go into details about that but you know

315
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:17,599
there's there's this this sense that you know sometimes we just put ourselves in

316
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:23,040
a box and so my encouragement you know

317
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,839
with this sharing of of these teachings is that is is that you know that there's

318
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:36,160
so many ways in which you can access this practice and if there's a moment if

319
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:42,079
which you don't know what you know well I don't know bruny those are too many factors well remember at the beginning

320
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:47,319
when I say oh see if there's any word that

321
00:37:47,319 --> 00:37:54,280

322
00:37:54,280 --> 00:38:01,800
post it somewhere at home look at it and see which words resonates for you and go

323
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:08,240
there that's the one that's the

324
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:15,200
one so the noble hateful path a path that support us in

325
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:22,839

326

327
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:37,160

is is available to you and some of these factors may be already within your

330
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:59,760
practice and you don't have to you know I'm offering them now in a linear way

331
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:07,800
when we start practicing with them it's nice to do it in a linear way but you see what works for

332
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:13,480
you it could be a circle it could be a triangle of the Eightfold paths I don't

333
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:18,520
know it's just however whatever works for

334
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:29,720
you so let me close with this quote from aanu Cheo because is it

335
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:39,280
it it also complements the full path and is is about conviction and faith and

336
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,440
confidence and this dear

337
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:53,319

340
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:14,160

341
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:19,640
confidence we frame it with

342
00:40:19,720 --> 00:40:25,720
mindfulness and we wield it with

343
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:34,520
energy we fir met up with Samari so that we can review all things

344
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:42,760
with discernment I repeat it without

345
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:49,280
commentary we pour our mind and awareness into the vehicle of

346
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:55,319

348
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:09,960
