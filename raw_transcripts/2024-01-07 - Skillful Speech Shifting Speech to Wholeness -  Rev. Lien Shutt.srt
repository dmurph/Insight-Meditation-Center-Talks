40
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:41,960
of one of these book so I should say I'm here uh my name is uh Reverend kti lad

42
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,880
on aloney land here yes okay uh meant to look at up and forgot and um Gil um was

43
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:02,840
kind enough and gracious enough to be at Bookshop with me at the one of the readings of my book back in November

44
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:10,280
home is here practicing anti-racism with the engage for Noble Truths oh no sorry

45
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:17,319
the engage hatful path we've changed the subtitle um anyone was here for that per

46
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:22,600
chance no one okay there few all right um there are a lot of people there but

47
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:31,120
different people obviously um so um he asked me to come and uh give a talk about the book and so um this meditation

48
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:39,759
or reflection visualization uh came about when I was literally feeling a mango a while back

49
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,840
not few weeks ago and um I peel mango

50
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:53,600
I'm right-handed I feel mango the skin towards me and I had a memory about how one time

51
00:05:53,600 --> 00:06:00,319
I was doing that and um a white woman said to me that is wrong

52
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:06,680
that is so unsafe you should not peel with a knife towards you that's if you

53
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:12,880
slip you hurt yourself you should peel away from you and I was like okay but I

54
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:19,560
continue to peel because this is you know how I was taught right maybe I brought a little more mindfulness and

55
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:25,080
carefulness to it um and then I um when this time when I was doing it I

56
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,199
remembered that I used to have a hang out with a friend um in the Vancouver BC

57
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:38,440
area who's from Malawi and uh one time when I was peeling a mango my way my way

58
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:45,000
she um said oh this is how we peel it in Malawi and so she took the mango and

59
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:51,120
with a knife did those lines and then with her you know finger just peeled it

60
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:56,599
off and so um to me it's a a way of

61
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:03,280
understanding how each of us are conditioned all the time this book is basically

62
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:09,360
about how um we are conditioned uh

63
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:17,680
especially in the system of white supremacy culture to um inhabit or take certain

64
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,080
places within the system with oppression system in general but very specifically

65
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,319
about race here and very specifically from the Asian-American

66
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:33,520
perspective um because there isn't a lot out there especially in the Buddhist

67
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,280
world right and so a lot of it has to do with how we

68
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:48,400
were conditioned and in our location how then do we um come to understand um how

69
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:55,080
to accept other ways of being or not right and and by that acceptance isn't

70
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:02,599
has to be some you know like rejection lock the door you know black go in the back or whatever it can

71
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:10,280
be other ways that are unconscious right or um maybe maybe you could say more

72
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:17,080
mild all right so with that I'm going to um and and maybe I should just say since

73
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:22,120
most of you weren't at the book reading is this book um rose out of a

74
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:29,000
response um the first response was in 2017 I was at a Generation X teacher

75
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,880
conf conference and uh another round of sexual misconduct had come to light in

76
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:41,959
various um Buddhist communities in in North America and um so at this

77
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:47,760
conference um they brought in right use of power as a restorative model who here

78
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:54,080
knows right use of power okay it's look it up Cedar Baro really about um up

79
00:08:54,080 --> 00:09:02,120
power and down power I mention it a little bit in here really useful and I really appreciate it it um H and yet it

80
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:08,079
got me thinking that in my career and in Buddhism um I've been to a lot of

81
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:13,320
trainings you know and um always something else was brought in for

82
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:19,480
conflict resolution or any of that and um I was like well what what in

83
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:26,399
Buddhism uh can we have that as a restorative model and so with the support of the

84
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:34,320
Hamera Foundation which is a Buddhist Foundation I've been developing the four noble truths to be a restorative model

85
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,920
so in that model the um first Noble Truth you know in life there's Dua um

86
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:47,079
starts out with that um there is harm and harming has happened because to

87
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:54,160
restore anything we have to begin that something has been broken right so much

88
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,880
a conflict I will say is about defining that

89
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:05,040
I've heard of many divorces where it's defining who hurts who in what way and

90
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,480
then that from there what kind of resolution uh Wars are about who has

91
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:17,320
hurt whom in what way and and and when we can have some in my sense um when we

92
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:24,600
when there's conflict when we can have some sense of you know where we could meet that we could at least start to say

93
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,600
this is the issue that needs restoration that's how restoration begins otherwise

94
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:37,519
it's just conflict so that's that's why it starts with that and then second Noble Truth is

95
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:43,560
usually it's you know their causes or the origins of Dua um and in the engaged

96
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:51,279
version it's that um understanding fully the causes and conditions for the rising

97
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:57,880
of hurt and harm so um similar to the the the

98
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:05,079
classic one however we focus a bit more on the um systemic

99
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:12,120
conditions uh for instance in racism I know that um for many years when a

100
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:18,120
racist incident happened to me um mostly my response is why are they being so

101
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:25,040
mean to me what did I do right and until I took ethnic studies by the way I'm

102
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:32,040
adopted I lived I'm from Vietnam I lived overseas until I was well I came to the

103
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:38,160
US when I was n and a half for like a year and a half then I went to Egypt and didn't come back till I was a teenager

104
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,560
right so I didn't understand the structure of racism in the United States

105
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,600
but once I understood that then I realized oh it's not it's not so personal I mean the the effect is

106
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,959
personal without a doubt the impact but there's a whole system that is creates

107
00:11:55,959 --> 00:12:03,720
that and so it's a systemic thing and it depers personalizes a lot it actually lowers my sense again not that the

108
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:09,360
individual impact isn't important and valid but it also gives me this wider

109
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,959
sense that one I'm not alone and two um and that there there many pieces that

110
00:12:15,959 --> 00:12:22,760
come into being and therefore there are many pieces that um Can rectify the

111
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:27,839
issue and essentially the premise of this book

112
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:34,720
is that um we the second Noble Truth is that these are all things that were conditioned right that the the suffering

113
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:41,959
part like course certain things dooka dooka is just part of life but the dooka that we can do something about is the

114
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:49,079
things that we've learned um we were taught at times in a way that um

115
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:57,040
was understood to be for our safety or for our good right our parents do that

116
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:02,480
um I know in Vietnam M um you know uh my

117
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:08,000
mother would ask us to move aside when a GI was coming towards us or group of

118
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:15,959
GIS black children children of color are taught many things to be aware of around

119
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:22,120
um white body people blue body or cop body people

120
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:29,760
right so these are things that are taught and and the idea is that what is um and also white bodies taught who

121
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,360
might be safe to you or not right and so what we need to do is examine that and

122
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:41,079
then think now is this a truth that works for me not only like now as in

123
00:13:41,079 --> 00:13:49,480
this year 2024 but also where I live I'm an adult now I have more agency so the

124
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:57,000
third Noble Truth is where do we find agency even in the midst of Duca right

125
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:03,240
in the midst of hurt and arm and then the last of course is the eight-fold

126
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:08,480
path so um in this version um the eful

127
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:15,040
path I've re structured them a little bit but I'll just say I'll just leave that for now um because I wanted to talk

128
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:20,320
a bit about um one of the chapters about how we can

129
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:26,320
restore um maybe I'll just say in general the book is laid down three ways

130
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:31,360
and um it it parallels or it echoes um

131
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:39,279
what I see as three essential aspects of healing from trauma racism is certainly

132
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:45,040
a a trauma other oppressions are trauma um and that is and and I would

133
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:52,519
say this is in general right acknowledging what is is the first step again towards restoration so much of our

134
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:57,839
practice actually it's the first number truth acknowledging what is now I like

135
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:03,399
acknowledging because because it's not just knowledge it's

136
00:15:03,399 --> 00:15:09,279
really investigating the knowledge how you know the knowledge and in fact the

137
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:15,959
practice instruction of the first Noble Truth is to investigate that's why we want to be curious we want to lean into

138
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:22,000
it we want to go and explore it further right is't that true you come here you think oh I'm going to get them

139
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,440
instruction how to avoid my suffering but if you stay for any length of the time we're asking you to look at it sure

140
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,680
we give you tools and the aold path gives you lots of great tools for how to

141
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:40,040
be to identify more and more clearly what is your Duca and to build a

142
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:46,160
capacity to be with it right then knowing what shifts are especially

143
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:51,959
needed right skillful thinking or skillful motivation skillful effort

144
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:59,800
skillful mindfulness skillful speech are under this category and in this book I frame it as the first acknowledging is

145
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,800
seeing the world as it is that's hard second is what the world needs

146
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:11,880
now and then the third is learning how to put those shifts into practice I

147
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:20,000
think it's really Buddhist practice is not a passive practice we we do a lot of you

148
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:28,519
know a lot of people go oh you just sit there in fact you know when I ordained my um uncle my adopted Mother's old

149
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:34,079
older brother they're my mother was already 48 when I was adopted at 8 so

150
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:41,399
they're you know pre pre- civil rights generation for sure and he came to my ordination

151
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:47,800
and um he he was like uh well one he said do you guys have to chant like that

152
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:54,079
have anyone been here to a Zen we chant very monotone right and the idea

153
00:16:54,079 --> 00:17:00,399
supposedly is that we chant in monotone because um then there's no you know you chant melodically the Buddha says

154
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,640
supposedly that then you start compare to each other right oh he sounds better I sound worse or I sound better he

155
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:11,839
sounds worse or vice versa right and so supposedly in Zen we just I'm monotone

156
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:17,520
so we don't arise comparison and then he also said well you know just you're just

157
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:23,120
Naval gazing why you just Naval gazing what do you do in the world H and so

158
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,120
it's useful um especially in restoration that we actually

159
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:36,440
um put shifts into practice it it's not enough to know what is the impact of

160
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,640
harm or to know what is your responsibility from the upow position

161
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:49,600
for instance it's that what are you going to do about it how are you going to put those into effect right and so

162
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:54,919
here it's realizing the wholeness of the world which is skillful I call it in

163
00:17:54,919 --> 00:18:00,559
acting which um is my reframing I think it's Kyra duel lingo who said that I

164
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:06,799
rearranged the furniture of the eful path um to skillful in acting um from

165
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:14,840
action because to me an acting gives um a sense much more of the vow to do

166
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:21,080
something essentially the the skillful action is the five precepts right and so

167
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:26,200
by when we say an acting we to me there's a vow that I'm going to do

168
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:32,880
something I'm going to put into action and also laws and policies are enacted so it gives it that systemic kind of

169
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:38,120
framing also and then lastly in the realizing the wholeness of the world is

170
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:46,280
that they're skillful living how do we use our energy especially after um examining and

171
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:53,360
realizing what the shifts are and when we do these shifts we actually find a lot more energy isn't that true because

172
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:59,600
what what happens is we realize a certain thinking that we were taught

173
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:07,880
certain views that we were taught brought with it a lot of tightness and if we can understand and make the shifts

174
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:14,280
from practice then we we find a lot more energy and so what do we do with this energy we keep on

175
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:20,559
validating what we value and hold to be true right essentially restoration to me

176
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:27,600
is that some sense of our wisdom our values that we thought we agreed upon

177
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,760
like not kill in right um not stealing not misusing

178
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,480
sexuality uh not stealing not lying and no

179
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:46,840
intoxicants right those are the main five right that these are values that we hold and how do we enact them so that's

180
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:52,120
essentially the the framing of the AIL path so I today I wanted to talk about

181
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:59,320
skillful speech which is in the uh shifting part

182
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:08,280
so this is chapter seven shifting speech to

183
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:15,520
wholeness I am in a practice period a 90-day Meditation Retreat at at convert

184
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:23,360
Soo Zen Monastery where I've been living for three years I'm part of the Doan Rio a

185
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:30,360
selected group of senior practitioners who are in charge of organizing all the activities in the

186
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,039
Zeno or meditation Hall this position involves tasks such

187
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:41,840
as letting people know when to come to medit meditate and how to participate in

188
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:47,640
ceremonies leading chants and leading the serving teams during

189
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:54,200
oroke Zen formal eating in the Zeno a white Mill teacher is leading the

190
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:00,480
this practice period as is part of the format of any Soo Zen intensive

191
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:06,559
session each practitioner goes to see the leader of the Intensive for a formal

192
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:14,039
Doan a Zen word for a one-on-one interview about your practice with the Abbot of the

193
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:20,640
temple meeting with the leader one time is mandatory after which it is up to the

194
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:26,400
discussion of the student or teacher to decide if more meetings are

195
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:32,640
needed the format for doosan I had been trained in thus far was to bring in a

196
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:39,159
question to the teacher that was about a teaching Point one's practice or how

197
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:45,760
practice can support a life difficulty on this occasion being the

198
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:53,559
first meeting with this person I didn't know I didn't have a question for him so

199
00:21:53,559 --> 00:22:00,039
I asked him if he had one for me he did

200
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:07,559
I've been watching you you go around looking glum a lot what's going

201
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:15,640
on I answered I'm having a lot of body issues some of it is overw work as head

202
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:21,279
Gardener the past two and a half years but most of it is that I'm having a hard

203
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:29,559
time with the racism that's happening here at the monastery he answered

204
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:36,720
you need to not think about yourself so much you should focus on taking care of

205
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:43,400
others I looked at him baffled I just started to share a pain

206
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,880
that was a result of the impact of systemic oppression and without having

207
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:54,120
had any discussion with me this is what he had as

208
00:22:54,120 --> 00:23:02,840
advice I paused then said you don't even know me how can you say that as an

209
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:09,640
Asian-American woman my whole life is thinking about other

210
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,679
people I've been taught to always put other people's needs

211
00:23:14,679 --> 00:23:20,720
first and what does that have to do with my experiences of racism here anyways

212
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:26,720
the glum part right your practice he says your practice as a Doan is to take

213
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:32,000
care of the SA a community of practitioners so you should put so you

214
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,679
should be putting the S needs first he asserted as he had completely ignored my

215
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:45,840
point twice now the subject of racism and its impact on me and thus my

216
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:53,520
practice I realized this was going to go nowhere so I politely bowed out of the

217
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:59,640
room on one level the Abbot was correct

218
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:06,240
as a Doan my role was to focus on making sure members in the practice period were

219
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:13,240
taken care of around the forms a Zen word for appropriate conduct in the

220
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:22,480
various ceremonies and skills that are part of Soo Zen practice however he did not act in

221
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:29,440
context his Focus would limit it to being an authority and thus

222
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,720
commanding it is true that the Abbott as the leader of the practice period was

223
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:40,399
technically everyone's boss however if you have a boss with

224
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:46,399
whom the only interactions are about how you should do your job how good a

225
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:52,159
relationship would you have with that boss this wasn't simply about

226
00:24:52,159 --> 00:25:00,559
professionalism and job responsibilities I was trying to share how racism was impacting my ability to

227
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:06,240
practice which I would argue also had a profound effect on how well I could do

228
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:13,039
my job because he was in a position of authority and he believed the job I had

229
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:19,039
to do was what was most important he did not listen to me and what I was trying

230
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,919
to share to the Abbot racism was irrelevant

231
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:30,600
to my practice and he only focus focus on how he thought my glumness affected

232
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:36,559
my ability to do my job well in retrospect it's a little bit

233
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:44,559
creepy somebody watching me all this time in the system of racism white

234
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:50,279
people's point of view is centered bipac are people of the global

235
00:25:50,279 --> 00:26:00,080
majority voices and points of view are considered less than from unimportant at the minimum to

236
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:06,120
irrelevant also to me there was an intersectionality of Oppression in this

237
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:12,320
situation I doubt he would have pointed out to a male body that they look

238
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:17,679
glum the predominant stereotype of Asian and Asian-American women is that we

239
00:26:17,679 --> 00:26:21,519
should always be smilingly

240
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:30,120
accommodating additionally he did not know me only what he interpreted by

241
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:37,600
watching me we had never interacted until that moment if he had been my

242
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,360
teacher or was a person I had a relationship with the result would

243
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:48,520
likely have been different the Abbot on several levels

244
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:54,960
ignored the context of the situation focusing only on his authority

245
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,039
and what he deemed important the priority in his style of

246
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:08,919
communication was not about connection or context to live from liberatory agency

247
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:15,399
in holess we need to shift not just our perspective but also the ways we

248
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:22,440
interact with each other and the world let's explore how skillful means

249
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:28,520
excuse me explore skillful means to do so as we um talk about

250
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:35,080
skillful speech so remember that the eight full path or the eight of them are

251
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:44,320
broken up into three sections right the first is called the wisdom section and it's skillful by the way the traditional

252
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:52,039
translation uh is right and and I did read that um right is in appropriate and

253
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:57,080
that the analogy is that you know if you go up to a cow and you want to get milk

254
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:02,480
the right way is to pull the utter not the tail so that kind of right right

255
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:10,519
that's that's what they mean by right however we we tend to think of right and wrong so that's why um very popular for

256
00:28:10,519 --> 00:28:17,720
a while and think so much now is wise right in terms of all the eful path I myself like skillful because it um and I

257
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:25,200
to me the the Elegance of the AAL path is it actually tells you what is wholesome or skillful classic wording is

258
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:30,519
also wholesome and then it gives you skills to develop those so that's why

259
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:36,600
I'm using skillful for the Eightfold Path okay so the first is skillful view or skillful understanding and it's very

260
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:44,000
specific of the four noble truths and of Karma and then there's skillful thinking

261
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:50,559
is usually uh very classic uh intention is also and I like motivation because

262
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:56,399
motivation for me um because thinking in Buddhism is never passive you're

263
00:28:56,399 --> 00:29:02,519
thinking propels you to the next section which is usually called the ethical

264
00:29:02,519 --> 00:29:10,039
conduct skillful speech skillful action and skillful livelihood um and so to me

265
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:15,320
um motivation takes us into the next section and the ethical conduct I like

266
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:20,480
to call it compassionate connection or compassionate conduct because it's the

267
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:26,360
interactive part right how we speak and how we interact with each other how we

268
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:31,960
live with each other um and then the last is um skillful

269
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:37,919
effort skillful mindfulness and skillful concentration usually call the amadi or

270
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:44,440
from Gil I learned I have heard him say that it's uh actually the uh

271
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:49,799
developmental both the emotional and mental Developmental and it's often well

272
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:55,840
it's put at the third it's often consider the bridge between the wisdom

273
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:03,880
section and the compassionate conduct we use the meditative factors to um reflect

274
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:10,159
right on how the two are working out you sit down and you think oh am I living in

275
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:15,279
accordance to my values my wisdom which is really your values right the the in

276
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:20,519
Buddhism as I understand it the a the Four Noble Truth is your set of values

277
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:26,360
right of how you view the world and then your thinking is how you process that

278
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:31,519
and how it motivates you to to act in the world so you sit down and you

279
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:37,480
meditate to see oh is that in accordance or you sit down and you maybe just had a

280
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:43,519
fight with somebody and so you ooh my speech how does it you know sure we all

281
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:49,960
think we sit down and especially in Zen we're just you know being with things as they are but I know if I just had a

282
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:56,639
fight I sit down and I like you know think it through and try to you know so

283
00:30:56,639 --> 00:31:03,639
it's working out right so in this section then if we think about it not

284
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:11,639
just as ethical conduct as some kind of morality but really how do we interact with each other then are we interacting

285
00:31:11,639 --> 00:31:19,039
in a way that Fosters wholeness that Foster a sense that we're

286
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:25,639
interconnected now um skillful speech is a great section in the AIL path because

287
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:30,919
it gives us very clear um it gives us four factors on how to have skillful

288
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:39,039
speech um and why there are four of them they're set up into two sets so the classic wording is wholesome excuse me

289
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:45,159
UNH wholesome or wholesome right um and so uh let's see the classic ones are

290
00:31:45,159 --> 00:31:52,559
let's see how do they frame it because I rearranged the furniture there too so let me pull up the classic for you um

291
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:57,840
the classic is abstaining from lying abstaining from

292
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:04,279
speech that divides abstaining from harsh or abusive speech and abstaining from Idol chatter who would like to

293
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:10,039
recite those back to me kind of hard huh so I like acronyms

294
00:32:10,039 --> 00:32:16,440
so I just I made up an acronym so we can have remember them more easily also then

295
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:22,440
put a little positive spin on it so the acronym is tugs like a little tug in

296
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:30,279
your sleeve to remind you hey skillful speech is like this h so T is for

297
00:32:30,279 --> 00:32:38,679
truthful and truthfulness is very layered in context um for instance um we most often

298
00:32:38,679 --> 00:32:44,559
think of Truth as being about facts and information you know we've heard just

299
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:50,880
the facts please but facts can be manipulated or wrong as we are hearing a

300
00:32:50,880 --> 00:33:00,120
lot about these days right in social media um and um it can facts can deny

301
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:09,120
hurt and harm for instance you know around when this book was being written um when the um Atlanta shooting of the

302
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:15,799
spa shooting in Atlanta and how then the um Sheriff I think it was a sheriff yep

303
00:33:15,799 --> 00:33:21,960
spokesman um said that the shooter was just having a bad day even though eight

304
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:28,000
people were killed six of them were Asian uh an Asian-American Wom

305
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,000
women so um facts are not just facts

306
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:40,760
they're not really objective and in um journalist you know journalism is starting to really sense that there's no

307
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:49,240
OB objectivity because we all bring a lens and in Buddhism the more and more you practice the more you realize

308
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:58,200
99.999% of the time you are just projecting because everything is associative we do not see see this as

309
00:33:58,200 --> 00:34:05,559
just this right what right most of us see this and what

310
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:11,158
you most of us here who speak who would say it in English would say a glass but

311
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:19,358
some of you might already say more than that you would say oh this is a glass mostly filled this is a I'm sitting

312
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:26,079
going this is a dirty glass right because I see some some stuff not not in a bad way just just noticing these

313
00:34:26,079 --> 00:34:32,158
things right right um this is a heavy glass I don't

314
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:39,760
like this glass It's Too Tall it's too heavy it's too whatever right we don't just see it as it is and leave it

315
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,919
alone we see it we make all sorts of Association about oh I have a glass just like that at home oh that's a nice glass

316
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:56,200
I'll go get one I wonder how much it costs I wonder where they got it right it just goes on and on so so truth right

317
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:01,680
is really layered and with oppressions truth is really that much

318
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:09,320
more layered because it's about safety I know before I came out back in the 80s you know on the weekend thing you know

319
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:15,079
on Monday at work people would say well what did you do for the weekend and I for many years would be using the

320
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:21,880
pronoun he even though I was a lesbian but it just wasn't safe in my in my

321
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:28,160
places of work at at times so truth is very layered

322
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:35,200
I'm supposed to read this part ah as oppressed people we have to reflect on how we may have been taken on valuing

323
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:40,720
white centered dominant Society idea of what is considered significant truth

324
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:47,640
over our own if so we need to work with it shifting internalized White Center views

325
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:54,040
into ways that make sense to us in our lived experiences of course we do need to be

326
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:59,520
mindful it doesn't mean we can say whatever we want at any time another way

327
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:06,800
to put it is how can we reenter truth to be more inclusive of our complex

328
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:13,480
experiences in contemporary life and more specifically as oppression

329
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:21,440
liberated people I forgot that the my um example is about also how even though

330
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:26,880
you know in the Bay Area we think we're very open about um being you know people

331
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:34,599
being queer um and yet in I know in still in a lot of Asian Asian-American

332
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:39,839
communities um it isn't always safe to be out to your family your family

333
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:48,160
everyone knows usually but um they don't want to talk about it and so I know that a lot of um uh interracial couples that

334
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:55,760
can be a real conflict um that you know you perhaps non-asian Partners would

335
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,119
think well you're not you know accepting me by in introducing me to your family

336
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:07,839
as your you know partner or girlfriend or whatever see so it's very layered now

337
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:14,240
tugs we on to you is for uplifting right and and in particular in

338
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:23,280
this book I'm bringing in uplifting as not only how do we talk in a way that uplifts each other but also um as we've

339
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:31,119
internalized either racism or home homophobia or sexism or ableism or fism

340
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,200
all sorts of internalized ISM how do we work with that especially when we're in

341
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:44,640
that category all right G is for

342
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:52,240
gentle it's actually really hard to be gentle when you've been conditioned to

343
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:59,040
be defensive and with oppressions we are conditioned to be offensive all of us

344
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:04,800
racism right when I even bring up the word racism probably anybody in the room would probably start to

345
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:10,640
go because we're all like uh-uh right and that is part of the our conditioning

346
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:16,400
that we should not be talking about racism or that it's going to be painful

347
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,720
and this is why it's really hard to

348
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:30,200
approach understanding places and which we were taught to actually not bring our

349
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:36,800
attention to to give it validity some of us don't have a choice

350
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:43,200
because we lived in in those areas right and yet part of our practice is not only

351
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:52,200
opening up to where we're unconscious about our you know you could say everyday suffering our own and

352
00:38:52,599 --> 00:38:58,520
personal generalized suffering but also our the specific spe ity of our lives

353
00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:04,119
and the systemic kind of specificity and so I know you know when

354
00:39:04,119 --> 00:39:09,359
I first started meditation and actually started out in the Insight tradition and

355
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:17,720
um uh I went to a women of color group um that was off of Spirit Rock and um

356
00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:26,520
for for a while and then one of the teachers said to me oh I want you to do meta recitation regularly and in

357
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:32,280
particular to use um I say my my favorite is or this is how I always say

358
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:39,079
it still is um May I know inner and outer safety now safety can be in met

359
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:44,440
classically in meta phrases or in karuna phrases right but she very specifically

360
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:51,880
asked me to include that as one of my meta phrases because there's obviously a lot of safety issues for me right and I

361
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:57,760
did it but it was very hard and I have met many many people of color queers um

362
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:07,040
other oppressed people where meta is really really hard right because it takes um that kind

363
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:13,599
of unconditional friendliness to all that you are we many of us some

364
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:19,880
sometimes think of meta just like going oh be nice be nice but really meta is

365
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:26,119
a really difficult practice because one remember in all the Brahma baharas we're

366
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:33,079
going to the point of something maybe simple to expanding it in all Direction

367
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:38,680
and all time and all things right and for most of us yeah I could be meta

368
00:40:38,680 --> 00:40:45,640
towards you know that uh I have a college degree that I'm 55 that I'm you

369
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:53,800
know I like my clothes today but oh uh meta that I um you know I don't know

370
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:59,040
maybe someone's looking at me and going like this right and I'm like oh do I have food in

371
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:04,480
my teeth am I going to have meta towards food in my teeth right now I'm making this up right now so that's why

372
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:09,839
that's a really silly example but you know it's harder right I mean in fact

373
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:15,040
yesterday you know I gave a Dharma talk and there was something I wasn't that happy the way I said it and then this

374
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:22,000
morning in fact was it this morning in the car or yesterday all of a sudden I went and Deb's like what are you doing

375
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,359
Deb's my girlfriend um and I said oh I was just thinking about something I could have done better yesterday and I'm

376
00:41:27,359 --> 00:41:34,280
trying to uplift myself so I'm just going ah right so when I think about that I you know this is my way of like a

377
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:40,680
bringing a meta to myself uplifting myself right meta's hard I was at a

378
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:46,400
two-month retreat at spear Rock many years ago and our friend who was a a a

379
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:51,880
queer man a gay man and um at the end we talked and he said Oh I thought this

380
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:59,040
would I would just come out so like oozy in love everyone beside the hardest

381
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:05,680
practice he had ever done because that Brahma Bahar is actually purifying practice so they bring up all the

382
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:12,440
difficult stuff also and I'm looking at the time so I will move on meta is hard

383
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:17,800
essentially all right s is for significant and perhaps this is where it

384
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:22,839
relates most to the beginning story significant speech is

385
00:42:22,839 --> 00:42:29,480
communication that takes into account what is important for everyone in a

386
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:35,400
conversation and is in service of connection in the memory at the

387
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:45,240
beginning of this chapter the Abbot responded in a way that was significant for him but it wasn't significant for

388
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:52,079
me I brought up what was significant for me but he did not acknowledge at all a

389
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:59,559
culture of domination such as white supremacy culture centers white people's point of views as what is important and

390
00:42:59,559 --> 00:43:07,520
valid White Privilege carries with it the sense that white people's point of view Trump other racist points of view

391
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:12,920
and thus they feel entitled to decide or designate value to what topic carries

392
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:20,119
more significance than others than others a crucial part of anti-racism and

393
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:27,200
anti-oppression work is to open up our sense of what is significant and

394
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:34,240
valued our practice needs to actively and persistently emphasize becoming more

395
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:41,720
aware of what is significant in particular for other people not just

396
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,240
ourselves especially in areas where we have been conditioned by white supremacy

397
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:52,440
culture to ignore deny or minimize race and

398
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:59,960
racism I will say in this book I write White suprem Acy culture a lot and the

399
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:08,359
reason for that is that white supremacy culture is one in which it's like the in

400
00:44:08,359 --> 00:44:14,680
in the United States I'll just say it in the United States it's the air that we all live in right it's the ground we all

401
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:21,839
live in but we don't have to act in ways that keep on promoting

402
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:26,920
white supremacy culture just because yes I got

403
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:32,200
right all right for those in dominant position

404
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:37,599
deep listening is a practice of not reacting from or centering one's point

405
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:45,760
of view first and foremost we can practice from a place of understanding that each of us inhabit

406
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,440
our social location in the very systems of Oppression and and the resulting

407
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:57,960
power differential each interaction carries

408
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:04,880
all right I'll leave it at that given the time thank you for your attention
