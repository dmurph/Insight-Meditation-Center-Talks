1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:09,019
hello everyone and

2
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:18,740
happy to be here with you happy to welcome you and um

3
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:27,840
and there's something that begins to happen maybe for many of us

4
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:34,860
if we pay attention if we allow it to be the case something begins to happen as soon as we

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,500
put ourselves into our meditation posture especially if we've been doing it for a

6
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:46,399
long time it's a familiar posture and the

7
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,500
associations are there the orientation the

8
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:58,340
the Body Mind hearts

9
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:03,320
inclination to become meditative

10
00:01:03,539 --> 00:01:11,400
is um you know can kind of kick in and and one of the consequences of sitting

11
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,920
down to meditate or one of the aspects of it

12
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:23,280
is that it it is a stopping if you're sitting

13
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:30,119
in meditation seated meditation you've stopped activity other activities

14
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:37,700
moving about in your mind hopefully you've stopped

15
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:44,159
searching the web or with your eyes your ears trying to

16
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,759
figure something out trying to search and study and

17
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:56,579
perhaps it's a stopping of the rumination

18
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:03,420
Fantasy spinning out there's a kind of a stopping that goes on here

19
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:11,280
and it's a stopping that is not meant to be a breaking bracing

20
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,980
it's a stopping that's meant to help us

21
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:25,500
become clear to see more clearly to recognize it's like being on a making

22
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,780
it to a Promontory if this the point

23
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:38,459
and once we kind of come up to that Vista point we can see the land around us we see it more clearly

24
00:02:38,459 --> 00:02:45,000
and so this stopping in meditation and we stopped you know if it's whatever

25
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:52,440
is easy to stop we stop and except for mindfulness we stop

26
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:58,620
moving as much as we can stop a lot of discursive thinking

27
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:04,579
having conversations and talking about things to ourselves

28
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,420
we might stop tensing sometimes we don't even know how much

29
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:19,379
we're tensing until we stop and sit down and begin feeling the body

30
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:26,659
and the body itself will kind of begin releasing the tension which is a kind of a stopping of it

31
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:32,159
and that this stopping is meant to kind of clear the clouds the fog help us to

32
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:38,340
see clearly so it's not stopping for its own sake

33
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:44,180
but stopping so we can see so here we are

34
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:51,420
some people call it a sacred pause a sacred stopping

35
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:57,659
in Chinese Buddhism the Chinese pictogram character for

36
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:05,720
samadhi or samatha is the Chinese character for stop

37
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:14,640
so somehow the samadhi is a kind of a deep stopping as opposed to a deep attainment

38
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:21,320
just pause sacred pause so

39
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,620
assuming a meditation posture that

40
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:33,620
supports you to let the body be still

41
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:46,740
and gently as the body is still

42
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:52,100
can you let there be any inner stilling of the body

43
00:04:52,259 --> 00:05:02,600
by relaxing maybe relaxing from the core or outwards

44
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:11,900
maybe relaxing from outside from the edges into the core

45
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:30,780
if you're able to feel someplace deep inside that still

46
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:36,180
peaceful has some quality of not moving and

47
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,340
agitation soft Stillness

48
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:46,620
Within as you exhale

49
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:54,199
relax everything around it and settle into that inner Stillness

50
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,180
gently letting the Mind become still

51
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:15,180
quieting and stopping discursive thoughts you might still have other kinds of

52
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:23,900
thoughts simple thoughts of meditation but the large conversations in the mind

53
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,300
them become quiet

54
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:38,819
if they are the fog let that fog clear

55
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:43,100
the son of awareness has come up

56
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:48,139
clearing the fog

57
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:05,600
and with whatever Stillness stopping you can easily do

58
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:13,020
May that allow you to have a bit more clarity of Mind

59
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:21,319
Clarity of awareness as you accompany your breathing

60
00:08:14,819 --> 00:08:20,478
there is a kind of stopping that is resignation

61
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,919
giving up and shutting down

62
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:34,940
and there's the kind of stopping

63
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,700
that is opening up

64
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:48,620
to gaze upon the view to gaze upon what is here

65
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:52,500
without interfering

66
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:59,399
just Clarity letting things come in as clear as they can

67
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:05,959
interview into perception

68
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:55,920
if you find yourself thinking a lot consider stopping

69
00:13:55,920 --> 00:14:04,700
consider becoming Stiller and in distilling of the Mind

70
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,360
becoming clearer

71
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:19,880
and then let that clearing accompany your breathing

72
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:25,339
or let your breathing accompany the clearness

73
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:10,158
what can you stop

74
00:23:13,559 --> 00:23:22,440
and in stopping opening to Greater clarity

75
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,700
Here and Now

76
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:57,860
and as we come to the end of the sitting

77
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:05,640
for a few moments here assume

78
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:11,760
that your heart your heart's wish

79
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:20,900
is to be able to smile and it's on the verge of smiling

80
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:26,600
if only something else would stop

81
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,500
what needs to stop to make room

82
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:37,400
for the heart to smile

83
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:57,480
What Fear what desires disappointments

84
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:04,740
would need to pause so you can gaze upon the world with a

85
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,460
smiling heart

86
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:18,960
not because you're making it smile because it's what this what the heart

87
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:28,278
wants to do it's asking to be able to smile

88
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:37,100
to be uncovered from the coverings of

89
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:45,380
fear and desires despair disappointment grief

90
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:50,960
fantasy the rumination

91
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:58,799
to allow there to be a pause to all those things

92
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:04,159
so there can be an uncovering of The Smiling heart

93
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:12,559
and from that heart to gaze upon the world kindly

94
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:23,778
kind smile that wishes well for everyone

95
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,580
may all beings

96
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:38,659
be happy may all beings be safe

97
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:44,539
may all beings be peaceful

98
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:49,940
may all beings be free

99
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:03,228

100
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:11,289
[Music]

101
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,820
thank you

102
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:42,059
so welcome to this third talk on strategies for working with challenges

103
00:30:42,059 --> 00:30:47,539
we have and um

104
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:55,860
one of the skills one of the ways of developing skills for being with life's challenges

105
00:30:55,860 --> 00:31:02,820
is to um train on the small challenges

106
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:08,100
life gives many of us huge challenges from time to time

107
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:16,799
some of them are so big that the legacy of them still live in Us in difficult ways fear and anger and

108
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:22,919
grief and different things and sometimes it's too much to be able to

109
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:30,779
sit with it be with it uh to open to it and without having trained without

110
00:31:30,779 --> 00:31:38,039
having prepared the ground would be able to do that some challenges possible you know

111
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:43,380
especially personal inner challenges that our Legacy of other things that's happened to us

112
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:49,559
sometimes it's better to do our best to kind of manage with them wisely put them on on

113
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:55,020
the side until we spend that time preparing ourselves for really

114
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:00,179
addressing them in a useful way and then training with the small

115
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:06,899
challenges and the training for this week is to start becoming start asking yourself the

116
00:32:06,899 --> 00:32:12,539
question oh uh what's the what strategy are you using

117
00:32:12,539 --> 00:32:17,820
in relationship to this challenge you're feeling what are you trying to do with it

118
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:25,620
and simply asking that question and stopping to investigate that is a powerful thing to do because it

119
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:30,659
begins to pull you out from being entangled or lost in that challenge

120
00:32:30,659 --> 00:32:37,980
it's like stepping back and trying to get the overview What's Happening Here and given what's happening how am I

121
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:45,120
responding what is my mind my heart trying to do here and there are two general ways that

122
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:53,399
things to notice whether what's go what the direction you're going makes it harder to be aware

123
00:32:53,399 --> 00:33:00,179
shuts down awareness kind of you get wrapped up or entangled in what's going on

124
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:07,679
or trapped by it or hindered by it or it's a way or there's a strategy that

125
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:15,539
has more the effect of helping you to open more help you see more clearly help the wisdom in you to come forth the

126
00:33:15,539 --> 00:33:22,740
wisdom that can only come forth if you're not entangled if you're not lost in it or caught up in it you have to be

127
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:29,519
able to step back pause and make room for some for wisdom clarity

128
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:37,620
compassion to kind of show itself in a way it can't show itself if we're entangled or caught in what's happening

129
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:44,100
and this is also why it's so powerful jamilia asked the question what's happening here and what am I trying to

130
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:49,980
do and so in terms of trying to this week using the hindrances as a reference for

131
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:57,600
the five hundreds for what this dysfunctional ways of being with challenges today it's the third hindrance which is

132
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:04,679
usually translated into English as sloth and torpor and um I don't think that that is quite

133
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:12,020
right translation of the Pali the the first word that's translated as sloth

134
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:20,040
more literally means to become stiff or rigid and maybe it's akin to the modern

135
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,500
psychological idea of freeze like when people some people freeze in the in the

136
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:31,858
face of challenge freeze fight or flight

137
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:37,200
and so it's a shutting down of something shuts down something closes

138
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:42,540
down and uh we freeze uh maybe go numb

139
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:48,358
and um and this can often be a product of fear fear gets the upper hand and

140
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:54,000
kind of shuts us down it's too much what's happening there can be other strong emotions that has that effect on

141
00:34:54,000 --> 00:35:00,540
us and it can have it can have the byproduct of turning away from what's

142
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:06,540
Happening part of the reason to shut down or to freeze or to become rigid is

143
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:11,820
so that we don't have to deal with something and so sometimes it's like the ostrich

144
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,980
that puts his head supposedly head in the sand to not see the danger so that

145
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:23,640
um sometimes the freezing is kind of a shutting down and just and um and

146
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:28,680
sometimes when it's real real extreme happened to me when I was young I remember something that made me really

147
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,780
afraid afraid and I had a clear feeling that I just disappeared I wasn't there I

148
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:40,800
couldn't understand why people were looking in my direction because I disappeared and and it wasn't

149
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:46,440
imminently dangerous situation but um so there's no immediate threat to me

150
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:51,660
but I remember that later I found myself walking down the street and no idea how

151
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:59,400
I got there something inside of me had turned off and and I guess I left the place and and

152
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:05,599
I don't know how I left what I said so this is something shut down

153
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:11,280
and um and uh and so we can feel that and we

154
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:17,400
can feel kind of shutting down closing down closing up

155
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:23,339
um resisting kind of I'm not going to deal with this something gets rigid something gets tight something gets

156
00:36:23,339 --> 00:36:30,540
closed locked and now we can feel it physically sometimes we can feel it over the heart

157
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:36,060
remember when I was I think I was 16 15 or 16 Maybe 15.

158
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:41,099
a friend of mine said something to me and I literally felt like the doors of

159
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:47,460
my heart just closed they locked up and I remember having this thought kind of like I'm never going to open that again

160
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:55,020
and um it wasn't until I started meditating some four or five years later that something that had closed that day

161
00:36:55,020 --> 00:37:00,359
began opening so shutting down closing up

162
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:05,400
and um the um so that's kind of the

163
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:12,599
dysfunctional way of responding the more functional way the healthier way the wise way also involves a

164
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:18,180
stopping stilling both of these are kind of a stopping

165
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:23,579
and the but the other side of it the functional side of doing the same kind of thing

166
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:30,359
is to stop to pay attention to stop to be present more for what's going on

167
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:37,619
to take a step back either metaphorically in the mind or sometimes physically to get the overview what's

168
00:37:37,619 --> 00:37:43,140
happening here if there's an argument and you're caught in the In the Heat of the argument

169
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:49,260
sometimes it's a really healthy thing to stop to pause ask for a pause and maybe

170
00:37:49,260 --> 00:37:55,740
even you know step away a few feet you know pause I need to spend time thinking I need to kind of feel what's going on

171
00:37:55,740 --> 00:38:01,020
and maybe kind of make it a little physical distance he also maybe

172
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:09,180
explaining why so you can catch your breath so you can get your bearings and really understand better what's going on

173
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:14,700
and so to the degree to which there can be an inter stilling

174
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:24,060
to stop being in the form of an interstelling not a numbing the interstelling is um again allows us

175
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:31,079
to feel make room for what's there there's a feeling not of closing down or locking up but there's a stilling which

176
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:37,560
has more feeling of opening up of becoming more full or or kind of a

177
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:43,020
sacred pause What's Happening Here what am I feeling what am I thinking

178
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:48,540
what am I trying to do what's happening with the person that

179
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:56,099
I'm with or the situation I'm with um can I take it take a second look what's happening and the day of pausing

180
00:38:56,099 --> 00:39:02,000
and looking pausing and reflecting I find invaluable because even to this day

181
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:10,260
my mind will produce interpretations or bias or jump to conclusions about a

182
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:15,900
situation and if I'm kind of moving along kind of fast I don't see my mind

183
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:22,260
has done it that's there's something in my mind that predisposes it sometimes to a certain

184
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:30,380
confidence in my ideas and so I have a erroneous idea but the confidence I have

185
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:36,599
rides along with it thinking that it's right but I know myself well enough that if I

186
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:43,619
can pause stop become little but still then I can see oh that's an

187
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:50,700
interpretation I'm overlaying a guess onto the situation and then I've learned to put a question

188
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:56,820
mark after my assumptions my guesses my conclusions that I make even when I'm

189
00:39:56,820 --> 00:40:02,339
confident sometimes that I'm right I'll learn to put a question mark after it what is this

190
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:07,440
is this really so and um and the more consequential my

191
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:13,859
view is my decision is my ideas are about what's out there the more important I feel it is to stop

192
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:19,980
and pause and live for a while that conclusion reflect on it see if it comes up

193
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:25,980
repeatedly you know if it comes up two or three more times like oh yeah this is right

194
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:31,740
this is right then then maybe I gave it a little more

195
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:37,260
Credence then maybe I give it more attention and explore a little bit more what's going on

196
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:42,839
but this stopping so we can see stopping so we can question

197
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:50,059
stopping so that we can catch our breath and really kind of look at things in a fresh way

198
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:56,099
so there are two forms of stopping just like in in relationship to

199
00:40:56,099 --> 00:41:05,160
hindrances there's two forms of each kind of movement of the Mind One is the hindrance and one is opening to wisdom

200
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:10,500
and um so with the first hindrance desire that

201
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:15,599
their sensual desire there's desires which are causes problems and there's this desire

202
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:20,700
to open up a desire to see and to be free there's healthy desires

203
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:27,300
and when we're with challenges can we see the difference which desire are we operating on

204
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:32,520
in challenges there's averting and there's healthy averting turning

205
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:38,339
away or saying no and so can we see a difference between the healthy and the unhealthy

206
00:41:38,339 --> 00:41:43,920
and today there's a healthy the unhealthy kind of hindrance of sloth and

207
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:49,440
torpor um freezing getting still getting numb

208
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:55,440
getting shutting down go ahead and going to sleep in a certain way and there is

209
00:41:55,440 --> 00:42:02,820
um stopping pausing that it opens us up that makes us more

210
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:08,160
clear makes room for wisdom um

211
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:15,859
so um um so this is a

212
00:42:16,619 --> 00:42:21,960
my words for today and what I'd like to suggest is that you

213
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:28,260
take a look at this the movement of shutting down turning off getting bored

214
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:36,800
going numb losing interest all that is a symptom of this third hindrance

215
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:43,560
waking up being interested clear investigating

216
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:49,619
even a situation that the first might seem boring certainly there's something about it

217
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:56,160
that you can study and look at and kind of see what what's the interesting thing what's going on here

218
00:42:56,160 --> 00:43:01,619
to do the little bit of work pausing stopping not to be lazy

219
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:08,220
but pause and stopping so you can figure out what is the mind's work here

220
00:43:08,220 --> 00:43:13,740
that is beneficial and healthy and creates maybe a better connection

221
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:19,319
and empathy for the person with the situation I'm with with myself

222
00:43:19,319 --> 00:43:25,859
so you might look today for opportunities for this see what goes on with your mind your awareness

223
00:43:25,859 --> 00:43:32,220
is it in some way or they're shutting down or is it opening up in the situation

224
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:38,040
you're in and if you see the difference choose

225
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:46,220
opening up so thank you very much and um

226
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:51,500
look forward to being together tomorrow
