00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:06,720
greetings friends greetings to all of you from

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:12,540
Mountain View California unseated oloni land hope you are well wherever you are

3
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:17,820
in the world and I'm delighted to be joining you

4
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:23,039
together joining each other to uh to practice this morning or In This Moment

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:32,758
In Time So today we're going to continue our exploration of compassion cultivation as

6
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,760
it is done in expanding concentric circles start with ourselves

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,020
good next category we extend to is the benefactor dear friend

8
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:51,239
and then the neutral person very important category that we worked with

9
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:57,960
yesterday and now today we've come to a uh a pivotal category one we've been

10
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:05,460
I've been looking forward to actually which is the person we have challenges with the person we have challenges with

11
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:12,180
and um I like to use the long version instead

12
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,820
of saying a challenging person because they're not from their vantage point they're not challenging they're just

13
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,259
doing the best they can and maybe they they think we're challenging but the person we're having

14
00:01:24,259 --> 00:01:30,200
challenges with so at this moment in time

15
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,020
so the neutral person we worked with

16
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,960
yesterday is really the stepping stone to to expanding our heart bringing ease

17
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,840
to our heart with respect to someone we're having challenges with

18
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,079
so let's just practice together and I'll give some invitations for us to explore

19
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:01,140
and again this is for the benefit of the piece of our heart

20
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:08,459
um it's not it's not necessarily for them it's really for us to have peace and ease and

21
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:16,340
expansion of our of our compassion so so let's practice together

22
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:26,819
now arriving arriving arriving in our seat arriving in our

23
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:33,440
bodies arriving in this moment in time

24
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:46,700
feeling our feet on the Earth our legs our sit bones our hands

25
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:56,599
feeling our entire body seated and receiving the breath

26
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,959
and connecting allowing awareness invading inviting

27
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:46,280
inviting awareness to connect with the entirety of the breath

28
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:07,260
in breath hauls out breath in the body in the body

29
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:11,120
receiving the breath in the body

30
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:58,320
and as we sit and feel grieved letting there be a

31
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:05,900
sense of good will for ourselves sense of appreciation

32
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:12,080
for showing up we're showing up in this moment as best as we're able to

33
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,620
instance of Goodwill for ourselves

34
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:42,440
the appreciation that we are doing the best we can especially with respect to our challenges our difficulties

35
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,520
and

36
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:08,520
and with the same gesture of a mother holding a

37
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,780
child a newborn lovingly

38
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,919
letting ourselves with our tenderness be held

39
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,360
with kindness

40
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:18,060
and now inviting the neutral person we were practicing

41
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:26,599
with yesterday if you're not practicing yesterday no problem invite someone you don't know so well

42
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:33,620
appreciating their common Humanity just like me

43
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:40,638
just like me you have Joys and sorrows

44
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:50,880
and sitting them sitting with them in your heart space with Goodwill

45
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,840
with friendliness

46
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,360
you might notice that they're no longer neutral you've developed a

47
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,979
sense of affection warmth kinship with them

48
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:39,899
Maybe notice

49
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:46,159
if that is present or not yet which is perfectly fine

50
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,779
these categories are so transient

51
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,100
now inviting someone you're having Tom challenge with maybe nothing

52
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,040
number one person on your list the most challenging

53
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:38,279
the person you're having the most challenges with uh

54
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:44,240
somewhere in somewhere lower

55
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:54,720
bring this person to your mind to your heart

56
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:00,800
and if you need to keep them a little further away that's okay too

57
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:10,440
Hunter them up seeing them as clearly as you can

58
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:18,440
while staying embodied staying in your seat of stability

59
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:25,220
if it's possible to see them as clearly as possible

60
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:34,019
and see that just like you just like you this this person suffers just like you they suffer they suffer a

61
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,139
lot

62
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,360
just like you they're the object of affection

63
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:57,680
of other people other beings

64
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:05,540
they are there they have been there they are very dear

65
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,060
they are loved

66
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:27,380
appreciate it they're a good friend to someone

67
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,680
they are a good friend to someone

68
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:48,560
maybe they're really kind generous loyal

69
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,100
airing

70
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,959
supportive to someone

71
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:30,200
else like me they have hopes and aspirations have values

72
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:48,860
just like me they don't want to suffer just want to be happy they don't want to suffer

73
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,700
no one to be free from sorrow and pain

74
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:42,420
you are not condoning it any harm they have caused you

75
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:47,480
but we're letting go of that story right now

76
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:55,440
and just feeling into the common Humanity not condoning the harm

77
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,540
tuning into the common Humanity

78
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:13,819
separating the behavior from the person our hearts our minds can do that

79
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:23,000
we are capable you see the humanity

80
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:31,680
and hold this person with good will just because they're a human being just

81
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:38,180
like me and they suffer just like me wishing them well

82
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:46,760
as much as available as much as possible

83
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,560
and again it defend your heart and your mind they need to be far away in distance

84
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,920
on another on an island for you to feel safe enough to wish them

85
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,880
well that's okay

86
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:13,339
or they might be able to be closer really seeing feeling the common Humanity

87
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:22,079
just like me they suffer just like me just as I wish to be

88
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:30,560
free from sorrow may may this person be free

89
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,379
from sorrow

90
00:15:56,579 --> 00:16:02,100
just as I would have E's and peace as I meet my challenges difficulties in my

91
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:09,500
life and peace as they meet their challenges

92
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,959
find your own way with the phrases

93
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:26,720
with seeing common Humanity trust that it's possible trust that you can

94
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:34,940
whatever amount available In This Moment

95
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:47,060
we wish you well

96
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,919
and also it might be helpful

97
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:24,120
to see the two of you you and the person you're having challenges with

98
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:29,880
in this entanglement and the way you're entangled or have

99
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:37,740
been entangled through all these causes and conditions that brought you together and

100
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:44,220
you got entangled in this way and wishing both of you well

101
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:49,400
wishing both of you well in ease with this entanglement that happened

102
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:56,780
where is happening I wish both of us is peace

103
00:21:57,419 --> 00:22:02,539
freedom from sorrow and suffering

104
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:09,860
as we have been entangled

105
00:22:10,919 --> 00:22:13,759
challenged

106
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:19,520
I wish you well

107
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:27,720
I hold with good will with understanding with ease with

108
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:34,039
friendliness both of us in this entanglement

109
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:46,039
offering ease to my heart it's okay it's okay

110
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:06,179
May both of us be free May both of us have ease

111
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:14,419
the midst of challenge I wish both of us well

112
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:42,539
and maybe your heart feels ready to release

113
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:50,059
and wish well release maybe just a little bit

114
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:54,559
release this entanglement in usual

115
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:05,059
for both of you

116
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:56,299
coming back to our seats

117
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:06,440
the breaths to the body as we turn to close this period of sitting together

118
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:19,278
and appreciating that we've showed up and we've done our best as best as we're able to

119
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:27,179
In This Moment In Time this practice giving our heart as much as possible

120
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:31,340
cultivating Good Will compassion

121
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:38,279
knowing that there are seeds of goodness planted a little ripen in their own time

122
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:42,980
not our time their own time

123
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:54,179
and without attachment the outcome Right Here and Now

124
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:59,820
sharing this co-created goodness offering it to all beings everywhere

125
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:05,520
may my practice be of service not just to myself and those

126
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,620
whose lives I touch directly but all things everywhere may all beings be free

127
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:17,778
may all beings be happy including myself

128
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:21,380

some sadness holding lightly gratitude for the teachings kindness

138
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:58,200

loosening up thank you all thank you for for offering for offering what's arising

141
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:21,120
and being bringing to the space so today we are continuing

142
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:27,000
with the theme of with expansion of the cultivation compassion cultivation as

143
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:33,179
I've mentioned I'll review it it happens it's done systematically in concentric

144
00:31:33,179 --> 00:31:38,520
circles starting with ourselves and our benefactor expanding some more

145
00:31:38,520 --> 00:31:45,299
dear friend expanding some more neutral person expanding some more and then the person we have challenges with

146
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:51,720
and this this part is so rich this part is so rich this this

147
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:58,200
um this expansion of the heart for those we have challenges with

148
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:04,320
um as I said before the meditation I like

149
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:10,380
to not use in fact in the midwest we don't use the the traditional label for

150
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:16,679
this category the traditional label for this category is is the um

151
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:21,899
um enemy but in the west we don't say enemy we say often teachers say the

152
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:29,279
challenging person or difficult person and I don't like to say challenging or difficult person because if we label

153
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:36,840
that person in our minds as challenging or that's my difficult person like oh they're difficult for oh ouch already

154
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:42,779
we're labeling them we're already our mind our perception our perspective is already deciding that yet they are

155
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:48,659
difficult I'm the one doing my best they're difficult and that there's no such a thing we are entangled with one

156
00:32:48,659 --> 00:32:55,500
another in fact they might think that we're the difficult or challenging person from their perspective so so

157
00:32:55,500 --> 00:33:01,919
calling them with this label of this mouthful of the person we are having challenges with

158
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:07,020
right now you can add right now because maybe in the past we didn't have challenges with it maybe in the future

159
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:14,519
we would not have challenges um but right now we happen to be entangled we happen to be entangled

160
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:19,940
um and they happen to be entangled with us so so

161
00:33:19,940 --> 00:33:27,360
compassion for the person we're having challenges with even saying that oh that to me in my

162
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:34,260
heart there are some there's some release right there it doesn't make it fixed there's no fixedness that oh yeah

163
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:40,019
they're the challenging person they're never going to change I'm never going to change but oh for right now we're

164
00:33:40,019 --> 00:33:45,299
entangled it's just it's it's a fluid thing it's impermanent it brings the

165
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:52,200
acknowledgment of the grace of impermanence it brings that acknowledgment in there and right now just something has happened or is

166
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:58,919
happening that this entanglement because of all the causes and conditions many of them beyond our control

167
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:04,679
this entanglement is happening so

168
00:34:04,679 --> 00:34:11,580
so it's very important as we cultivate and um it is very important as we cultivate the

169
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:16,858
compassion and open our hearts little by little as much as available to release

170
00:34:16,859 --> 00:34:22,618
entanglement and wish well for the person uh we're having challenges with is um

171
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:29,820
it doesn't mean that we let go of the the harm that has been

172
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:35,580
done it doesn't mean this kind of compassion some people

173
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:41,520
um don't don't dip their toes because they're afraid

174
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:47,280
that they're going to become um they become weak they become more uh

175
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:55,020
vulnerable to to Future abuse no it doesn't work that way so so so

176
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:01,320
hear me out one is that we don't condone the actions

177
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,420
we separate the actions the behavior from the humanity of the individual and

178
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:11,460
we might still hold them accountable of course for their actions and

179
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:17,339
um and and maybe even keep some distance between us and them

180
00:35:17,339 --> 00:35:23,339
um as I think Sylvia Borstein says we we may throw people out of our lives but we

181
00:35:23,339 --> 00:35:28,380
don't throw them out of our hearts so you may decide okay this person you know

182
00:35:28,380 --> 00:35:36,240
it's just not appropriate for us to have contact and and it's just too hurtful and and it's more it's wiser not to have

183
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:45,240
not to be in my life but you don't throw them out of your heart you wish them well you wish them well so can so

184
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:52,380
separating the behavior from the humanity of the person and if if the circumstances are such

185
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:57,780
that you continue to be engaged with the person again you engage from a place of

186
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:03,359
common Humanity kindness good will they're doing their best maybe they're screwing up maybe you're screwing up

187
00:36:03,359 --> 00:36:10,560
it's it's an entanglement together and kindness for both of you good will for both of you and not condoning the

188
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,280
actions again uh separating the actions from the coming Humanity

189
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:23,940
of the person and in fact it takes a lot of courage and strength to have this

190
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:31,980
kind of compassion and this kind of kindness for the people we have had entanglements with it is

191
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:37,680
um it takes great courage and strength and it also gives us a sense of uprightness

192
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:43,560
and compassion their nuances to compassion compassion isn't just

193
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:50,880
um soft and and and and tender compassion can also be fierce fierce

194
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:58,079
compassion is another way that it shows up again it shows up with a lot of care but with a lot of wisdom of what is

195
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:03,240
appropriate um and and

196
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:10,680
when we have compassion 360 degrees including ourselves and other people say

197
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:16,020
if this is someone with whom we've been in say abusive relationship when we have

198
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:21,660
complete compassion for ourselves and them there is this sense of fierceness

199
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:27,480
compassion that comes in in our hearts like okay I care for you I love you and

200
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:33,420
for the sake of myself and you I'm not going to allow you to hurt me again

201
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:39,420
anymore so there's a sense of fierceness out of its and it's not out of hatred

202
00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:45,720
it's not out of hatred for the other person but it's out of love for ourselves and for them like this is not

203
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,300
appropriate so love and wisdom really come in to create the sense of

204
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:56,700
um appropriateness and I in in the west we tend to call it boundaries but I don't

205
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:02,040
like the word boundaries because boundaries is already creating separation like oh you over the you know

206
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:07,560
you you're separate but we see the common Humanity but wisdom creates this

207
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:12,560
this I don't know this sense of um

208
00:38:13,619 --> 00:38:19,680
um yeah this this the strength the sense of uprightness this sense of fierce

209
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:26,460
compassion for ourselves and for them to allow the to allow kindness compassion

210
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:33,660
to flow uh and not enabling not enabling uh

211
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:41,599
say abuse Etc so this is a very very important distinction to make

212
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:48,180
so yesterday I I promised to say a little bit about the um those that were to say

213
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:55,800
more about the um the enemies of of the near enemy and the far enemy

214
00:38:55,800 --> 00:39:01,079
of compassion so we've already discussed in the past few days that the two of the

215
00:39:01,079 --> 00:39:07,320
near enemies or the masqueraders things that masquerade as compassion but they're not compassion one of them being

216
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:12,900
empathic distress or grief with sense of grief you're falling into the waves with

217
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:19,020
the person instead of having the stability to have kindness for them um and that's a really important one we

218
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:26,400
discussed that you can go back and listen to number two I do to day two and

219
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:34,260
um we also discussed pity yesterday which is another masquerader which is a less than oh it never happened to me uh

220
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:42,599
so compassion from this high place of oh yeah I'm up here and I'll pour you poor you and pity is not compassion

221
00:39:42,599 --> 00:39:47,880
now today I wanted to bring in What's called the far enemy which is another

222
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:59,060
word for saying the opposite the opposite of compassion and the opposite of compassion is cruelty is cruelty

223
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:07,740
so cruelty is is easily recognizable it's not a masquerader but say it can

224
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:16,380
arise um and when for example you're trying to to cultivate say compassion for the

225
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:22,980
person you're having challenges with and and if you're in your your brain to mind you bring to hard to come in humanity

226
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:28,980
you bring to mind the way they suffer and instead of your heart extending in

227
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:34,619
kindness oh oh you too like me oh YouTube like me it's like oh you're

228
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:40,079
feeling happy for their suffering ouch that is cruelty that is the definition

229
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:45,119
of Cruelty taking joy and Delight in other person's suffering so if that

230
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:52,980
arises please recognize it and then turn and then instead of

231
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:59,339
turning towards yourself with with you know self-judgment like oh how can I have cruel this is terrible like okay

232
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:05,520
pause pause pause bring in kindness and wisdom to yourself okay sweetheart

233
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:11,940
what's going on here you must be really really hurt to be resorting to Cruelty

234
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:19,200
sweetheart this is yeah this oh this is not good for you it's not good for your own heart development your own Karma the

235
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,540
way you feel the way you think the way you show up in the world so so can't so

236
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:30,900
bring kindness understanding acceptance instead of pushing it away and trying to make it into an exile

237
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:37,200
accept and understand it and that's step number one step number two is consider

238
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:42,780
the um the the [Music] um

239
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:49,020
the the deterrence the the the the heavy weight the karmic weight the the the

240
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:56,220
negative aspects um of of of Cruelty it's it's it's

241
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:03,119
um in fact it's it's almost like the cruelty and you know the other negative

242
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:08,520
um uh emotions externally like anger for example it's it's it's in the there's a

243
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:14,940
simile that it's likened to to you wearing a um the skin of a dead

244
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:20,579
um uh that snake which is kind of repulsive and ugly right it's like ooh

245
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:26,640
it's not very inviting so so you can light you can use similar you can use

246
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,880
some similar um uh similes and and feelings like yeah actually

247
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:37,560
cruelty it's quite unattractive the unattractiveness in in the qualities of

248
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:44,099
the heart so these are some ways to perhaps if if the far enemy if the

249
00:42:44,099 --> 00:42:51,060
opposite of compassion arises if you're doing this practice you can support yourself so

250
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:57,359
so a lot more on this topic a lot more in this topic but uh

251
00:42:57,359 --> 00:43:05,099
um we have one more day to practice together and um I want to invite you if you will

252
00:43:05,099 --> 00:43:10,440
for the rest of the day if it's helpful to consider you and the person you've

253
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:16,619
been entangled with if it comes up to wish both of you well wish both of you in this entanglement wish both of you

254
00:43:16,619 --> 00:43:22,980
and see if there can be some release you can do some release some letting go

255
00:43:22,980 --> 00:43:29,960
yes um and and um

256
00:43:30,119 --> 00:43:36,060
yeah somebody also put in schadenfreude yeah schadenfreude is this this great

257
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:42,780
German word taking joy in this in the pain and the sadness of others very yeah

258
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:49,980
it's that's another far enemy here so it's a cruelty so so thank you all for

259
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:56,520
for your engagement and I see there's a question about boundaries yeah um maybe I'll just take a moment to

260
00:43:56,520 --> 00:44:03,780
clarify that so for me it's a sense of boundaries that we use is is such a sense of separation of our Humanity but

261
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:11,160
there's a way that we can have this this uprightness but with with kindness for ourselves kindness for others

262
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:18,720
um maybe I'll say more about that tomorrow the time has run out so thank you all may you be

263
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:25,619
well may you practice well with kindness with compassion if there are any entanglements for the rest of the day

264
00:44:25,619 --> 00:44:30,619
and looking forward to practicing with you tomorrow be well
