1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:08,040
so hello everyone welcome to this meditation that's part of the

2
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:13,080
series on samadi and as an introduction I'd like

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,080
to say that samadi is a very

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,599
personal experience in a very personal way of

5
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:32,398
being in the world being with oneself and so no one including myself

6
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,840
can give you precise instructions precise metaphors

7
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:46,039
precise um uh that are you know tailor made for each individual for you but I'm

8
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:52,120
hoping in this series that I'm teaching enough that there'll be things that are

9
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:59,199
even just one thing that really supports you really helps you as an entryway into

10
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,960
this a mind which is undistracted a mind which becomes clear

11
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:12,240
and really enters into uh the meditation in a in a meaningful way for you in a

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:17,280
deep way and uh and one of the ways to

13
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,680
understand uh the instructions i g am giving is that they're all meant to be

14
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:28,360
ways for you to understand yourself better so even if some of the

15
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:35,119
instructions I give here doesn't work for you um that doesn't mean that you

16
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:42,600
should dismiss them or or ignore them but rather uh there are a means by which

17
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,680
you can understand yourself better to understand what doesn't work and by that

18
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,000
maybe have a better sense of what does work or or maybe there's ways of um what

19
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,600
doesn't work and teach you something about how your mind how your own mind works and so that you can have more

20
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:08,039
clarity and understanding so with that in

21
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,440
mind the um the emphasis I want to make

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,160
today is that in the unification the

23
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:27,480
inclusion uh inclusivity of Samar practice that uh can also involve what I

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:33,599
call uh organizing ourselves bringing together all the

25
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:39,879
desperate parts of us and kind of bringing them together almost like a puzzle pieces that fit together that are

26
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:46,560
working together or maybe maybe it's an unfortunate uh metaphor but uh rather

27
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,879
than puzzle pieces with maybe it's like building blocks Lego blocks that we put

28
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:57,959
together so they all fit together nicely as opposed to uh having a

29
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:05,959
centrifugal force in our thinking that spins us out into many preoccupations and concerns and we keep uh spinning we

30
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:11,760
keep scattering ourselves scattering our attention scattering our focus our

31
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:19,519
concerns because we have too much going on and too many things and too strong a pull into the fascinating worlds of

32
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:27,040
desire and aversion and fantasy and so it's not just simply that

33
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:33,720
these thoughts and activities pull us away from the present but they also pull apart the mind they

34
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:39,760
pull apart the body if we get tense and preoccupied there can be a tensing and a

35
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,519
lifting that um that kind of removes us from a settled unified

36
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:53,079
feeling sometimes that lifting goes all the way up into the head and we mostly live in our head where we're no longer

37
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:58,120
uh all the all the building blocks of who we are hasn't come together so that

38
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:05,799
they are settled on each other and the thinking mind also can be

39
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:12,599
um sometimes not even in the present moment can be ahead of ourselves behind ourselves in another place but

40
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:18,199
physically we can feel sometimes that the energy the thinking mind the tension

41
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:24,680
the activity agitation the um the um the

42
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:32,680
uh what's activated maybe in our head in our brain brain maybe is it the the the

43
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:38,520
you know in the front of the brain or maybe it's uh the brain is now more kind

44
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:45,080
of zeroed in on the eyes or um and that's got the mind has gotten small or

45
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:51,600
it's gotten maybe mostly we're preoccupied on the left side or the right side of the mind or um there's a

46
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:58,240
kind of way in which the mind starts feeling not complete not whole not settled on itself and there's a way of

47
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:04,800
organizing the mind bring at all the pieces together um and now so they were right

48
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,800
there similar to how you would organize your body if

49
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,680
um if uh I don't know there a lot of a lot of examples I could use but if

50
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:24,880
you're going to play pingpong uh and you're ready for someone to serve the ball to you um you would

51
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:30,240
kind of get your body ready organized and the whole body is coming together

52
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,080
to be there for that activity the orientation of the mind's attention is

53
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,199
now oriented and and U brought into the

54
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:49,400
tabletop the other person's hand the ball just right it's organ everything's kind of organizing itself in order to be

55
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:55,479
there for the game of ping pong and um and the same thing with the mind and

56
00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:02,080
this is where most people don't have a very good sense of the physical physicality the physical sensations of

57
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,240
their mind and what is activated agitated energized in the mind and where

58
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:15,319
and what's included and it's not or the directionality of the different kind of centrifugal forces of thinking in the

59
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,440
mind and preoccupations and the mind too can come

60
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:26,360
together into a whole into a settled interconnected

61
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,319
peace and so that'll be the instructions today and it'll maybe work for some of

62
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:39,759
you and for those of you who don't uh maybe it'll maybe it helps you see and understand something about

63
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:47,720
yourself so to assume a meditation posture that is a posture of organizing

64
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,759
your body so that as much as your body as

65
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:57,879
possible is now going to be participating in the

66
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:05,199
meditation how your feet are

67
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,759
positioned so the feet themselves support attentiveness

68
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:20,479
presence being grounded maybe The Souls of the feet are touching some

69
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:28,280
surface maybe the positioning of the legs

70
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:39,560
and if you're sitting on a chair or a cushion the way that the cushion chair

71
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,919
receives the weight of your body can you move a little bits way back

72
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:51,759
and forth so that weight feels grounded

73
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:56,879
feels full feels

74
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:02,199
solid to support being

75
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:08,440
here and adjusting organizing your torso your

76
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:14,599
spine to be here participating ready for

77
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:17,879
anything in

78
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:25,039
meditation gently closing your

79
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:32,759
eyes and without just as you're

80
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,240
breathing feel your body on the

81
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:45,120
inhale feel where you're agitated

82
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:51,440
tense where you're activated maybe so there's

83
00:08:52,600 --> 00:09:00,240
a prioritization of certain parts of your body at the expense of others

84
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:07,040
feeling that on the inhale and then on the

85
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,320
exhale to relax the

86
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:18,279
body settle the

87
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,160
body with the idea that as a body settles on

88
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,360
itself the body is coming

89
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:37,800
together being organized so that all the parts

90
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:47,399
are somehow cooperating or here in the same way

91
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:05,760
and is there any way that's your body your chest your heart any part of your

92
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,040
body is energized or engaged or

93
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,240
activated by some emotional

94
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:22,240
state and is it a state that's more likely

95
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:30,000
to take you away from kind of a wholeness of who you are to have you preoccupied with a

96
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,480
particular State emotional

97
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,040
state and just knowing

98
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:50,880
that feeling how that emotional state might be alive in some part of your

99
00:10:54,160 --> 00:11:00,800
body feeling that as you inhale and on the

100
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,399
exhale relaxing the emotional state relaxing

101
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:16,639
the body associated with that

102
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:29,600
state and maybe the emotion doesn't go away but maybe it's allowed to settle

103
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:35,480
more deeply into some place where you feel more grounded with

104
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:43,600
it where the wider body is there to hold it or support

105
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:52,920
it so it doesn't need to be a

106
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,079
preoccupation it's okay

107
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:14,440
and then on the inhale feeling any Sensations associated

108
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,000
with the thinking

109
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,839
mind is there any tension or pressure

110
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:38,560
contraction any activation

111
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:46,560
agitation in any parts of your head anywhere else in the

112
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:51,000
body that seems connected to

113
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:01,120
thinking and is there a preoccupation with thinking with thoughts

114
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:09,160
that takes you away from yourself divides you from the rest the

115
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:18,160
whole a prioritization of the concerns you have

116
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,800
and as you exhale soften the thinking

117
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,320
mind let it

118
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:53,639
relax maybe with the image of a wide lake with

119
00:13:53,639 --> 00:14:00,360
waves that the waves begin to settle and slow down and get

120
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:07,639
smaller until the lake becomes wide and flat and

121
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:15,480
still so the thinking mind quiets slows

122
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:22,639
down settles becomes Broad and

123
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:32,600
still maybe allowing all the water of the lake all the activity of the

124
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,759
lake to rest on the lake

125
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,240
Bottom where the weight of the

126
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:50,600
mind is allow to settle into the body

127
00:15:00,839 --> 00:15:06,639
in that settling if there's any sense of the

128
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:15,320
mind having different parts different pieces where not everything is

129
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:21,480
included as you exhale let all the Mind

130
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:28,600
settle together into a settling place

131
00:15:31,319 --> 00:15:39,920
where the mind the thinking mind can be received and

132
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,920
supported

133
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,920
reassured that kind of reorganizing of the Mind

134
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:07,480
so everything comes together and however close and whole

135
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:15,959
complete the Mind may feel Orient the

136
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:23,279
mind to rest Focus

137
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:28,319
include the experience of breathing

138
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:46,279
where every exhale brings allows all the parts of

139
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:52,319
ourselves to settle together into the experience of

140
00:16:52,319 --> 00:17:00,839
breathing the Gathering Place the settling place

141
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:22,720
and is a way of organizing the mind to be more here

142
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:30,840
and unified let your thinking mind

143
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:38,720
be involved with the thought of the

144
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:47,120
count of counting the exhales one to

145
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:54,559
10 and if you lose count no problem begin again at

146
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:01,799
one counting not as a strain and not as something to worry

147
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:07,400
about to be successful at but each

148
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:15,400
count a settling a relaxing helping the mind come together

149
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,640
in an organized

150
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:27,760
way to settle into the Gathering Place of

151
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
breathing

152
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
for

153
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
for

154
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

155
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

156
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

157
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
for

158
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
for

159
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

160
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

161
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

162
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
for

163
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
for for

164
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:29,240
and then as we come to the end of this sitting to allow for a full Fuller

165
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:32,720
settling on the

166
00:25:37,159 --> 00:25:45,120
exhale and even if you're unsettled in some way to

167
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,039
feel the way that you are settled

168
00:25:52,520 --> 00:26:00,240
now settled in your body in your heart

169
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:03,080
in your

170
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:14,240
mind maybe with every exhale a

171
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:22,880
soft wholeness in this settling all of

172
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:33,440
yourself letting go settling

173
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:42,640
in gathering together on the in the Gathering

174
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:47,720
Place maybe at the very end of the

175
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:55,080
exhale letting go here

176
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:13,440
and from this subtle place to gaze upon the world

177
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,320
kindly to gaze Upon This World

178
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:30,158
peacefully to take in and include the whole world

179
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:47,360
compassionately almost like you're inviting it all in to sit and be settled with

180
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:53,080
you almost as if you're making space and room

181
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:58,399
and accompanyment with the world

182
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:04,360
so there's a whatever comes into your

183
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:11,158
orbit also has a chance to settle be at

184
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:22,000
ease being settled and gazing upon the world

185
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:28,679
kindly may all beings be happy

186
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:35,200
may all beings be

187
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:41,679
safe may all beings be

188
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:47,880
peaceful may all beings be

189
00:28:50,120 --> 00:28:57,399
free and may the way that we can be settled on ourselves

190
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:06,600
be a support for the welfare and happiness of others

191
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:15,080
certainly at least May the ways that we get agitated

192
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:21,159
reactive not spill out to

193
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:29,760
influence more of that in the world may all beings be happy

194
00:29:42,640 --> 00:29:45,880
thank you

195
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:33,000
so hello on this welcome to this series of talks on

196
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,320
samadi and uh samadi is not an abstract

197
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:46,519
topic for intellectual interest only but it's a topic about ourselves

198
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:53,120
about how we can be present and engaged in really whatever we're

199
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,080
doing and it's with the general focus of the series is on medit

200
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:04,919
meditation and that's that connection to samadi is so strong that sometimes the

201
00:31:04,919 --> 00:31:12,080
word samadi is a substitute for the word meditation and

202
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:19,919
um and but really the ability to be fully present oriented organized

203
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:25,639
absorbed in anything um makes anything a subject for

204
00:31:25,639 --> 00:31:30,799
somebody and for those of you are going along with this series and wanting

205
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:36,120
to cultivate uh samadi uh in

206
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:43,159
meditation it's greatly supported by beginning to take what you're learning about yourself about how you can be

207
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:49,559
settled how you can be oriented organized

208
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:56,840
simple um settled still spacious the way that you can bring that

209
00:31:56,840 --> 00:32:02,120
into different activi in your life so it's not just something you do in

210
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:09,240
meditation but something that you're beginning to um spread through your day

211
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:14,960
so that when you come to meditation you're already familiar with the territory you're all you haven't been

212
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:21,320
out of touch with it for a long time and it's it's it's more easy to uh be be be

213
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:26,679
connected to it and I learned this when I was in the monastery and I had very

214
00:32:26,679 --> 00:32:31,960
busy full job in the kitchen being a cook for the large

215
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:38,240
Monastery and uh didn't have a lot of time for meditation but uh I started to practice

216
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:46,159
this uh in the monastery with the activities I I did and uh and uh I carried I had a

217
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:51,919
question that I carried with me that was my kind of my contemplative question for

218
00:32:51,919 --> 00:32:57,000
the year I was in the kitchen there and that was the question uh how can I

219
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,120
participate more fully with what I'm doing in the kitchen and so whatever I

220
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:09,320
was doing if I was chopping vegetables if I was washing pots and pans if I was

221
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:17,000
uh putting together ingredients in pot if I was um walking around with a dirty

222
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,279
pot to bring it to the sink and there were other people working whatever I was doing how could I be in that

223
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:30,600
activity in a sense of really participating in it and why it was important for me was right away when I

224
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:37,480
came started work in the kitchen I didn't want to be there and my mind was elsewhere and I had other plans and

225
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:43,000
other aspirations and I was preoccupied with other issues with people I've been

226
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:50,240
talking to or doing and and I felt myself scattered I felt myself um uh you

227
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:58,880
know being kind of uh propelled out of the present moment propelled out of what I was doing um

228
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:04,159
and and I the what I used as my um as my

229
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:09,480
antidote to that as a way of learning about myself as a way of was how can I

230
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:15,079
participate with what I'm doing here so the consequence of that at some point

231
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:22,040
after some months of doing this uh if after the medit after working in the kitchen I would go to the meditation

232
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:30,280
session kind of almost you know directly I I would show up in the meditation already concentrated already there

233
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:35,839
present and it was relatively easy to uh enter into

234
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:45,079
samade and um and uh so this is a plug for you to participate to organize to be

235
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:52,398
start taking some of these lessons and you applying them into your daily life where you can where it makes

236
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:57,440
sense and one of these ideas in the theme of unification inclusion that's a

237
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:03,320
big part of it is the idea of uh that might work for some of you is to

238
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:09,320
organize your body mind and heart to be uh to be

239
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:17,680
participating in the settling in the Gathering at some central place within

240
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:24,880
so at the heart or Center of your breathing or as for me it's uh I I'm I I

241
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:31,119
was uh trained and spent decades now attending to my breath in my belly the

242
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:38,000
movements of the belly the sensations there the subtle feelings of pressure and release of pressure as I breathe the

243
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:44,119
softness keeping it soft for years uh for the early years of practice I held

244
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:51,160
my belly always tight and tense and I would relax it and soften and soften and

245
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:57,960
it took a while to really have that be settled um

246
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:04,920
uh and uh and so to um to to have this participating

247
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:10,200
there to organize yourself and um and I have this sense

248
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:17,200
some they not always available to me but there are sometimes where when I sit down to meditate I spent some time

249
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:22,280
feeling and sensing what the thinking mind is like is it tense is it tight is

250
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:29,359
it scattered and um and sometimes I can feel that I could kind of bring it

251
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:34,560
together and organize it kind of have put all the pieces together like the the

252
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:39,920
maybe the my mind has five major pieces blocks or something and I have this

253
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:45,480
sense that I can kind of like just like I could take a deep breath and and bring

254
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:51,560
my shoulders down and there's a organizing my body here in the Torso in

255
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:57,720
the the here or the weight against my my seat I can do the same thing with the

256
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:03,119
mind I can sense and feel my mind a little bit and then as I exhale I kind

257
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:10,240
of like imagine I'm putting the pieces back together and so the Mind becomes whole all the parts of the Mind are

258
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:17,160
there and to what degree this is only a something of my

259
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:23,560
imagination or to what degree it is something that feels you know more actual that's going on and I'm putting

260
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:29,680
the Mind back together um uh is not that important for me what's important is

261
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:35,000
that um the tensions I feel the different ways maybe it sometimes feels

262
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:41,560
like the blood is going in different places or the blood is going all into a central place not flowing into the whole

263
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:47,920
brain and so there's some kind of way in which I feel the brain feel the thinking

264
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,520
muscle and um and then kind of let it settle and come together gather together

265
00:37:54,520 --> 00:38:00,160
let it kind of uh spread and and what happens often is the mind gets settled

266
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:05,720
and qu calm it tends to get feel larger more spacious it feels like it's

267
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:15,319
expanding partly because any idea of a uh outer limit like of the mind um is an

268
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:22,960
artifice of my of imagination and uh that we are unconscious of how we're doing it and um

269
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:31,359
and if we no longer boxing the mind in with a concept idea that it's just inside the skull or um there can feel

270
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:38,880
like there's no barrier no limit to the size of the mind and and uh when we

271
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:44,480
don't imagine a limit to this edges of thoughts the edges of the

272
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:49,920
Mind there can be a feeling of It kind of softening and relaxing so this

273
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:58,359
unifying and then relaxing um and with the risk of offering too many images uh it's it's um

274
00:38:58,359 --> 00:39:03,800
the image that worked well for me also is out of a a surface of a lake that's

275
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:09,720
spreading and becoming wider and Stiller and quieter not pushing it but kind of

276
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:15,880
allowing it so this organizing of the mind having the mind

277
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:21,200
oriented and then in that orientation bringing together the other

278
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:28,319
pieces of the mind so it's everything is working together settling

279
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:35,400
orienting organizing things and one way uh that I

280
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:42,440
in the last meditation that I emphasized was get everything kind of coming back

281
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:47,560
coming together in the Gathering Place the GA gathering spot that's at the

282
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:54,319
center of all things not to exclude anything not to be laser focused but

283
00:39:54,319 --> 00:40:00,079
kind of a soft round bold for attention where everything is

284
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:05,760
rolling down flowing down coming to where it comes together and everything

285
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:13,720
can settle there and be resting in the weight of that sides of that bowl resting in the in the lake Bottom the

286
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:20,200
bowl of the lake so um I hope that this some of what

287
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:27,520
I said today uh will be uh useful for some of you and and as

288
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:34,560
I said in the beginning of the meditation I don't expect that all that I'm teaching about suadi will be feel

289
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:39,680
right for all of you and that it's all a piece all kind of you know fit for who

290
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:46,000
you are somadi is a deeply personal phenomena it's very personal and unique

291
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:52,680
to each person how they discover understand their own mind body and heart

292
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:58,640
so that it becomes whole it becomes organized becomes fully

293
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,800
gather together so there's a feeling of being whole and here and absorbed in

294
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:09,280
what we're doing without being scattered in in distracting thoughts and

295
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:17,119
activities and feelings and um and uh so if anything

296
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:23,920
that I say doesn't work for you you're welcome not to use it but maybe it's even more important if it doesn't work

297
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:29,720
for you take some time to use it as a mirror to understand yourself better

298
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:35,920
what is it about your mind that maybe why it doesn't work and is there something else like it or different

299
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,800
thing that does work for you the more you become familiar with yourself and

300
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:46,880
what the elements of who you are are

301
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,240
then uh the easier it is to gather all those pieces and unify them into the

302
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:58,119
absorption that is samadi so um

303
00:41:58,119 --> 00:42:08,119
thank you very very much and uh um we'll continue tomorrow thank you
