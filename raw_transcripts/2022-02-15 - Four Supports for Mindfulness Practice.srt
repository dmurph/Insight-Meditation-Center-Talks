1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:06,879
i said my name is marilyn johnson i am from the netherlands and i live in

2
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,480
the u.s that's where the accent and the weird name is from

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,480
very happy to be here with some of you here in person and

4
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,720

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,359
valentine's day

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,200
um i want to thank also the volunteers who make it possible for us to be here in person at imc

7
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,600
and to make it possible for the recording and the youtube

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:52,320
stream so yeah big bow over for the volunteers thank you

9
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,879
and today i'd like to talk about for

10
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:06,400
ways for helpful supportive ways that that we can use in our practice

11
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,240
both on and off the cushion and i came up with those supports a

12
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:18,320
while ago when i was doing a retreat and they were very helpful reminders for

13
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,520
me to stay balanced and stay on course on the

14
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:31,600
path towards a more easeful more wholesome a more free life

15
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,720
and i still use them regularly in my practice and so i thought i'd share them and hope

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,320
that they are also of use to uh you or at least maybe

17
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:50,479
one of them so i'll briefly mention them first before i dive deeper into each of them

18
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:56,399
and the first might be familiar which is mindfulness

19
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:03,439
and mindfulness is of course the ability to be aware of what is happening while it is happening

20
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:09,640
and then the second support i'd like to talk about is relaxation

21
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,200
because if we can relax a little bit in our often stressful lives this can be very

22
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:24,239
helpful and i will give some tips and tools on on how to do that

23
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:32,239
and then the third support is kindness and i'd like to specifically focus on

24
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:40,080
kindness towards ourselves because i think that's something that in our society is

25
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:46,560
often difficult while it is vital for our well-being

26
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:53,920
and then the fourth support will be returned to the present moment

27
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,080
so we all recognize when we are meditation we just go off lost in thoughts of

28
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:08,640
past or future and just a simple reminder to be in the present moment can be very helpful

29
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,560
so mindfulness relaxation kindness and returning to the present

30
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,640
moment so first mindfulness

31
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,080
the buddha says mindfulness is always useful

32
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,120
so we can never go wrong by being mindful it's a very special quality of mind if

33
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,560
you think about it because it really helps us to be aware of things

34
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:43,760
we see what is happening while it is happening there's not really another

35
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:50,319
aspect of our mind that can do that and mostly most people

36
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,439
live in their lives without really knowing without really being present for

37
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:01,519
what is here right now what is happening in our body and and we live

38
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:08,000
mostly out of old patterns and conditionings and tendencies that we cultivated

39
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,439
through our life in our childhood and later on in life without really

40
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,040
knowing that we're doing that another simple example in my own life is

41
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,400
that um i used to like be super aversive towards cleaning

42
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,800
like if i had to clean my house i was like oh i have to go clean again and it's really really

43
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:36,960
needed again and i really don't want to do it and i was like days and days would build up like oh i

44
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,400
really need to clean and i really don't want to and then when i was actually cleaning i was still aversive towards

45
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,160
the cleaning i said i really want to do something else i really don't like this and through mindfulness practice i

46
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:53,440
started recognizing that better enough aversion towards cleaning

47
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:59,280
and i became aware of like oh maybe this is actually not so useful

48
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,800
maybe this is actually painful to be aversive the whole time and i had to see it maybe like 100 times

49
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:10,479
before it started to shift a little bit towards like letting it go and

50
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:17,360
being more present and just uh finding it a bit more neutral to to clean

51
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:23,680
and sometimes i now even like it sometimes it's even just a pleasant way of

52
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:30,400
being mindful of the body so it can actually change

53
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,039
so mindfulness can really help us to see all these old patterns these conditionings that we tend to live

54
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,880
from and we might find very unhelpful

55
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:52,080
unwholesome patterns and tendencies that are based on greed or aversion or delusion

56
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:58,960
delusion sometimes also called confusion so it's very useful to keep an eye out

57
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,319
for like oh is there any greed or wanting in the mind is there any aversion

58
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:11,840
is there any confusion present but we can also find very helpful and

59
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,360
wholesome states of mind when we start being mindful um

60
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:23,199
like patterns that are based on generosity and compassion and wisdom

61
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,840
so if we find those kind of veterans that is very useful to see because

62
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,840
if we say for them if we acknowledge them then they strengthen and they become more

63
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,160
so it's a very good thing to to really acknowledge those kind of patterns and

64
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,199
and tendencies as well

65
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,840
so as you understand probably this mindfulness sati in pali

66
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,080
can really help us gain insight into our own minds insight into what is governing our lives

67
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,199
those patterns and tendencies and maybe another super simple example

68
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:13,120
is when we just start meditating then we find out like oh the mind thinks a

69
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:19,120
lot i didn't know that like how much the mind is thinking um

70
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,120
so that's just there's these tiny little simple things that we can notice

71
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,720
and seeing these patterns is of course not always pleasant

72
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:40,639
we we often see things that are not so pleasant but sylvia borstein is a meditation

73
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:46,560
teacher she says mindfulness meditation doesn't change life

74
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:52,800
life remains as fragile and unpredictable as ever mindfulness meditation changes the

75
00:07:52,800 --> 00:08:00,560
heart's capacity to accept life as it is end code

76
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:07,039
so mindfulness can help us to grow this heart's capacity

77
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:13,919
to be with both the pleasant and the unpleasant to really

78
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,400
have the capacity to be with what is

79
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:26,160
mindfulness itself is a non-judgmental presence for life for mindfulness it doesn't really matter

80
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:33,039
what happens mindfulness itself doesn't have a judgment or doesn't need anything to be different than it is

81
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,880
it's just seeing life as it is in this present moment

82
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,240
so in a way we can learn to be not so reactive anymore

83
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:50,720
and not necessarily want want things to change not necessarily want to want to push it

84
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:57,839
away or pull it towards us but just to be there with it just to open to whatever it is however

85
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:05,040
difficult it might be i do have to say that is it's a training

86
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:10,399
it's not something that's like in an instant like we can do that

87
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,160
sometimes we just need some time in this process so it can be useful to practice with

88
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:21,680
easy things first and we don't start with the biggest thing in our life too open

89
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,800
to that but to start with maybe something small like if someone cuts you on the

90
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:31,920
highway and you feel anger coming up that you start with that anger

91
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:37,440
or when you have an itch during your meditation you you don't want to move so

92
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,959
you feel the irritation of the itch that kind of thing

93
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:48,080
might be useful and then slowly we will build some resilience

94
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,440
and bit by bit we have more and more capacity to be with

95
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:59,680
difficult things so patience is really important in this

96
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:05,839
process really see it as a gradual learning process

97
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,519
and i do want to say that we sometimes need to back off sometimes it's just overwhelming when what we

98
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:19,680
experience and it's just too much and then it can be just really skillful to turn away

99
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,720
from what we experience to to turn the attention away can be also very skillful

100
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:32,600
and wholesome at times that's an important side note to what i'm saying

101
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:39,920
but in the cases that it's not overwhelming and super difficult then when we do open to difficulty then

102
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,200
to help us get a little bit motivated we could ask ourselves like

103
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:52,640
do we want to live in ignorance or do we want to know what's happening even if it's maybe not so pleasant

104
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,959
because only when we know what is happening can we change it

105
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:07,440
and can we work towards a more wholesome way of living with a bit less reactivity maybe

106
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,880
so when we know we can start to learn from it and gain wisdom

107
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:21,600
and we can practice this knowing of what is happening both in formal meditation as well as in

108
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:29,759
our daily lives and especially in daily life we can see those patterns and conditionings

109
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:36,800
that that govern our our life and our activities and we can see simple things maybe like

110
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:42,240
craving for coffee in the morning or that we see that when we say hello to

111
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,800
our neighbor and that it's actually coming from our kind heart uh or we see the change of mood during

112
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,399
the day from energized to down to at ease to stressed

113
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,639
we can see all sorts of interesting things

114
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:12,480
so when we start to see more and more know more and more about our own minds and hearts

115
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:18,800
then we start to develop more and more wisdom and skillfulness in our lives

116
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:24,160
and one of my teachers said otisha talks about that there's this wisdom part in the

117
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:29,920
mind the wisdom is like this separate part in the mind just like like anger and and

118
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,120
love they're all like little entities in itself in the mind and then

119
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:42,000
those can grow or weakened hopefully with anger for example and then when we start to see things

120
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:48,639
with mindfulness then the wisdom part of our minds can start to learn from that

121
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,800
and one way of learning would be that what we see

122
00:12:54,800 --> 00:13:00,000
uh and what we're gonna see is that what leads to happiness

123
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,440
and freedom and peace and what leads to suffering

124
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:11,040
and that's a very important thing to start seeing like what i realized with the cleaning

125
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:18,079
that my response of being super aversive towards cleaning was actually not leading to happiness

126
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,959
but was contributing to more and more suffering in my life

127
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:31,760
so we start to see the painful habits and then start to let go of it because wisdom starts to

128
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:39,680
start to let go of his wisdom is the part of the mind that can let go it's not us that let's go let's go

129
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,720
so we don't necessarily meditate to get rid of a problem

130
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:57,120
but a more helpful way to see is that we meditate to start to understand and

131
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,560
to learn and to gain wisdom

132
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:11,680
so and this way you can make mindfulness

133
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,519
your whole your whole path your your whole life becomes your path because it becomes

134
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,959
this fertile ground for wisdom

135
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:28,959
that's what i wanted to say about mindfulness and then the second

136
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,920
second support i'd like to talk about is relaxation maybe you recognize that sometimes you

137
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:41,440
sit down for relaxation for for mindfulness or for meditation and you just sit there and you do your

138
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,600
thing but you don't really start anywhere you just sit there

139
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,519
so what often is very helpful is when we have a little bit of a beginning

140
00:14:53,519 --> 00:15:00,319
when we start our meditation and one of the things we can do to start would be to relax

141
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,680
because when we deliberately relax then

142
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:11,839
it will condition the next moment and next moment so every moment conditions the next moment

143
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:18,720
so if we deliberately relax then that helps us in our meditation

144
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,560
so we can also relax during daily life we don't have to wait till we sit down for meditation

145
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:32,079
um anytime you think about it you can relax

146
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,079
like when you drive to work or when you're in the bathroom or when

147
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:46,560
you're eating whenever you think about it but how do we do that

148
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:52,639
how do we relax like the first easy thing to do is to

149
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:59,120
relax the body because the body and mind are connected

150
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:05,759
so if you consciously relax your body then it will affect your mind as well

151
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:10,959
and one way to relax the body is to do a body scan um

152
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:18,399
so you just go through the body and um just touch on with your with your attention on each

153
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,680
part of the body and often there's a little bit of attention for the body

154
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:31,120
already relaxes the body and sometimes a direct invitation to the

155
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:39,519
body um helps the body to relax so you can say may the body relax

156
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:47,360
or if we have certain tensions in certain parts of the body we can we can invite those parts to relax

157
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:53,040
like the shoulders maybe the forehead or the little muscles around the eyes

158
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,920
sometimes get get tense and sometimes just breathing in and out

159
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:06,798
a bit deeper a few times can really relax as well

160
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:15,360
and we can also [Music] work with the mind to relax

161
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:20,798
and the simplest way is again an invitation you can say oh may the mind relax and

162
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,699
see if that does anything sometimes it will sometimes it won't

163
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:34,080
[Music] because what relaxation is actually what it actually is

164
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:40,400
is an absence of unwholesome mind states so when we

165
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:46,240
experience those unwholesome uh

166
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,520
roots for example greed wanting aversion delusion

167
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:58,240
um confusion that i was talking about earlier these cause all sorts of unwholesome

168
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:03,440
mind states to arise like wanting attachment

169
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:10,240
frustration despair sadness fear anger whatever it is that we experience if we

170
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:18,640
experience any of those kind of mind states then relaxation becomes a bit harder

171
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:25,840
because when these mind states subside then relaxation will automatically follow

172
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:34,320
so relaxation is about the absence of desire or aversion or confusion

173
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:41,919
so anytime you find yourself being not relaxed you could ask yourself like oh is there

174
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:47,039
maybe desire aversion or confusion present right now

175
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:54,720
is is there anything i want different right now because if we're in contention with reality it's really hard to relax

176
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:02,160
so when i was uh feeling tense about the cleaning

177
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,280
um i i couldn't relax you know i was feeling tense i

178
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:14,320
was a versatile or you know you you feel your whole body contracting uh

179
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:20,000
and then when that lets go then there can be relaxation and there

180
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,600
can be an ease in the cleaning and that's a whole process of course it's not that uh when once we recognize

181
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:33,840
oh oh i'm aversive or uh or i'm stressful that it lets go

182
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:39,200
immediately sometimes it does sometimes just a simple recognition is enough

183
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:44,480
but sometimes it doesn't sometimes we need to see those patterns like over and over again

184
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:50,520
just the recognizing of it is is the first step

185
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:00,000
and this of course ties back into the mindfulness and recognizing of what's happening um

186
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:08,480
is mindfulness so mindfulness is the basis for the relaxation in a way you can say

187
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,240
so with mindfulness we can start to recognize like uh

188
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:21,520
we can also start to see like oh i am not relaxed right now and indeed there is a version or wanting

189
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:27,520
maybe in the mind or you can see oh i'm actually really relaxed and the mind is pretty wholesome

190
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:33,360
right now you can see start to see that those things are related

191
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:41,039
connected so that's what i wanted to say about relaxation

192
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,799
and then the third support is kindness

193
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,679
so as i said i'd like to talk about kindness towards ourselves even though

194
00:20:53,679 --> 00:21:00,240
kindness towards others is very useful and wholesome of course so [Music]

195
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:05,520
fantastic also to practice kindness towards others

196
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:13,120
but i think for a lot of people here in the west um [Music]

197
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:18,640
yeah kindness for ourselves is a bit underdeveloped like

198
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:25,240
many of us are you know somewhat unkind towards ourselves we experience

199
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:31,520
self-judgement or self-hatred or or self-loathing [Music]

200
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,240
these can be pretty strong patterns of the mind

201
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:43,039
and the buddha says hatred never ends with hatred by love

202
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:48,880
alone it ends this is an ancient truth

203
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:54,320
so sometimes we try to [Music]

204
00:21:54,320 --> 00:22:01,360
overcome these patterns of self-judgment or self-hatred with hatred like oh i don't

205
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:06,400
want this better i it needs to go away um

206
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:11,760
but it doesn't really work because then we're trying to end our hatred with hatred

207
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:17,760
and hatred is a little bit of a strong word aversion is kind of a milder form of

208
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:23,919
hatred you could say so these patterns we can actually

209
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,760
overcome by kindness kindness towards ourselves

210
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:36,559
i would say that developing this this kindness for ourselves is actually

211
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:45,360
for westerners often a fast track to more ease and more peace in our lives

212
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,360
and i do admit it's not easy to develop this

213
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:58,080
it can be it can be quite a challenge as this especially because these

214
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:04,400
patterns can be of for example self judgment can be very strong but

215
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:10,400
we all are somewhere in our practice and we all have to start somewhere

216
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:16,159
so even if it's not easy and a lot of those kind of patterns come up it's

217
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:23,320
still worth it to incrementally try to practice this

218
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:30,320
i think that trying to cultivate the kindness will be beneficial

219
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,640
for almost anyone even if you already feel kind to your towards yourself you can always practice

220
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,280
a little bit more

221
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:50,760
if you imagine being kind to yourself how that influence like every aspect of your life

222
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:59,440
and there are several ways to do this to practice this kindness towards

223
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:05,760
ourselves and the first one is very simple that it would be

224
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:12,640
just a simple intention so we can have the intention

225
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:19,840
to be kind just the intention to cultivate kindness

226
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,000
because intention shapes

227
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:32,559
shapes our mind and shapes the next moment in the next one with what i said with the conditionings of

228
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:39,120
the moments so it's a very powerful tool i can use that in all sorts of settings

229
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:45,679
not only with kindness but it can be very strong a strong way to cultivate it because the

230
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:51,600
mind will start to direct us in that direction even though we might be miles away from kindness

231
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:58,880
right now it will give us just the dire interaction it's like trying to advance those big big tinker

232
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:04,320
ships trying to uh to change the course you know you might

233
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:10,880
not might not notice it much in the beginning but every tiny bit that you pull on the wheel is going to uh going

234
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:16,400
to have an effect in the long run

235
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:24,400
so intention we can use intention and then the second way we can develop kindness is

236
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:31,760
through using what is called meta meditation and metta is one of the brahma viharas

237
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:39,520
the heavenly abodes that's translated as loving kindness meditation

238
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,760
and i think most of you are probably familiar with meta meditation

239
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:51,440
but just to sum it up it's it's a buddhist meditation form

240
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:58,960
that uses phrases to generate this hard quality of loving kindness

241
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:05,600
so we would express phrases it's not out loud but just in the mind

242
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:13,520
like a wish for ourselves for example may i be happy or may i live with ease

243
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:20,559
or may i be healthy and what i said about relaxation we can

244
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:27,760
start with relaxation if we do our meditation we could also start with kindness

245
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:33,120
that's a choice i mean you don't have to know all everything but sometimes you can maybe start with like

246
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:42,080
relaxation sometimes she can start with some meta practice with some wishes for yourself

247
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:50,880
and you can even try this in your daily life like also whenever you think about it

248
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:56,799
use a phrase may i be happy i mean i live with ease

249
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:03,279
um i use it a lot during my daily life just when i feel a little bit down or

250
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:08,799
something i just realized oh i can do a little bit of meta for myself just a few phrases

251
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:15,760
and it sometimes just lightens the heart up right away it's not like an instant

252
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:22,159
an instant cure for everything but it can sometimes just give us a little bit more light in the hearts whenever we

253
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:30,000
need it and then the the third way to cultivate

254
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,159
kindness would be to pay attention to

255
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,600
when we are kind to ourselves and when we are not kind to ourselves

256
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:49,360
so this also would require some mindfulness so being mindful of body and mind state

257
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:55,200
of mind and also this

258
00:27:55,200 --> 00:28:01,600
is a learning process we can learn and grow from those moments that

259
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:07,760
we are not kind to ourselves and we can see those moments over and

260
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,080
over and over again and we start to recognize the better and static that it comes from

261
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:20,640
and the mind might start to realize at some point that it's not that great to experience

262
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:29,200
unkindness towards ourselves the mind starts to realize that it's painful and unpleasant

263
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:35,200
and that's what what i said about gaining wisdom [Music] this

264
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:40,320
the mind recognizing that it's painful is wisdom at work

265
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:47,200
and if wisdom wisdom starts to grow then it might at some point steadily

266
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,960
slowly let go of these patterns or just a little bit here and there

267
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:00,159
so wisdom can really work in the background it's not something that we would

268
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:06,880
uh easily see for like it's like with that big

269
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:12,799
big tanker ship uh like only when we are way down

270
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:19,760
down the road down the road not really a road but our way down our path we see at some point oh we've actually

271
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:25,440
steered so much in the in the wholesome direction now i start to see that

272
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:31,440
my part actually changed compared to where i came from it is something that

273
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:38,320
that can be a very slow process but at some point we might see some effects

274
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,960
can be weeks can be months can be years

275
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:51,360
so an example that sharon salzberg gives she's a meta

276
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:57,200
meta meta teacher fei pasana teacher as well but she does a lot with meta

277
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:06,240
and she describes in her book on love and kindness that [Music] she once was on a retreat long retreats

278
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,399
and she was doing only meta only meta for herself and

279
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,480
during that retreat after some weeks or a month or so i don't remember she she got a message that something was

280
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,520
wrong at home so she needed to leave the retreat early and she didn't feel any

281
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:29,919
meta she had like set all these weeks for for nothing she thought because she didn't feel anything

282
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:36,799
and just this meta practice was just not working for her she was thinking so she was packing her stuff

283
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:44,240
and she dropped a bottle and it just shattered all over the floor and her thought was something like

284
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:52,240
it's okay dear and she realized wow metta meta just came up for myself

285
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:59,039
um and she just like before her retreat she would never have thought anything like that but now

286
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:05,840
the meta even that she didn't notice anything during the practice it had worked somehow

287
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:14,240
so we never know what happens in the background when we practice this kindness for ourselves maybe at

288
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,679
some point we have a kind thought too

289
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:26,960
and of course we can be aware of those moments that we're unkind or towards ourselves but it's

290
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:33,120
also very important to see those moments that we are kind towards ourselves

291
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:39,039
and really take those moments in really savor the moments

292
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:44,640
because if we savor it at any wholesome state also with kindness we really

293
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:51,279
reinforce that state of mind when we really really enjoy it and feel it um

294
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:58,640
then it can can grow more and that's not an ego trip at all

295
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:04,640
it's actually the building of a healthy self and we kind of need a healthy sense of

296
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,720
self uh before we can let go of ourselves like in buddhism we talk about all the

297
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:15,760
not self aspect of life but yeah it's we need an unhealthy sense of

298
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:21,200
self before we kind of can let go of ourselves so

299
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,840
this kindness towards ourselves is actually contributing to

300
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:34,320
uh through this aspect as well of not self it's very beneficial for a wholesome

301
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,278
and free life

302
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:48,399
so that was what i wanted to say about kindness and then we get to the last

303
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:55,720
support for our practice for today which is to return to the present moment

304
00:32:56,240 --> 00:33:01,840
i'll quote the buddha again don't chase the past or long for the

305
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:08,640
future the past is left behind the future is not yet reached

306
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:14,159
right where it is have insight into whatever experience appears

307
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,799
end quote

308
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:27,200
like how much of our lives do we spend not in the present moment how much of our lives are we

309
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:35,440
off into daydreaming about the future or worrying about the future planning

310
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:42,240
or we're ruminating about the past thinking about this fun vacation that we had some years

311
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:48,960
ago or this difficult conversation we had yesterday or whatever it is

312
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:54,159
and of course we do need to think about the future we do need to make plans

313
00:33:54,159 --> 00:34:00,720
like else we wouldn't all be here or we wouldn't have turned the computer on to look at the dharma talk

314
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:07,600
um so there is some use in you know thinking

315
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:13,358
about the future or the past but often

316
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:19,040
like a big chunk of the time that we are lost in future or past

317
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:25,599
it's just this habit pattern of thinking thinking thinking but it doesn't really contribute much to

318
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:32,839
our lives so being in a present moment and really

319
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:38,240
experiencing this moment like what's happening right now in the

320
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:45,520
body what's happening right now in the mind can be very skillful

321
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:51,440
um and can be very grounding and stabilizing

322
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:58,079
and if you think about it like is there anything

323
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:03,280
do you ever get anything else than this present moment

324
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,280
not really right we always get only this moment and this one and this one

325
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:17,320
our lives is just this flow of present moments everlasting present moments

326
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:25,440
so even if we plan for the future or if we think about the past or um

327
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:31,839
or worry or want something or have aversion towards something in the past or in the future

328
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:40,480
and the only thing we have is is those worries or wants or feelings or thoughts in the present moment

329
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:46,400
and it's even if you think like oh i want like let's say i want a pizza right now

330
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:52,079
like you're never gonna get that pizza um in this present moment it's always

331
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,760
wanting to get something in the future once you get it it's not this one thing anymore of this

332
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:01,280
moment if that makes sense

333
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:09,119
so it's important to recognize that we can't really escape this present

334
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:17,200
moment even though we're off in thoughts and about future of past

335
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:24,240
and this returning to the present moment is also

336
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:31,040
a simple recognition like oh i was gone i was lost in the thoughts about the future or the past

337
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:37,599
so it also involves mindfulness again and often when we recognize that we are

338
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:44,960
already back in the present moment and and next to that we just see oh i

339
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:50,960
was gone and now i'm back we can also more actively tune back into this

340
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:58,079
present moment like uh we can check into what the body is like now like oh

341
00:36:58,079 --> 00:37:05,119
it's like this right now there's maybe some tension here or there's some softness there or some bar

342
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:10,320
end or whatever it is and we can tune actively into what's

343
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:16,720
happening in the mind and it doesn't have to be like this big

344
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:22,960
elaborate investigation it can just be a tiny moment in our daily lives or

345
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:28,320
if we're meditating then we might do it a little bit more elaborately tune back in the present moment and try

346
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:34,400
to stay there but in our daily lives it might be just a moment like oh yeah the body is like this right now or the mind

347
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,680
is like this you could try it even right now when i'm

348
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:47,040
talking tune into the body tune into the mind the present moment sensations

349
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,839
recognizing it's like this right now

350
00:37:57,359 --> 00:38:03,359
so that's what i wanted to say about the

351
00:38:03,359 --> 00:38:10,560
returning to the present moment and like what you can see throughout

352
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:19,160
all these supports is that mindfulness is actually the basis for the other three supports

353
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:26,960
so we need mindfulness to recognize is there any stress

354
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,880
present is there an unwholesome mind state present or do i need to relax a little bit more

355
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:40,480
the first the first support to relax or mindfulness can recognize are we kind

356
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:49,200
towards ourselves or is there some harsh harshness or judgments in our minds

357
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:56,000
and mindfulness can help us to learn from these patterns and tendencies of harshness or judgment

358
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:03,838
and maybe eventually let go and and cultivate some kindness

359
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:09,839
and mindfulness can recognize if we're off into future or past

360
00:39:09,839 --> 00:39:15,400
it can help us remember to return to this present moment

361
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:24,000
and so if you have bandwidth for only one of those four supports then you can pick mindfulness because then you cover

362
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:29,440
all of them basically and mindfulness is always useful as the

363
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:36,160
buddha says so but you can also

364
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,720
pick and choose or see which one resonates most with you right now or which one you feel like would be

365
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:48,880
beneficial right now or what i do is i've written them down i use a digital

366
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:54,640
notebook and they're there when every time i open that notebook they're they're clearly

367
00:39:54,640 --> 00:40:00,800
there and i see them like several times a day and then i remind then it reminds me

368
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,599
like oh yeah right i was supposed to be mindful or i take this conscious moment to relax

369
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:14,880
the body and relax the mind i fight the body and the mind to relax or check in is there any aversion or

370
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:20,079
detention present or then i see the kindness

371
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:26,000
reminder and like oh yeah i'm supposed to be kind to hurt myself let's cultivate a little bit of kindness

372
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:32,319
and sometimes i'm really stressed out and you know my to-do list is right there and i'm like oh i need to do all these things and like oh yeah kindness

373
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:35,920
oh yeah i can be kind towards myself

374
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:44,319
or i uh consciously return to the present moment seeing that reminder like oh yeah i only

375
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:49,599
have to take care of this moment and then this moment i don't have to think about like four

376
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:53,800
weeks from now just this moment

377
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:03,760
and of course there are many other supports that we can use

378
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:09,680
for our lives and our meditation practice these are just four that i came up with

379
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,560
that were very helpful and useful for me

380
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:21,440
and some other supports that you can think of might be like the other brand of harass compassion

381
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:26,480
joy equanimity maybe

382
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:32,839
support like acceptance or patience or

383
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:38,800
impermanence might be useful and so we all have different

384
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:44,960
conditionings different habits patterns and tendencies and we all need different types of

385
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:51,119
supports in different times so we don't have to be attached to the four

386
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:56,319
that i talked about today

387
00:41:56,640 --> 00:42:02,720
yeah i just wanted to share that they've been helpful for me and how

388
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:09,680
they can be helpful for you maybe as well so the invitation is to discover

389
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,880
for yourself what is supportive for you in your practice in your life

390
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,200
and that might change over time as well

391
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:27,920
i'd like to end with a poem it's by the poet and teacher

392
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:33,839
kaveri patel and a poem is called dear you

393
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,280
dear you you who always have so many things to do

394
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:48,400
so many places to be your mind spinning like fan blades at

395
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:54,960
high speed each moment always a blur because you're never still

396
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:02,640
i know you're tired i also know it's not your fault the constant brain bus is like a swarm

397
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:10,319
of bees threatening to sting if you close your eyes you've forgotten something again

398
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:16,720
you need to prepare for that or else you should have done that differently

399
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:23,359
what if you closed your eyes would the world fall apart without you

400
00:43:23,359 --> 00:43:29,040
or would your mind become the open sky flock of thoughts flying across the

401
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:34,880
sunrise as you just watched and smiled

402
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:42,760
thank you for your kind attention
