1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:06,799
good morning everyone welcome here this

2
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,679
morning um my wife read me um headlines from a news site that

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,199
she was reading and the headline said something

4
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,320
like uh to have a happy life don't be

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:31,880
frightened stop being frightened that sounds nice

6
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:39,440
and but I also thought that's great that that's maybe what my topic is

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:48,719
today because that topic is uh a very buddhistic topic and it's the topic of

8
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:56,320
refuge and um so those of you who don't know much about Buddhism it'll become clear why you know how Central it is and

9
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:03,040
refuge is and the idea is to um often we talk about going to Refuge or going in

10
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:10,320
Refuge going to some place that's safe or some place that's protected and

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,640
um and uh and that can be both inspiring to some people to know there can be

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,439
safety to be had in this dangerous world world we live in and for some people it

13
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:28,360
could seem kind of offputting because it seems like we're it's withdrawing it's pulling back into some place that we're

14
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:33,759
going to be all safe and comfortable and not really in the world how it

15
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,759
is so I'll tell you um a story from some years

16
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:45,880
ago um that just delighted me when I understood what was going on kind

17
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:51,920
of got all turned on a moment so I uh I was in a

18
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:59,560
training and um we invited a trainer to come and uh as a way of beginning our

19
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:08,440
time together the trainer said take out a piece of paper and pen and write down uh

20
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:15,239
what do you need to feel safe here and um and I thought this is okay

21
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:22,239
this is good to cre safety and if we have safety then we could all share and be together nicely and and I kind of

22
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:29,200
imagined we would share what we had written and that would create community and safety in itself or something like

23
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,840
that so everyone was very Earnest and was writing away what they needed for

24
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,920
safety and then uh she said okay and so then everyone came back and was sitting

25
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:47,400
there and ready for the next thing and she says she said okay now you bring

26
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,480
that with you if you need safety you bring that

27
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:00,640
with you that very thing so she kind of turned it around in the way that no one expected it and as you turned it around

28
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:07,040
kind of to make each person responsible for themselves to create the safety that they would have

29
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,799
there now this also could be inspiring and it could also be off-putting because there are real

30
00:03:13,799 --> 00:03:19,920
dangers in the world and what now now I'm responsible I've been people have been dumping on me forever and now I'm

31
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:27,360
supposed to be the one and um

32
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:33,200
so but there is a refuge there 's a place to find protection and safety that

33
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:41,280
is not withdrawing from the world but actually allows us to be in the world more fully and it's a little bit like

34
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:49,920
and maybe it's a little bit too pedestrian of a metaphor but um most of us most of you

35
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:56,480
are here I think great majority of you in order to come here today you probably

36
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,760
put on shoes and putting on your shoes you're

37
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:09,519
protecting your feet so it's a little bit easier to walk around and get here by having protected feet safe feet it's

38
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,319
actually easier to go where you want to go in this world and we don't say we're you you

39
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:21,840
we're take we're giving Refuge protection to our feet and it's worried like well now you're you're disappearing

40
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,759
you're not available to us you you're you're disconnecting from the world you know this is really a problem these

41
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:31,560
Buddhists who wear shoes

42
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,080
uh no it's uh it actually allows us to step into the world more freely and more

43
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:43,960
available for World more connected rather than going on so gingerly and and

44
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:49,759
so it's the same way with this Refuge this Refuge that Buddhists

45
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:58,280
discover that to have that Refuge actually allows us to go into the world better and Fuller it's not a

46
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,120
withdrawal and um so uh the the usually there's

47
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:10,080
considered to be three refuges and these are called the Buddha

48
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:16,080
the Dharma and the S so the Buddha is the Exemplar and the founder of Buddhism

49
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,840
Exemplar of what's possible he's more important that he's the Exemplar than it is he is the

50
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,919
founder of Buddhism he's the example of how thoroughly a person can become happy

51
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:32,600
and free there's Dharma which are his

52
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:38,600
teachings for sure that point to that possibility but also the underlying kind

53
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:45,880
of patterns of life that we tap into in order to find our inspiration in order

54
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:52,120
to find our safety and then there's a sa which is the community of

55
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:59,479
practitioners especially the community of practitioners who have really tasted the freedom that Buddhism is about but

56
00:05:59,479 --> 00:06:08,000
it's so it could be any of our fellow practitioners and um and then the um the

57
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:17,240
way that it's usually chanted it's actually one of the core rituals of Buddhism where people will chant

58
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:22,050
[Music]

59
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:36,919
um and it goes on and uh the gami the end is a literal meaning means to

60
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:43,960
walk and um buddham is Buddha and saranam sarana is

61
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:50,039
refuge and with the way the grammar is it's actually you have fair amount of

62
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:55,199
choice about how you put it together grammatically the most common perhaps in

63
00:06:55,199 --> 00:07:00,319
English is I go for Refuge to the Buddha

64
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:08,720
but uh what I'd like to offer today is something different I walk in Refuge together with

65
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:14,840
the Buddha I walk in Refuge with the Dharma

66
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,400
I walk in Refuge with the S and the word walk is kind of a

67
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,759
metaphor for moving through life um when just saying it in my mind I

68
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:33,919
come come um reminded of a Native American religious idea that is to walk

69
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,560
in Beauty it's inspiring and for Buddhists we say walk in

70
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:45,280
refuge and we have company for that process we have companionship we're not

71
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:51,919
doing it alone their support and so we walk in Refuge with

72
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:58,240
the example of the Buddha with the guidance of the Buddha with the the way

73
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:04,159
uh the way leading the Buddha provided we go for Refuge with the

74
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:11,440
Dharma we go we go we walk in this world with a support with a companionship of

75
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:19,479
these teachings and then with the community and this idea of walking is

76
00:08:19,479 --> 00:08:24,800
something that each person needs to do themselves so bring your own safety

77
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:30,840
bring your own Refuge you have to do something you it's not like just this going for Refuge just not sitting you

78
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:37,320
know on your couch it's looking at wait waiting for something to protect you and like I'll be fine if I just hold on

79
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:42,399
tight to these things it does require stepping into the world it does require

80
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:47,760
living a life A Life That's dangerous to some degree a life that has its

81
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:55,839
challenges a life where maybe the biggest challenge is you yourself to yourself and so to step into that and

82
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,959
see it to hold it to be with it to walk in this

83
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:07,040
world and so that comes to something that seldom talk about in Buddhism and

84
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:14,519
there is a fourth Refuge that the Buddha taught the Buddha never actually told

85
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:21,440
anyone that they were supposed to engage the Buddha Dharma as The

86
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:29,959
Refuge the one thing he did say in terms of Refuge he said make yourself a refuge

87
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,839
and so the fourth Refuge is yourself and so that goes back again you

88
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:41,640
know to be safe bring it with you or to save maybe nicer uh we have to find

89
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:47,320
something it's up to us to find a way of being in the world that we create we

90
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:54,959
make a refuge and eventually as we make ourselves a refuge we make ourselves a

91
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,560
refuge for others we we become someone who's safe for others we makes ourselves

92
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,240
someone that we then accompanying and supporting others in their deep process

93
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:14,640
of becoming free becoming themselves and um so there are three

94
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:20,560
different kind of main meanings that this walking in

95
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:28,320
Refuge uh implies it implies an

96
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:33,920
understanding something that provides meaning gives meaning to our life and

97
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:40,519
understanding to our life it implies um something that is

98
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:45,680
motivating something that we can commit ourselves to or be devoted

99
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:51,760
to and it implies some form of inspiration something that's heartfelt

100
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:57,800
some kind of uh the classic language in the tradition is some kind of some kind of

101
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:02,880
gladness or joy that uh bubbles up from the

102
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:09,120
inside so those are the three kind of elements of what means to walk in

103
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:16,680
refuge and so it there there's an understanding we come to so it's not magical thinking oh if I just trust just

104
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:22,839
trust the Buddha without knowing what you're doing the idea is you have to understand something and that

105
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:28,320
understanding doesn't come from reading books it doesn't come from listening to

106
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:35,480
my talk the real it might it might be somehow a byproduct of it these things but the

107
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:41,959
real understanding comes from yourself you begin seeing and experiencing for

108
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:48,760
yourself uh uh you know something profound something very

109
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:56,040
meaningful and for different people this can be different things I don't want to be very careful I don't uh only give one

110
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:03,200
example or just give it leave you an impression there's only one thing I can mean for some people it's seeing

111
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,880
dramatically clearly how they are contributing to their own

112
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:15,600
suffering by what they're clinging to attached to what they're resisting what they're fighting what they're rebelling

113
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:22,079
against what they are running away from uh and um it's a whole slew of

114
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:28,399
things and to see that so clearly wow I thought it was the world that was doing

115
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:36,240
it but I'm contributing to this in the way and lo and behold I see that it's

116
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:42,399
possible it's difficult I might be I'm inspired I'm

117
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:48,680
motivated I know it's possible to chip away at this way in which I'm

118
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,920
contributing to my suffering even if it takes me a

119
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,920
lifetime that's how I want to walk I want to move through this life engage in

120
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:05,000
this life so I stay close enough attentative

121
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:12,760
enough to my inner life so I begin chipping away at how I keep adding

122
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:19,000
to my suffering adding to my challenges how I keep making it worse for

123
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:25,920
myself and so the inspiration there might be the understanding there is

124
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:31,959
maybe the motivation is encapsulated by the expression I won't make it

125
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:37,800
worse no matter what's going on I'm not going to make it worse and for some

126
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,480
people that's maybe a really great and great Poss

127
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:50,959
seems like that's at least that's possible I can't make it better that's too high a bar that's that

128
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:58,040
just seems too much to make it better but at least I'll stop making it worse that's how I'll walk through this

129
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:03,839
world and we'll chip away at it for other people it is something

130
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:09,759
better that they discover through this practice and um and I was trying and

131
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:15,800
thinking about this talk I was trying to remember for me what words would I use to describe what I discovered because

132
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:21,160
there was something positive that I found that really changed my direction of my life through this

133
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:27,440
practice and um and I I couldn't quite settle on one word when I was younger I

134
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:34,040
used the word integrity for it but not an ethical Integrity it was more of a sense of feeling whole like all of

135
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:39,480
myself was there I felt complete and I had never felt that way in my really in

136
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:44,560
my life in this regular way I started to be awakened through my

137
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:51,480
meditation and it wasn't that I was n less neurotic or less troubled or my Minds

138
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,600
got quieter because I used to think a lot but there was something about the

139
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:03,959
the being present for it that something felt complete something felt like I'm I'm including it all here and this

140
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:10,920
inclusion of all of who I am wors and all that just created a sense of Health

141
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,880
a sense of well-being a sense of healing or something it might have been a feeling

142
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:24,560
of peace I felt more peaceful at ease I might have been more um feeling at home

143
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:31,160
here in this being and this world there were variety things I was starting to feel through my meditation

144
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:36,759
practice and that became important enough for me that it kind of turned my

145
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:42,720
whole life in a New Direction and at first it was uh just a small turn of the

146
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:48,959
ocean liner but then slowly it got bigger and bigger turn and that was I

147
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:56,839
want to now have this whatever I was discovering in meditation this is so important this has so much value so it

148
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:02,720
feels like nothing else is richer or or true this way of being at least for me

149
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:09,600
as I walk through the world I want to walk through the world with this way of being because this seems

150
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:15,639
right and um now I want to find out how to do that in the world I want to find

151
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:22,199
out how to be working outside of meditation how can I have what I have in meditation how can I have this in my

152
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:29,079
daily life and that became a multi-year process and I made step by step I went

153
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:35,759
deeper into Buddhism not to get more out of Buddhism or be more buddhistic but I

154
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:42,040
wanted to answer this Quest I had which is how do I live from this place of at

155
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,560
homeness or completeness or peace or Integrity that I was feeling can may

156
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:52,639
live this way in my whole life because that seemed valuable and

157
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,600
important and so I had an understanding which is part of Refuge

158
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,038
that it was possible to live a different way it was a possible to live a way that

159
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:11,120
was settled at ease at peace I was motivated to do so Not only

160
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:16,360
was I motivated I was committed but the commitment was not

161
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:22,600
like hard and fast I didn't even know I was committed it was like this you know this

162
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:29,480
is what I'm doing I mean I it wasn't even deci I I I didn't even have those words in my mind I'm saying this in

163
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,919
retrospect looking back at my life when I was my early 20s that yes that's what

164
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:44,720
I was dedicated to this is what I was going to do and um and it it was

165
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:51,919
heartfelt there was an inspiration to do it it just felt so good and in in fact the truth was that

166
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:57,320
both of these two things positive and negative motivated me I could see the

167
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:04,159
more I felt better how I was making it worse for myself and so I was inspired not to make

168
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,400
it worse and and I could see what this

169
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:17,760
better way of being was and I wanted to stay close to it and um and this and and it wasn't

170
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:22,960
just hedonistic it wasn't just selfish to feel you know just better and not

171
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:29,400
feel worse it had a much deeper kind of feeling of rightness because because it

172
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,960
was almost like this is what allowed me to be stop being selfish this allowed me

173
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:40,799
to stop being self preoccupied and caught my my neurosis and it was clear

174
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:46,880
that what was being born in this process was uh a greater sense of community a

175
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,919
greater sense of compassion a greater sense of care for the world around me

176
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,799
that I didn't have before I started this process so for me the process these

177
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:05,240
three different aspects of Refuge you know very alive it involved an

178
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:12,120
understanding and for some people you know it's related to the topic I talked about last week the four noble truths

179
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:17,200
for some people that's make encapsulates it beautifully for them that this new

180
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:23,039
understanding and it encompassed the motivation and it encompassed something

181
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,400
that was felt heartfelt or in or an inspiration that

182
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:35,640
oh this this is like makes me happy this seems right this feels good that doesn't mean that there was

183
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:41,919
clear sailing for me and I just kind of like just you

184
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:48,880
know um I had a lot of ups and downs a lot of challenges as I went through this

185
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:57,200
practice but I never doubted it and so that's was The Refuge I walked

186
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:05,600
in Refuge ref I walked in refuge in the practice in refuge in myself that I was

187
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:10,919
going to do it because I kind of could see that what this is about I can't

188
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:17,559
contract it out for someone else to do it for me I had to do it I had to show up I had

189
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:23,600
to show up every day in some ways you know every minute to show up for this

190
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:30,240
life and then and then I had to um

191
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:36,039
um you know keep walking the walk keep walking the walk keep doing it

192
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:43,520
keep finding it keep discovering it here and now and so this idea of so then

193
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:49,799
going in Refuge walking in Refuge means that we're accompanied we're surrounded

194
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:56,039
we're we're filled by um something that's profoundly important something

195
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:02,799
that's invaluable and there stay close to that to be reminded of that so when I was in

196
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:08,480
my 20s for a while actually I was living in a place where they had mananita

197
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:14,799
berries and I picked all these dry berries and and then I very went to the

198
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:21,640
shop and clearly and and kind of flattened out little sides of

199
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:27,200
them so I could drill a hole through them and then I made um Mala beads from

200
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:32,440
them so made my own kind of you know you know little thing I carried on my arm

201
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:38,960
for a while and um and it wasn't because I was showing off that I was a

202
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:47,480
Buddhist it there was they were kind of they were kind of big and long you know like many beads uh it was kind of

203
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:55,480
awkward and so when I I I was going to do anything I had to I was always being reminded I was this awkward thing it's

204
00:21:55,480 --> 00:22:03,200
you know bracelet kind of thing was there and so so it was reminding me of Refuge reminding me of the practice

205
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:09,080
because I needed help sometimes to remind oh okay remember remember and sometimes I would go through and you

206
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,679
this thing where you you're like prayer beads I you just count them through you know and I wasn't doing anything else

207
00:22:14,679 --> 00:22:21,720
but doing that just just you know running through them with my thumbs um

208
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:27,520
but that too reminded me kept me connected and remember stay here stay

209
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,440
here I know people who really can't concentrate in meditation and so they

210
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:39,000
find that having these you know Mala beads is like prayer beads and every

211
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:44,559
time they breathe they do one and then they stay

212
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:52,240
connected so what does it take to walk in

213
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:57,559
refuge and so it's important in Buddhism this topic of Refuge because it's a

214
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:02,799
turning point for someone it's some it's a point where the that the Dharma

215
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:08,200
becomes the practice becomes maybe the centrally important thing in their

216
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:14,200
life uh where they have a lot of faith a lot of inspiration a lot of love for

217
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:19,840
this and some people say that it's nothing more important than

218
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,050
this and then other people say what the spouse says what

219
00:23:26,050 --> 00:23:30,510
[Laughter]

220
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:37,720
your kids say what um nothing is more

221
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,360
important because we're so much

222
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,760
better and more present and maybe even more have more love for all those people

223
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:54,960
in our life so they get you can tell them you know it's a

224
00:23:55,000 --> 00:24:00,640
trade-off okay if you don't want if you want you to be the most you're gonna if

225
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:05,919
you want you to be my most important thing let me tell you the trade-off if

226
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:11,600
you're the most important thing I will not be so happy and then I'll not be able to offer

227
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:17,200
you as much love but if you allow me to have this practice be the most important

228
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:22,960
thing then I'll have so much more for you that's the

229
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,520
trade-off and if you need to bargain negotiate

230
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:35,240
you know that's one one approach but so um so Refuge refuge in

231
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:41,760
the Buddha Refuge with the Buddha Refuge with the Dharma Refuge with the S and I

232
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,120
like this wording I go I walk and refuge with the

233
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:53,200
Buddha I'm the one who's walking I'm the one who's engaging I have to do

234
00:24:53,200 --> 00:25:00,320
it and um so like it's the kind of like these shoes

235
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:05,919
if you don't wear them they can't protect you you have to

236
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:11,200
walk if you want the shoes to protect you you have to walk if you want the

237
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:16,320
Dharma to protect you you have to go and enter into this

238
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:24,600
world and um with all of who you are so this quote that I started by

239
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:30,919
there was something like to live a happy life stop being

240
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:37,039
frightened I'd like to offer something different to live a happy

241
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:41,440
life bring all of yourself

242
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:47,360
along bring all of you to the table bring all of you in as you walk

243
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:54,039
including your fear hold it all together let it all be here and that's the

244
00:25:54,039 --> 00:26:02,200
possibility and why I think this Dharma this practice is so powerful so wonderful it's not to reject any part of

245
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:10,320
ourselves but finding a way to walk in the world to be in the world to be ourselves where we bring all of it along

246
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:17,960
and doing so live a wise life doing so live a

247
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:25,919
life that doesn't harm ourselves or others that's at the heart of the

248
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:33,200
Dharma so those are my thoughts today about this topic of Refuge so we have

249
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:38,279
about 15 minutes before the scheduled end if any of you would like to ask any

250
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:46,640
questions or have comments about this or you're welcome to ask or so

251
00:26:53,480 --> 00:27:00,120
speak um I'm wondering if you have any suggestions on Refuge hug with the S

252
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:03,039
when you're by

253
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:10,080
yourself are you ever by yourself that ever

254
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:17,320
happen um physically yes oh physically oh

255
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:24,880
physically that happens occasionally I think that the the the

256
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:31,880
classic practice of doing that is to bring the s to mind think about them remember them

257
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:37,159
consider them you know some people have um pictures on they have little altar at

258
00:27:37,159 --> 00:27:44,440
home and some people have pictures of the Buddha well pictures uh they have maybe of their

259
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:51,360
teachers teachers that Inspire them um so so find some way to remember

260
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:59,000
recall maybe going for a walk and thinking about it so being intentional and this is an example uh uh where they

261
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:04,120
answer these kinds of anwers always um what how are you going to walk now what

262
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:10,640
are you going to do how are you going to be active in the process of looking for what you're asking for and so these are

263
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:16,279
some of the ways to bring them to mind maybe write a letter to the

264
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:21,760
S you ever written a letter to your s write say write a letter you don't

265
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:28,679
have to mail it but that might bring it all to mind and the connection you have and make it

266
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:35,639
come kind of come alive in your heart in a ni way nice way thank

267
00:28:42,919 --> 00:28:48,320
you hello everyone thank you um my question is

268
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,320
about finding Refuge during conflict during a moment

269
00:28:54,320 --> 00:29:00,039
that your body is triggered

270
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:05,799
and how to work through that rather than walking away from it

271
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:13,200
yes well I mean there's so much to be said about that you know very important

272
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:19,080
topic um depends a lot about who it who you're with who who the conflict is with

273
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:25,000
and you know and what what's possible um there are times where

274
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:30,039
because of who I was with I I asked can we take a

275
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:35,320
pause and uh I think a few times I've actually asked you know can I can I step

276
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:41,320
away for a while I need to kind of be be with myself and process this so we I can

277
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:48,080
come back and process this with you because you know I'm a little bit I don't know my wife says I'm equally

278
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:53,760
introverted and extroverted but so there are times where I need to really go off

279
00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,159
by myself and really process it ints often need to be time alone it's hard with introverts and extroverts because

280
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:07,559
extroverts want to do it right now in person and that's what works best for them and so you have to explain you know

281
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:14,080
I have a need I I want to take care of this I want to be honest and and really come to the bottom of this but in order

282
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:19,840
for me to do this effectively I need to pause and uh sometimes I've done it for three you know can I take two or three

283
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:27,559
minutes just to breathe here and just check in so I can come back in a way that's more effective so so this so

284
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:33,799
sometimes that's was necessary so but knowing you have that option then you don't have to run

285
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:41,480
away um the other is to assess what the other people are capable of you have to

286
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:48,120
be you have to be kind of have certain Street smarts to see are they capable here and and maybe the maybe the only

287
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:54,480
thing they're capable of is let's lower the temperature a little bit we can't really resolve this but let's lower the

288
00:30:54,480 --> 00:31:00,360
temperature and and um and one way to do that is just to name little bit what's

289
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:05,960
happening in a safe way like oh I see this is difficult for you and you know I

290
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:11,480
see it's difficult for you it's difficult for me and I'm not sure what to do but I just want to acknowledge

291
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:19,639
that yes this is this is not an easy thing just that I learned um many years

292
00:31:19,639 --> 00:31:25,600
ago that uh one way to deescalate the conflict really strong if it's if it's

293
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:32,120
the true the a statement is to let people know you're frightened like you know wow you know

294
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:38,000
this is really difficult for me I'm I'm scared right now especially if someone's angry with you because they're kind of

295
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:45,240
hostile in the in the conflict um some people when they hear that they're shocked like wow I had no idea and

296
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:52,000
they're not put on notice like is this really what you want to do maybe unconsciously it is they want

297
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:58,039
you to get but when they when it was made conscious it's hard for them to kind of want to keep doing that so but

298
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:06,039
just saying you know and you're not saying anything about them you're saying wow I'm really afraid and I need a minute to catch my breath

299
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:14,159
here and then sometimes it helpful if you have um established ahead of time so if you

300
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:22,080
if it's with some a friend or a partner or someone who you're going to be seeing for a long time uh when things are good

301
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:28,360
you might say you know you might say you know I kind of suspect sooner or later we're probably going to have some kind

302
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:35,679
of conflict maybe it might be accidental but um could we have a

303
00:32:35,679 --> 00:32:41,240
plan you know how we talk to each other what we do what can we have a plan of

304
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:46,279
what we can ask of each other so that we don't just go into it with the all the

305
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:51,600
plates flying through the kitchen but so that we can say if I lift

306
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:58,000
my hand say hey let's at least sit down together or let's both of us go outside

307
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:05,960
and get some fresh air before we continue or let's both of us now talk about uh this only from the only using

308
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:12,600
eye statements and uh and and then so anyway so make it if you can plan

309
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:20,240
ahead and then but then in relationship to this talk I gave today uh which is really where you have

310
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:26,480
the most possibility of success people are hard are difficult so

311
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:32,120
so getting everyone to kind of you know Harmon harmonize is not always so easy

312
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:37,440
but at least harmonize within yourself and so one of so that's where the how do

313
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:43,480
you walk walk in Refuge walk connected so if a person really has a

314
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:51,039
strong sense of what refuge is for them or what's really strong sense of a good inner way of being even if it's not

315
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:58,399
available right away we have a practice to reconnect to it we have a practice to try to come back to it and if we can't

316
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:04,960
really get back to it then we have a practice of mindfulness and mindfulness is uh what

317
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:11,240
part of what mindfulness can do is uh especially if it partners with the practice of getting

318
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:17,638
grounded so just sit up straight or stand straight and and uh breathe and

319
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:24,118
just feel what's going on and hold it all in some kind of way and uh really

320
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:31,040
become very clear what your experience is right now and that Clarity of what's happening is a

321
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,599
refuge so those are some things to do but I I don't want to imply that it's

322
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:42,480
easy thank you so yes Cheryl number of years ago in

323
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:49,679
fact probably more than once he told a story which was very interesting a personal story about um being on the

324
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,440
street at night in San Francisco is that a story I don't know if youve told it lately or

325
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:01,880
not would you be willing to tell it it's not that long a story and I doubt whether you've forgotten it I I have all

326
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:08,200
kinds of sanan San Francisco San Francisco street stories but maybe it's the it's the one woman in the the woman

327
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:14,119
in the car no you were walking with a friend you were walking with a friend and these guys came up to you with a gun

328
00:35:14,119 --> 00:35:21,320
I think a what gun with a gun oh it wasn't no that's not me no there was

329
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:28,240
a there was a there was a a friend of mine who uh someone came up with aun

330
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:34,599
okay and and um I had a few friends who were held up at gunpoint in San

331
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:42,040
Francisco but maybe the one that I'm you thinking of one of them was useful seemed like a very useful thing to do I

332
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:47,599
remember one of them was um the person uh just looked at the this young man

333
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:53,839
with a gun and said something like you know

334
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:59,640
um you're not a good Christian your mother would be ashamed of you

335
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:05,440
you and that was enough to kind of just break the whole thing and the person

336
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:11,720
left a number I wonderful stories of people but you know getting out of trouble in San Francisco streets like

337
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:19,480
that but but the um and there're wonderful stories but you C you can't use it as a

338
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:26,560
technique it's it's all has to do within the moment something feels like the right thing to do and

339
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:33,160
um and the one person who didn't do something like that and kind of was

340
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:40,800
reactive back in my friends back uh to someone who came and held them up um he

341
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:48,359
reacted and I think the person who held him up somehow was never apprehended but he

342
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:53,680
ended up in jail so because of his reactivity to it

343
00:36:53,680 --> 00:37:00,119
all so it's good to stay calm and know how to be

344
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:05,640
non-reactive yes um I like the story about the um the

345
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:13,280
prir beads the pr beads yeah I like your sorry okay I like the the um part about

346
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:19,720
the prir beads but I would lose them I guarantee so but you know I find that um

347
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:26,839
staying mindful especially at work um is really hard um and I did set an alarm to

348
00:37:26,839 --> 00:37:32,160
go off at noon every day to kind of try to remind me um and a lot of the times I

349
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:38,720
just turn it off CU I'm in the middle of something so do you have any other tips or maybe somebody else has other tips on

350
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:45,480
how you remind yourself to be mindful during the day at a when you're busy so

351
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:52,280
two things I could say one is to make it a habit to uh you you much of your work

352
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:58,800
sitting standing both both is to uh focus on your posture

353
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:04,920
and so sit in a in a good aligned upright posture and also stand that way

354
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:12,040
in since in a good way and let that uh the posture somehow uh call forth bring

355
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:19,079
forth as a form of mindfulness because if we if our posture collapses so does

356
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:24,960
our mindfulness and that and but if the posture is kind of aligned and good

357
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:31,800
sometimes we can see when we're starting to lose the mindfulness because the posture begins to collapse or give up so

358
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:40,440
posture is invaluable the other is to have reminders around and um I used to use uh

359
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:45,800
every time I went through a door frame that was my reminder and it was kind of nice because

360
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:53,880
when you go through a door frame you're going into a new space so it's good to kind of notice what you're doing and not just be kind of lost in thought and so I

361
00:38:53,880 --> 00:39:01,040
used to go through a lot of door frames so I used to that was a great thing to do um some people put stickers on things

362
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:08,160
that they'll see regularly I've known people who put a sticker like says remember or something on top of their

363
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:15,839
computer screen so that it's always there so they see it regularly and and

364
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:23,839
um so you know you know something you do regularly and it can be a series of things so if if if it's you know if your

365
00:39:23,839 --> 00:39:30,480
thing was to only at noon once a day I bet you go to uh the bathroom more

366
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:35,880
often than once a day so make that your

367
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:42,319
thing you you know say

368
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:52,960
Yes um as far as staying mindful at work I have a mug on my desk a what a mug a

369
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:58,440
mug that says take a breath and remember who the heck you

370
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:03,920
are so as far as taking refuge in yourself you know I've got the Dharma

371
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:11,440
I've got a long life of experience I'm looking at turning 70 so come on you

372
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:17,839
know I I'm not helpless so um uh I just

373
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:23,160
find that really you useful great I love it yeah if I didn't have the mug I'd put

374
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:29,200
a little sign there you cuz you've got this cuz I've got some worries and I

375
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:36,319
realize that worries are related to fear yeah and I know how to deal with fear

376
00:40:36,319 --> 00:40:42,680
nice so yeah yeah so there are people you so at work at home and the in the

377
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:50,319
bathroom mirror on the steering wheel of the car people put you all these little

378
00:40:52,400 --> 00:41:01,880
reminders okay maybe that's enough so um I'll end this way

379
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:25,869
