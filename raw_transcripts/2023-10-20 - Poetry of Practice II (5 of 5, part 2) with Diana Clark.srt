1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,120
okay so welcome back welcome back seems

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,599
that there was a technical glitch and uh

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,280
zoom and

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,719
YouTube stopped

5
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:16,920
youtubing I guess and um but here we are

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,400
finding our way back so I didn't drop in

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,720
the poem so I'll share the poem with you

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,760
now and um we can talk about a little

9
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:30,080
bit the good news is it's that it's a

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,439
short

11
00:00:32,879 --> 00:00:37,160
poem and the poem goes like

12
00:00:37,399 --> 00:00:41,120
this I stopped her in the grocery store

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,320
her crown of snowy braids held in place

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,760
by a great silver clip her erect bearing

15
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,440
radiating

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,399
tenderness the way she placed yogurt and

17
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,480
avocados in her basket beaming peace

18
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,920
like the North

19
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,199
Star I wanted to ask what aisle did you

20
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,479
find your Serenity in do you know how to

21
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,240
be married for 50 years or how to live

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,240
alone excuse me for interrupting but you

23
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,560
seem to possess some knowledge that

24
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,000
makes the Earth burn and turn on its

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,960
axis but we don't request such things

26
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,320
from strangers

27
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,759
nowadays so I

28
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:32,920
said I love your

29
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:36,079
hair and I'm sorry if you can hear all

30
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,159
this uh noise it's

31
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,320
outside so I I'll uh read this poem one

32
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,520
more

33
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,280
time I stalked her in the grocery

34
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,640
store her crown of snowy braids held in

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,360
place by a great silver

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:58,159
clip her erect bearing radiating

37
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,000
tenderness the way she placed yogurt and

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,159
avocados in her

39
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:08,959
basket be mean peace like the North

40
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,319
Star I wanted to ask what aisle did you

41
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:17,080
find your Serenity in do you know how to

42
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:21,760
be married for 50 years or how to live

43
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,560
alone excuse me for interrupting but you

44
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,319
seem to possess some knowledge that

45
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,239
makes the Earth burn and turn on its

46
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,640
AIS but we don't request such things

47
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,680
from strangers nowadays so I

48
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:43,120
said I love your

49
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,440
hair this poem is uh just great in so

50
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,760
many ways the poem is called I

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,720
confess and the poet is Allison

52
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:58,120
lman I confess by Alison

53
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,400
luterman so there's a a number of ways

54
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,680
that we might think about this poem but

55
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,440
one is that our practice doesn't impact

56
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,840
only

57
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:13,400
ourselves whether we intent to or not it

58
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,120
impacts

59
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,840
others so we this poem is about one

60
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,640
person seeing another person and being

61
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,239
struck about how the other person they

62
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:26,400
erect bearing radiating

63
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,920
tenderness the way that they're doing

64
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:31,640
these simple of putting grocery items in

65
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,760
their

66
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,280
cart and the speaker notices oh there's

67
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:39,480
something special about this person with

68
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,080
the white hair the braids that put up

69
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:45,040
with a silver

70
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,040
clip so when we show up in the world

71
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,760
with some steadiness some balance some

72
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,200
ease some presence it has an

73
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:58,879
impact whether we know it or not whether

74
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,680
it's a

75
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,920
immediately obvious to

76
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,239
ourselves we make an impact we showing

77
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:12,920
up with some ease and

78
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,400
presence and some

79
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:19,199
peacefulness spreads out from us whether

80
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,639
we are speaking to others or whether we

81
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:27,320
are just doing our ordinary things so we

82
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:31,000
don't practice only for ourselves

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,039
we also practice for others recognizing

84
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:37,360
this impact that humans have on each

85
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,919
other one way that I like to think about

86
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:43,080
this sometimes is to go to the opposite

87
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,320
extreme we also would notice somebody

88
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,440
who is frantic and throwing things into

89
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,000
their grocery cart and maybe yelling

90
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,960
into the phone at the same time you know

91
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:57,520
kind of like distracted and just

92
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,880
agitated and maybe unkempt in a way that

93
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,160
looks like they don't care about

94
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,759
anything or you know or clearly having a

95
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,400
difficult time right we notice those

96
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,759
things as well and they have a different

97
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:13,960
impact on us than somebody who has some

98
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:19,199
ease and Poise and seems to be radiating

99
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,440
something so maybe that's one thing that

100
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,319
we could take away from this poem this

101
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:26,000
poem has a lot of different elements and

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,400
some depth to

103
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,280
it and for those of you that are just

104
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,039
joining now because we had a little bit

105
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:34,600
of problem I'll read this poem one more

106
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:39,000
time before I talk about something else

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,639
kind of like a different perspective we

108
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,120
might take on this poem and so this poem

109
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,919
is called I confess by Allison Lerman

110
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,880
and it goes like

111
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:53,880
this I stocked her in the grocery store

112
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,160
her crown of snowy braids held in place

113
00:05:57,160 --> 00:06:00,720
by a great silver clip

114
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,960
her erect bearing radiating tenderness

115
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:07,919
the way she placed yogurt in avocados in

116
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,080
her

117
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,280
basket beaming peace like the North

118
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,560
Star I wanted to ask what aisle did you

119
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,560
find your Serenity

120
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,840
in do you know how to be married for 50

121
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,360
years or how to be

122
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,319
alone excuse me for interrupting but you

123
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:30,520
seem to possess some knowledge that

124
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:35,280
makes the Earth burn and turn on its

125
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,520
AIS but we don't request such things

126
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,280
from strangers nowadays so I

127
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,199
said I love your

128
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:48,080
hair I don't know I always kind of like

129
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,800
Chuck a little bit at the end but I also

130
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,759
want to point out one other way in which

131
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:55,199
we might think about this poem and that

132
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,000
is the speaker here in this

133
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,919
poem the way that she's

134
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,039
seeking like she's

135
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:05,479
looking and importantly she's looking

136
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:08,680
outside of herself like nowhere do we

137
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,319
hear about her own experience what's

138
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:13,240
happening for her but

139
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,000
instead she's looking

140
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,680
outside and for me I'm struck by the

141
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,280
person that she's looking as a person

142
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,160
with white hair somebody who's an elder

143
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,639
I'm imagining somebody who has

144
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,160
wisdom and so she's trying to think like

145
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,520
oh that person has wisdom and she says

146
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:35,759
that you seem to possess some knowledge

147
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:39,639
so this seeking for wisdom but not only

148
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,400
wisdom she describes this person as

149
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,840
having some

150
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,080
tenderness and beaming peace like the

151
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,440
North

152
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,599
Star North stars are something that like

153
00:07:52,599 --> 00:07:55,479
show the way or something that we

154
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:59,360
follow so this way of the speaker saying

155
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,280
she wants peace as well so this seeking

156
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,120
of wisdom and peace so much can be a big

157
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,159
part of our

158
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:11,080
practice and we might think that it's

159
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,560
all about

160
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,599
seeking and uh for those of you who have

161
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:17,080
any of you who have done grocery

162
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,960
shopping you know that the let's see the

163
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,360
yogurt and the avocados are never near

164
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,960
one another right they're in different

165
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,400
parts of the grocery store maybe I'm

166
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,800
reading too much into this poem but

167
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,199
there's this way that their speaker is

168
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,240
just like following this other person

169
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,680
stalking her as the way that the uh the

170
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:41,599
poet uses this word stalking so is there

171
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,279
a way in which we are

172
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,240
stalking wisdom tenderness peace

173
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,040
thinking that it's out

174
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,040
there but not looking

175
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,800
here into our own EXP

176
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,880
experience we have wisdom we have

177
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:08,200
tenderness times we have

178
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,120
peace The Way Forward is

179
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,160
found with our experience and our

180
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,480
reactions to that

181
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,240
experience we spend so much time looking

182
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,320
outside of ourselves but this practice

183
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,120
so much is about looking in

184
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,360
Inward and then maybe a third aspect

185
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,720
I'll bring about to this about this poem

186
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,360
there's so many things I could say about

187
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,880
this one is of course I just to

188
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,200
appreciate the Whimsy and the

189
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,720
everydayness of

190
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,399
it this recognition that everything can

191
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,920
be a teacher all of our experiences can

192
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,160
be a teacher even this random experience

193
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,440
I'm going to the grocery store I'm

194
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,440
saying random but you know it's often we

195
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,279
tend to think like go my spiritual

196
00:10:00,279 --> 00:10:02,880
practice is only on the meditation

197
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,320
cushion when I'm in a meditation

198
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,320
posture but is there a way that all of

199
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,680
our experiences can be a support for our

200
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:16,839
practice is there a way that everything

201
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:21,839
that we do in our life can be this way

202
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,519
that enriches

203
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:25,880
us doesn't mean it's Pleasant doesn't

204
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,680
mean that we want but is there a way

205
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,839
that we can learn from whatever life

206
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:32,200
brings

207
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,360
us and maybe lastly I'll say this the

208
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:42,399
title of this poem I

209
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:45,399
confess right this this confessing

210
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:48,560
doesn't actually happen in the poem it's

211
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,720
maybe the poet is talking about the the

212
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,040
character in the poem is maybe doing

213
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,560
something that uh they feel like they

214
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,360
shouldn't be doing so they have to

215
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:03,360
confess it and you know confess

216
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,880
sometimes is associated with some

217
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,240
religious practices as

218
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,440
well but it there's a way in which it

219
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,959
also sense that we're doing something

220
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,880
wrong right we only confess things that

221
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,040
we do

222
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,839
wrong and how much this is also a part

223
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:21,760
of The Human Experience especially I

224
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,480
would say in modern times in the west we

225
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,040
often are feeling like we're doing

226
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:27,959
things

227
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,880
wrong

228
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,639
can we be present for that experience

229
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:36,120
too even though we may not be doing

230
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,200
anything wrong there way in such we have

231
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,959
this feeling of

232
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,200
inadequacy but

233
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,839
instead can we maybe connect with our

234
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,600
experience in whatever way is

235
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,959
available this poem The Reader wants to

236
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:06,040
ask this whired woman this beautiful

237
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,160
white haired woman uh about you know how

238
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,480
to be married or wisdom or things like

239
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,320
things but instead she

240
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:19,079
said I love your

241
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:22,560
hair she started where she

242
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,519
could this is the connection she could

243
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,680
make and I love that we don't know what

244
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,040
happen happens

245
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,639
next maybe there was this conversation

246
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:35,920
that was really touching and meaningful

247
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,320
for this

248
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,639
speaker maybe

249
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:42,800
not but at least she made this

250
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,399
connection I love your

251
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,279
hair I keep on smiling and giggling a

252
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:51,680
little bit with this poem and for me

253
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,240
that uh is part of the power of it too

254
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:57,480
is that it brings this kind of uplift

255
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:00,839
the ordinariness of it

256
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,639
