1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,839
good morning everyone and

2
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,120
um one of the surprises to me when

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:17,400
I went to practice in Thailand when I was first introduced to tabot Buddhism and to

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:26,160
basana was that um the topic of Sila or ethics or virtue was one that brought uh

5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:33,160
people a lot of Joy it was a joy topic it was something that brought

6
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:41,399
happiness and um that was not something I had ever imagined uh growing up or in the western

7
00:00:41,399 --> 00:00:47,600
cultures that I had lived in fact uh I was grew up somewhat mistrustful of

8
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:53,199
people who had overemphasized ethics that it was um somehow a little

9
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:58,680
bit too puritanical or dogmatic or judgmental of people or hypocritical

10
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:04,080
even at times but the idea that they would bring you

11
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,040
Joy and uh it wasn't just a surprise to discover people who had that

12
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:15,840
orientation it was a surprised that as I started doing long retreats in Thailand

13
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:24,079
that something shifted inside of me and there was a uh something got cleansed

14
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:30,360
something got emptied something got uh space for something new to arise

15
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:37,479
that I had never felt before that uh that felt uh as something that uh

16
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:43,360
brought joy for living a life of

17
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,439
non-harming living a life that avoided the kind of unh wholesome behavior that

18
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:56,240
felt like it uh did a kind of violence to this inner place that was developing

19
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:04,159
through the practice and so the reference point of joy for ethics

20
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:12,800
for ca for this kind of living this life of cusa and kalana wholesomeness and

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,360
beauty and one of the things that uh is very Central to Buddhist the Buddhist

22
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,920
teachings is that the mind is malleable and nowadays we might call

23
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:32,560
neuroplasticity that uh the mind can be a trans transformed and made uh workable

24
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,840
wieldy so that it's not stuck in a rut but can be become soft enough to

25
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:45,120
workable enough to be able to uh do the inner spiritual work that Buddhist

26
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:53,000
practi is about and that's encapsulated in the idea of a training that Buddhist practices about

27
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,319
training ethics is about training in ethics not about

28
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:03,480
perfection so we don't hold ourselves up against a standard of either or either

29
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,879
we're doing it wrong or doing it right perfectly but that we're

30
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:16,319
training and many skills many things we do in our ordinary life we train to become better at riding a bicycle

31
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:23,239
playing an instrument um cooking a particular dish we do it a few times until we feel like

32
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:29,640
we can do it easily without continuing to look at the recipe and being reminded or something

33
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:37,080
like like that so we're training we're learning we're developing and to orient yourself around

34
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,879
meditation that uh it is in fact Not Meant to Be Perfect it's meant to be a

35
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:49,480
training that we enter into with sincerity a training where we do our

36
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,519
best knowing that we'll fall off the wagon and we'll just have to uh get back

37
00:03:54,519 --> 00:04:00,560
on again or off the horse I guess and back on again and back on again um developing

38
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:07,519
ourselves and as we do so we're developing a wholesome attitude towards

39
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,920
ourselves as a meditator wholesome attitude towards our meditation a wholesome attitude to whatever

40
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:21,479
experience comes up in meditation a beautiful attitude and one that we can understand

41
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:26,680
has some quality of Ethics in it that it brings us joy and happiness to be

42
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:33,440
training to do our best to train ourselves to meet our situation with kindness and

43
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:41,400
nonhostility and and so we're training which means we do our best and knowing that our best is

44
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:48,199
the best we can do and not have any more standard than our own ability

45
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:54,520
to do our best and our best is going to vary from day to day depending on our energy and

46
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,840
our tiredness and life circumstances and this wonderful

47
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:06,039
sincerity of living this practice the best we can and uh seeing it as a

48
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:11,240
training seeing it as something that we're slowly developing over

49
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:18,400
time so to assume a meditation posture and that also is a training your

50
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:26,479
body is slowly shifting and changing over time as you repeatedly enter into your

51
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:33,000
posture some people talk about developing a yoga Body by how we

52
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,120
meditate and the body itself will make subtle shifts stretch become stronger in

53
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,800
particular medit ways that support this posture it's a training in posture

54
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:53,639
meditation posture and to lower the

55
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,319
Gaze close your eyes

56
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,199
and see if you can adjust your attitude sitting

57
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,880
here to from whatever attitude you find yourself sitting

58
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:18,080
in to an

59
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,800
attitude of getting ready to

60
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:31,560
train to do your best at being here

61
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:39,039
an attitude of being at ease with non

62
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:46,919
Perfection as a training you can't be perfect

63
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:56,440
already there has to be imperfection for training to have a role in our

64
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:04,479
life and so an attitude of being great ious generous

65
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:13,759
kind shifting from any UNH wholesome attitude we

66
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:20,919
have to at least a mild wholesome attitude of Good

67
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:32,479
Will and then beginning the training by tuning in attuning yourself with a body

68
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:52,720
breathing breathing sits at the Nexus of life itself in so many different ways

69
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:00,319
Nexus of our emotions our mind our body our external world

70
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:10,599
and to sit there gently quietly attuned to breathing the body

71
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:29,039
breathing to give yourself a little more fully over to breathing you might take a few long slow

72
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:37,360
deep breaths just enough so it remains

73
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,839
comfortable relaxing on the

74
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:02,399
exhale for

75
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:40,320
then letting your breathing return to

76
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:49,000
normal and for a few minutes

77
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:54,959
here if there's anything happening for you which is more compelling than

78
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,160
breathing you're thinking a lot there's emotions and feelings

79
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:09,079
Body Sensations sounds around you be aware of

80
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:15,360
them while accompany those experiences with your

81
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:20,279
breathing breathe with them breathe through

82
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:27,440
them where the we're an emphasis on breathing right

83
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:36,959
in the middle of these other experience es is a training and not being reactive or

84
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:44,680
caught and these other things that are happening breathing is like a massage

85
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:52,160
that softens the pull the

86
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,120
attachment the way that we might be bothered by something else

87
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:08,880
just breathing with it a training and allowing things to be

88
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,160
for

89
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,160
for for

90
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:02,519
and then in the middle of all things Center yourself more

91
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:07,519
fully on the body's experience of

92
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,240
breathing wherever in the body the breathing is easy is to attend

93
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:27,639
to let there be a resting point there resting

94
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,759
or sent centered on the

95
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:39,279
ballast of the body breathing a

96
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:46,079
training in staying present a training in beginning again

97
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:52,880
when your Wonder off a

98
00:14:52,959 --> 00:15:00,759
training and not being bothered by whatever is happening

99
00:15:00,759 --> 00:15:08,959
that instead of being bothered being aware

100
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,920
for

101
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839
for

102
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:30,840
for

103
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
for

104
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:31,760
for for

105
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:01,679
for

106
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,559
for

107
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
for

108
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
for

109
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
for

110
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,399
for for

111
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,279
for

112
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:59,559
and then as we come to the end of this sitting to gaze upon the world

113
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:09,000
as an imperfect place no expectations of things being

114
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:18,760
perfect but for us to practice

115
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:28,760
train and gazing upon that in an unbothered kind way

116
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:33,200
here to support ourselves our

117
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:41,279
world to see it all as a work and

118
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:50,880
progress and for us to contribute the best we have to

119
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:59,679
offer to improve and benefit the welfare and happiness of of all

120
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:04,559
beings may all beings be

121
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:10,559
happy may all beings be

122
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,399
safe may all beings be

123
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:22,278
peaceful may all beings be

124
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:31,440
free and May may we engage in a

125
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:41,120
training and a development and a growth that that can be the case

126
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:53,368
[Music]

127
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:03,600
thank you

128
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:53,320
so at this talk I offer the fourth discussion about introduction to Buddhist

129
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:59,919
ethics and the emphasis for today today is on

130
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:07,440
training that the or orientation that the Buddha had on becoming ethical being

131
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:16,000
ethical is that it's a training a continual training uh to be as ethical as we can

132
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:22,440
to live as harmlessly as we can and this idea of training is very

133
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:30,279
different than the idea of uh right or wrong or or Perfection and imperfection

134
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:37,760
or um you know um uh you know that there's absolute

135
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:44,320
morality we are measuring ourselves against the the way that the five

136
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:51,279
precepts are worded in in uh in Buddhism is that they're worded to be trainings

137
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:58,039
rather than committing to not killing it's uh I commit to train and not

138
00:30:58,039 --> 00:31:04,039
killing I commit to train in not taking what is not given I commit

139
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:11,159
to um or I engage in it's not even the word commit might even not even be Nepali

140
00:31:11,159 --> 00:31:19,840
maybe that's a strong kind of Western tendency I have to insert a a little different idea of Ethics um but it's uh

141
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:26,480
I engage in the practice of training I Eng engage in the training steps

142
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,360
sikam um and uh so the

143
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:38,639
um uh the emphasis on training and training implies that you

144
00:31:38,639 --> 00:31:47,679
need to train you need to cultivate and develop and so uh uh rather than

145
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:55,240
being all or nothing we're working towards something we're developing ourselves and it's not develop not

146
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:00,840
working towards Behavior necess necessarily but more deeply training the

147
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:07,840
heart and mind in such a way that we live uh ethically we live a life of

148
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,559
non-harming uh and we live a life that's wholesome that's ethically beautiful

149
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:19,200
because of the quality and nature of the heart uh it's not the external

150
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,080
formalities that we're trying to live by and uh but rather to be transformed on

151
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:30,799
the inside so being ethical is a natural expression of who we

152
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:38,039
are so the training is uh the uh training ourselves to appreciate and

153
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:45,080
develop the inner qualities that support ethics the learning how to lessen and

154
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:50,960
maybe even eliminate uh the strong forces within compulsions within

155
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:58,120
attachments within that lead to unethical behavior and to replace those with

156
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:04,080
wholesome be wholesome uh attitudes wholesome orientations within so that

157
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:09,399
those wholesomeness naturally get expressed in Behavior which is what we'd

158
00:33:09,399 --> 00:33:17,720
call ethical um and so but training means that we have training to do we um we

159
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:26,080
want to kind of begin to um uh understand that we're trying to

160
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:32,000
develop ourselves cultivate our eles more than we're trying to adhere to

161
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:39,840
ethical strictures uh to do to know what to do that's right and then behave accordingly

162
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:46,000
might actually override and do a kind of violence to be a strong language to who

163
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:54,080
we are what's going on inside and so an ethical life that's really based on a

164
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,639
strong emphasis on mindfulness strong emphasis on awareness self-awareness so

165
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:06,559
we see and know what's going on inside so that we've healed some of the unresolved issues and emotions and

166
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:12,200
challenges that we have on the inside not to override them sometimes I had the

167
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:20,398
impression that some of the people who uh live um uh their behavior is is

168
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:27,839
strongly or uh Guided by the wording of the precepts um are trying to best fit

169
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:34,638
into that Behavior Uh sometimes are overlooking and maybe even running away from or

170
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:40,760
avoiding uh unresolved issues or deep forms of of something inside that needs

171
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:48,079
to be healed uh rather than um doing the healing taking a good

172
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:56,118
look and resolving what's going on deep inside so that the ethical training in Buddhism is not just be training in what

173
00:34:56,119 --> 00:35:01,960
can be seen as ethical behavor Behavior but really involves looking more deeply

174
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:10,200
inside of ourselves to what needs to be resolved or work with or liberated within us so in that sense um the

175
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:15,960
precepts sometimes are seen as mirrors that we see ourselves ethical guidelines

176
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:21,680
in Buddhism we call them guidelines not rules or Commandments are seen as

177
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:27,880
mirrors so if we go up against um uh you know wanting to kill someone or har

178
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:33,720
someone if we go up against wanting to take something not given or involved in

179
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:39,119
sexual be Behavior which maybe causes harm to others uh or breaks the

180
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:45,320
precept that we're stopping to wait wait a minute what's going on here with me

181
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:52,079
not wait a minute I'm being a wrong person but rather wait a minute um I think there's something for me to check

182
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:57,640
in to find out about myself understand myself so it's a training of turning

183
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:02,839
inward to see what's really going on here and clarifying that and maybe

184
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:10,920
transforming that into something that we feel really good by uh really um uh are

185
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:17,480
nourished by it's wholesome something that we begin feeling is beautiful and um and so that we have a

186
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:23,359
reference point for how wonderful it is how delightful it is to live a life of

187
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:31,119
non-harming the um so um so to think of Ethics as being

188
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:36,319
involved something we train in rather than something that's either or and I

189
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:44,240
think this is a very generous attitude towards ourselves because we're not expected to be perfect ethically perfect

190
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,720
uh what we're expected to do if anything is to uh be sincere in doing the

191
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:56,760
training doing our best we can and if somehow we we mess up somehow we don't

192
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,040
live up to what we're training for then rather than spend a lot of time berading

193
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:10,200
ourselves or or being uh uh caught in in the remorse uh the idea is to take an

194
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:18,160
honest look at what happened um we look at our mistakes we look at how we've been unethical to learn from it so we

195
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:25,400
can uh do better in the future training has a lot to do with being forward-looking not being stuck in the

196
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:30,599
past we learn from the past past we learn from our mistakes so that we can

197
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:38,200
do better in the future but the emphasis is on let's see how we can do better to be inspired to be motivated yes uh I

198
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:44,079
will try now to do better and sometimes we have to restate that intention many

199
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:50,960
times a day okay well that was didn't work out well but I will try to do better as opposed to justifying what we

200
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:57,160
what we did you know it's the other person's fault they deserved it or something um it's always kind of looking

201
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:03,160
at our elves and can we do better and how do we train how do we um become a

202
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:09,440
person who naturally is going to be an ethical person and

203
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,520
um so one of the interesting things about this for um is that the

204
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:19,839
Buddha uh in these training precepts like you know not killing not stealing

205
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:26,119
not involved in sexual misconduct not lying and not engaging in

206
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:34,599
intoxication that um for late people there's there's as far as I know I've never seen any teachings of the Buddha

207
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:42,359
that um describes or provides punishments for people if they break the

208
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:48,960
precepts the Buddha didn't have a relationship with lay people that he was in a place that was his job or his

209
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:56,520
orientation to um to somehow intervene and and uh judge people that

210
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,599
way or to to uh punish people or to uh

211
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:08,280
advise that these people should be punished in any kind of way for being unethical his monastic Community had

212
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:14,760
institutional ethics Behavior which there were consequences for and things had to happen in order for the monks to

213
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,560
kind of be in good standing or have Harmony in the community but um uh and

214
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,920
we have in our society institutional ethics we have things that uh our

215
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:31,720
government wants and and uh different institutions we're part of have ethical codes of

216
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:37,599
conduct and um but Buddhism has codes of

217
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:43,720
training and uh and there's no sense in Buddhism that there's some kind of

218
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:48,800
Buddhist idea that you're a terrible person or bad person and you will

219
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:54,960
somehow be punished by the Buddhist Church or something like that or the Buddhist Church has a role in doing that

220
00:39:54,960 --> 00:40:00,839
kind of punishment um there might be institutional reasons why

221
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:08,119
a Buddhist Community might decide on certain things but from Buddhism itself that doesn't come from doesn't come from

222
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:14,480
Buddhism uh rather what the Buddha was involved in was to continue putting

223
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,680
people away from living an UNH wholesome life a harmful life and training to live

224
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:27,720
a good life training to live an ethical life and training means that uh sin for

225
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:34,760
training is cultivating ourselves developing ourselves um uh growing ourselves into

226
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:40,040
something different and that's a slow process and it's a wonderful process and

227
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:46,200
it's a really worthwhile process to um and it's possible and this is part of

228
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:53,800
the good news of Buddhism is that the heart the mind is valuable it is it can

229
00:40:53,800 --> 00:41:01,640
be changed and it can be changed for the better and uh and that involves practice and so

230
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:09,000
another synonyms for training is practice we practice we're practicing something so we get good at it uh we

231
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:14,880
practice so we develop proficiency develop skill in what we're doing and so

232
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:23,000
there's Proficiency in being ethical one of which is um to engage in

233
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,440
ethical reflection some of the issues we're involved in our life are e ethically

234
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:34,760
complex and uh it's not obvious what the least harming thing is that we can do

235
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:40,040
and so developing a training ourselves to begin reflecting on principles

236
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:46,560
reflecting on consequences thinking out and and uh is part of uh I think a wise

237
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:54,079
life to train ourselves to be able to wisely reflect about um the ethics that

238
00:41:54,079 --> 00:41:59,920
uh impact of our lives our decisions how we we vote different

239
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:06,000
things so an ethical life is not just simply a life that lives by the precepts

240
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:13,520
but in a complex society that it's also being able to U uh be deeply reflective

241
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:21,359
about uh what is going on for you know in this wider world of ours so it's a training we grow into

242
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:28,079
being ethical and I think that's been one of my great joys of practice is to

243
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:35,880
slowly um maybe way pretty slow um but to slow grow grow in kind of an ethical

244
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:43,359
sensibility grow in an ethical Clarity and wisdom that uh about how to live and

245
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:49,400
where to come from in such a way that our heart and our minds become our best

246
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,720
friends we like it there we enjoy ourselves because uh we know that we're

247
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:03,440
not oriented towards causing harm to anyone self or others we've trained oursel that way to live wisely

248
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:11,319
effectively in this world uh with a way that is ethical wholesome beautiful and

249
00:43:11,319 --> 00:43:18,720
beneficial for all beings so um so the theme so far for

250
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:25,599
this week as foundations for Buddhist ethics is the importance of non-harming the importance of

251
00:43:25,599 --> 00:43:31,960
wholesomeness wholesome qualities developing wholesome States um looking at the issues of

252
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:38,319
Ethics from the point of view is it wholesome or UNH wholesome or skillful and or unskillful then Wednesday

253
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:43,800
yesterday I talked about beauty um this this sense of inner

254
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:49,359
beauty that can be developed that's closely connected to uh being

255
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:56,880
ethical and then today the idea of training in it all that is something we train in and develop over time and then

256
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:04,960
we have one more talk tomorrow on the foundations of Buddhist ethics so thank you very much for this

257
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:13,079
chance to talk about this and um and I hope that uh you find

258
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:18,520
Opportunities to train today may you might think ahead into into the day and

259
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:26,760
think about situations that might be challenging for you and how might you train to enter into those into those uh

260
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:34,760
situ situations with a uh uh so that you train in being ethical or maintaining an

261
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:42,040
inner beauty your wholesomeness in what you do thank you
