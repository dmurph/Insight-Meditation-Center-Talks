just let the uh reality of goodness soothe you soothe your heart

7
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:41,079
it's almost unimaginable how much

8
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:46,000
ordinary goodness there is

9
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:10,920
and we here together try to take that ordinary goodness as a kind of object let

10
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:21,280
it motivate our um our action consolidate our love

11
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,239
commitment resolution

12
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,879
Adan e

13
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:25,120
usually we direct our attention to our breathing

14
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,760
to body to feeling s

15
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:46,519
s maybe we just U let uh goodness

16
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:53,879
soothe any uh agitation worry fear and then see what's left in the

17
00:03:53,879 --> 00:04:01,720
mind where the attention goes

18
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,720
e

19
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,680
e e

20
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,039
can feel like meditation puts pressure on

21
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,720
oursel to perform some intenal intentional

22
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:57,600
ritual to be good to not get lost in thought

23
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,880
to d da da da da uh it's not that meditation puts

24
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:13,160
pressure on the self it's this self puts a kind of pressure on

25
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,560
awareness e

26
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:30,199
ego dramatizes everything Maybe

27
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:43,440
makes um life feel dramatic melodramatic

28
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:16,560
we just relax surrender up the sense of self to awareness

29
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,039
and meditation starts to do

30
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
itself

31
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,360
e

32
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,320
e

33
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
e

34
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
e

35
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:32,279
e e

36
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:15,519
we must um forgive our minds a very deep level

37
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:48,320
and through that process of forgiveness we come

38
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:54,639
to trust our mind trust awareness

39
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:02,160
trust love e

40
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:44,920
the goodness of your mind doesn't depend on

41
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040
you

42
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:31,040
e

43
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,040
e

44
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,959
e

45
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,920
e

46
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,920
e e

47
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,520
the more we cling the more World there

48
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:34,080
is as we cling the less World less

49
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:37,679
World a more

50
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:56,520
alive just take our cues from the

51
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,840
silence

52
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,760
for

53
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,720
e

54
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,720
e

55
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,640
e

56
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,640
e

57
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,600
e

58
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,520
e

59
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
e

60
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:30,520
e

61
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
e

62
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,440
e

63
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
e

64
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,360
e e

65
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,840
whatever can be enjoyed enjoyed in the uh the field of

66
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,360
your experience really enjoy

67
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:28,760
it if it feels overshadowed by

68
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,840
other things just enjoy what can be

69
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:00,240
enjoyed

70
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:30,240
e

71
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,240
e

72
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:30,159
e

73
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:00,120
e

74
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:30,120
e

75
00:28:57,039 --> 00:29:00,039
e

76
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:31,080
e e

77
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,559
okay so uh TS um TS Elliot's poem Ash

78
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:32,480
Wednesday um often not a scholar I don't know what

79
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:40,120
I'm talking about but apparently often read as a a kind of conversion poem is

80
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:45,720
conversion to uh angli anglicism and

81
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:51,080
um and um yeah I think from Unitarianism to

82
00:30:51,080 --> 00:31:00,039
anglicanism so begins this way uh because I do not hope to turn

83
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:08,039
again because I do not hope because I do not hope to turn Desiring this man's

84
00:31:08,039 --> 00:31:13,639
gift and that man's scope I no longer strive to strive

85
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:18,960
towards such things why should the Aged Eagle stretch

86
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,200
its wings why should I mourn the vanished

87
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:29,120
power of the usual rain

88
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:37,360
and twice in that um that that poem he uses the phrase

89
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:45,519
that's been quoted quite often in Dharma talks uh teach us to Care and not to

90
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:52,399
care teach us to sit still this part doesn't get quoted so

91
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:59,200
much but the very next line is pray pray for us sinners now and at the hour of

92
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:05,120
our death pray for us now and at the hour of our

93
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:10,840
death and generally I've uh I've understood that teach us to Care and not

94
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:17,440
to qu care in a sequential way there are moments of care but then there are other

95
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:23,200
moments when care is absent

96
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:32,039
and I've described a kind of dialectic of love and rest love and rest the

97
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:37,120
urgency of of love

98
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:43,559
and yet we know that even love beautiful love fatigues the

99
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:50,600
heart and so we must find ways of resting not closing the heart but

100
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:57,360
resting and I've been preoccupied in trying to work out

101
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:03,799
my own own kind of um life and what kind of

102
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:09,679
what what a good life entails working out this relationship

103
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:16,320
between compassion and equinity like what is the kind of

104
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:24,080
balance point between nihilism and frenzied inefficient

105
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:30,399
suffering and we know it doesn't take long to realize that a path devoid of

106
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:36,840
compassion is kind of dismal pathetic

107
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:42,760
really and yet caring is

108
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:48,600
costly and so there's love in the face of suffering

109
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:55,279
compassion and then uh love in the face of powerlessness it's

110
00:33:55,279 --> 00:34:01,240
equinity and we move between those modes sequentially sometimes caring sometimes

111
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:06,639
that care is absent and as we practice that this this

112
00:34:06,639 --> 00:34:12,358
sequential Rhythm gets smoother the kind

113
00:34:12,359 --> 00:34:20,800
of stickiness the holding on the ruminative mechanisms that keep the past

114
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,320
alive settles out quite a bit and the trace of the last

115
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:34,480
moment is a bridged tears in other words

116
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:39,800
in uh In This Moment laughter in the

117
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:47,200
next each moment very fresh and so the the poignancy

118
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:52,480
of of grief need not cast any Shadow

119
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:59,640
over ecstatic joy to care not to care

120
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:07,680
is it possible though to to care and not to

121
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:12,640
care simultaneously not

122
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:23,480
sequentially one description or manifestation of of

123
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:31,720
emptiness is the simultaneous experience of car car Ing and not

124
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:41,240
caring it is the uh the experience of of of utter problem

125
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:47,320
lastness this moment as it's come to

126
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:53,839
be in its imperfection is without

127
00:35:53,839 --> 00:36:02,400
error and we rest in that sense of the the eror errorless of it we rest

128
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:07,760
in progressively the perception of no

129
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:17,040
thing like the things of perception start to to drop out to melt

130
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:24,160
away and in a sense what becomes more prominent than anything is the three

131
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,880
marks of existence Dua anicha anata you

132
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:36,880
know un unsatisfactoriness impermanence not

133
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:44,800
self emptiness we might say is the perception of of less and

134
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:51,520
less you know like in the sense of like empty it's not like a metaphor you know

135
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:59,200
the perception of less and less with more and more aliveness

136
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,960
it it's the kind of tranquilizing of

137
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:10,040
perception and from the um TR

138
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:15,960
Su um the lesser lesser discourse on

139
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:22,599
emptiness uh we're first transfixed by the perception of the the busyness of

140
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:29,119
the village and then the perception of the village drops away way all the agitation

141
00:37:29,119 --> 00:37:37,000
of that perception drops away just the perception of the the animals or the human

142
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:43,200
beings then that drops away it's just Wilderness perceiving Wilderness

143
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:48,599
refining out the more agitated forms of

144
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:59,440
perception and the Wilderness drops away as just Earth less and less perceptual

145
00:38:00,760 --> 00:38:08,920
disturbance and so the the kind of basic agitation of ssara like is being

146
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:14,318
progressively um refined refined

147
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:22,720
out and we keep noticing absence the absence of coarser

148
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:29,440
phenomena and it's so striking where

149
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:37,920
um we're beings that long for peace but accept mere

150
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:45,400
pleasure the perception of the Wilderness drops away to

151
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:50,520
increasingly subtle forms of of

152
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:56,319
somethingness but not much something perception of Infinite Space

153
00:38:56,319 --> 00:39:02,720
no body no mind space without anything on the other

154
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:11,560
side of it and so this is

155
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:16,640
um this this is a kind of um not

156
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:23,599
caring not caring to teach us to Care and not to

157
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:31,680
care this is not to care in the sense that happiness happiness is um it's

158
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:38,160
independent of the sensor the ordinary sensory World very

159
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:46,720
independent extremely confident in the mind in goodness in the Dharma

160
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:56,280
path and so there's less and less but there is still mind there is still mind

161
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:02,760
everything before sensation there's still

162
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:14,520
mind so the the Raa um just as if there were a roofed

163
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:20,240
house or a roofed Hall having windows on the North the South or the East when the

164
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:26,720
Sun rises and array has entered by way of window of the window where does it

165
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,520
land on the Western Wall the person replies

166
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:38,359
if there's no rest Western Wall where does it land on the

167
00:40:38,359 --> 00:40:45,000
ground and if there is no ground where does it land on the water they reply if

168
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,279
there is no water where does it land it does not

169
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:56,240
land and then the the the Buddha response is

170
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:03,119
um where Consciousness does not land or increase that I tell you it goes on to

171
00:41:03,119 --> 00:41:07,880
