1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:08,920
good evening welcome welcome nice to see you all nice to

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:15,559
practice together I wanted to talk a little bit

3
00:00:15,559 --> 00:00:22,080
about thoughts tonight in other settings I've been talking about thoughts and I like to

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:29,039
talk about it some more here because there's this way like when we sit down and meditate like we just

5
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,200
did for 30 minutes there often can be this sense of like dang it where are all these thoughts

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:41,480
here or there can be a sense of like why is the mind so busy or if only my

7
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:49,760
thoughts were different or would go away or something like this even if it's uh those expressions

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,480
weren't explicitly said in the mind there can be

9
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:01,079
a way in which we have a little like resistance or aversive relationship to our thoughts especially when we're

10
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:09,320
meditating when we're not meditating we love our thoughts but when we're meditating we uh often or you know wish

11
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:16,720
it it would go away or be otherwise in some kind of way so in this tradition as many of you

12
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:23,479
know this not about getting rid of thoughts we don't have to do that turns out you can't in a way that you think

13
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:33,159
you might be able to anyway but really what's being pointed to is just noticing our relationship to

14
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:39,079
thoughts so it's more about noticing and just how how we are

15
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:44,640
engaging with thoughts how we're being with them are we all in like in love

16
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,159
with them and being entertained by them or we when we wake up from being in Lost

17
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,320
in thought thinking like oh shoot I'm supposed to be meditating oh here we go

18
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:03,039
again when you're lost in thought while you're meditating no no problem because you're lost in thought there's like

19
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:08,200
nothing to be done right you just are lost in thought you can't make yourself

20
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:16,160
not be lost in thought so somehow I know at the beginning of my meditation practice somehow I thought that uh I

21
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:24,280
should be able to wake myself up but doesn't work that way probably you've noticed that we

22
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:30,480
don't have this uh way we do this uh we can't like just force things to the way

23
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,840
that we want them to be and I say this a lot and if you could

24
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,879
you wouldn't be here at a meditation center on a Monday night you would be out having whatever thoughts you wanted

25
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:49,680
whenever you wanted so maybe it's helpful to just

26
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:56,040
um just say briefly well why is there often just this incessant flow of

27
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,480
thoughts while we're um sitting down to meditate

28
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:08,480
one way or one reason it might be is that it can support a sense of feeling

29
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,480
safe that's probably not what's on top of Mind instead what the mind is doing

30
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:21,080
it has this sense of like I got to figure this out I got to solve this

31
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:27,400
problem I got to get to the end of this I got to make this be different in some

32
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:34,840
kind of way and there's this way that um we feel like okay well if I only figure

33
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:40,200
this out then everything will be fine and then I'll be safe and comfortable

34
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:45,680
maybe maybe that's a another way of thinking about

35
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:55,319
it but there's this way in which um trying to figure things out or try to

36
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,360
solve a problem really takes us away from what's

37
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,400
being experienced from what's here right now

38
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,640
and it turns out if we want to be safe really it's just to be with what's actually

39
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:18,239
happening because the harm is going to be you know in this moment I'm not saying that we don't have to plan

40
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,440
sometimes we do have to plan I'll talk a little bit more about that later but if there is a feeling of

41
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:30,199
wanting to be safe or feeling unsafe then it's to be with our experience like what's being heard with what's being

42
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:36,240
seen what's being experienced with the body I'm I'm rocking like this like

43
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,360
often you don't to feel your feet on the ground and feel like oh I'm I'm actually

44
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,400
here or maybe there's just a lot of thinking because that's what we've been

45
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:54,039
trained to do that's what we've been conditioned to do certainly we have an educational program that supports

46
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:00,600
that lot of thinking of course and many of us have had professions jobs that

47
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:06,120
really supported a lot of thinking and we got rewarded for our thinking and so

48
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:14,600
this is you know of course we've been doing this our life long it's not going to stop just all of a sudden so that's

49
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:22,240
another reason why there might be a lot of thoughts but here's one that um I had which I didn't even really notice that I

50
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,479
had in the beginning of my meditation practice and it was with a meditation

51
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:33,919
teacher uh who kind of pointed this out to me and that was I had this like

52
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:39,039
discomfort with just not knowing like I felt like oh I just have

53
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:46,560
to know everything I just you know I don't know I just felt better and I couldn't like say

54
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:53,319
exactly why so some of you may know I'm like trained as a researcher right so this was like suited me perfectly just

55
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:59,919
go figure things out and I loved it when I was a research scientist like I just have a question hm

56
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,440
I wonder if it's because of this and then go design experiments and do experiments I just loved it it kind of

57
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:12,160
like supported this idea like to know things is like the most

58
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,319
important we don't have to know everything it turns out we feel

59
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,800
uncomfortable like not knowing things but there's this way in which just this

60
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,639
wanting to know is Just Thoughts talking to other thoughts talking to other

61
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:36,360
thoughts talking to other thoughts so often it's um in some ways it's just a

62
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:43,120
distraction it's a way in which we're trying to feel more comfortable and because we figure like if I just knew

63
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,319
everything I would feel better but often what's going to help us

64
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,319
feel better is to align with the reality of the

65
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:01,120
moment but so often the reality of the moment is exactly what we don't want

66
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:08,520
it's too hot it's too cold they didn't talk to me the right way I should have

67
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,840
done that thing I don't know there's just so many ways in which it feels like

68
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:20,639
not quite right so we often like just kind of Escape into thoughts and try to figure

69
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:27,360
something out there's this way that that's uh can be a certain type of entertainment but I'll talk a little bit

70
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,560
more about entertainment in a moment but also it's it's just a distraction from the present moment

71
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:38,639
experience if we're okay with what's happening then there isn't this push to

72
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:48,720
leave this moment so there's this way that thoughts

73
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:53,919
you know we don't can't control them of course not anybody who's ever

74
00:07:53,919 --> 00:08:00,120
had a song stuck in their mind sometimes because like an earworm right

75
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,639
NOS like oh why is this song still happening here you didn't make it there you didn't put it there and you can't

76
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:13,599
make it just go away it just shows up again and again right so these things they just arise

77
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,639
spontaneously out of our control they're just uh that's what

78
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:26,039
thoughts do that's the nature of thoughts it's not something that we're intentionally trying to

79
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:34,320
do so maybe instead of this idea that we have to get rid of our thoughts or that

80
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:41,399
uh we should have only maybe I'll just stay there instead of getting having

81
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:47,200
this idea that we have to get rid of our thoughts instead can we have this maybe

82
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:54,880
um aspirations for different types of relationships we can have with our

83
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:02,920
thoughts instead of trying to control them can we have some different relationships and one relationship is

84
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,399
can we not feel harassed or hared by our

85
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:15,160
thoughts is there a way that we can say wow that's kind of annoying that that

86
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:23,600
song is stuck in my head well okay that's just the way it is and let it be

87
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:31,079
okay even though it's not what we want cuz there's this way of trying to

88
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:38,720
make it be different or that little bit of irritation that shows up or trying to figure out like why is this song in my

89
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:45,000
head that's this way in which we're fueling them interacting with them but

90
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:50,720
then if we have this idea okay I don't want to interact with them so I'm not going to so that they'll go away but

91
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:57,200
there's still that secret I'm trying to get them to go away so I'm not going to think about them but it's that trying to

92
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:04,480
not it's trying to make them go away that's going to have them persist so can we just have a

93
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:10,320
relationship that we're just not harassed or hared like yeah okay this is what the mind is

94
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:16,760
doing we don't have to take it personally we don't have to make it a problem we're not making it happen it's

95
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:25,760
you know we're not uh choosing to have these thoughts and just allow them to be there

96
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:31,200
the best we can I'll talk a little bit more more like how we can work with some

97
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:39,040
particular thoughts there's a maybe another aspiration we can have with our thinking

98
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:46,839
is can we discern maybe helpful from unhelpful trains of

99
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:53,000
thought Buddha talked about there's this um whatever one thinker thinks and

100
00:10:53,000 --> 00:11:00,079
ponderers upon that will become the inclination of the mind so with this recognition right that

101
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:05,360
we in some ways we're kind of like making these grooves in the mind with things that we think about a lot

102
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,240
whatever we think about a lot just becomes easier and easier to think about it so if we can notice well what's

103
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:19,160
helpful and what's not helpful if these grooves are going to be made can we have some helpful grooves made as opposed to

104
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:25,920
some unhelpful ones and the Buddha talked about this this was part of his path towards

105
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,959
Awakening when he discovered or noticed oh there are some thoughts that are

106
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:40,320
helpful and some that aren't some that lead to suffering Dua and some that don't and then he

107
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:48,320
talked about when he started to investigate he like kind of like boiled it down to thoughts of Cruelty not

108
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:54,480
helpful causes Affliction and dooka for myself and probably leaks out and causes

109
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,920
it for others too thoughts of ill will just this not

110
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:08,000
cruelty not harming but just like aversion and wanting to push away turns out not to be

111
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:14,920
helpful and thoughts of sensual desire just thinking about how you're going to satisfy every desire you've ever had or

112
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:20,360
something like this also turns out not to be

113
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:25,600
helpful so there's this way in which when we can feel into or maybe just

114
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,959
logically notice like follow so trains of thoughts like yeah yeah it's not so

115
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,800
helpful then there's a way that some of the power behind them some of the

116
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:44,440
Authority or some of the momentum behind them can start to lessen so just to make this

117
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:51,399
observation is this leading to something that's helpful or not is this helpful or

118
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:58,079
not helpful and helpful we can Define as leading to more ease leading to more

119
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:03,880
peace leading to more freedom I keep on saying this and then

120
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:10,199
I'll talk about a little bit what to do with uh things that aren't helpful if you find yourself stuck in something

121
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:15,519
that's really not helpful I'll talk about that at the end here but something that I think is

122
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:20,760
really fascinating is here's the Buddha is these his teachings preserved in the

123
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:27,279
poly Canon thousands of years ago here's somebody who's saying you know all this

124
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:33,920
thinking is tiring and it's straining he was just maybe pointing out

125
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,320
how if we really notice this like always trying to figure things out or always

126
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:45,240
trying to entertain ourselves or whatever it is it's turns out to be

127
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,639
taxing but we don't notice it's taxing unless we have a meditation practice

128
00:13:51,639 --> 00:13:58,639
that we have a experience some calmness and then stability and then we can realize oh

129
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,480
yeah this calmness compared to what my mind is usually doing is quite

130
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:11,519
something this certainly has been my experience and I think this is uh one way we could say we could describe this

131
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:17,800
whole path of practice is just starting to notice just more and more subtle

132
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:23,120
levels of agitation we think like oh wow this is

133
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:29,160
fantastic and then a little bit more meditation practice or maybe it doesn't even have to be meditation practice

134
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:35,560
practice we start to say oh yeah there was that little bit more agitation I didn't notice that's even a little bit

135
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:42,160
more quiet and a little bit more a little bit more we could say this is the entire path of practice so in this way

136
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:47,959
we could say subtle is significant like seeing subtle agitation

137
00:14:47,959 --> 00:14:55,040
subtle way in which thinking is tiring taxing and straining can be a support

138
00:14:55,040 --> 00:15:00,440
for us to not always be pursuing it

139
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:07,560
but then we can um and then maybe the third aspiration we might have for our

140
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:14,680
relationship to our thoughts is well can we if recognizing that planning is

141
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:20,399
really helpful appropriate we need to do it we do need to solve problems there

142
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:25,959
are plenty of problems to solve big problems small problems lots of them we

143
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:31,600
need thinking so is there a way that we can

144
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:37,360
learn to think well like to use thinking to actually

145
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:44,079
solve problems to help ourselves to help others to make the world a better place

146
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:50,399
to help us find more ease and freedom this isn't necessarily during

147
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:58,079
meditation practice but is there a way that we can learn to think well as opposed to

148
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:04,639
maybe just simply a agreeing or disagreeing with what we hear in the media or social media or mainstream

149
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:11,000
Media or whatever it might be instead of just like oh I don't like that that's terrible oh yeah this is good this makes

150
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:21,000
me feel good can we do something a little bit beyond that to solve problems can we um think in a way that really

151
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,839
leads to a place that is can we think in a way that's helpful

152
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:33,800
that leads to a place that has more freedom so there's this way in which thinking

153
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:40,000
well you can say includes asking questions like what what do I know about

154
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:45,720
this what what do I not know about this what is not being said

155
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:51,120
here what what what if I were to look at this from a different

156
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:56,639
direction we could say that the Buddha did this as well as part of uh his

157
00:16:56,639 --> 00:17:02,639
Awakening process too he asked some questions starting with like well what

158
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:08,438
is it that is we could paraphrase and say the big

159
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:17,000
problem he identified it as death it's the big problem and he's like well what what

160
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:22,558
causes to death why is there death what's what is the leading to death came

161
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:28,520
up with an answer but then he didn't stop there he came up with another like well then what leads to that and why is

162
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,720
this like that and thinking and think like thinking in this way and pondering

163
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:39,200
and coming up with a way that pointed to direct

164
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:48,720
experience as part of a key part of uh finding our freedom so can we use use our thoughts

165
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:58,440
this most likely is not during meditation but at other time in a way that ask questions and has

166
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,960
a commitment to finding the answer as a commitment to solving the

167
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,919
problem otherwise there's this way we'll just spin around and around and around I'm sure all of us have done this right

168
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:16,799
there can be this feeling of stuckness like I can't figure this out I don't know what to do but there's a way in which we can't

169
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:22,760
find our way forward I'll talk a little bit more about how to do this in a meditation

170
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:28,039
practice but one way to do this to help with the

171
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:33,640
thinking outside of meditation which we really do want to use thoughts to solve a problem or to

172
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:39,919
plan it turns out it can be really helpful use a pen and

173
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:45,200
paper kind of this oldfashioned way remember those pens and

174
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:50,320
paper there's something like when we write something

175
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,559
down then it kind then it doesn't it have to be kind of like held in the mind

176
00:18:55,559 --> 00:19:02,760
in the same way and then there's a way which we can write something else down and then we can like draw arrows or Draw

177
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:11,080
X's or Circle things or there's a way in which we can get the stuff out of our

178
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,200
mind and onto paper can be a really helpful way I'm not saying this is the

179
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,120
best way for everybody but for some people many people it's really helpful

180
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:28,280
there's a way in which we' gone to keyboards it's we can do this if you

181
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:35,080
have a facility in doing this but there's a way in which a pen and paper kind of you know engages the hand of

182
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:41,880
course and the feeling of the pen against the paper but there's something about drawing a line connecting things

183
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:47,240
or crossing things out or making a bulleted list in the margin or something

184
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:54,679
like this can be really helpful this is what I do to organize talks I uh and it's fun for me to look

185
00:19:54,679 --> 00:19:59,720
back in the chicken scratch I have and it's all kinds of stuff and turn the

186
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:05,720
page this way and write a little things and then I look at it and then H I'm not quite sure and then I then I go to the

187
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:10,919
keyboard and start to organize some of the stuff that's on the

188
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:16,480
paper so this way in which if we want to have this aspiration to use thoughts to

189
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,400
think well that is to really solve problems instead of just swim around in

190
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:30,799
them ask questions have that real commitment that you actually do want to solve it there's

191
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:36,240
a way in which we can get lost just there I don't know how to explain this

192
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:43,679
maybe you have had this experience where you want to solve something but

193
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,799
it's also a difficult thing so you want to solve it and yet you also want to be

194
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:54,679
a little bit distant from it so that you don't feel the emotional

195
00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:00,640
discomfort things that are hard to solve are often difficult because because they have some emotional content that are

196
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:08,039
some of our buttons are getting triggered or something is um maybe a underlying emotion is trying

197
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:13,720
to Bubble Up in some kind of way so can we say well I'm going to try really want

198
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:19,400
to solve this whether this is a big giant thing how do I prepare for my

199
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:24,640
vacation in two weeks or is it you know how do I have this difficult

200
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:31,640
conversation with my co-worker who is always correct ing me or how do I tell

201
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:37,840
my partner that um they're not doing their share of the

202
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,480
housework again but I want to uh make this not be confrontational what are

203
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:50,080
some ways that I can do this in a way that I'm not falling into these old patterns and not so that we don't get

204
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:56,559
into the same fight that we often get into whatever it might be

205
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:05,559
so maybe I'll just say that um I I did uh mention this idea of entertaining

206
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:11,080
thoughts so maybe I'm transitioning now to talk about meditation in particular

207
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:17,880
we might notice that some of the thoughts are just entertainment certainly outside of that

208
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:25,799
either but thinking about well let's see so you know that room I really should

209
00:22:25,799 --> 00:22:31,600
put up some different window coverings because it doesn't really matter match the furniture in there or maybe I should

210
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:38,600
paint it a different color or whatever it might be might have some decorating ideas or we might have some uh thoughts

211
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:46,720
about sports well who should play are they going to put that person in the infield in the next game I'm saying this

212
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:53,840
not really knowing baseball very well so I'm but you know just there's this way in which we kind of uh just think these

213
00:22:53,840 --> 00:23:00,360
types of things it's just a way of the Mind entertaining itself

214
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:06,919
and then we can just if we find this happening we could just maybe like Drop in a question or maybe you could just

215
00:23:06,919 --> 00:23:14,080
even reflect on it right now is there a fear of

216
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,640
boredom does this seem like the absolute worst thing that could ever

217
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:25,919
happen how many quadrillion bazillion dollars are spent to make sure that

218
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:31,200
nobody is ever bored it's quite something

219
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:38,480
right boredom it's not so

220
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:47,000
bad and it turns out if you have a mindfulness practice you can never be bored

221
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:52,840
again just feel like oh this feels like boredom what does boredom feel

222
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:58,799
like sense of impatience there's some restlessness maybe there's irritation

223
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:04,520
with whatever I think should be happening instead or something like

224
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:10,360
this but there's this way just we kind of fall into thinking which often isn't

225
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:16,039
helpful just so that we won't be bored but instead if we notice there's this

226
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:22,320
little thing that we just want to get our phones out can we not take our phones out and

227
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:28,880
just be with the experience of boredom and just get to know it

228
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:35,760
it turns out to be quite interesting which is fascinating that boredom is

229
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,640
interesting so just an

230
00:24:40,799 --> 00:24:47,480
invitation then maybe I'll say so here are some things if you find yourself in

231
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:54,679
meditation some things to work with if you find that you're um there's

232
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:59,720
a uh compuls or obsess compulsive those

233
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:05,600
these are words that don't sound so great but there can be a way in which there's a lot of energy behind thoughts

234
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:13,440
and some spinning and feeling like they're uh have a lot of energy behind them so here's

235
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:21,799
something to do here's some things to do one just drop in the

236
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:28,279
question what will my next thought be

237
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:33,720
ask yourself now what will your next thought

238
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:43,360
be this can be fascinating to kind of like be looking

239
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:48,559
and like waiting for thought and you notice there's a small little Gap a

240
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:55,919
small little Gap while you're waiting for the next thought which the next thought is most likely oh this is silly or wait oh

241
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:01,480
that's that's am I doing this right or something really fast that we often

242
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,399
aren't noticing as a thought but just that dropping in what will my next

243
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:13,880
thought be does two things it shifts our relationship right we're no longer lost

244
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:19,360
in the thoughts We Now The Observer and it disrupts the momentum of

245
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:25,320
whatever was happening these two things can be really powerful and you can just

246
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:31,559
again and again drop in these things what will the next thought

247
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:40,360
be there's something about when I practice with this that uh like the like

248
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:45,440
sitting back and looking at thoughts kind of like connects to just this

249
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:51,919
vastness this openness this space like there's no problems they're just hanging

250
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:58,240
out saying what the next thought is going to be there's something that's can be really beautiful about this because

251
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:04,200
it makes it easier and easier for this vast spaciousness to open

252
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:10,240
up so that's one thing to do if you find yourself with

253
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:16,399
meditation and you there's or I guess it doesn't have to be in meditation in

254
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:25,640
daily life what will the next thought be maybe one thing I I'll say is that

255
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:33,200
sometimes it's helpful if we find ourselves um with a lot of thinking and a pressure

256
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,159
behind thinking to remind ourselves okay these are just

257
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:46,320
thoughts like nothing out there in the external world is changing we're just

258
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,440
thinking because there's this way in which uh we we tend to link some like

259
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:57,840
our thoughts with what's going to happen or might happen or will happen or

260
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:05,640
something like this if we can just say it's just mental activity it's just what Minds

261
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:14,360
do we don't have to take it personally we don't have to make it into a big problem this is just what Minds do

262
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:22,200
there's a way that can help support a a certain amount of relaxation and ease with this recognition of okay this

263
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:28,640
doesn't have to be turned into a big problem cuz thoughts are are actually

264
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:36,600
just if you really look at them are only pointing to

265
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:42,760
thoughts which are pointing to other thoughts which are pointing to other

266
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:50,559
thoughts which are pointing to other thoughts right there's nothing out of here that's actually happening it's just

267
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,880
thinking it's just thinking and so there's this way kind of like noticing

268
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:02,000
not only the in insubstantiality of them but how they're just happening inside

269
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:08,120
here in this uh thought space so that's a second thing if you can bring this to

270
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:13,279
mind so maybe just remind yourself about this when you find

271
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:20,159
yourself with this certain amount of thinking a third thing one what will my

272
00:29:20,159 --> 00:29:26,880
next thought be to recognize it's just thoughts mental activity the third is

273
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:35,720
can you bring some car osity to the experience the experience of

274
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:41,960
thinking but that might be a little bit hard so maybe just expense experience

275
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:47,039
whatever is happening sounds sites pressure against the body you know

276
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:52,120
bodily Sensations feeling the clothes against the skin these types of things

277
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:58,279
just like bring the some of the energy towards other sense doors and then kind

278
00:29:58,279 --> 00:30:05,840
of like take out some of the energy that's going towards thinking so it's a third thing to do is

279
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:10,679
just go towards uh another sense

280
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:18,799
door if you're meditating and you feel like oh wow okay

281
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:24,039
I I this is not helpful and I'm really caught up in this it can be really

282
00:30:24,039 --> 00:30:33,600
helpful to just systematically do a body scan tune into the bily experience on the

283
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:43,200
head on the eyes from the mouth the shoulders upper back lower back chest

284
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:50,640
belly hips legs and feet and just kind of a few seconds in each

285
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:56,919
spot and just checking them this gives the Mind something to

286
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:04,600
do which can be really helpful and kind of like take up some of the bandwidth and it also is a way starts to

287
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,279
help you get more embodied and then when you're more embodied thoughts are less

288
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:17,480
uh spinning around and going elsewhere and things like this so a body scan can

289
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:27,360
be really help just intentionally doing this um systematically through the body

290
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:36,279
then if there's a lot of energy around thoughts when you're meditating you could do some meta

291
00:31:36,279 --> 00:31:41,399
practice because meta practice is using thoughts so it's also kind of like using

292
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:47,880
some of the mental bandwidth but it's using some of the thoughts in a way

293
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:54,639
that's uh positive and supportive and what I mean about me meta practice those

294
00:31:54,639 --> 00:32:03,360
of you who U many of you might already have a met to practice but it's something bringing to mind

295
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:10,720
um somebody who's dear to you and you might send some good willll

296
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:16,320
may you be happy may you be

297
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:25,120
healthy may you be safe may you live with ease so just these four phrases and we

298
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:31,039
could just repeat them may you be happy May may you be healthy may you be safe

299
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:36,519
may you live with ease and this can really just change the

300
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:42,760
inner Ecology of the mind this sincere wish

301
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:49,399
for somebody that we care about somebody that's dear to us and to be wishing them

302
00:32:49,399 --> 00:32:55,840
well can be really make a difference and not there's something also about the Rhythm about just saying

303
00:32:55,840 --> 00:33:03,320
these phrases over and over that just naturally start to settle things down bring some uh stability and quiet to the

304
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:09,080
mind so that the mind isn't just uh thrashing

305
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:16,080
about so I offered quite a few things here if you find yourself really kind

306
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:22,080
like lost in thinking ask yourself what will the next

307
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:28,720
thought be I love this one I I think this is fun it's h can be surprising and

308
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:34,000
can really it just it can be a little bit of a shock to the mind in some kind

309
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:41,279
of way it's not used to being asked what's going to be next recognize it's just mental activity

310
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:47,039
they're just thoughts that are happening and there's a way that noticing that can

311
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:53,320
bring a little more relaxation and remove a little bit of the urgency that might be

312
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:58,919
there bring some curiosity to the experience like to other sense stors

313
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:06,840
what's being heard what's been seen what's being felt in the body do a body scan just systematically

314
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:12,760
go through the body or do meta practice these are some of the ways in which we

315
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:18,118
can work with thinking not because we have to get rid of thinking but just so

316
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:24,200
that we can um have a relationship with our thoughts that really support some

317
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:31,599
well-being and that can be support some greater peace and ease and freedom

318
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:37,760
because when we start to pay attention we start to notice we actually are wrestling with our thoughts or we're

319
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:45,638
lost in thoughts it's either one or the other usually but they're just useful

320
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:53,118
companions can we have them be useful companions instead of being harassed or

321
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:59,560
hared by them and maybe I'll close with this

322
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:07,000
short poem it's by Rosemary

323
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:14,839
traumer it's called could I say it and really mean

324
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:22,760
it by Rosemary trummer a pomegranate tennis racket wide

325
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:29,720
openen Lily B basically anything can act as a trojan horse to get those old ideas

326
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:35,440
close to me and dang I'm confronted again with all the ways I've let down

327
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:41,200
the world in all the ways I could have I should have done better how many times

328
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:47,280
have I tried to escape these thoughts I've run Mountain races and

329
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,839
written thousands of pages and wept a spring flood and confessed and bled and

330
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:58,480
still they find a way back to me

331
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:04,760
Sometimes They Come knives drawn but more often they come wearing fluffy robes and

332
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:10,960
slippers making themselves at home I cornered one

333
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:19,440
today looked it right in the eye what I said what do I have to

334
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:29,520
do it shook its head and said all I ever wanted was for you to say thank you

335
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:34,680
this this different relationship to our

336
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:40,880
thoughts so I'll end there and open it up to see if there's some comments or

337
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:44,000
questions thank

338
00:36:55,760 --> 00:37:01,800
you we'd like to do we'd like you to use the microphone so people can other people can

339
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:06,920
hear uh you mentioned you have a background in research can you tell us

340
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:13,079
more about that if you're comfortable sharing I'll just say I have a PhD in Biochemistry and I used to do cancer

341
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:20,079
research in a laboratory white lab coat the whole B whole whole nine yards cool

342
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:27,880
thanks any else yeah right behind you hello hi um I was just was wondering

343
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:34,760
if you have any advice in terms of um people who struggle with chronic um

344
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:41,000
health issues and whilst meditating and doing the body scans um how do you kind

345
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:46,520
of um not focus on the painful parts of

346
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:53,640
that there's a lot I could say I'll say briefly two things one is it's really

347
00:37:53,640 --> 00:38:00,440
helpful if you can to not use the word that uh rhymes with the word rain and

348
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:06,280
starts with the letter P instead to really think about is this

349
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:13,720
a stabbing or is it a throbbing is it hot or is it cold is it

350
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:20,599
moving is it like dynamic or is it in one place is it diffuse or is it uh like

351
00:38:20,599 --> 00:38:28,119
really pinpointed so that is to kind of like zoom in and maybe like describe The

352
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:34,079
Experience because it's there it's already there so that's one way because

353
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:39,240
there's one way in which we slap a label on it that then we have a relationship

354
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:45,800
with this label oh my gosh this is uh further evidence of my imminent demise

355
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:53,079
you know there's this way in which it all these rightly so appropriately that we have this when

356
00:38:53,079 --> 00:39:00,880
there's I'm just going to use this word pain when there's pain then um we might think it just sets off a whole Cascade

357
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:06,280
of thinking thoughts about doctors and emergencies and what's wrong with us and

358
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:12,040
all these types of things so instead to maybe zoom in is one

359
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:19,359
way um another way is to zoom out and that is I'll just say briefly we

360
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:26,839
could say um to notice not maybe during a body scin if we find ourselves getting sucked into oh my gosh this uh whatever

361
00:39:26,839 --> 00:39:33,240
the discomfort might be can you um turn your attention to other sense doors

362
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:38,680
sounds is a really good one because that uh there's a way and just I'm just going

363
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:44,839
to open up and listen to sounds and just let sounds arise you don't have to figure them out you don't have to know

364
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:52,040
anything about them because opening up to sounds is a way that uh often um

365
00:39:52,040 --> 00:40:01,280
brings a little bit more spaciousness and then maybe the third thing I'll say is um is there a neutral or a pleasant

366
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:07,680
experience in the body and as best you can can you rest the attention there that's often not easy when there's

367
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,960
discomfort it really is compelling and calling for us so I'm not saying that

368
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:18,359
all these will be fast and easy but they definitely are ways forward is that

369
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:24,119
helpful thank you somebody else have a question or

370
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:30,720
comment there was a hand that went up over here somewhere oh or oh sorry Elena

371
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:38,640
um I you know feel like when I am struggling with thoughts

372
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:44,560
and I try different things like You're suggest suggesting in meditation like

373
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:50,119
doing the body scan or doing a meta practice then I start then I start

374
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:56,640
judging myself that I'm jumping around to different strategies and then I think

375
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:04,480
that's like wrong or something do you know what I mean yeah yeah and how long do I do the meta practice should I just

376
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:10,640
do that the entire time or can I then do a self- compass you know self-compassion

377
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:16,359
may I you know be happy may I be and then I start well I'll think about her

378
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:22,760
so then I'm like start then I just do that and then I don't know then I judge that I'm having monkey mind as far as

379
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,760
like my strategies I don't know if that yeah yeah no this makes perfect sense you're highlighting we could just spend

380
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:34,040
the whole time doing like h two minutes of this practice two minutes of that practice two then jumping all around and

381
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:40,400
like this kind of stuff and then one more thing is that I've heard like you pick one thing to focus on like your

382
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:48,720
breath or your the no feeling the breath in the nose or the stomach or the you know abdomen I mean and then like I'll

383
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:55,040
switch and be like no I want to I'm feeling it here no now I'm feeling it there and then I again it feels like I'm

384
00:41:55,040 --> 00:42:01,960
doing something wrong or something yeah this is such a a great comment thank you there's a few things I can say

385
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:07,119
about here so often if uh we start our meditation practice with the wanting to

386
00:42:07,119 --> 00:42:12,760
settle the mind and calm the mind and it's really helpful to choose one thing and to stay on it just as you've heard

387
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:20,599
but if you find that you just can't do that I think it's really helpful to switch because there's concentration

388
00:42:20,599 --> 00:42:26,880
practice is uh just stay stay stay no matter what but here I'm not talking about concentration practice I'm talking

389
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:32,960
more mindfulness practice where we're being with what's uh arising and if

390
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:41,000
what's arising is there's no I just can't settle the minds are all all over the all over the place then we just work

391
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:48,000
with what's arising a mind that's doing something rather and then do the a body scan as

392
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:55,599
best we can and I do agree it's probably best to if we switch I'm using

393
00:42:55,599 --> 00:43:01,280
this word best loose ly maybe maybe here's what's the most

394
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:09,079
useful instead of saying rules we could set a North star is where

395
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:15,000
where does it feel easeful where does it feel

396
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,800
easeful and yeah maybe that's that's uh the

397
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:26,520
direction so if you feel like you're doing loving kindness practice but you're getting wrapped around the axle

398
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:32,280
trying to decide who to do it to and like all these kinds of things which happens right if there's this pressure

399
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:38,480
of of speech a pressure of thinking then there's chances are there's something

400
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:46,040
underneath some emotional thing that we don't want to see and that emotion is still there so it's going to pop up as

401
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:51,640
thoughts or with the busyness with the mindfulness or it's going to pop up as

402
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:57,400
body scan jumping all around or something like this so I didn't say this

403
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:04,960
I could give a whole another talk on thoughts but maybe it's you could drop in is there an emotion that's fueling

404
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:12,040
this so I just said a lot of things so one is maybe to choose a North star what

405
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:18,880
helps with ease if you find that you're just doing this and then doing this and then doing this maybe drop in the

406
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:26,280
question is there an emotion under here that's fueling this agitation that's showing up in in all these different

407
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:32,280
ways and thank you so much you're welcome you're

408
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:37,960
welcome okay so we're at uh 8:30 here so

409
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:45,160
thank you all for your kind attention and you're welcome to come up to here and talk to me if you'd like and I wish

410
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:50,440
