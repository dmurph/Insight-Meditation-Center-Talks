1
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:07,960
okay great so a warm welcome to all of

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:13,280
you wherever in the world you are joining this

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,320
moment so for today's practice we have been making our way

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:28,800
through the different categories um of the Brahma viharas and where we've made our way to the category

5
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:37,360
of compassion cultivating our heart in compassion in karuna for all beings for

6
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:43,079
all beings so I'll say a couple of words about this particular

7
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:50,960
category so this category actually similar to all categories they're

8
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:58,039
aspirational um because sometimes it can feel like wait all beings wishing all of

9
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:03,879
all beings to be free from suffering and be well that's impossible of course they

10
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:10,759
suffer so it's not the I idea that you are going to wish them

11
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:16,640
well and that they will be well um I see

12
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:23,720
a message someone can't hear is anybody else having trouble hearing me no everybody else is having not

13
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:31,200
having trouble so I think it's it might be on your end um so just continuing with that so

14
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,280
so this is similar to the um aspiration

15
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:44,960
to the aspiration to the bodh satva aspiration so the Bodhi satva vow um

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:52,960
which is something like beings are numberless I vow to save

17
00:01:52,960 --> 00:02:01,759
them fully well knowing that you can't save every

18
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:08,840
single being it just it's inconceivable right so to even taking

19
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:16,400
that vow your our perception needs to shift it's it's aspirational we are

20
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:23,040
doing this in order to cultivate our own heart not that every single being will

21
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:31,319
be saved or every single being will be free from suffering but you're cultivating your heart in this case

22
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:38,920
in the wish for every being to be free from

23
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:47,480
suffering to be cared so it's it's training our own heart it's without

24
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,000
attachment to outcome that yes every being will be happy because the outcome

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:58,159
is beyond our control whereas what is within our

26
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:06,159
control is the cultivation of our heart so this practice of Wishing Well of

27
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:12,599
cultivating compassion for all beings everywhere is an aspiration of

28
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,720
cultivating our heart in kindness in

29
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:24,239
goodness okay does that make sense give me a nod if you're with

30
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:30,480
me yes okay all right I'm seeing lots of nods and I don't see every single one of

31
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,120
you but uh but okay so with that

32
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:42,640
aspiration with that aspiration of cultivating our hearts for

33
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:47,840
Wishing Well wishing well for all beings knowing fully well that yes there is

34
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:56,439
suffering in the world there is pain there is sadness and we are not empowered the

35
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:05,480
this one person to take it all away to make it all better but that's not the object it's about us cultivating us

36
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:11,319
turning our hearts into the Good Will may that be so may that be so fully well

37
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:17,239
knowing that it's not possible but may that be so that is our wish that is Our

38
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:23,520
intention all beings no one left out not just these beings but not those other

39
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,520
beings the ones that are this shape but not those other shape no all beings may

40
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,600
all all beings be well so that's the idea here so with

41
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:44,000
that let go of all the words too many words let's practice first of all with

42

186
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,480
practice would love to invite you if you wish to share any

187
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:22,040
Reflections questions comments challenges complaints especially if you

188
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:31,119
haven't shared in a while you can raise your hand um um using the raise hand

189
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:36,559
function or type in chat if you

190
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:52,480
wish what did you notice and knowing that by sharing

191
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:58,000
your wisdom you're supporting supporting the whole SA

192
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:04,318
with your questions observations if you wish

193
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:41,920
and Clark please um like I've always

194
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,480
found uh meta or compassion for all beings difficult because I do well with

195
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,839
visualization and so it's sometimes hard to know what to visualize for all beings

196
00:38:52,839 --> 00:39:01,440
my mind's just like I don't know what that is and I also s struggle with comp passion because I tend to want to like

197
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:09,319
fix the problem or it feels hard to be like here I'm just going to like shine

198
00:39:09,319 --> 00:39:14,920
this light on you not really helping you sorry um but tonight I think what I

199
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:21,119
really noticed was I was like imagining myself as just this sort of like I don't

200
00:39:21,119 --> 00:39:26,160
know Heart Light flying around and I would like imagine a scene and imagine the Heart Light flying around and like

201
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:34,119
Illuminating people and they didn't even necessarily know I was there but I felt like care and tenderness for them rather

202
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:39,760
than when I feel like I have to solve the problem I constrict because I'm like that's a lot of responsibility and I

203
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:47,640
don't think I can do it um I think I'm sure the framing that you did at the beginning really helped me get there uh

204
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:54,319
so it was subtle but it was pretty powerful so I was like oh that's the point right like

205
00:39:54,319 --> 00:40:03,119
that's the point is to don't have to make them smile they might not want it at all but yeah so thank you that kind

206
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,920
of finally helped that land for me the compassion for all

207
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:16,480
beings beautiful Clark I'm yay I'm getting chills as you're describing your

208
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:24,000
experience and how this subtle shift in the framing really brought it a life for you

209
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:30,200
and I love you imagining yourself as the the Del light traveling and just with a

210
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:38,560
sense of concern and warmth for for people's challenges not a sense of it's my respon responsibility that's exactly

211
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:43,800
it beautiful oh beautiful that's it yay

212
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:50,079
yay I'm celebrating your the shift and the opening for this practice for you

213
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:59,079
yay lovely thanks so much for sharing that beautifully shared thank you and Susan

214
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:07,079
thanks um that made me happy what Clark was sharing and then I after being happy

215
00:41:07,079 --> 00:41:13,119
I be I had sympathetic joy that was cool um but I wanted to

216
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:19,000
jump on here and say that I had the experience of being really distracted

217
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,800
and having a lot of thoughts and I'm so grateful for the reminders so often that

218
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:31,000
there's no bad meditation and it you know so I noticed there was a kind of a lack

219
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,280
of beating myself up and then I could just be with the disappointment of not

220
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:44,880
having had those moments of Liberation that I wanted that was cool great thank you

221
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,560
great thank you Susan I really appreciate what you said about oh not

222
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,720
beating yourself up yay yes distractions

223
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:02,839
happen and really that U the not beating ourselves up at the end of this period

224
00:42:02,839 --> 00:42:08,520
of practice as a reminder that's the moment that's perhaps I mean all of the

225
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:16,160
moments of practicing MAA and compassion throughout the whatever 30 minute guid of meditation are just as important but

226
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:21,720
somehow for me that last moment is more important if you don't beat yourself up

227
00:42:21,720 --> 00:42:27,720
because you were distracted yay now that that's that's really in action because

228
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,319
also what you can take to the all of this you can take so I don't

229
00:42:33,319 --> 00:42:40,319
want to privilege anything or another one though it seems like I am but I really want to celebrate not beating yourself up that is so important like

230
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:46,440
yeah I did my best these are the causes and conditions that I tried to bring my mind back and I did my best and I was

231
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:52,119
present for half of it and not and I did my best I planted the seeds and it's

232
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:57,200
okay um beautiful so thank you for sharing I'm so happy to to hear that

233
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:02,280
shift which can happen over time oh great

234
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:08,720
lovely and bill says I was able to generate a loving feeling in short iterations great but it was too easy to

235
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:17,119
let my attention stray and for the feeling to dissipate fine see above as Susan talked about it bill yeah

236
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:24,480
so so dear ones Let's uh practicing Community because

237
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:31,079
now the others who will be in a small GR group with you holding you and you holding them they're part of all beings

238
00:43:31,079 --> 00:43:37,960
they're part you're part of all beings and they're part of all beings so so just as beautifully as as uh Clark

239
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:44,440
described you're This little light shining and not taking responsibility

240
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:51,640
but expressing care expressing warmth for them and for yourself so let's let's

241
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:58,000
work with that image and maybe we'll start with 30 second of silent meta for

242
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:04,400
each other as you go into group just 30 seconds of Silence just looking at each other with eyes open with meta and

243
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:10,319
karuna knowing that everybody here has challenges of course we do um and

244
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:15,960
sharing as much or as little as you wish about your practice after the 30 seconds

245
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,240
so and if you have to go understandable but I hope you stay I hope you stay

246
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:27,319
because this this part of connecting with others is a really beautiful part

247
00:44:27,319 --> 00:44:33,800
of creating creating connections creating community and heaven knows we

248
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:40,000

249
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:47,480
rooms enjoy okay welcome back

250

everyone and we have a few minutes left if you would like to

251
00:44:55,359 --> 00:45:02,480

252
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:08,319
of practice um yeah I would love to

253
00:45:08,920 --> 00:45:16,160
hear love for you to share your wisdom your observations as they support others

254
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:22,440
especially if you usually don't share

255
00:45:23,319 --> 00:45:30,480
Holly hi um just after that group chat it's making me think that life doesn't

256
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:37,559
stop for the meditation um you know like things have momentum or want to come up or want to

257
00:45:37,559 --> 00:45:46,440
be heard or something and then we just sit and we just have a go at the meditation in the middle of what's

258
00:45:46,599 --> 00:45:51,880
Happening yeah yeah do you want to say more they have something specific I I

259
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:57,400
find it helpful because it's like whatever is happening well the happy

260
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:04,440
hour in particular like helps bring an atmosphere of kindness around it and and

261
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:09,760
and then that like Love Can can seep

262
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:19,720
in and then I can hold the experiences more lightly and with more um compassion

263
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:26,200
and yeah and get a bit of distance from it maybe like it's not

264
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:34,319
so like coming from inside and um like dominating my whole experience but

265
00:46:34,319 --> 00:46:41,200
it's my experience is like wider and it's one thing that's happening yeah it saves through yeah I I appreciate what

266
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:46,280
you're saying and and Emily is agreeing with you in chat and she say especially

267
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:52,079
being at home so yeah so there's something about you're you're doing you know you're at home you're doing your

268
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:58,040
thing oh happy hour okay you you you practice it infuses your heart your life

269
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:05,720
and your mind might kind of get uh think about that issue or problem during meditation which is fine you're like oh

270
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:10,800
maybe your P it the heart brings a perspective of kindness towards yourself

271
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:16,280
and towards the human beings in your life that perhaps you're entangled with whatever is happening then you know you

272
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:22,119
come back to the medit guided meditation and then when you leave um The Happy are

273
00:47:22,119 --> 00:47:30,040
is like oh there might be a slightly different perspective it has se through your life yes that's what I'm hearing

274
00:47:30,040 --> 00:47:38,000
yeah lovely what what a beautiful perspective to bring in and to acknowledge to see I

275
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:46,400
completely agree that's lovely that can be the advertisement for for happy

276

hours let the kindness see through your life that's love brilliant thank you

277
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:58,240
Holly my pleasure and Jerry says it was helpful in the group chat to hear how

278
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:04,599
active listening to others is in itself a way of reducing suffering thanks oh

279
00:48:04,599 --> 00:48:11,160
beautiful yeah thank you for raising that anything else you want to add to that

280
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:18,760
cherry oh let me ask hold on I need to there now try

281
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:25,480
it okay so um I was uh I was thinking I

282
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,599
had commented in the group I'll speak to myself but how I was wondering how when people die I know you

283
00:48:31,599 --> 00:48:37,960
had mentioned but when people die that acceptance of it is natural but still

284
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:43,960
people are suffering and I guess I was questioning how am I helping reducing

285
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:49,760
suffering when someone is dying and grieving profusely so I was relieved

286
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:55,400
when I heard the comment of the group about well that actually just by

287
00:48:55,400 --> 00:49:00,520
listening active listening could be a form of reducing suffering and I yeah

288
00:49:00,520 --> 00:49:07,000
because I was feeling some pain that I wasn't doing enough so yeah yeah I I

289
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:13,599
appreciate you raising that and and I want to highlight it some more as you've highlighted and your your group has

290
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:19,760
wisely highlighted that the act of just listening just listening can be so

291
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:26,799
healing um we underestimate how healing and supportive that can be um not

292
00:49:26,799 --> 00:49:33,200
jumping in in fact trying to jump in to fix or give advice can be painful

293
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:38,520
earlier today I was with with someone dear to me who's going through a really

294
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:45,480
difficult time and I just sat and listened just touched her knee and just

295
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:51,280
listened and just listened you know I said M aha yes I agreed but just it

296
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:57,240
wasn't my role to give advice do this you know it just listened just listen

297
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:03,520
and that seemed I could feel the nervous system their nervous kind of relax and mind

298
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:11,880
relaxed it just kind of ah just listening so thanks for raising that

299
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:19,160
Jerry so dear ones we have come to the end of another happy hour together I
