1
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:09,420
warm greetings and from a dark morning in Redwood City

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:15,059
California at the IMC Insight Meditation Center

3
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,480
and um from this kind of

4
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:25,859
seat in the middle of IMC Dharma seat

5
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:33,239
um seeing all your names and greetings and I kind of imagined that the IMC is

6
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:39,420
has stretched and stretched and stretched in circles of the community now extends around the globe and

7
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,520
it's a very nice feeling so

8
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,700
for the meditate oh no sound one person says they have no sound but

9
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,699
when it's only one person it probably has to do with them their their technology rather than here

10
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:03,440
so I'm going to continue and um

11
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:13,700
so one of the

12
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:20,340
I'd like to say something that maybe is a little bit um

13
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:26,220
hopefully in a good way kind of provocative and um

14
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,320
and maybe make an impression on you for this meditation maybe help you become

15
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,280
quieter think less and more be curious

16
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:43,920
what you're capable of discovering or being

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:52,560
when there is more silent awareness in the way that if you listen to a sound

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,799
you don't need to be thinking to hear the sound when you're tasting food you don't need to be thinking while you're

19
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:05,700
tasting it in fact if you think distracted thoughts you might miss the sound or miss the taste

20
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,860
so in the same way so we can put this the thinking mind is not needed for the

21
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:16,440
Deep awareness that's possible in uh

22
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:23,659
in just a deep kind of silent and wonderful awareness

23
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:33,660
and that this awareness that we're capable of um this kind of a natural functioning of

24
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:39,540
our minds our being and if we can leave it alone

25
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:46,940
but our if we're alert to it alert to awareness

26
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:55,319
foreign of awareness by itself just kind of attending to it and the Silence of it or

27
00:02:55,319 --> 00:03:01,800
the Stillness of it or whatever there will be no complaining

28
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,060
no blame

29
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:12,500
and in that lack of complaining and lack of blaming

30
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,000
there is something in the family of love

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,099
exactly what that is it would might be vary from person to person maybe just a

32
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:33,599
simple tenderness or a sense of gentleness towards all things or warmth

33
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:40,500
maybe it's compassion kindness maybe doesn't need to have a name

34
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:47,720
in this wonderful vague English word love is all we need to know

35
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:55,019
so what is it when you sit and are alert to awareness

36
00:03:55,019 --> 00:04:01,319
if mindfulness is very simple and open receptive to

37
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:06,540
what is how is it that there's no complaining

38
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,299
and no blaming in that

39
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,419
and instead there might be something in the family of love in that

40
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:25,020
could it be how is that and I'm hoping that this evocative

41
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,080
maybe if I could have introduction doesn't uh lead you to do a lot of

42
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:38,699
thinking about this complaining about what I said for example uh making exceptions install that that

43
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:43,740
can be for later is plenty of times to think it out and

44
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,040
but maybe there can be a curiosity

45
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,080
as you do your practice and show up for your experience with this

46
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,919
clear awareness in that awareness

47
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:11,000
is it characterized by an absence of complaining and blaming

48
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,139
might it be somehow maybe subtly

49
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:23,360
characterized by love

50
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,000
so to begin with a

51
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:34,699
yeah assuming a meditation posture

52
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:45,060
and maybe the somewhat silent sensing and feeling

53
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:51,240
of the body can be how you begin your meditation to

54
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,479
sense and feel your posture your body and your posture

55
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,419
making small adjustments to your posture in ways that

56
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:10,380
support the body to be more aligned more settled

57
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:13,520
more at ease

58
00:06:21,419 --> 00:06:24,620
and gently

59
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:34,280
closing your eyes

60
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:45,800
and perhaps with a curious quietness of mind

61
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:51,560
or where the quietness of sensing and feeling the body

62
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,600
taking a few long slow deep breaths

63
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,240
stretching the Torso of the rib cage as you breathe in deeply

64
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,819
and let go relax

65
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,620
settle on the exhale

66
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,780
and letting your breathing return to normal

67
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:56,000
and on the inhale emphasize the way the body

68
00:07:56,340 --> 00:08:00,979
can feel and sense itself

69
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:08,599
not really needing the medium of thoughts ideas images

70
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,800
on the inhale feel where the body might be tense or holding you

71
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:20,000
tight and on the exhale

72
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:25,639
allow the body to soften around that area

73
00:09:08,339 --> 00:09:15,560
and for the next two or three breaths

74
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:24,260
feel your whole body as you inhale in whatever way that is easy

75
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:32,279
and as you exhale see if you can quiet or let go of your

76
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:34,700
thinking

77
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:47,060
letting go into your breathing

78
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:13,920
letting go into your body I meant to say

79
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:19,640
letting go of your thinking and letting go into your body

80
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:47,339
and as we continue with whatever capacity you have to be

81
00:10:47,339 --> 00:10:52,459
aware without needing to think about it

82
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:58,160
hearing sounds feeling sensations of the body

83
00:10:58,519 --> 00:11:03,540
simple knowing simple registering of

84
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:07,100
emotions and thoughts

85
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:16,440
being alert to a silent awareness

86
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:21,920
thought free your thought reduced awareness

87
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:31,639
perhaps being aware out there and that awareness

88
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:37,759
there's no complaining complaining or blaming

89
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,380
even if some other place like in the place of thinking there might be

90
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:55,459
go to that place where there's no complaining no blaming

91
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,019
being aware in a quiet way

92
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:13,800
and in that quiet might you find something in the nature

93
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,839
of love within that awareness accompanying that

94
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:24,440
awareness supporting it

95
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:32,360
and as you continue this meditation stay close

96
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:40,880
to the awareness that doesn't complain the awareness that is

97
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:49,399
Associated comes with something in the family of love

98
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:01,760
thank you

99
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:40,279
where is that place in awareness

100
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:48,020
where there is no complaining no blaming

101
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:57,019
might there be some place of awareness

102
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:06,600
um which is in touch with qualities of kindness and good will

103
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,559
love

104
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:31,039
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

105
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:37,679
imagine that you're sitting on a park bench next to someone maybe a friend or

106
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:43,980
someone you know but the after some conversations and

107
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:52,220
talking and there's no need to talk anymore it feels very content to sit quietly

108
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:59,960
and imagine in this quiet Silent Way of sitting with a friend next to each other

109
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:08,840
that you are aware of them you even think of them without any complaints without any blame

110
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,860
but rather with good will not a good will that is a doing

111
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:25,580
something doing good will but rather from a place where awareness

112
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:36,299
has tenderness gentleness good will love care

113
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:43,260
something like that within it maybe your care Your Love can be private

114
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:48,440
do you have to you don't have to tell them you're sitting quietly

115
00:28:51,960 --> 00:29:01,220
and maybe in this privacy of sitting quietly next to each other you can allow yourself to feel

116
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:10,200
fully the warmth the care of this other human being loved

117
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:17,760
that maybe now can extend outwards to the park the trees the children playing

118
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:21,080
the people strolling

119
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:28,520
and out into the world

120
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:40,880
there is a way in which a quiet mind

121
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:50,120
can give room for the heart's capacity to quietly love

122
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:54,320
generously love and

123
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:04,320
may it be that our capacity to do this practice to free ourselves from complaining and

124
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:09,200
blaming hostility of all kinds

125
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:17,840
may it be so that we can promote the welfare and happiness of everyone

126
00:30:18,659 --> 00:30:24,559
may it be that we learn to live effortlessly

127
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:32,179
with the welfare and happiness of everyone may all beings be happy

128
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:39,840
may all beings be safe may all beings

129
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:46,398
be peaceful and may all beings be free

130
00:30:53,310 --> 00:31:02,979
[Music]

131
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:06,919
thank you

132
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:22,559
so this will be the fourth talk on what happened called condition to

133
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,500
consciousness with this wonderful

134
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:34,440
phenomenon the fact that one way or the other in our waking hours maybe other times

135
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:40,020
that we're conscious we're aware we're conscious beings so we're beings

136
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:48,320
and um and maybe that's enough to know but that we also have some way of

137
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,580
constructing a sense an idea a Feeling

138
00:31:53,580 --> 00:32:01,919
of what it is to be conscious as if there's something called Consciousness something that we can call awareness

139
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:07,440
and the danger of that kind of word is that we make it into a thing and so then

140
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:13,440
we try to discover what is that thing whereas maybe it's not a thing maybe

141
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:20,360
it's more like a hologram and that is kind of something a hologram but is it a thing

142
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:26,039
then we get caught up in issues of linguistics and definitions but

143
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:32,100
but um there's some uh this condition

144
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:38,820
conscience is conditioned sense of what this being conscious is a lot to do with states of mind we have

145
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:44,100
and attitudes we have and all kinds of things and um

146
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:49,260
and so today I want to talk about the difference in Consciousness and

147
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:56,100
awareness between blaming and loving complaining and

148
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:03,539
caring so when we spend time blaming

149
00:33:03,539 --> 00:33:09,299
planing and cotton in in the grip of those States

150
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:14,399
it there's a they were caught in the grip there's a tightening there's a narrowing

151
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:19,440
and uh and often that tightening and narrowing of uh around those feelings

152
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:26,820
with ideas are closely connected to the sense of self and it becomes kind of a a

153
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:33,500
a a lumping up a coagulation a a condensing

154
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:41,399
of a lot of different things awareness Fielding Sensations in the body attitudes energies of the thinking where

155
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:47,519
everything kind of gets you can take a strong feeling of me yes Me Myself and

156
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:54,299
mine the self and and um and it's when the blaming is this is

157
00:33:54,299 --> 00:34:01,260
this place of contractions oftentimes that's a source of uh or the the origin

158
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:07,500
of this a strong motivation to be blaming and complaining about things

159
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:13,020
and the Paradox is that this tight place of self that can be felt experientially

160
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:20,898
somehow um is a it's kind of like a um a solid

161
00:34:20,899 --> 00:34:28,740
wall that experience of the World will hit it and uh and it's it hurts it or it

162
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:33,858
threatens it or you know it's this wall is fragile or

163
00:34:33,859 --> 00:34:39,540
whereas when that self-coagulation this contraction of self is not there

164
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:45,300
then the events of the world can still be known very clearly but the known has

165
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:51,000
the knowing has no weight that has no substance it has no resistance and what

166
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,040
is no it just travels right through and we can still be responsible and take

167
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:03,420
care of things but it doesn't hit anything it doesn't reinforce that coagulated that's contracted

168
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:11,280
sense of self and so the blaming and complaining is kind of this world and universe of self

169
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:16,560
and other and conflict and tension and uh in which

170
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:24,660
um there's awareness gets contracted gets small and tight uh it gets filled with that

171
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:29,760
as the uh as we learn to sit quietly and

172
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:35,579
shed the contractions of the Mind the tightness of the Mind things we're holding on to and clinging to

173
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:40,859
then the preoccupation with complaining and blaming will quiet down

174
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:46,619
the motivation to be hostile this sense of hostility within which is part of the

175
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:53,880
same complex will settle and uh and then awareness has a chance

176
00:35:53,880 --> 00:36:00,960
of not being so congested with a lot of concerns a lot of feelings

177
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:06,180
a lot of this a lot of the self that we can live under and this contracted self

178
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:12,780
this tight place of where we're caught up in ourselves and um

179
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:18,660
and so the sense of awareness then our capacity to sense or feel that being

180
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:23,880
aware becomes more and more empty of all this Gunk all this stuff

181
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:30,780
and this emptiness is a fantastic thing um because we then to be aware of

182
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:36,599
emptiness there's awareness of the emptiness and but emptiness can grow in a certain

183
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:43,980
way and have no boundaries can be as big as this room because the cathedral because the space over the ocean

184
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:49,140
and but the but that which knows it kind of begins to share some of the

185
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:55,680
qualities of that it's a kind of like part of the we construct this idea of uh

186
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:03,000
for of what Consciousness is from the way that uh we know the way that not

187
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:10,140
knowing sentencing feeling or wearing um a kind of kind of is and if it's more

188
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:15,839
and more empty it has different characteristics and part of that care part of that is

189
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:23,099
that the more empty it is it allows for something deeper to surface and be present

190
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:30,240
and and I say the call that's something the family of love

191
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:36,000
and I think we find many spiritual Traditions will say something like this in Buddhism sometimes especially

192
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:41,420
Mahayana Buddhism they equate the Deep experience of emptiness with compassion

193
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:47,760
somehow that emptiness and compassion are rise together or there's compassion in emptiness

194
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:54,480
and um and uh and this wonderful kind of uh phenomena of how

195
00:37:54,480 --> 00:38:00,440
somewhere other is some sense of emptiness they talk about uh is uh

196
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:07,940
coterminous with Compassion or impregnated with Compassion or something really wonderful

197
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:14,460
and um and uh so to

198
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:21,180
we have this capacity to nurture others to parental nurturing of children

199
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:27,060
is a deep Instinct we have we have capacity to care for the welfare

200
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:34,140
others like a like a nurse who tends and cares maybe lovingly and

201
00:38:34,140 --> 00:38:39,200
and warmly for whoever's been wounded or hurt or sick

202
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:44,220
and maybe even someone they don't even know but they there's a care there's a

203
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:49,440
kindness there's a warmth that comes and can come in that kind of caring

204
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:57,020
so so this uh kind of amazing capacity that as awareness feels more expensive

205
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:02,160
more peaceful that it's it's a more empty in a certain

206
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:07,579
kind of way there's a room for something to surface in it that doesn't

207
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:13,980
detract from that emptiness because there's no contraction there's no tightening up around it like there is

208
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:20,099
with blaming and complaining um but the the Mind stays open the heart

209
00:39:20,099 --> 00:39:25,280
stays open and then um

210
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:31,380
and then kind of penetrating it all or oozing from it or

211
00:39:31,380 --> 00:39:37,700
radiating can be Good Will kindness friendliness care

212
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,960
tenderness warmth compassion um

213
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:50,339
sympathy empathy and then maybe just plain old-fashioned

214
00:39:50,339 --> 00:39:56,339
love and this is one of the great things of this kind of deepening of practice is to

215
00:39:56,339 --> 00:40:02,300
have that kind of begin to surface and for some people certainly my case

216
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:10,200
that my own capacity for compassion kindness loving kindness meta

217
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:16,020
was not something that I cultivated or worked at developing

218
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:23,280
but it surfaced as I in my practice as I matured in this Buddhist practice there

219
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:28,500
was room for it and something began to emerge and to grow that

220
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:35,160
um uh you know changed my life around this family of Love kind of experience you

221
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:41,520
know we have and uh it felt kind of like this was what was in there waiting to come and in

222
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:47,160
the open space of awareness quiet settled

223
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:53,539
and uh so um um

224
00:40:53,880 --> 00:41:00,960
so I would like to propose to you that complaining and and complaining like

225
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:07,560
blaming blaming and in a complaining way is really a waste of time for you

226
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:14,000
it's really a form of undermining yourself

227
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:19,920
in fact all hostility is an undermining of yourself

228
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:25,338
your hostility if you have it your hostility

229
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:33,480
keeps you hostage not hostility

230
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:40,579
frees you from captivity

231
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:47,099
hostility makes you a hostage your own hostility

232
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:53,280
makes you hostage non-hostility frees you from captivity it's that

233
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,000
dramatic and um and so

234
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:06,540
so check it out if you have a tendency of complaining

235
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:13,320
especially if you have a tendency but even if you have an occasion to complain and with that kind of complaining be

236
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:20,700
blaming someone else you are then um giving

237
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:27,000
someone else responsibility or for your happiness and

238
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:33,540
your peace don't be a hostage don't give away

239
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:39,660
your peace to someone else that way live in your own peace take

240
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:45,300
responsibility for it don't sacrifice it if you need to take care of something a

241
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:52,320
problem in the world it's chances are it's possible to do it to do it even better if you don't

242
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:58,980
complain and you don't blame maybe you can do it better

243
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:05,579
when you're kind support loving caring compassionate

244
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:13,319
so much better that sometimes it's better to wait to address a problem until you

245
00:43:13,319 --> 00:43:20,339
have some modicum of Goodwill some decrease of the blaming blaming and

246
00:43:20,339 --> 00:43:27,000
the hostility so thank you very much and um

247
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:34,880
may your conditioned consciousness nourish you with love
