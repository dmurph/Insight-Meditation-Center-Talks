1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,199
so today is the part two of

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:06,720
the equanimity factor of awakening

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,440
and um

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,040
you know it's also part of this series

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:14,080
on

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,679
mindfulness of breathing which the

7
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,119
buddha presented a little bit like a

8
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,240
path

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,080
that as we stay present for our breath

10
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:23,840
that we're cultivating and deepening the

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,680
meditation practice

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:28,800
um with a deep relaxation of the body a

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,000
deep relaxation of the

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
mind until

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,440
we're not just focused on the details of

16
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,360
our life the particular activities of

17
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,480
the body

18
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,040
or the mind but we start becoming aware

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,760
of

20
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,160
the mind state the state of mind the

21
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,239
quality of our mind

22
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:49,440
the feeling of kind of the gestalt or

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,000
the

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:52,160
wholeness of awareness that can just be

25
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:55,280
here holding it all

26
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,399
and it's a fairly you know mature

27
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,199
place in meditation that we might fall

28
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:02,879
into occasionally where

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,479
the the the mind state is more salient

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:06,960
more

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,520
prominent than the particular details of

32
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,799
what's happening in our body or the

33
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:13,439
details what's happening in our mind

34
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,360
all of these all of the all of the above

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,640
are important

36
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,320
but to be more holistic

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,000
in the practice to some point to get a

38
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,080
sense of that the whole

39
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,960
the mind as a whole the mood mind state

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,560
that we have

41
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:30,799
and those mind states have various

42
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,920
characteristics

43
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:33,520
uh when we get more and more settled

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,759
when the mind feels more

45
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:38,079
whole or expansive or clear the greater

46
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,240
clarity and mindfulness

47
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,240
and the seven factors awakening are part

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,600
of that

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,520
and the last one equanimity is part that

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,920
when the mind when we're really stable

51
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,200
in a strong awareness with a strong

52
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,960
sense of being aware in this

53
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,040
in our mind state a healthy wholesome

54
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,719
mind state

55
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,719
it tends to come with a strong sense of

56
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,880
equanimity

57
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,159
and equanimity being very simply not

58
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,079
getting caught in the reactivity of the

59
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,040
mind

60
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,879
of being for and against things and

61
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,319
and it's a wonderful capacity

62
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,160
we still might be for and against things

63
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,680
might have those thoughts or

64
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,560
impulses a little bit but equanimity we

65
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,080
just simply don't pick it up we don't

66
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,680
get involved they just pass through

67
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,720
they're just

68
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,879
fleeting kind of impulses of the moment

69
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:28,640
that come and they go

70
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,040
and um and we don't we don't pick it up

71
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,120
we don't get involved

72
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:37,040
and it can lead to a tremendous social

73
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,400
good

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,000
because uh when we don't uh

75
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,560
respond socially into the world by our

76
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
reactivity by the quick impulses of

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,640
being foreign against things

78
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:51,200
then uh we're more likely to be

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,879
impartial in a really healthy

80
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,840
understanding of impartiality where we

81
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,680
treat everyone equally or

82
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,239
we don't treat people through the filter

83
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,280
of

84
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,120
our desires and our aversions kind of

85
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,800
leaning into unwanting or

86
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,400
pulling back because we don't want or

87
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,080
something

88
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,840
we don't so easily get pulled into our

89
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,920
preferences

90
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,159
and so a sense of justice a sense of

91
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,000
impartiality sense of being someone

92
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,519
who's safe for other people becomes more

93
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:22,080
and more

94
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:25,040
more stronger the the more we have this

95
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,200
equanimity this ability to

96
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,840
not get caught up in our reactivity or

97
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,680
these impulses of being foreign against

98
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,760
all kinds of things

99
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,760
there might still be wise being foreign

100
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,040
against things

101
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,400
but that wisdom builds on equanimity

102
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
on being stable and settled it's not

103
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,000
impulsive

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,120
there's a clarity and a wholesomeness in

105
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,680
how we respond to the world so

106
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,720
equanimity

107
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,959
is both something for deep meditation

108
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:54,959
and for

109
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,720
everyday life it's a really a

110
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,840
great boon for life in deeper and deeper

111
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,480
meditation

112
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,319
that's some place where some people can

113
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,040
really feel this state of equanimity in

114
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,720
a very powerful way

115
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,799
that gives us a feeling for it and then

116
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:14,159
a support

117
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,920
of what it's like to bring that into our

118
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,519
daily life

119
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,320
but in the anapanasati process it's very

120
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,120
much

121
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,960
the reference point for it is in

122
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,560
meditation

123
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,280
and so in meditation the equanimity is

124
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,360
what allows the mindfulness

125
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,479
to be uninterrupted to just stay in the

126
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:33,840
flow of awareness

127
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,080
here here and we don't find ourselves

128
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,919
drifting off in thought and coming back

129
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,840
two three minutes later

130
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:42,479
we don't find ourselves getting caught

131
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:44,960
and preoccupied by what's happening

132
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,280
now we might be very attentive to what's

133
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,759
happening but we're not caught by it

134
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,840
and so the steadiness of mindfulness it

135
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,440
just kills the course

136
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,639
holds the course keeps walking keeps

137
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,120
engaging step by step

138
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,880
equanimity sort of allows that

139
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,720
steadiness and continuity of awareness

140
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,160
and equanimity that upekka

141
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,400
as i said yesterday has a lot to do with

142
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,199
wisdom

143
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,759
so having an overview of the situation

144
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:15,120
and it's not a wisdom that's

145
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,039
acquired knowledge that we bring with us

146
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,160
and apply

147
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,840
but rather something that we deeply

148
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,919
understand as we go along

149
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,800
and there's a variety of things uh one

150
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,280
can be

151
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,160
that it's not worthwhile getting being

152
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,080
reactive it's not being worthwhile being

153
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:31,360
caught up in

154
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,720
in thoughts or thought up in our

155
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,039
reactivity it's just not valuable for us

156
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,080
and we can feel that

157
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,039
and sense that directly the other is

158
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,479
that

159
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,600
we can have a clear sense feeling for

160
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,280
the impermanence of phenomena the

161
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,440
inconstancy of it how things come and go

162
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,639
and change and to really

163
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,199
understand that means we don't then

164
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,400
relate to things

165
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,000
as if they're going to be there forever

166
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
or if they're

167
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,280
you know something that's fixed that has

168
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,280
to be fixed something fixed that has to

169
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,280
be fixed

170
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,440
and uh and so having a clear sense oh

171
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,280
this is impermanent this is change as

172
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,240
well

173
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,160
uh you can let us set back and just be

174
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,440
willing to just be present be aware

175
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,039
the wisdom of not taking all these

176
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,000
things personally that i'm not unique

177
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,960
that my experience is not unique that uh

178
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
many people have meditation probably all

179
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,160
the experiences we've had

180
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,319
one way or the other others have had as

181
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,280
well

182
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,680
and it's one of the primary roles of

183
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,000
sometimes of a meditation teacher

184
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,280
is to normalize people's experiences

185
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,319
and for the most part to normalize just

186
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,759
make it ordinary it's okay

187
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:42,080
it's just part of the process so we can

188
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:43,680
keep coming back

189
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,759
to the equanimous mindfulness steady

190
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,800
mindfulness that

191
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,680
doesn't get perturbed or agitated by no

192
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:51,280
matter what is happening no matter the

193
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:51,840
fear

194
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,240
or the pain or the suffering or that

195
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,319
we're experiencing a meditation

196
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:59,360
it's all normalized in a certain way

197
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,360
so not taking it personally is one of

198
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,680
those ways

199
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:06,240
and so there's a variety of kind of

200
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,919
wisdoms that come into play that's

201
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,840
really supports this ability

202
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,199
to stay equanimous balanced unagitated

203
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,319
in our experience the

204
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,400
but also this equanimity comes from a

205
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,000
sense of balance

206
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,759
and balance has something to do with

207
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,120
inner strength

208
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,440
to be cultivate when there's a strength

209
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,440
of mindfulness a strength of

210
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,440
concentration is a strength of stability

211
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,880
then uh it's kind of like we have

212
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:38,319
a a

213
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,479
you know as a stability we have a

214
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,560
something that holds us down keeps us

215
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,840
grounded

216
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,120
um allows us to withstand the winds of

217
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,280
the mind the winds of change and

218
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,919
things that come and go and to and to

219
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,080
develop that strength by the continuity

220
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,680
of meditation meditating

221
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,400
maybe almost every day and regularly and

222
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,919
developing this

223
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,080
the mind is an instrument that can be

224
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,720
developed and strengthened and trained

225
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,080
and not everyone develops their mind

226
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,919
everyone trains their mind to be a

227
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:13,599
strong

228
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,720
be strong and part of what ongoing

229
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,039
regular meditation practice is about

230
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,800
is not just showing up and being mindful

231
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,800
of stuff and accepting of stuff

232
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,080
but also developing an inner strength a

233
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,759
capacity to let go

234
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,639
a capacity to really stay present and be

235
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,560
steady with experience and not

236
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:36,000
wander off in all kinds of things a

237
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,880
strength of concentration a strength of

238
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,839
even joy

239
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:44,640
so as we get stronger and stronger we're

240
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,640
not buffeted so much by the winds of

241
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,040
change the winds of what goes on

242
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,279
and so we're more able to kind of hold

243
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:54,640
the course and hold the course and so

244
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,279
as the uh as the ninth step of this

245
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,480
anapanasati mindfulness of the mind is

246
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:02,959
to

247
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,279
um start experiencing and sensing that

248
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,200
we have this amazing resource this

249
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,760
amazing

250
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,760
thing called chitta called mind that we

251
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,040
want to care for

252
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,480
that's a reference point for a

253
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,440
well-being

254
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,240
a wholeness that any kind of suffering

255
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,279
we have

256
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:29,120
is a subset of and so when the mind is

257
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:30,160
really

258
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,720
spacious and open expansive present

259
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,640
we're aware of the cheetah in a more

260
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,080
bigger way it's much harder to take our

261
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,760
greeds or attachments or lusts or

262
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,720
addictions our hates hostilities regrets

263
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,160
resentments

264
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,480
our fears as being all there is

265
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,200
they all become a piece of the puzzle

266
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,200
they're not the whole puzzle

267
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,360
the whole puzzle feels more like the

268
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,399
mind

269
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,440
that can be aware of it all

270
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,800
and and there's a lot can be uh a

271
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,839
feeling of great goodness great

272
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:08,560
rightness

273
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,680
great kind of in that kind of sense of a

274
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,560
mind or

275
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:16,160
this inner life which is whole

276
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,279
and um and so whether it's completely

277
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:19,839
whole

278
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:21,760
or feels completely kind of as

279
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:24,000
satisfying as i'm saying here

280
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,040
uh that keeps coming now as we continue

281
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,920
the practice of anapanasati

282
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,120
step 10 is gladdening the mind or

283
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:35,200
feeling the satisfaction of the mind of

284
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,959
being connected to this mind that feels

285
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:38,399
more whole

286
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,399
and then the the um the 11th step is uh

287
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,560
samadhi is concentrating the mind or

288
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
unifying the mind

289
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,720
which we'll talk about soon enough and

290
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,240
that's what makes the mind even more

291
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,600
whole

292
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:55,040
so it's a fantastic process here and

293
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,920
and i know that it's not easy to

294
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:58,640
experience

295
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,839
all these things i'm talking about but

296
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,560
part of the confidence in practice is to

297
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,440
know

298
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,480
that you're on a good path and

299
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,240
and part of the equanimity that comes

300
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,880
with practice is the confidence

301
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,600
this is a good path to be on i can just

302
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,720
walk this path

303
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,880
steadily keep going i don't have to be

304
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,279
too concerned about how far i've gotten

305
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,560
because i know i'm on a good path and

306
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,240
and i'll keep walking so

307
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:31,200
thank you for today and i look for

308
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,600
forward as i almost every day do now

309
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,160
of coming and sitting and teaching here

310
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,040
with you

311
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,720
thank you
