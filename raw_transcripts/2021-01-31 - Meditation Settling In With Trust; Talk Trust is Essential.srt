for the benefit of self others in the world

139
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:50,079
so for reflections today

140
00:35:50,079 --> 00:35:57,040
i'd like to speak share some thoughts

141
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:06,240
about trust about trust

142
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:16,880
as i was alluding to trust in the meditation dropping it in here

143
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:23,839
and there trust the sense of trust that can be so supportive

144
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:30,160
for practice for our life or humanity for the way we show up who we are in the world

145
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:41,838
supporting ourselves and others so trust the word in pali

146
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:51,680
often transliterate transliterated or written

147
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:59,920
as s a d h sada sada sada

148
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:06,640
beautiful word literally means to place our heart upon to place our

149
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:12,560
heart upon so sada it's not an intellectual

150
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,599
endeavor to place our heart upon something to give

151
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:24,240
our heart to something to trust in it to give our heart to it it's also

152
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:32,000
sada translated often not just as trust but also faith or confidence

153
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:37,839
or even inspiration

154
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:47,680
for some they arrive in the practice of

155
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:55,200
meditation mindfulness buddhism turning away from faith

156
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:02,079
perhaps from this idea of faith or blind faith that's requested

157
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,640
in theistic religions that you have to believe in something before you can

158
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:16,560
[Music] be part of the practices so for some people that resonates so they come to

159
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:23,680
to this practice from an intellectual place perhaps um and that's okay or from a place of

160
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,720
suffering perhaps but not not wanting to have faith place faith

161
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:35,119
in something it just seems too much and some people in fact turn away like faith again and buddhism

162
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:42,480
faith wait i thought i got away from that so you might resonate with that or not

163
00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:50,880
for some people um trust in the divine is not in opposition

164
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:56,320
to this practice there are many practitioners of of other

165
00:38:56,320 --> 00:39:02,480
theistic religions and faiths who also practice mindfulness buddhism

166
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:08,000
etc and there is no opposition to trust in the divine and also

167
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:14,320
have have trust in the buddha sangha dharma buddha dharma sangha as i'll talk about

168
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:19,760
it in the in a bit so and yeah there is no

169
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:28,640
there's no issue there's no opposition yet some others

170
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:34,160
after practicing in this tradition [Music]

171
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:42,400
they actually open up to more divinity and to the sacred through this practice

172
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:48,880
through this practice as as many of us might feel into touch into

173
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:55,839
experience something that's quite profound and unfathomable in our own first person

174
00:39:55,839 --> 00:40:02,960
experience so it might feel opening up to a

175
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,640
dimension of sacred or divinity without without putting it

176
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:13,520
in the box not letting it be in a box

177
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:20,480
where wherever whatever you resonate with or not

178
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,920
and maybe having curious curiosity about what your resonance is

179
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:31,280
with perhaps the terms as i've introduced them so far

180
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:38,640
trust faith confidence inspiration different nuances of this

181
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:47,920
word sada of this word sada so what is surely true and prominent

182
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:57,119
in in this path that we practice together is as the buddha has said

183
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:04,880
come and see for yourself come and see for yourself you don't have to sign up

184
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,280
to anything at the beginning you just come and see for yourself if it works for you

185
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:18,880
great and if it doesn't great it's come and see for yourself

186
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:26,880
so in many ways this practice excuse me

187
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:35,838
so in many no still the tickle in the throat is here hold on sick

188
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:49,838
okay let's try that again

189
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:57,119
all right i think it's going to come and go i trust it will be okay and we'll see so

190
00:41:57,119 --> 00:42:02,560
i hate pasako come and see for yourself so

191
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:08,560
um there is a sense of you know there needs to be still even

192
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:13,920
with that come and see for yourself there needs to be some sort of trust

193
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:19,839
some level of faith some level of trust but okay i'm going to give myself to it

194
00:42:19,839 --> 00:42:25,520
because even if we you know if we come to it with the

195
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:31,040
invitation of ahipasico we come to it but we're just apprehensive we're not giving our heart

196
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:37,680
to it um it it may not work we we need to give our hearts to it trust it

197
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:42,880
at least for a certain amount of time and then if it's working great if it's not then

198
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,920
it's not working for you but but if we're checking our watch every five

199
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:54,720
minutes okay is it working is it working um do i have more ease freedom am i enlightened yet

200
00:42:54,720 --> 00:43:01,760
oh it must be enlightened you know just just if if there's not a sense of trust giving yourself to this practice

201
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:08,079
with humility um it it probably won't work

202
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:13,760
so there needs to be that sense of trust or faith and it could be

203
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:20,319
and they could be borrowed trust it could be borrowed trust or bright trust they're

204
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:25,359
different borrowed a bright trust before it becomes

205
00:43:25,359 --> 00:43:31,920
verified trust and then if it as it moves to

206
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:40,240
unshakeable trust so so it often starts with bright trust we see

207
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:47,760
someone we who who's different who's acting in the way we want to

208
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,839
be in the world or act or they have more freedom they have more ease

209
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:59,119
um so that sense of um bright

210
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:06,640
that sense of brightness of of the trust there's sense of brightness there

211
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:12,319
um like oh i'm attracted to this there is something there is something that inspires me

212
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:19,119
there's something that's inspiring my trust ah and then

213
00:44:19,119 --> 00:44:24,240
there can be borrowed trust borrow trust

214
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:29,920
which can be similar to bright trust in that you're borrowing trust from from what

215
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:36,880
you're witnessing in another person and i often actually work with borrowed

216
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,240
trust and practice meetings with with with students where

217
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:50,319
i can see their capacity i can see their beauty i can see their goodness and

218
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:58,240
when they are hesitant and then they say well i don't know about this and i say okay i have full trust in you

219
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:04,079
i i fully trust i fully trust you um with this practice with this

220
00:45:04,079 --> 00:45:10,480
invitation with what you're about to to to undertake is it okay if i hold it

221
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:18,000
for you and for you to have borrowed trust to have the trust that i have that i

222
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:25,040
have in you to borrow from that for now until you see for yourself

223
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:33,280
and it becomes verified trust becomes a verified trust because then after a while it feels like wait this

224
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:40,319
this thing works this thing works oh there is it so it becomes verified it's not

225
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:48,319
bright or borrowed anymore it becomes verified yes you realize you look back

226
00:45:48,319 --> 00:45:54,079
perhaps in your life and see again it's practices like stock market don't check

227
00:45:54,079 --> 00:46:00,000
on it every single day every single hour but look at it long term if you've been practicing for

228
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:04,800
weeks and months look look at months or even years

229
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,640
consider some areas of your life where you used to

230
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:16,400
be very upset anxious etc etc things that were really

231
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:22,319
challenging for you that are not challenging anymore and c oh

232
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:28,640
verify trust something is shifting i have more peace more ease more love

233
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:35,440
more gratitude whatever it might be whatever it is you're you're serving and trusting

234
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:43,119
and after a while of doing this practice it becomes it becomes unshakeable trust

235
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:48,160
your your trust becomes unshakable you know it works of course it does

236
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:53,520
and yeah you might have a day or two or a week or a month when you have monkey mind and this and that

237
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:59,520
but you have unshakable trust that you're planting seeds it's working

238
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:07,119
quote unquote working in some ways that you may not be able to fathom and in some ways it's opening you up

239
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:12,160
even if in your in the way

240
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:19,119
you're judging it it seems like it's not working but trust try you becomes unshakable trust yes of

241
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:25,359
course i'm giving my heart to this i've given my heart to this

242
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:33,760
so so trust or faith i will use that word faith there's a sense of faith

243
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,599
that gets developed after a while after a while and a sense of confidence

244
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:44,800
confidence in yourself i like the word confidence somehow

245
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,559
sometimes it might feel a little intellectual and yet it can also feel

246
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:55,839
embodied a sense of ah confidence in the heart i like to point

247
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:03,200
in the heart center but sense of confidence like yes trust confidence

248
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:10,720
so it could be that actually these different terms these different translations such as inspiration for

249
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,640
example it can refer to the earlier um to the bright trust like ah

250
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:22,640
inspiration and then later it becomes maybe again we can

251
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:29,040
i can wax philosophical about all these terms but maybe after a while when it becomes

252
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:35,440
unshakable trust there's it's actually faith that that translation works better for it

253
00:48:35,440 --> 00:48:40,880
but maybe at first inspiration works better as a translation of sadha

254
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:48,400
maybe later borrow trust verify trust confidence as one of the

255
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:54,880
translations and then unshakeable trust or faith just putting the cards on the table at the

256
00:48:54,880 --> 00:49:01,200
end so so trust is needed it is needed

257
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:10,079
and in fact if it wasn't for trust we wouldn't be here right now practicing together because

258
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:17,200
the buddha after his awakening the story goes that he didn't want to

259
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:23,119
teach he didn't want to teach he thought oh the dharma is

260
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:31,920
i can't teach this people won't get it why why do i bother and and he was asked

261
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:37,040
by his friends his his the the five disciples by his first five friends

262
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:43,920
no please please they're bonte dear sir there will be people with little dust in

263
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:49,119
their eyes with little dust in their eyes who will understand

264
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:56,079
who will understand the dharma so he trusted that there are people with

265
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:02,640
little dust in their eyes that yes there might be other people who

266
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:10,319
won't understand won't listen won't get it but that's okay trusting that there will be people with

267
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:16,559
little trust in their eyes who would understand and that's such a beautiful metaphor little does we

268
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:22,240
we all have dust we little dust isn't that great it doesn't say people with no dust in their eyes yeah

269
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:30,559
little does we still don't see clearly we have confusion and delusion and you know all that um you know hatred

270
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:35,759
ill will and attachment yeah a little dust but still

271
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:41,839
to see the dharma to see the beauty the beauty of these teachings the beauty of this path that

272
00:50:41,839 --> 00:50:47,200
can open us up in these profound ways so thanks to his

273
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:53,520
trust to to have shared what he discovered here we are

274
00:50:53,520 --> 00:51:01,119
so and of course going even further had he had not had he

275
00:51:01,119 --> 00:51:07,680
uh had no trust in his ability in his own um in his own being

276
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:13,599
etc etc all the inner trust and faith in him actually sitting under the bodhi tree and saying

277
00:51:13,599 --> 00:51:20,480
i'm not going to get get up until i'm awake and all that trust all that sense of confidence

278
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:27,680
that that really went through his own discovery and and to think that he wasn't a god figure

279
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:32,880
he was a human being just like us the same dna and a human being just

280
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:39,920
like us so so with with the idea

281
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:47,839
of of trust or sadha sadha um in this tradition

282
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:54,319
it's it's often invited for the triple jewel

283
00:51:54,319 --> 00:52:00,160
so i want to say a little bit about that as i referred to trust in buddha dharma sangha earlier so

284
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:06,720
what does that mean let's decode it a little bit because we can take it by face value oh yeah

285
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:12,800
trust in buddha this human being that existed trust in the dharma the writings and the teachings

286
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:18,160
or trust in the sangha the the community of practitioners now and in

287
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:26,640
the past so yes that's absolutely one way to um to interpret it and yet

288
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:32,640
and yet there is a much more profound i would

289
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:38,400
say deeper another dimension for our hearts to open to what actually this

290
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:45,440
idea of trust in the triple jewel means for us to have a meaningful

291
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:53,599
even more meaningful even more meaningful personal relationship to it

292
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:59,440
so first and foremost trust in the buddha

293
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:06,960
in addition to the historical figure but the buddha within

294
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:14,480
to trust that this being right here is not broken

295
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:22,880
or damaged goods or bad that trusting that you are inherently

296
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:29,359
you are inherently good you're inherently lovable you're inherently loved

297
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:37,520
completely loved beyond all the imaginations beyond all the ways

298
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:42,559
that you judge yourself so trusting in the buddha nature trusting in the

299
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:47,680
goodness in your capacity for awakening that yes

300
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:54,079
you too i too it's it's here it's here and

301
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:59,599
it's a trust that above it's above and beyond the personhood

302
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:07,680
it's trust in something that's above and beyond what you can control so much

303
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:13,520
yes there are things that we can do practices and we do our best we do our part we do

304
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:21,440
we hold our end of the bargain and trusting that the other part something that's above and beyond

305
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:27,520
what we can fathom control that yes there is this goodness

306
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:38,799
so trusting having faith fully trusting giving our heart to

307
00:54:38,799 --> 00:54:45,040
giving our heart to giving our heart to

308
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:52,160
the goodness the beauty that shines and trust it's here trust it's here

309
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:58,480
even if at times we can't see it or it gets lost trusting that it's here

310
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:10,480
the second of the triple jewel the dharma trusting in the dharma

311
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:17,760
yes the amazing teachings the paulie cannon all of this

312
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:23,200
that's passed down yes this is pretty awesome and yet

313
00:55:23,200 --> 00:55:31,119
another way of relating to it another way of relating to it is

314
00:55:31,520 --> 00:55:38,000
trusting the lawful the lawful unfolding

315
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:46,640
of of the universe of the world this the lawful unfolding it's it's unfolding

316
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:55,280
according to laws according to to order that i don't understand

317
00:55:55,280 --> 00:56:00,319
i don't understand but i trust but i trust

318
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:05,920
i trust it's goodness i trust it's goodness

319
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:13,680
and this is something that has been brought this this importance of this trusting this this

320
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:21,119
the universe the lawful nature of universe we see that both in in here in this practice and

321
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:27,520
so many different practices that it's important to to make that choice

322
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:34,160
albert einstein my hero one of my heroes puts it

323
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:40,799
quite beautifully actually that one of the most important lessons or one of the

324
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:47,839
most important decisions that we make in our lives is to decide

325
00:56:47,839 --> 00:56:54,720
whether the universe is a good

326
00:56:54,720 --> 00:57:01,200
is whether there's goodness in the universe whether we trust it or whether it's

327
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:06,799
neither good nor bad that god is playing dice with the universe is

328
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:12,319
what he said or that it's actually unfriendly we don't trust it

329
00:57:12,319 --> 00:57:20,880
he said this is the most important decision we need to make because if we decide that the

330
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:26,960
the the universe the lawful nature that nature in its lawful way it's there

331
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:35,359
is not goodness in it it's there there's ill will and we don't trust it then

332
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:41,440
we use all our might we use all our science all our

333
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:47,040
energy in order to to defend ourselves destroy it there's a sense of distrust

334
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:52,798
that that comes up and we don't revere we don't appreciate

335
00:57:53,920 --> 00:58:00,160
nature etc if we if we think that that the world universe dharma is

336
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:08,000
neither filled with goodness nor nor it will but it's kind of like ah

337
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:15,599
it's random random random then then he suggested that we end up

338
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:22,000
kind of feeling lost and nihilistic like uh whatever what's the point it's

339
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:27,599
it's all random and yet the third choice if we have a sense of

340
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:35,839
trust in the goodness and we can choose to do that if we have a sense of trust in the goodness

341
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:42,799
of the natural laws then we use our science our minds our

342
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:48,160
hearts to defend to defend it to support it to love it to

343
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:55,040
um and and we actually will be happier ourselves it turns out there are studies or

344
00:58:55,040 --> 00:59:00,480
psychological studies that point to how

345
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,680
both personal or personal as well as societal happiness

346
00:59:05,680 --> 00:59:14,480
is linked to the level of trust wow who would know who would know

347
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:22,480
that trust is related to both personal and societal happiness and it turns out societies that are more

348
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:28,079
trusting and of course than personal persons who are more trusting

349
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:33,839
there is more happiness more well-being and also there's links between

350
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:40,720
kindness that can actually increase level of trust and happiness so

351
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:47,359
kindness some there's a study that suggests that it

352
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:54,160
works as a link between trust and happiness so random acts of kindness maybe try this

353
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:59,200
out don't take my word for it don't take the research of this researcher don't

354
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:04,720
take their results for it see what happens if you if in some relationship for example or in some

355
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:13,599
community you start doing acts of kindness random acts of kindness to to notice over time how that might shift

356
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:21,200
how that might shift the the link between the happiness and the trust in between

357
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:27,119
this community and this relationship there are also more studies about the

358
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:34,799
connection between trust and oxytocin and how it modulates fear depression it's it's absolutely

359
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:40,480
fascinating trust giving our hearts to giving our hearts to

360
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:47,119
so the third of the triple jewel being the sangha again as i was

361
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:53,760
relating to it having this sense of trust in basic human goodness and humanity and

362
01:00:53,760 --> 01:01:01,680
people around you with you and and humanity at large that even if people are expressing their

363
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:08,240
anger frustration and in the will that that there's still common humanity there is but in nature

364
01:01:08,240 --> 01:01:14,480
in every single being and in fact every time you get into a car you're trusting

365
01:01:14,480 --> 01:01:19,599
in the basic goodness of humanity there is this this this social

366
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:25,599
trust that okay i'm going to stay in my lane you're going to stay in you're like we're going to do our best and of course

367
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:30,720
your things could happen but you're going to do your best i'm going to do my best it's kind of a sense

368
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:38,319
of a trust if there was no trust in the world nothing would would ever happen get done

369
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:45,119
so much more i can say about that but but time is short so

370
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:52,000
so as a practice

371
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:58,480
trust can serve so in so many ways it can serve us in so

372
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:06,079
many ways and i invite you to to explore and discover it for yourself

373
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:13,599
in one way that it can show up is as an antidote to anxiety fear and

374
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:16,000
worry

375
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:26,480
and the practice could be trusting trusting that it's okay so if in this

376
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:31,920
moment anxiety arises having a sense of

377
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:38,880
perhaps spaciousness like actually can i trust that it's okay this

378
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:46,319
anxiety can be here but it can be held in a wider perspective trusting that it's okay no matter what

379
01:02:46,319 --> 01:02:53,839
it's okay ah trust trusting in the okainess no matter what

380
01:02:53,839 --> 01:03:01,440
similarly with fear which is often future oriented um i had this experience recently a

381
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:06,559
thought came up thinking and i felt a tightness in my chest oh

382
01:03:06,559 --> 01:03:14,960
ouch what if this thing happens then i thought what came up for me was um

383
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:21,920
i trust that it'll be okay no matter what even if this thing awful

384
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:28,240
thing happens it'll still be okay there's a basic okayness and

385
01:03:28,240 --> 01:03:33,599
and oh it just it just released to release the sense of

386
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:40,480
the sense of um fear or worry and in fact awakening

387
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:47,760
nibana nirvana one of the translations is fearlessness and this is the path of

388
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:53,359
fearlessness where there is no fear no matter what happens

389
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:59,760
what or what is happening like whether we deem it to be good bad

390
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:06,400
if we take ourself out of it with in a bigger sense of spaciousness

391
01:04:06,400 --> 01:04:14,400
and having unshakable trust that gets developed as we practice more and more and more

392
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:22,160
this sense of fearlessness no matter what there's nothing to fear because nothing can truly happen

393
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:28,160
to you and i'll say that it may not make sense but there's

394
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:34,160
nothing that truly can happen to you if that's you it's all okay

395
01:04:34,160 --> 01:04:41,599
you're really okay it's all okay and i'll drop drop that in as a zen koan

396
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:47,920
which i fully believe and i'll leave that be as huh and i won't try to explain it

397
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:54,960
because it's not one of those things to be explained it's it's to be experienced

398
01:04:54,960 --> 01:05:03,039
and one last thing you know it's about um you know you've said fake it till you

399
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:08,880
become it well fake it till you make it but i like to say fake it till you become it

400
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:14,640
see what happens if you bring in trust if you bring interest if you practice it if you

401
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:20,079
practice it until you become it you really become it

402
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:27,280
so what do you lay your heart upon what do you trust

403
01:05:28,640 --> 01:05:37,039
and i thank you all i thank you for showing up in the best way you've been able to

404
01:05:37,039 --> 01:05:43,839
we've been able to showing up for ourselves for those we love for all beings

405
01:05:43,839 --> 01:05:50,079
everywhere may all beings be happy may all beings

406
01:05:50,079 --> 01:06:04,079
have fearlessness may all beings be free

407
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:13,359
thank you so much
