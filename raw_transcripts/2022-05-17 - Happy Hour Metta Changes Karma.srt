00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:26,640
so so for tonight or this moment whatever the time zone might be you're in

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:34,719
i'd like to um invite us in a practice in the reflections and in the guided meditation

6
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:43,600
um to consider karma and meta so the theme of karma is something that

7
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:51,120
by the way i've been i've been subbing for gil of those of you who show up to the 7 a.m yes some of you are here i see

8
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:57,520
you and this morning i talked about karma and um

9
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,239
i wanted to bring that in to in the spirit of happy hour the way we practice

10
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,280
with with meta and the whole all the hard practices so i want to say

11
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,119
something first briefly about karma

12
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:21,360
that it's not really it's not a teaching about

13
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,640
what we've inherited from the past magical life or

14
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:33,280
or somehow explain why you know we're having poor fortune here i must have done something terrible in

15
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:39,439
my past life where this other person must have done something bad in their past ouch ouch

16
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,640
not a helpful way to use this profound profound teaching

17
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,840
so it's unfortunately co-opted in the west and misused really misused in these very

18
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:57,680
painful ways that's not really helpful it's not appropriate it's not serving it's not really a

19
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:04,320
practice it's just a baton for for or it's for self-flagellation it's a um

20
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:11,599
rod for self-fragilation not at the top but anyway so so instead one way to understand um the

21
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,879
teaching of karma or the way really to understand is

22
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,800
is that there are three aspects to karma

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,680
and they're all intertwined one aspect is the intention the wanting to do an

24
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,720
action the second part is the doing of the action but the

25
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:40,640
action could be action of the mind actually no speech action of the body so

26
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,640
a thought is considered an action of the mind or okay that's number two

27
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:54,160
number three the third aspect is what is done is is the result is the result of

28
00:02:54,160 --> 00:03:02,159
what has been done is the is the is the karmic uh disposition that we're left with that

29
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,920
we are left with so all of those aspects both the leading aspect which is the

30
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:15,680
intention the doing and what is done that is karma that is what we are left

31
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:21,040
with that's what shapes us and we are

32
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:26,319
product of our quote-unquote karma because of the actions of the intentions

33
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:31,360
we have taken all these moments of the doings we have done and

34
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:39,200
the the results of those actions and it's also concordant with neuroscience so

35
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,560
not going to too much detail speak more about in the mornings if you guys want to show up

36
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:52,080
but how i want to relate it to the practice of metta for us in this in this community is

37
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:59,040
if you want to be kinder to yourself and to others

38
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,599
then intend to be kinder right lead with the intention have the intention to be

39
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,280
kinder do an act of kindness part two an

40
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:17,680
act of kindness again could be thoughts of kindness could be words of kindness

41
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,680
could be physical acts of kindness towards yourself towards others right that's

42
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:29,600
part two part three part three is that you are left you will be left with you'll be

43
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,720
shaped you'll be shaped little by little

44
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:39,840
to have a kinder disposition wow

45
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,520
pretty cool hey karma is powerful

46
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:52,320
we can produce our own karma it's not this magical thing we produce our karma

47
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,759
moment by moment by the way we think the way we intend

48
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:04,479
the way we act and what and the result that it's we're left with and then we tend to do those

49
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:10,080
more and more so if you find yourself not being kind okay just pause

50
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:17,039
change just shift a little bit shift shift and probabilistically speaking

51
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:23,600
the accumulation over time you will be changing your karma you'll be you'll be acting you'll be going down a

52
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,120
different path that'll become your habitual way of being in the world so

53
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:35,360
karma is profound especially when it comes to practicing loving kindness so

54
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,479
so let's produce some good karma

55
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:47,280
for ourselves really and in that way i'm not again with the definition i've given it's not

56
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,320
something magical but let's intend towards kindness with our intention

57
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,759
let's engage in thoughts words and actions of kindness oh and see what

58
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:06,720
kind of a result we are left with and we are we will be left with a different karma

59
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:13,120
with with wholesome karma wholesome karma instead of unwholesome karma

60
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:20,240
so such an empowering teaching such an empowering teaching is karma

61
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,000
it's not a you know matter of fate or destiny oh

62
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:31,600

00:29:53,760 --> 00:30:00,480
you can stay with this dear being or extend extending intention to be kind

165
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:08,640
to more beings many more beings

166
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,559
may all of us may all of us be well

167
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,039
including

168
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:28,200
yourself letting your body be soft be relaxed

169
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:58,398
and if thoughts challenging difficult thoughts emotions are arising

170
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:03,000
can there be kindness

171
00:31:06,399 --> 00:31:12,080
as a response not believing

172
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:19,919
not falling into the judgments the grief in this moment

173
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:24,200
i just hold it with kindness

174
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:09,200
even if a thought is annoying or if someone comes up

175
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:14,640
the landscape of your mind doesn't you're annoyed or displeased can you

176
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,559
still be kind to yourself to this being who doesn't know any

177
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,559
better

178
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,278
who's acting out of confusion delusion

179
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:41,960
having dust in their eyes lack of wisdom

180
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:16,158
planting planting seeds of kindness planting seeds of kindness

181
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,320
planting seeds of wholesome karma

182
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:14,319
and for the last moments of this practice period

183
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,800
can we be kind to ourselves

184
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:30,960
kindness in this moment for whatever arose or did not arise we've done our best

185
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:38,480
to be kind to this being who's me here and now we've done our best

186
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,480
to cultivate good will for others

187
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:49,838
whatever came up or did not come up

188
00:34:52,320 --> 00:35:00,320
it's an unfolding it's an unfolding of causes and conditions past thoughts actions karma

189
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:06,880
it's okay you can forgive it let go forget

190
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:15,040
and intend in this moment to be kind one moment of kindness

191
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:20,800
infinitely more powerful than zero

192
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,920
moments of kindness

193
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:30,280
may all beings be

194
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:35,880

199
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:26,720
to uh share reflections questions comment

200
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,720
richard i see your hand

201
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:39,359
am i unmuted you are well i i wonder if you could help me

202
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:45,520
briefly uh i guess for a long time to this moment i sort of think of the

203
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:52,960
brahmavir as warm and squishy and bare awareness is neutral and chilly and

204
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,400
dry and some i i think that's causing a split

205
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:05,920
down my personality yeah yeah well well said you're not

206
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:15,280
alone richard it's so well said yes meta warm comforting nourishing

207
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:22,000
pipasana or or awareness or open awareness as neutral

208
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,680
cool yeah it's and and then this feeling is split

209
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,119
in your personality so well said so was it i think you already know the answer

210
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:41,920
yourself no no no okay all right i think you do but okay all right so um

211
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:49,040
so um yeah so you know the sense of

212
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:56,079
kindness gentleness it has to be imbued it has to be part of

213
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:02,560
our awareness when we do vipassana when we do inside practice when we do open

214
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:09,680
awareness if that kindness isn't there it becomes so dry it becomes

215
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,280
can become a grim duty it's it's lacks it's just gentleness i

216
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:21,920
i often quote joseph goldstein i love what he says he says

217
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:28,560
wisdom wisdom practices and open awareness is a wisdom practice wisdom without

218
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:36,880
metta wisdom practices or vipassana you know fill in the blank without meta is like riding

219
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:46,800
a bicycle without air in the tires so richard please put air in your tires

220
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:54,000
please bring kindness gentleness in every mind moment it can be imbued and

221
00:38:54,000 --> 00:39:00,000
and i'll be in higher teachings you know the sense of kindness gentleness there's

222
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:07,760
this goodness imbued in every moment of of of awareness of mindful of sati

223
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:14,800
so um they are not separate and so many here's my personal opinion

224
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:20,640
my humble opinion um that many practitioners practice for

225
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:27,040
many years i'm not talking about you but many practitioners practice for many years without

226
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:33,440
um fruition without um

227
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:39,760
getting well i don't want to say getting somewhere but you know without just uh

228
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:45,520
with with a lot of challenge let me put it that way i'm feeling a lot of challenge because there isn't enough

229
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:52,400
meta and care and ease and gentleness imbued in vipassana so i'm so grateful you

230
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:59,520
brought this question up it is so important and it's not so difficult i mean you

231
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:05,200
you know how to practice meta it's not just you know here's a problem

232
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:11,599
that i'm going longer this is not a short question because it's such it's a short answer because it's such an important

233
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:17,599
question see that the problem arises from westerners often thinking of meta

234
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,880
practice just as the phrases may i be well may you be well that's just one

235
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:30,160
expression of meta practice as you know because you've been coming to to this practice um

236
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:35,760
to the to the happy hour for so long the way i offer and teach you sometimes

237
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:42,319
a lot of times it's without words it's like resting the feeling resting in the care and the gentleness

238
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:49,359
in you know when the thoughts for example come just smile at them be kind to them all of that is meta all of that

239
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:56,640
is bringing meta into awareness practice so there is the infusion i hope that

240
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:04,640
helps richard thank you you're welcome thank you for that very important question

241
00:41:05,599 --> 00:41:11,599
invite me to reflect for the benefit of many beings

242
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:18,800
catherine says i was one of those practitioners the dharma only started actually landing for me when i opened my

243
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:25,520
heart to meta practice it has changed everything yay

244
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:30,640
yay thank you katman thank you so much for sharing oh it's beautiful that makes

245
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:36,480
me so happy it makes me so happy apparently others do i see hearts

246
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:43,200
so so any other questions reflections about

247
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:49,560
today's practice as we engage together

248
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:03,280
nima yeah um i really appreciated this

249
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:09,359
because i had never looked at it from that angle that um the way you explained it it is

250
00:42:09,359 --> 00:42:14,400
empowering it's not like i'm a victim to my own ignorance and not knowing

251
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:19,599
what karma was it's it can change today like right now like this practice and i

252
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:25,520
didn't never i never looked at a meta and coming to happy hours planting seeds

253
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:30,720
of that karma to change my whatever causes and conditions of

254
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:37,599
yeah my constitution of how i am or whatever um so this was a really uh helpful way of

255
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:43,280
looking at the practice very soft very

256

259
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:07,440

260
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,040

00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:37,680
you can also type them in chat if you type them to me

265
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:43,170
privately i'll only read the reflection if they're typed to everyone

266
00:43:43,170 --> 00:43:49,040
[Music] i will read your name also it'll be public

267
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:59,839
um silence is always welcome too

268
00:43:59,839 --> 00:44:06,240
the complaint's true questions if something didn't work it's all welcome

269
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:09,839
warmly welcome

270
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:21,440
tell you what let's shift and turn and engage with each other

271
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:28,319
in small groups and the invitation today the invitation

272
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:33,920
for the small groups is um you know you can share it by your

273
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:40,880
practice if you wish you can say a word about any insights aha moments challenges or

274
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:47,680
maybe about karma and metta this relationship of exploring

275
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:53,040
karma in this new empowering way so um

276
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:59,920
again as always you're asked to just share from your own experience not

277
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:06,560
serving as a um um what's it called facilitator for the

278
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:13,440
group just speak from your own experience just ask your own experience that's it and let other people speak

279
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:18,880
from their own experience or say pass people can say pass and hold presence

280
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:24,240
it's all okay they can be silent perfectly fine

281
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:30,800
no one is forced to say anything you can hold that with kindness hold that with kindness

282
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,880
so each person will share one nugget let's go reverse alphabetical order just

283
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:42,480
for the fun of it according to your first name say one nugget the next person the next

284
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:49,599
person and back to you next person next person etc and be kind to yourself be kind to each

285
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:55,040
other you're planting seeds in the small group remember you're planting seeds

286
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:01,520
of of karma in the small groups so

287
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:07,520

288
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:12,480

304
00:47:54,880 --> 00:48:01,920
well two of us in our group had identical thoughts um during the meditation we we were both

305
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:07,119
thinking that well this is what we want to do with the rest of our life you know however long

306
00:48:07,119 --> 00:48:12,720
it might be we we want to be kind we want to find

307
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,079
the means to do this in a persistent way as though this was now

308
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:23,280
our post-career career it was kind of wonderful to think that

309
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:30,079
the same words went through both of our heads it was a nice communion together

310
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:36,319
sweet thank you for sharing that and now i'm lighting up hearing that from from you

311
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:41,920

312
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:49,040
oh you're still muted still muted

313
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:56,160
third try there we were saying that you are a wonderful model and um that it's humanly possible

314
00:48:56,160 --> 00:49:02,480
maybe because we see this um shown to us with you

315
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:08,319
oh thank you thank you you're very kind

316

317
00:49:15,839 --> 00:49:21,760
