1
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:09,080
good day to you a warm welcome to this time of practicing

2
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:16,080
together again it's wonderful seeing um all of you in the

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:24,160
chat uh very connected with the fact that um how widespread the S

4
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:31,119
is so for this morning's uh today's meditation I'd like to touch upon the

5
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,520
quality of trust or faith in the practice um the poly word is

6
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,920
Sada it literally means to place your heart

7
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:52,120
upon Sharon Saltsburg defines it as trusting or own deepest

8
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:59,199
experience it refers to an inner quality that we all have which unfolds and grows

9
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:06,600
as we learn to trust that experience when we talk about faith

10
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:12,720
we're talking about heartfelt confidence in the possibility of our own

11
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,799
Awakening of our own deep

12
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,880
happiness when we place our heart upon the moment we're wholeheartedly present

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:31,720
fully here and we can trust that that is enough to pay attention to whatever is

14
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:36,280
in front of us whatever is

15
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:44,119
here and as mindfulness strengthens so does her confidence not to

16
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:51,718
cling to not try to control resist or manipulate or

17
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,600
experience and often when things are challenging the most important thing to

18
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:07,280
have faith in have trus in is the trust not to cling to trust the ability to meet the

19
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:14,879
moment with our open heart so let's

20
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:25,400
sit taking a comfortable and alert

21
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,879
posture and gently closing your eyes

22
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:44,519
settling into your meditation [Music] posture take a little time making any

23
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:51,720
small adjustments so the posture feels confident

24
00:02:53,480 --> 00:03:02,879
dignified allowing yourself to be centered in this body sitting or lying with

25
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:10,560
strength with dignity now allowing the

26
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:17,159
attention to meander throughout the body relaxing any obvious tensions that

27
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:24,360
can be relaxed just that your own pace relaxing

28
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:31,760
the face the shoulders the

29
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:40,239
belly whatever is tense letting go of any tensions or

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:57,760
Holdings connecting intimately with this body relaxing this body

31
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:27,840
and from within this body you might become aware of your

32
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:35,600
breathing the Simplicity of an inhale and an

33
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:44,160
exhale just knowing your breathing in knowing you're breathing

34
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:00,680
out you might take a few long slow deep breaths

35
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:08,560
and with each inhale connecting more intimately with a moment with each exhale relaxing a

36
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:16,600
little more deeply Letting Go settling into the round the

37
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,840
chair the

38
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:27,720
Earth connecting and

39
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,680
relaxing e

40
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:10,479
and letting your breathing return to normal and staying close to the

41
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:33,199
breath place think your heart upon a

42
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:40,319
moment being aware of your experience nothing else is

43
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,919
needed staying

44
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:53,400
simple allowing any other physical Sensations emotions or thoughts that

45
00:06:53,400 --> 00:07:01,440
arise allow them to come and go see them when they arise

46
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,080
let them leave when they're ready to leave without clinging to them or

47
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,758
resisting them

48
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:38,240
placing your heart upon the

49
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,440
moment

50
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:31,440
e

51
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,440
e

52
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:32,360
e e

53
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,880
allowing the breath and Body Sensations to remain in the

54
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,040
foreground with the peripheral awareness we can be aware of the

55
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:38,279
spaciousness that's all around and in this space there can be an

56
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:45,600
awareness of the arising and disappearing of any sensations of

57
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:52,600
breathing any movement any thoughts or feelings as they come and

58
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:59,560
go any mental activities as they arise and pass away

59
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,519
the vast open field of

60
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,160
awareness if agitation arises no need to be disturbed by that awareness is room

61
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,720
for it it's just something that arises and passes

62
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:28,680
away it's just a ripple and the vast field of awareness

63
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:40,120
awareness has room for

64
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:49,600
everything any wanting or not wanting that arises it's not a

65
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:58,240
problem there's nothing to push away we can just allow allow it to come

66
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:04,360
and go just waves in the vast ocean of

67
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:07,360
awareness

68
00:12:52,240 --> 00:13:01,120
there's nothing to do nothing is needed resting in awareness

69
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:06,720
allowing experience to unfold in its own

70
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,560
time trusting in not clinging to anything in

71
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,760
the

72
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:31,120

if the attention has wondered in a friendly

88
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:36,080
way guiding it back to the

89
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:44,480
present trusting in Awareness trusting in the

90
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,520
moment

e

102
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:01,158
e e

103
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:49,760
we in the sitting I'll ring the bell in a moment when I do you might take a couple

104
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:55,639
of slow deep breaths again before opening your eyes

105
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,080
for

106
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:11,159
in this uh fifth talk on the topic of knowing and not

107
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:16,960
knowing I'll focus on another aspect of not knowing and that's the difference

108
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:26,720
between the hindrance of doubt and wise or skillful doubt doubt that's useful

109
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:34,039
so in the hindrance of Doubt um that that hindrance can be one of the

110
00:30:34,039 --> 00:30:39,399
trickiest because it causes that not causes us to not fully apply ourselves

111
00:30:39,399 --> 00:30:45,799
in the moment it makes it easy to get lost in our thinking you know going back and

112
00:30:45,799 --> 00:30:53,000
forth within decision you know just holding back from applying ourselves in the

113
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:58,840
moment and we can question our own ability We can question method we're

114
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:04,600
using the teacher or the teachings you might think I you know I

115
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:10,360
don't think I can do this or am I doing it right or should I try another method

116
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:16,360
and go back and forth maybe I'll try this maybe I'll try that is it true what the teacher said

117
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:24,120
about the meditation is it true what the teacher teaching said about practice about the

118
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:31,679
teachings every one of those doubts might be useful but not during

119
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:38,760
meditation I like to think of the hindrance of Doubt as premature

120
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:47,080
questioning it just isn't the right time it's not a useful time it keeps us from going deeper in

121
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:52,760
meditation from really engaging in the practice because when we're caught in

122
00:31:52,760 --> 00:32:02,320
doubt we're no longer seeing we're no longer seeing the moment we're no longer seeing what's happening we're lost in

123
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:10,600
thinking and when I was young I decided to learn to walk a tight rope it was uh

124
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:15,960
all of six inches off the ground um but I didn't know that if I could do that

125
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:22,960
and I was pretty hesitant it was re it was a reasonable doubt but when I actually got on the

126
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:28,639
rope that that doubt the question distracted me from walking on the Rope

127
00:32:28,639 --> 00:32:34,399
the only way I can make it across was to steal my mind from anything else and my

128
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:40,000
feet on the Rope after I fell off countless of times

129
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,639
I finally made it across and so I learned that I could do it but the only

130
00:32:45,639 --> 00:32:49,880
way I could answer my doubt was to

131
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:57,360
practice with other questions such as am I doing this right or is it true what

132
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:03,799
the teacher said again those could be very useful questions outside

133
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:11,440
meditation maybe we do need to understand the method or the teachings better we may talk to a teacher or read

134
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:17,120
or study about it skillful doubt inspires us into

135
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:24,840
action to one understand and can be very helpful for mindfulness practice

136
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:35,440
the teachings refer to three kinds of wisdom and all three are important in

137
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,639
practice and the first one is wisdom from learning such as what we do from

138
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:46,399
teachers from Dharma talks from study and where we develop a clear

139
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:52,360
understanding of the teachings a clear intellectual understanding of the

140
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:58,799
teachings and the second one is wisdom from reflection and that's we actually

141
00:33:58,799 --> 00:34:04,000
mindfully think about a topic maybe reflecting on some of the

142
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:11,520
bigger questions of spiritual life what's my life's purpose why do I

143
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:17,358
practice what are my priorities where am

144
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:25,118
I what are my edges and practice we can reflect as a practice in

145
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:32,158
itself where discursive thinking is us useful we can also reflect discussing

146
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:37,200
the topic um with a friend a Dharma friend or a

147
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:46,480
teacher and the third form of wisdom is the wisdom for meditation the Insight that arises from

148
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:53,398
practice from formal meditation practice um we might have personal

149
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:59,480
insights or psychological insights all the way to the liberative insights that

150
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:04,720
completely free us from suffering from

151
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,760
clinging so the hindrance of Doubt is not productive or

152
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:21,560
useful it drains us and disconnects us it keeps us unwilling to apply

153
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:27,320
ourselves might even give up it's important to recognize it and

154
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:34,520
when we do to fold it back into the meditation not to ignore it but to

155
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:42,520
actually see it we can question doubt directly is

156
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:50,520
this a useful question if it is then we can honor it and put it aside to consider after

157
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:56,599
meditation and maybe take steps to resolve it but we can very clearly just

158
00:35:56,599 --> 00:36:02,119
say oh yeah this is a great question what a wonderful question and I'll do it

159
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:07,760
after the after my sitting or schedule it for

160
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,400
later and we can turn it back um to you know turn the attention back to applying

161
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:20,280
ourselves in the moment we saw

162
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:26,599
out maybe insecurity is there I can't do it or some version of my experience

163
00:36:26,599 --> 00:36:34,119
isn't the right EXP experience we can first recognize the hindrance of doubt we can turn the

164
00:36:34,119 --> 00:36:40,160
attention from what the doubt is about what the thoughts were lost in turn our

165
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:45,920
attention from the thinking to the experience of Doubt how does the body

166
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:51,240
feel um are emotions predominant how do those feel in the

167
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:57,599
body or maybe our attitude is one of resistance we don't like What's happen

168
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:04,920
happening and we're resisting as we engage in the present moment it disentangles us from being

169
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:12,318
caught in the pattern of doubt that vacillating world of back and

170
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:19,800
forth and as her Minds get quieter and quieter the hindrance of Doubt can still

171
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:25,440
arise but it can be much more subtle and sometimes it's more difficult to

172
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:32,359
recognize we can get lost in think thinking about it but because the mind is still kind of calm we tend to think

173
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:38,280
of those thoughts are being even more valid this is a time that doubting or

174
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:43,599
doubt can be very helpful and the phrase that I like is to

175
00:37:43,599 --> 00:37:48,960
not believe everything we think we can question a thought directly

176
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,400
is it true

177
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:09,480
now as I mentioned one of the practices that's really important wise questioning in Wise Wise

178
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:17,440
doubt um it's um wise reflection it's important to not confuse

179
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:23,200
formal meditation with formal reflection I mean sometimes we do

180
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:31,599
reflect on things spontaneously and that can be wonderful but it can also be helpful to take time periodically to

181
00:38:31,599 --> 00:38:37,440
reflect on purpose for important questions I find

182
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:42,960
it helpful not to do it on my cushion but to either go for a walk or sit

183
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:48,560
somewhere that feels particularly peaceful and maybe sitting on the sofa

184
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:53,640
looking at the window um yeah somewhere somewhere that

185
00:38:53,640 --> 00:39:00,359
makes us feel kind of cozy and comfy it's helpful to not to demand that the

186
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:06,440
reflection lead to a conclusion it's an open-handed

187
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:12,960
exploration it allows us to do this without the pressure of accomplishing

188
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,960
something and sometimes I found it's about finding the right question we

189
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:26,680
might start with one question but end up with another you know I've asked questions

190
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:32,640
about my deepest purpose in life I've reflected on impermanence on

191
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:40,040
death or the question who am I or questions of whether my lifestyle

192
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:47,280
is supporting my purpose or how to relate to politics or

193
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:53,480
other challenging topics with an open heart

194
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:07,680
sometimes even though we actively and carefully explore an issue we still

195
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,920
don't know we can stay open to the possibility

196
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:19,000
that it will become clear at some point in the future but in the meantime what's

197
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:27,520
helpful is to patiently rest in the not knowing to accept that we don't know

198
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:34,560
to be at peace with not knowing sometimes in life we have to

199
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:41,319
make a decision and we just don't have enough information to make a clear

200
00:40:41,319 --> 00:40:47,520
decision and we may have to take a chance we just don't know and it can be

201
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:54,599
very uncomfortable not to know the Mind wants certainty and it's really helpful then

202
00:40:54,599 --> 00:41:00,040
to recognize the stressfulness of not knowing in that

203
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,880
situation it's stressful it's Dua and to be compassionate with

204
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:12,200
ourselves when that happens and instead of being frozen and

205
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:18,599
decision when there's no way to figure it out we may need to just take a chance

206
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:24,040
and move on and jump into something

207
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,040
so Sharon salsburg said that faith is the quality of the

208
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:42,160
heart that stays open beyond or current level of

209
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:50,280
understanding it's the quality of heart that allows us to persevere into the unknown in meditation

210
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:57,480
practice and in our daily lives for the insights into to the

211
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:03,000
deepest Freedom we need to be able to

212
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:10,800
trust entering the unknown if we knew we'd be free

213
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:18,960
already so repeated faith is the quality of the heart that stays open beyond our

214
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:26,280
current level of understanding and that's a not knowing

215
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,680
mind a beginner's

216
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:38,920
mind so I'd like to end with a quote from from Gil franel I think you most of you have

217
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:44,800
heard of him right you have doubt about

218
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:50,200
mindfulness of the value and importance of just being

219
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:55,760
mindful borders and having doubt about the value of being present for life in

220
00:42:55,760 --> 00:43:01,040
general because mindfulness and being present

221
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:06,449
for life is the same [Music]
