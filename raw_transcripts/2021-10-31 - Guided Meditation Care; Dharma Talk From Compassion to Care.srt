1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:07,359
oh good morning everyone and welcome to imc and

2
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,880
especially those of you who maybe this is one of the first times you've come together and

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,039
with maybe even so many people in a room like this for some maybe but maybe particularly to

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:26,720
come to meditate and to be in community this way so welcome so welcome to everyone who's here on

5
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,880
youtube watching and i i want to reassure you that um even

6
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:39,440
though there are people here and i'm looking at them a little bit and paying attention to them a little bit more unnatural to do that when you have

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:45,200
a room people i haven't forgotten about you all on youtube

8
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:51,680
and i have that i have my laptop open here so that a little bit trying to track the chats

9
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:59,680
and certainly appreciate the uh the greetings that come in

10
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,920
so

11
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,400
many years ago uh i read when

12
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,840
one of the great american saints died mr rogers

13
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:28,640
um i read an article about him and and said that he was uh invited to the emmys i guess that's

14
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:34,079
where the rights were when they get awards for tv shows a little bit

15
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:40,880
so emmys and um and so you know it's a big gala event in los angeles i think

16
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:47,920
and all these you know big celebrities show up and

17
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,439
and uh he asked um so he got up to give his little speech

18
00:01:53,439 --> 00:02:01,840
and he said you know everybody he everybody here

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,160
probably is here because someone cared for you believed in you at some point in your

20
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,319
life let's take a minute to be silent and remember the people who believed in us

21
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,680
and cared for supported us that's kind of partly responsible for us being here

22
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,760
and the article said that the tv producers panicked because what do you do with a minute of

23
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,879
silence on tv and so they just

24
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:38,480
use the time to scan the audience and uh people were crying

25
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,920
and uh just that simple question and to be cared for

26
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,720
and uh so i bring it i bring it up here this morning because it's possible to care

27
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:57,040
for oneself and to meditate this assignment of self-care

28
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,959
and rather than saying self-compassion or self-love which is certainly wonderful and

29
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,480
important care is kind of a little more basic and maybe a little bit more accessible

30
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:14,480
for us we can care for ourselves and it's possible to care for someone you we don't like

31
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,760
if and for the neighbor down the street who we've always had difficulty with because they're they represent

32
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,159
everything that's challenging for your life and you find them on the sidewalk with a broken leg

33
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:31,519
you know suddenly all your the care you care then and

34
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,280
then you take care of things and maybe you get into the hospital or something but then you come back and you

35
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:44,959
care for their cat because a person's not there someone has to care for the cat and it isn't exactly compassion it's just

36
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,280
you know you maybe take in their mail or different things and there's a basic care that goes in

37
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,560
to just caring for people so maybe as we said today

38
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:01,680
maybe we can sit with if you're inclined or if it's easy enough

39
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:08,879
to sit with care for yourself what would that look like what would it look like to

40
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,680
take a posture and be with your breathing and and uh no matter what arises for you as

41
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:22,400
you meditate uh even if uh this little exercise evokes the opposite

42
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,520
or some challenge even then what would what it mean what would it be like to sit

43
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:34,400
quietly peacefully caring in a way that's not complicated some way

44
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:41,040
that perhaps is settling and quieting and intimate and kind of supports a kind of cozy

45
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:46,160
way of being here so with that we'll

46
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:54,360
sit quietly for these next 30 minutes and then go from there

47
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:21,920
and then as we come to the end of the sitting

48
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:30,400
to take a few moments to consider what care we have

49
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,880
for others in the world around us

50
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:41,280
our communities friends family

51
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:50,000
and maybe consider how this path of meditation

52
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:58,000
that releases us from our attachments

53
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:05,279
our preoccupations is a way that

54
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:11,200
allows our care to flow more freely

55
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:17,359
and may it be that this meditation today

56
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:24,960
leads to a greater caring

57
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,760
care kindness

58
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:37,680
loving concern for the world may all beings

59
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:44,800
be happy may all beings be safe

60
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:52,480
may all beings be peaceful and may all beings everywhere

61
00:39:52,480 --> 00:40:00,590
be free [Music]

62
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:08,959
[Music]

63
00:40:20,319 --> 00:40:25,760
so so anyway so i'll tell you what

64
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:32,000
my main purpose or hope through this talk up front

65
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,760
and then then i'll kind of give the talk kind of to support that

66
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:44,240
and that is for you to reflect on your life

67
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:49,760
review your life like kind of your autobiography

68
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:55,280
through the lens of uh caregiving

69
00:40:55,280 --> 00:41:00,560
emotions feelings like so you know emote kindness compassion love

70
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:05,119
care itself that's a whole thing i'll talk about

71
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:12,079
and uh you know it's interesting to look at a person's your own life and uh understand it in new ways and see

72
00:41:12,079 --> 00:41:18,400
under proof and new perspectives and it can be quite freeing or opening or sometimes understanding one's life uh

73
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:25,680
story even from a new perspective sets the foundation for further growth growth in the dharma even

74
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,800
and um and uh it's so you know it's

75
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:37,440
not that it's maybe that interesting for everyone else but you could for example probably tell your uh your life story

76
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:43,680
from the perspective of your of your hair and over if you're old enough you know there's been a lot of

77
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:49,119
a lot of history about how you've been with your hair and maybe and so

78
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:55,200
so that would make a story you know so different different things so your life your life story from the

79
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,640
perspective of care so in that

80
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:06,800
regard and then i'd like to talk a little bit about my own maybe as an example of this kind of way of thinking

81
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:14,000
and orientation and it brings together some of the different things i've been thinking about lately so it's kind of topical for

82
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:20,480
me to give a talk on this and

83
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:29,040
they [Music] i don't think i gave a lot of thought to

84
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,240
caregiving feelings emotions motivations until i had been a zen student for a

85
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:40,319
while and then i uh reviewed little in my life at that point and then i saw oh there

86
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:45,920
were probably some influences on me and the big one that i associated with uh

87
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:52,160
kind of being compassionate or the value of compassion was

88
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,680
my mother and uh and i i think one of them made a big impact on me i grew up a little bit in

89
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:04,880
italy and and it seemed like in italy she was regularly stopping

90
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:11,280
for strangers who had were in car crashes and that seemed to be a regular thing to

91
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:17,359
encounter and she even bought a big first aid kit so she'd be ready to help people and

92
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,800
support people who were in car accidents and and she would pull over and stop if you

93
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:29,040
saw something like that and uh and that was i think that had a big impact on me that's you know she

94
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:35,280
would have this caregiving instinct for strangers and and help them out

95
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,680
and i didn't realize at the time that it had influence on me but i think it kind of went in by osmosis somehow and had an

96
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:48,400
impact and and then i remember

97
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:54,160
both my father and also a little later when i was working for the zen center my

98
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:59,920
brand new student there and i was working at the bakery both as two circumstances where uh my

99
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:05,839
father made a donation to some non-profit i think i think it was to save the children or something

100
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:12,880
and i thought wow people do this thing you know why would you do that and then um and then when i was at the

101
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:18,480
working present center they used to have a bakery called tosahara bakery and

102
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:24,960
so over in cole street in san francisco so i used to work there and one day i was up in the office

103
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:30,720
and the person who ran the bakery as a zen priest was sitting at his table some reason i

104
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:36,880
was sitting next to him and he got a letter from a local um

105
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:42,480
association for the coal street association or something asking for a donation and he asked me you know how much should

106
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:48,240
we give and i don't know i kind of i probably didn't say anything i didn't like what you give money

107
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:53,599
and uh and he said well so he could well i think we'll do fifty dollars and i

108
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:58,880
said well you know in 1979 that was

109
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:05,359
and uh and so this idea that you would do such things was kind of novel for me even though i saw a little bit growing

110
00:45:05,359 --> 00:45:13,599
up as well but it had a big impact it went in kind of deeply and oh this is an interesting way of living

111
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:18,640
and then as i practice then my first buddhist practice i suffered a lot and

112
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:25,200
uh and at least the way i understand myself was that at the zen

113
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:31,280
center there was very little instructions on mindfulness or none and uh and so there wasn't no

114
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:38,319
instructions for mindfulness of emotions and mindfulness of your suffering the instruction was just to sit there

115
00:45:38,319 --> 00:45:43,760
upright unmoving and just keep showing up for the present moment in a kind of

116
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:50,480
uh uncomplicated way just be there be there be there and so i didn't you know had any thought

117
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:56,480
i should do anything different so that's what i was told so that's what i did and so what it meant was i sat with a

118
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,319
lot of suffering and uh and uh

119
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:08,640
and so that had an impact on me to sit with a lot of suffering and just sit and breathe and not react and not get caught

120
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:15,760
up in stories and reactivity to it and just feel it and be with it and i felt quite lucky lucky that i

121
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:22,880
didn't have a lot of instructions of what to do with it because then the suffering could kind of the simplicity of suffering could it

122
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:28,240
somehow became like a tenderizer for the heart and as something shifted and changed and

123
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:35,280
i don't know if they're suffering so much but it it they definitely decreased but i it started to work on me and this

124
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,680
idea that suffering can work on you or you know that it has a chance to work on you if you're not trying to solve it and

125
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:47,040
fix it and you know and get away from it or something but just be with it

126
00:46:47,040 --> 00:46:53,040
and uh but i didn't have a lot of psychological understanding no any either about all this and it was pretty

127
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:58,480
naive in many ways about my own suffering and uh

128
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:06,000
and then i started remember i started recognizing suffering and compassion in other people

129
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:12,560
and uh they just and then i started recognizing compassionate objects there was a

130
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:18,160
a statue at the san francisco zen center still there that it was positioned before where you

131
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,680
like you'd come out of meditation in the morning and you'd go walk right up against it before you have to make a

132
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:28,800
right turn it's like like it's right there it's about was five feet tall or so so it's

133
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:34,880
and um and it's kind of a sinewing kind of narrow kind of thing that

134
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,920
kind of spirals up a little bit and i would see this at the as the embodiment of compassion as like kuan

135
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:48,319
yin the body of compassion i'll go over there and see this and uh many years later i discovered

136
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:54,160
that the hardest thought that was of a flame going up and

137
00:47:54,160 --> 00:48:00,960
it probably looks more like a flame than what most people think of as compassion but um what i and then also i started

138
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:07,280
feeling compassion in the wind when it breathed against my cheek and i would look for find photographs i started

139
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:13,920
collecting photographs of kuan yin of logitech and just just that's what i did and i

140
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:19,200
started drawing them and then different things and what i think what was happening was

141
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:25,520
that i needed more compassion and i was also beginning to feel something like compassion arising in me

142
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:32,079
from all this sitting with suffering and so i was kind of like tuned into it around me to receive it

143
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:38,480
but some of the tuning in around me i was projecting it on the situation i remember telling someone that that person is so compassionate

144
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:44,880
and they look at me you've got to be kidding and so i don't know what i was picking up but you know

145
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:51,760
the fact that i was seeing it in the statue you know i i i really needed it so i was finding it and getting it

146
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:58,160
and so i don't know how how enlightened i got in zen but i became compassioned and then and that made a big huge

147
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:04,880
difference for me that made you huge i'm so grateful for it and at some point

148
00:49:05,119 --> 00:49:11,760
i decided to become a zen priest and it was kind of a culmination of that back then it was called i was it was called a

149
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:18,240
monk i got ordained as a zen monk and then three days three months later they changed the name to a priest and i said

150
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:24,640
what what did i just sign up for

151
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:31,839
i got a whole different feeling of what it was about and i'm happy with the word priest i don't mind it but

152
00:49:31,839 --> 00:49:37,359
you know technically still am and and so

153
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:43,119
but the reason to become a monk was in fact to respond to the suffering of the world and

154
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:50,559
slowly over time especially the monastic zen life that um something began to settle and open up

155
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:57,920
and that it seemed like it was just inherent in me to be not even you can't even say me almost

156
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:03,760
like inherent within me this responsivity to suffering around me and and that

157
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:10,079
that's kind of what was wasn't like i chose to respond to it but it's kind of like

158
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:15,119
this you know that's what you do that's what happens sir and

159
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:20,559
but they did take this form that i became a zed monk really the purpose of it was

160
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:25,760
uh i thought that uh the deepest way fullest way i knew to address human

161
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:32,559
suffering was through buddhism i didn't know anything else and i i wanted to have a i'd feel like

162
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:38,319
i'd be dissatisfied if i did any other kind of care for the world and i had other ideas in mind i was supposed to go

163
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:45,359
to graduate school and was going to do a kind of thing that was and um but i felt like i needed to be

164
00:50:45,359 --> 00:50:51,760
able to i felt like i had to for who i am i didn't want that dissatisfaction or that

165
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,800
sense of incompleteness i felt if i didn't try to meet the suffering of

166
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,720
the world address it and the deepest thing i knew how which was through buddhism and it wasn't like i was thinking of

167
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:08,800
becoming a teacher i just thought i'd you know i would

168
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:15,200
i thought one image i had was that i would have a little city like a city storefront or something

169
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:20,640
where i had meditation as a zendo meditation hall and i just had a key and i'd open up i keep it clean i'd open it

170
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:27,440
up and people come in they'd leave so who knew who knew that i spent a year and a half just

171
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:33,839
opening it up in the old game and um so um

172
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:40,400
so then so that so then being ordained the idea was that compassion was my motivating force in my life and that's

173
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:45,280
how i saw it for myself that that's what i was all about

174
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:51,359
and then um and for years i kind of still felt that was the case but slowly something began

175
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:57,040
shifting and i was always kind of late to understand the shift it's only retrospectively

176
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:02,160
so at some point i i left zen center from practicing there to practice

177
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:08,000
vipassana first in asia and then here in this country

178
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:13,920
and and clearly something shifted in the meditation

179
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:21,520
because meditation no longer became about suffering and about compassion

180
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:28,319
and um and and as something began shifting and i couldn't tell you what it was

181
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:33,440
but uh i while things were shifting i became and all along in this process i

182
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:39,760
became more and more acutely aware of how much suffering there is in the world but what was i think really

183
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:44,880
meaningful important to recognize is that because i was practicing so much

184
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:50,400
um there became more and more room in me to recognize the suffering more space for

185
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:56,640
it for me not to take it personally or for it to touch my own suffering and irritate like but salt in the wound or

186
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:02,000
something that there was just i was more a greater capacity to be be with

187
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:09,119
people suffering and pain and not can somehow wilt because of it or be burdened by it

188
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:15,760
and this openness is gonna and so that i think was a lovely thing to have that and and um

189
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:22,079
but then i went to practice in asia and and uh and it was kind of there was a dramatic shift that happened there

190
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:28,559
and uh and where my own suffering was no longer the salient issue

191
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:33,599
and uh and then the practice opened up in a new way and then something different happened to

192
00:53:33,599 --> 00:53:39,440
me and again this was kind of also a surprise and it had this kind of funny kind of

193
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:45,359
story maybe funny sad i don't know what was uh i came to practice the united

194
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:50,559
states and um and practiced it at the retreat center

195
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:56,559
in massachusetts ims for three i did a three month retreat and that was like kind of the first time

196
00:53:56,559 --> 00:54:03,440
to practice in the with western teachers and to my surprise they started doing

197
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:08,880
some of them beginning back in some of the meditations with doing loving-kindness meditation

198
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:14,079
a little guided loving kindness and the first time i did it i thought oh this is great i look like oh this is nice this

199
00:54:14,079 --> 00:54:21,599
kind of surprise but they kept doing it and for the kind of zen student i was

200
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:27,040
you don't talk to people when they're meditating and and also and also zen is kind of

201
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:32,400
like a pla you know zen is more stoic and stern and like you you get to the

202
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:38,559
truth directly and nothing sentimental to kind of make it you know whatever something like that

203
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:44,400
it's uh that's the way i took it in i'm not saying that's what zen is about but that's how i took it in

204
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:51,040
and uh kind of silly but i did and uh and so i just

205
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:56,880
did what a reasonable person would do maybe i was they would teachers or show up and do this guide to loving kind of

206
00:54:56,880 --> 00:55:03,359
meditation i would just tune them out and then um

207
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:08,720
and so then uh and so that but at some point during that three-month retreat

208
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:16,319
um this uh wonderful feeling of of clarity and kindness and goodness and

209
00:55:16,319 --> 00:55:22,559
started to well up inside of me and then one day they came to do the guided living kindness meditation and i said oh

210
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:29,520
that's what they're talking about oh and then i had my own reference for it

211
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,559
it wasn't insincere it wasn't trying to make something happen it was just and then when they did it's like i just

212
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:41,119
tapped into that and built on what was already there and so then what happened in my practice

213
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:47,520
in my life was that um and i still kind of called it compassion i didn't know any better

214
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:54,240
but i think i was slowly was realized i was more motivated by a day-to-day kind of overall with a

215
00:55:54,240 --> 00:56:01,119
mood of kindness and earlier it was kind of like there was a deep underlying mood that i

216
00:56:01,119 --> 00:56:06,640
recognized always there of compassion but as it shifted to kindness as the

217
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:12,480
underlying mood i realized that that compassion as wonderful and profound as it is

218
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:18,400
involved a certain kind of a little bit more activated internal state

219
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:24,640
for me and uh and the kindness turned out to be a simpler uh less complicated or less involved

220
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:30,960
state i mean the difference here is very little and so i want to be very careful not to

221
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:37,040
there's no disrespect or devaluing the importance of compassion but i noticed this it was a shift happened and now

222
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:43,440
that shift happened i still thought it was i was motivated by compassion but in fact over time i realized it was a whole

223
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:48,480
different sentiment it had to be and it was simpler and sometimes it

224
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:55,680
would morph into compassion for sure but it was kindness became or friendliness or good will

225
00:56:55,680 --> 00:57:01,599
became the silly and kind of interesting kind of expression of what was happening to me in practice and that kind of felt

226
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:07,760
like the mood or where i was coming from so that went along fine

227
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:13,280
for a while and then at some point in the last 15 years or so

228
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:19,440
i have all these decades you know i could review you know so it's a slow process you know this is not like you know sit

229
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:25,920
down and you know three day process and get to what i'm saying talking about for me it was like a decades-long process of

230
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:31,119
really simmering in the dharma and letting it unfold

231
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:37,200
and then i started noticing that one of the salient features that was happening to me

232
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:44,079
was that there was a kind of a peacefulness associated with whatever

233
00:57:44,079 --> 00:57:49,839
caregiving compassion kindness goodwill whatever way i was involved in there was a

234
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:55,200
peacefulness in it where there was no very little inclination

235
00:57:55,200 --> 00:58:00,559
to give into clinging to anything or reacting to anything or being caught in anything or

236
00:58:00,559 --> 00:58:06,559
to define myself with it or try to prove myself like when i was a new teacher i felt like

237
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:13,520
when people came to see me this is like 30 years ago right so before we like meet with people one-on-one i thought i

238
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:20,160
had to give them something i can't just have them show up and and uh and not you know have done something

239
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:25,920
useful for them and you have to show something for myself as a teacher so that's a little bit crazy to have

240
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:31,280
that attitude but anything's natural enough maybe in the beginning of a new job like that

241
00:58:31,280 --> 00:58:37,119
and there's all this peacefulness settled in and you know i i certainly wanted to support people and meet them

242
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:43,760
and respond to them best i could but uh and that extra attachment the need to do something

243
00:58:43,760 --> 00:58:49,280
started to go away and there was peacefulness to it all and i thought this was kind of

244
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:55,680
interesting sometimes i felt that was a little bit uh people didn't like it because people are some people are

245
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:02,400
really aroused around all kinds of issues of justice and politics and all kind you know even

246
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:09,119
even sometimes one-on-one suffering someone's suffering and you know they want you to worry for them they want you to kind of

247
00:59:09,119 --> 00:59:14,720
be alarmed or you know that's kind of the language of how we know we care for each other if we're

248
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:21,520
you know angry or something or upset or something and uh so sometimes i could feel the

249
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:26,960
tension of being in these situations where a certain expectation of how i was supposed to be

250
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:32,000
didn't match this peacefulness i had and some people might have thought i was

251
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:37,359
aloof or i was worried i'd be seen that way but in fact i wasn't i mean i was

252
00:59:37,359 --> 00:59:42,960
certainly given my life over to try to support people in all kinds of ways and do things and that's what my life is

253
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:48,400
about and um so it was kind of like interesting to discover this

254
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:55,040
peacefulness or non-attachment as a reference point for it all and and then the challenge of and sometimes

255
00:59:55,040 --> 01:00:00,720
the inner debates so the inner lawyers would come up and even tell me you know gail you're supposed to be a little more

256
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:07,359
you know upset here or a little bit more attached or something and uh and so i had to navigate that and

257
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:13,359
wonder about that and uh and so i still felt uh you know i

258
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:20,720
wanted to care for people and all that and then i started i was started at some point studying the pali canon the

259
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:28,400
teachings of the buddha much more and in some ways my real deeper study of this early teaching started about

260
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:33,760
12 13 years ago really kind of spending a lot of time in it

261
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:40,000
and uh and then a few years ago i was interested in what the buddha had to

262
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:45,280
say about compassion partly it was so important for me and

263
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:51,359
and i knew that the word for compassion is karuna many people know the word karuna

264
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:58,799
k-a-r-u-n-a and uh the um

265
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:06,318
and it turns out the buddha and these early texts have there's very little to say about it

266
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:12,318
in fact the only thing he says about it has to do with um

267
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:19,520
how you how some about how it's related to meditation practice how in meditation you would have

268
01:01:19,520 --> 01:01:25,680
boundless karuna it doesn't even define what it is so we don't even know for sure that it's

269
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:31,040
supposed to be translated into english as compassion because the if if what we're doing

270
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:36,480
building on is the evidence from the ancient teachings so maybe compassion is fine to translate

271
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:41,920
as a translation but but the fact that i was so surprised to see

272
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:48,000
and but it's not so obvious because some of the translators translate

273
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:54,880
another word as compassion so when i read that in the old days i used to think oh that's karuna that's karuna

274
01:01:54,880 --> 01:02:02,000
but it turns out that it's a karuna is not the word or the concept that involves everyday

275
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:07,200
caregiving and the word for that is anu kampa

276
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:13,440
so the a-a-a-n-u-k-a-m-p-a anu kampa

277
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:19,440
and in all the circumstances where the buddha is

278
01:02:19,440 --> 01:02:25,440
offering some kind of care to someone else uh it's using this word ano kampa care

279
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,480
and i translate it as care as i said some people translate as compassion

280
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:38,079
and occasionally you see it translated as sympathy but if the buddha taught he spent you know

281
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:44,559
40 45 years teaching out of anu kampa so it seems like a very important emotion

282
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:50,640
because it's kind of the basis of why buddha taught if someone asked the buddha to come and teach for

283
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:56,000
them or even come to their house to have a meal they would ask can you do it please do

284
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:01,760
so out of anucampa for me and so the reason why this word is

285
01:03:01,760 --> 01:03:08,880
something different than compassion is that the way that it's talked about in the suttas in the ancient language

286
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:15,440
is uh it's always in relationship to caring for the welfare and happiness of

287
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:21,680
others it's never talked about explicitly about suffering

288
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:27,280
uh you know the people you want people to be alleviated and freed from their suffering

289
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:34,200
it can include that for sure but it's it doesn't not limited to suffering it's a

290
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:41,760
broad-wide caregiving uh kind of emotion feeling it's also used in the ancient literature

291
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:47,440
for a much more ordinary simple kinds of care that people provide

292
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:53,359
child care providers have care for their children teachers you know outside of buddhism

293
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:58,480
you know have have an accompanist care for their students

294
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:05,039
parents have care for their children and

295
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:12,160
and so you know so what is it now

296
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:18,400
it was yesterday i think i talked to a friend of mine who has stage four cancer

297
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:24,160
and then starting treatment now and so i asked him

298
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:30,000
spend a lot of time in hospitals and stuff and and uh and i asked him

299
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:35,599
what would you prefer that all these people who are caring for you the nurses the doctors and all that

300
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:42,480
that they have compassion for you or they have care for you and he said right away oh i prefer they

301
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:49,920
have care so exactly well i didn't ask him why but um there's something very different

302
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:55,760
with compassion which is you know based my life on so i don't want to dismiss the disrespect or just diminish it's a

303
01:04:55,760 --> 01:05:01,599
value but it's a particular kind of caregiving and i'm thinking about this as i was

304
01:05:01,599 --> 01:05:07,440
studying this word on ocampa i realized that if a friend of mine went along we'd spend the day together

305
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:12,480
hanging out and every moment that we were together every conversation

306
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:18,880
they were expressing their compassion for me like i would start kind of stepping further and further away like you know

307
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:25,440
you know give me a break but if if they were constantly if there it was a continual feeling oh this

308
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:31,680
person cares for me there's care i i wouldn't feel troubled by it i wouldn't feel like it's getting too much

309
01:05:31,680 --> 01:05:37,599
or a burden there's a very different feeling to care and to compassion

310
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:43,599
and so to to over emphasize compassion is the primary way to be with people

311
01:05:43,599 --> 01:05:49,440
maybe misses something and and so this care

312
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:56,400
that involves care for people's welfare and happiness so you can then you can have that kind

313
01:05:56,400 --> 01:06:02,720
of care for someone who's not suffering you know someone who's suffering

314
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:07,920
like the buddha met people or practitioners who were

315
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:12,960
not suffering they were deep in meditation they were filled with joy and happiness

316
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:19,280
and he would then care for them by offering them further teachings they go further into a greater kind of happiness

317
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:24,880
than what they're already feeling and so i like this word care so much as

318
01:06:24,880 --> 01:06:30,160
a translation for anacampa because it's a kind of humble

319
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:36,160
word uh it also has a double meaning in english that uh

320
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:42,799
it's uh to care for something is to value it and so to offer value have value for the

321
01:06:42,799 --> 01:06:48,160
people you're with or to appreciate them and to and to care

322
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:53,520
and then the care also means to offer like there's medical care we say or spiritual

323
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:58,880
care or child care or elder care it's a very common word

324
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:05,119
and um and uh oh so my friend who was in the hospital he said oh i'd prefer to have care right

325
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:11,440
to compassion and he said these nurses who are taking care of me they're just like

326
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:16,960
inspiring by how much care they have they care for everyone you watch them and there's so much care

327
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:23,119
of what they're doing but i don't think they have come to i don't think they're having compassion for all of us

328
01:07:23,119 --> 01:07:28,480
but they're just going around their job and doing fantastic job caring for people

329
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:33,920
so i think it's possible to care for people who you don't love

330
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:41,119
it's possible to care for people because love and compassion are kind of high kind of a high bar sometimes

331
01:07:41,119 --> 01:07:46,160
and so this care thing is a lower bar you can do it for someone who

332
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:52,640
you know it's just a basic ordinary human activity to care if you allow yourself to be a basic

333
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:58,880
ordinary human being without preoccupations attachments and being caught up

334
01:07:58,960 --> 01:08:04,799
and then finally this uh in the sutas

335
01:08:04,799 --> 01:08:10,480
the motivation for anukampa they don't they don't talk

336
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:16,560
much about why what motivates it what's the rationale you would have it it's kind of just assumed that people have it

337
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:23,679
when people were when some of the buddha's disciples were were fully enlightened he told them to go forth out into the

338
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:29,679
world for the welfare and benefit for others out of out of care for the world so that was

339
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:36,480
the motivating force but he just told them to do that or expect it it just kind of assumed

340
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:42,080
but but there is a few places in the sutras where this word for care

341
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:48,238
is or is closely connected to um the human capacity

342
01:08:48,239 --> 01:08:52,159
for to have respect

343
01:08:54,400 --> 01:09:00,480
to respect to honor to esteem or to venerate other people

344
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:06,640
or benefit each other this idea of respect and better veneration is are kind of strong word

345
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:13,520
but some people in the west talk about appreciating the sacredness of other people and they inherently they say sacredness

346
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:20,159
or some people use the word in the west of divinity divine in everyone but this anakampa coming not from

347
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:26,560
suffering uh it's not quite friendliness but it comes from a kind of place of

348
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:31,758
deep respect veneration so there's something very very uh

349
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:37,440
honor honor worthy of of each person we meet to have honor and

350
01:09:37,440 --> 01:09:42,960
respect and care and you can do that for people you don't like there are people who are

351
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:49,600
challenging you know who behave in ways that are you know maybe even

352
01:09:49,600 --> 01:09:54,640
you know distasteful or something and so that's not to

353
01:09:54,640 --> 01:10:01,760
say that that's not you know that was distasteful what the person did but even so there can be this basic care

354
01:10:01,760 --> 01:10:08,080
can still exist so go back to my story when i started reading about this

355
01:10:08,080 --> 01:10:14,000
anu then i recognized it's that oh this is the good i think this concept least how

356
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:19,360
i'm understanding it that speaks to this more recent change i've had this

357
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:26,159
peacefulness around caregiving i think that i'm finding it what i'm living from now is this very simple

358
01:10:26,159 --> 01:10:32,159
care that is for me is defined by non-attachment but not clinging

359
01:10:32,159 --> 01:10:37,280
it's just a simple ordinary thing and it can morph into compassion it can

360
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:42,800
morph into friendliness and all these other all these things but

361
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:48,800
it has a simplicity to it an ordinariness to it and and uh sweetness to it

362
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:54,880
that um that just seems like that's what has evolved in it now if i look back

363
01:10:54,880 --> 01:11:01,600
to kindness you know loving kindness or something that seems like a more activated state

364
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:07,280
and uh and there's nothing wrong to be a little bit activated so if compassion is more activating than

365
01:11:07,280 --> 01:11:12,960
kindness then anakampa then kindness is more activated than anu kampa than care

366
01:11:12,960 --> 01:11:18,560
and and to be able to go about the life without always being activated or

367
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:24,400
by something or or having to evoke or to make something happen

368
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:31,520
you know if your requirement is to always be kind you kind of have to kind of gear yourself up a little bit sometimes and

369
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,800
then if the requirement is to be compassionate you also have to kind of like oh how do i do that now and you know what do i have to do and i'm

370
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:43,040
supposed to be compassionate um maybe um but for me uh you know i am you

371
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:48,480
know pleased to hear listen to me a little bit this is a personal story so i'm not to want to say that it should be

372
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:53,679
your way but uh uh but anyway finding this piece this

373
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:59,600
non-attachment in relationship to caregiving and finding it kind of resonating with this word anu

374
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:06,480
with with care has been really kind of one inspiring for me and and feeling yeah this is good it kind of

375
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:11,600
like kind of you know if the lawyers in my mind were

376
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:17,280
arguing about is it okay to care for people without being attached it's like i got the star witness the

377
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:23,280
expert witness to come on the stand and then you know made us made the case

378
01:12:23,280 --> 01:12:28,320
that it's okay yes so um

379
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:33,360
so i knew kampa just so there's movement towards at the care

380
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:39,679
so that was my story and uh and i told the story for the purpose of hopefully

381
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:45,760
inspiring you to think of your story and maybe you can even find someone you tell it to

382
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:50,960
say maybe even the telling of it is not is your discovery process so you maybe

383
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:56,000
find a good friend who you're willing to kind of stumble along and um but

384
01:12:56,000 --> 01:13:02,400
so what's what's been your relationship to care is it did you have no examples of it growing up and no and cared for

385
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:08,560
you and which happens to some people it's like the primary background for some people is the absence of it and or

386
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:14,239
worse and uh and then has anything shifted and

387
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:19,520
opened and changed and what were the influences on you the impacts on you and

388
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:24,960
as you as you went through your life and and uh you know what have you learned

389
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:31,280
over your lifetime about your care your kindness your friendliness

390
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:38,480
or where have you received it how you've been nourished by it from others and or influenced by others by it

391
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:44,239
what is your story and whatever your story is

392
01:13:44,239 --> 01:13:50,640
let's respect it let's honor it let's venerate it because your story

393
01:13:50,640 --> 01:13:56,800
and uh and see it as a stepping stone for further growth the more clarity you

394
01:13:56,800 --> 01:14:01,840
have about it then maybe you're ready to kind of

395
01:14:02,719 --> 01:14:07,760
find something more or let it grow or evolve into new ways that maybe wouldn't

396
01:14:07,760 --> 01:14:15,000
have evolved if you hadn't really kind of seen it clearly what what it is

397
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:22,400
so [Music] those are my thoughts for today

398
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:27,679
and we have a couple of minutes if any of you would like to

399
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:33,840
ask a question or a comment you're welcome to do so

400
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:46,320
another question here is peacefulness similar to equanimity from the youtube

401
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:51,920
um it's maybe it overlaps a little bit i think

402
01:14:51,920 --> 01:14:57,199
of them as different i think of peacefulness is less complicated than

403
01:14:57,199 --> 01:15:05,520
equanimity yeah i was thinking about empathy

404
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:13,920
as a way of it's not quite as intense as compassion and it's a way of feeling into

405
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:19,520
a person another person's state yeah and that that might be closer to caring

406
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:25,920
for someone yeah yeah it could well be there's a word uh another word that's sometimes translated

407
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:31,120
as sympathy um in the policy that

408
01:15:31,120 --> 01:15:37,040
often goes together with the care they're they're they're a pair so empathy and care maybe are closely

409
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:39,840
related

410
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:50,040
maybe one more and then

411
01:15:54,480 --> 01:16:00,880
so i think something that i've been struggling with particularly you know in the events of the last two

412
01:16:00,880 --> 01:16:07,280
years or so is um exercising compassion for people where

413
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:13,520
the the root of their sufferings seem is something that i fundamentally disagree with like that

414
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:20,159
their suffering is due to not being able to engage in their own selfishness for example and it's to a

415
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:28,560
point that you know especially with so much like polarization and discourse around that that it's extremely fatiguing for for me to

416
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:34,400
and i feel that the the answer to it seems to be having compassion for those people

417
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:40,320
instead of yeah responding with more anger but i'm not sure how to go about that i think

418
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:45,600
it's completely reasonable to not have compassion for some of the reasons people suffer

419
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:52,159
but the reasons they suffer under the underneath under that there is some kind of suffering

420
01:16:52,159 --> 01:16:58,719
and uh and that it's this it's the it's what's under what underlies it that's uh maybe you can connect to

421
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:05,040
others like so for example if i'm really upset and sad and i'm here crying and you know

422
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:10,480
and i've had a really difficult day today and you know gil what's wrong what's happened well

423
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:17,199
i just didn't win the california lottery today uh so probably you just shrug your

424
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:22,560
shoulders then it's like what's going on here and that wouldn't elicit a lot of compassion but if you listen to me more

425
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:28,800
deeply you might say you know what why why is gil interested in the california lottery

426
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:35,360
and um and maybe he's really kind of insecure or something and i i can maybe feel for his

427
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:42,800
insecurity is this a idea relevant for you yeah i i do think so yeah yeah so kind

428
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:47,040
of go listen deeper than the surface

429
