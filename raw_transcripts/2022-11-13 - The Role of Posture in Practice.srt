1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:07,440
so welcome to IMC and those of you online welcome

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:13,559
to our Sunday morning program and um

3
00:00:13,559 --> 00:00:20,460
for today I would like to talk about the role of posture in this practice

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:27,599
that we do the and I want to start with an analogy

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,480
of driving a car some of you might have had this experience

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:41,940
or maybe didn't have some of what I'm going to describe you're driving a car maybe in a from the freeway even fast

7
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:47,219
and lots of traffic around you and you remember

8
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:53,820
that um you forgot to return an important phone call while you're driving

9
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:59,879
so of course you know the thing to do then is go oh both hands oh no when how

10
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:06,619
could I have done that oh this is with we don't do that do we drive

11
00:01:06,619 --> 00:01:13,680
oh no you keep driving right you don't give up the posture for this tragic

12
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,600
realization because more tragedy will come if you do

13
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,479
uh you lose something if you go oh no and collapse on the

14
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:34,259
steering wheel you lose your attentiveness you lose your care for everyone else

15
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:41,159
there's a lot that you lose in that process if you're sitting there in your car and

16
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:47,579
you know and there's you know traffic's going along but a good clip but not fast enough for you and you're kind of

17
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:54,020
annoyed with it all and you don't just kind of like sit back and put your hands like this

18
00:01:54,020 --> 00:02:01,259
well in that case you know again you maintain

19
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,899
a certain posture when you're driving you don't collapse you don't pull back

20
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:13,260
you don't shrink you maintain a certain you might have little variations if you feel a little bit something but you

21
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:18,080
maintain a posture so you don't lose your attentiveness

22
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:25,440
now outside of something as important as driving a car people do all kinds of things with their

23
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:32,280
posture they do collapse they do cross their arms and sit back they do kind of raise their fists you

24
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,220
know all kinds of things they do with their posture and it might say people might feel well

25
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:43,500
like you know darn it I should be free to do whatever I want I feel free when I

26
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:50,099
do these things you know but we lose ourselves sometimes and how

27
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:56,940
and it represents our loss of ourselves how we succumb to posture sometimes

28
00:02:56,940 --> 00:03:03,720
if we sometimes are so filled with desires that we're free to act on

29
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:09,180
desires but we lose ourselves in the pursuit of those desires addictions for

30
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:15,780
example or intense and neediness like I have create you know like clawing neediness the way I want something

31
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:22,620
and we lose ourselves in that process not just our attention when we kind of like ahead of ourselves

32
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,860
if we get uh you know into a very angry situation and we're really angry and we

33
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:35,640
feel I should be damned free to be angry if I'm angry but there's also we lose something about

34
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:41,519
ourselves if we give ourselves we lose ourselves to the anger and we lose the capacity to pay

35
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:48,420
attention to be a present and just like if you lose yourself into anger really lose yourself you know rage when you're

36
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,940
driving this is usually not a good idea you know not good idea for either the

37
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,599
drivers probably not a good idea for you so we lose ourselves all too easily in

38
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,299
all kinds of emotional states motivational states that we have

39
00:04:06,299 --> 00:04:13,680
sometimes we lose ourselves because we freeze we get all rigid and hard sometimes we

40
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:22,079
lose ourselves in wanting to blame and fight you know and to criticize sometimes we lose ourselves in

41
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,360
in uh in our restlessness we get so activated and agitated that we don't

42
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:32,180
even know you know what foot to stand on

43
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:39,180
you might feel that way when you're driving but I suspect that when you're driving you don't succumb to the

44
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:46,139
restlessness you you kind of like within my within reason you're maintaining your posture

45
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:53,040
and uh because you have your life depends on a little bit so what I'm suggesting is that we lose

46
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:59,040
ourselves we lose ourselves to our emotions sometimes through our posture

47
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:06,320
by how we relate to it we give ourselves away to it sometimes

48
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,120
and it's not to deny that we are this way but we don't have to give ourselves away

49
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:19,620
to it and one of the ways not to give ourselves away is to maintain a balanced

50
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:25,620
posture in the midst of it in the flow of it all

51
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:32,039
and this is what I think the Buddha recommends this is what I I see the statue we have

52
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:37,740
here of the Buddha that for me that it represents that

53
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,639
the Buddha's posture is balanced upright he's not pulling

54
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:51,419
away like folding his arm and say who are these people you know who are come here you know

55
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:57,419
and you know they're not monastics so what good you know what good is this

56
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:04,199
you know he's he's present he's not pulling away he's not leaning forward into the world

57
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:10,500
he's just fully there he does I don't know if you probably can't see but he doesn't have his eyes

58
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:17,639
closed but he's not staring he's seeing but he's not caught in what

59
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:24,419
he's seeing in the world the Buddha is um [Music]

60
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:32,039
sitting in a strong way balanced way and he's available to the world and he's

61
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:38,340
available to himself for all what goes on and so when the Buddha before he was

62
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:44,280
enlightened there's a story he tells that he was meditating in the forest

63
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:49,380
jungles by himself and it seems that he will get scared the

64
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:54,900
Sounds in the jungle even he says even the peacocks walking around and maybe at night or something he didn't know what

65
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,900
it was and he would be scared and um and so he decided that his

66
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:06,000
practice was going to be whatever posture he was in

67
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:12,660
he would continue the way he was so if he was doing walking he said he

68
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:19,740
would keep doing walking meditation sitting he would keep sitting if he was standing he would keep

69
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:25,979
standing if he was lying down he'd keep laying down recently I was reminded of the story by

70
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:32,819
a trauma therapist and he loved the story he said this is exposure therapy

71
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:40,020
you know they just could I just expose yourself to something and then find your way until he said in his language until

72
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,720
you get deactivated until you can relax and um so I don't know if that's the

73
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,759
wisest to things to suggest always but but this idea that he would stay in his

74
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:56,220
posture and and the idea is a dignified balance posture

75
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,880
and what's the advantage of doing that of doing that until the fear passes

76
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:09,300
one is a balanced posture is one of the best places in which to

77
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:16,500
um monitor yourself with what's going on to not lose yourself but to gain

78
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,599
yourself to increase your capacity to know and be

79
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,900
aware and to hold whatever is happening for us without succumbing without giving it to

80
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:33,959
it giving up to it losing ourselves to it and also not running away from it not

81
00:08:33,959 --> 00:08:41,399
distracting us from it so there's this wonderful combination of benefits from a posture which is in your

82
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:47,220
way the equivalent of what the Buddha is doing in your way it doesn't have to look as nice as his after all it's a

83
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:53,160
metal stat it's a metal statue it's just just an artist who made that one

84
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:59,640
but that uh that you would sit and not Lose Yourself

85
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:07,080
monitor yourself well and keep noticing the tendencies

86
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:13,860
to Lose Yourself notice a Tendencies to start tapping your fingers you know

87
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:21,120
because you're impatient the Buddha doesn't tap his fingers not because it's wrong to do that but that

88
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:29,040
is kind of a way of losing our ourselves distracting ourselves or getting caught up in the impatience perhaps

89
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,080
there's nothing nothing necessarily wrong with that but

90
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:39,300
is it is it the best way to process is it the best way to really

91
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:46,920
be present for what's here and have a certain be in the driver's seat of your life rather than the

92
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:54,360
passenger seat or rather than just kind of you know giving up or something losing yourself

93
00:09:54,360 --> 00:10:00,600
there's something very powerful about being careful with our posture so the

94
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:05,700
posture can reveal better to us what's really going on

95
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:13,560
so if you're sitting meditating this way especially I'm talking about meditation it transfers a daily life as well

96
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:19,380
but you're sitting this way and um and you know you remember that

97
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:28,380
you've you know you didn't make that important phone call in meditation you can feel the power of the arms the the

98
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:33,600
power of this the collapse that wants to happen the arms that want to go like

99
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:41,100
this they collapse but you're committed to not doing it not not as a repression

100
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,920
but as a way to feel the energy to feel the sensations feel the motivations to

101
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:53,640
collapse wow my collapsibility is huge right now

102
00:10:53,640 --> 00:11:00,899
I had no idea collapse could be so powerful in convincing and authoritative I had no idea the collapse could be come

103
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:06,779
with all its lawyers arguing it's a case that this is why you should collapse

104
00:11:06,779 --> 00:11:12,420
wow this is quite something but I'm not going to collapse not in meditation

105
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:17,940
but I am going to be present for this I'm going to know this see it

106
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:25,019
until I see it through until I get to the other side many years ago I love this story that

107
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:30,959
someone told me what he had learned to do I think he was maybe an alcoholic some

108
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:37,019
kind of serious addiction and someone told them that when he got the urge to drink

109
00:11:37,019 --> 00:11:42,060
he should go find a nice comfortable chair to sit in and not move

110
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,640
not leave the chair no not moving wasn't it not don't leave the chair no matter what

111
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:52,680
and he said it was hard the the power of addiction is oh it can

112
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:58,860
be overwhelming for people and um and uh very convincing very hard

113
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,220
to resist but he was he had this PR he was told to don't leave the chair

114
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:12,500
and what he discovered that it would be like the rodeo than a wild Bronco

115
00:12:13,079 --> 00:12:18,360
that he would stay there and actually they uh they're their analogy he used

116
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:23,640
was that of a wave cresting he would and the wave would get bigger

117
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:29,339
and bigger bigger more and more powerful and at some point it would crashed and he'd find himself on the back side of

118
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:35,519
the wave and everything would settle down and he said that was a turning point for

119
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:42,300
me I felt so empowered he felt so capable I felt so like oh this I can do this at

120
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:47,820
least and that was a real turning point for him and his addiction when he learned to

121
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:54,060
not move from the chair so to learn to feel fear to you know you

122
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:59,760
know the mountain lion's coming don't just stand there but in meditation to learn to feel fear

123
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:04,800
anger depression sadness all kinds of things

124
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,839
that can come that normally we would sink into or give and give ourselves

125
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:16,380
away to and we do it in our posture unconsciously

126
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:22,980
but here to keep the posture that's dignified and balanced

127
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:28,079
and see it through to the other side if possible and what does it take to do that it's

128
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:34,320
not an easy thing sometimes what I'm start describing but we have all these instructions and mindfulness about how

129
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:39,959
to bring attention careful mindful attention to the body

130
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:45,180
to the feelings that we have to the impulses the Mind states that are operating

131
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:51,839
the desires and the aversions that operating and as we start teasing apart the package looking at the component

132
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:57,899
pieces of it rather than one big wave it becomes easier and easier to sit

133
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:04,019
there and that which can relax has a chance to relax and soften

134
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:09,740
and and something can begin shifting and there could be a sense of

135
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:16,139
empowerment or inner strength that can arise from being able to maintain a posture

136
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:22,019
through the difficulties we have so we have in this tradition the

137
00:14:22,019 --> 00:14:27,779
teaching on the five hindrances and this is the place to practice this with

138
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:33,000
the five hindrances are divided into kind of three different areas

139
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:39,360
the first area has to do with our relationship basically with our relationship to what's external to us

140
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:48,420
kind of we're looking outward to the world of desires and the world of uh hostility of ill

141
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:58,320
will what we don't like in the world and what we want in the world and uh and uh so that intense way in

142
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:04,139
which we want things we lose ourselves in that wanting

143
00:15:04,139 --> 00:15:10,079
and some people lose themselves with the carrying the banner of freedom

144
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:15,660
I should have this some people lose themselves in hostility

145
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:22,320
to the world blaming others some people live in the world of externalizing their life

146
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,959
desires what I like what I don't like blame not blame

147
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:34,860
Proclaim praise and then some people externally live in this world of hostility and it's

148
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:40,459
everything out there has to you know fit the way I want it to be or something

149
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:49,500
it's sad to lose yourself in this way but to sit to learn to hold a posture

150
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:57,540
and sit and see that movement to feel it within us is really powerful

151
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:02,820
the first hint I had about this you know it's not that big of a deal I suppose

152
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:08,820
but the first hint I had of myself doing this when I was practicing in Thailand

153
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:15,500
and we didn't eat much food there like we didn't have no food in the afternoon so lunch was a big deal

154
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:22,440
and lunch was kind of you know down a hill and through the jungle he had to go walk there for a

155
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:29,339
five minute walk or something and um I'd be ravenous

156
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,800
and I noticed that um my center of gravity

157
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:41,339
would be about a foot in front of me because I was kind of like kind of like all my concerns were up ahead

158
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:48,480
and I could say oh wow what a gill what are you doing out there and I would kind of take a deep breath and kind of bring

159
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:54,959
myself back to myself and and then I'd within a few seconds I found myself

160
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:01,199
and that was like the Seesaw reclaiming myself and losing myself just because of

161
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,540
lunch and um so

162
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:11,880
um so beginning to see how this operates and see it clearly because we're not

163
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,339
giving in to the impulses because we're standing here we're kind

164
00:17:17,339 --> 00:17:22,558
of staying keeping keeping what we're doing in a sense the posture we're in

165
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:27,720
again not to repress it so we can see it really clearly

166
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:34,620
we see it with the kind of clarity we can't see if we give into it come back here come back here

167
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:41,580
and also a balanced posture is a posture not only you can be balanced in a sense but also a posture with a tension that's

168
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:49,559
building up has a better chance to relax and soften and some of the lawyers are I think the

169
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:57,419
lawyers are they're they're they're they're they're they're commissioned their what they get paid the lawyers of the mind is intention

170
00:17:57,419 --> 00:18:04,640
the more you pay them attention the more they work for you

171
00:18:04,679 --> 00:18:11,899
but the lawyers of the mind don't you know that when you if you're relaxed they tend to kind of relax too

172
00:18:12,419 --> 00:18:17,580
so the so to begin seeing how we involved with the external world the

173
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:25,140
first two hindrances being caught in desires caught in ill will the second uh the next category of the

174
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:31,020
hindrances after those to do will we get caught in our internal world

175
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:36,179
the usually the next the next one is usually called sloth and torpor but it

176
00:18:36,179 --> 00:18:42,720
turns out the word that's translated sloth in Pali means becoming stiff and rigid

177
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:48,120
so it has I think it's much more valuable understanding because we freeze

178
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:54,840
we get do we we get numb we get all kinds of ways in which we kind of stop or get

179
00:18:54,840 --> 00:19:00,299
stuck in our inner life and we do kind of interpre sloth and

180
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:05,460
torpor what is torpor I think it's also kind of a here it's kind of a numbness a

181
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:11,520
kind of lethargy that comes from resistance we kind of pull in and collapse into

182
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:18,000
ourselves and so that's easy to succumb to with a nap

183
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,640
isn't that absolute right thing to do is it uh do we want to stay frozen and stiff

184
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:28,740
this posture can't take a balanced posture where

185
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:35,760
you're breathing doesn't freeze your breathing doesn't get tight the breathing has a chance to notice if it

186
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:42,600
does get tight and maybe you can adjust it and change it work with it and keep it soft and so

187
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:49,559
some of the the stiffness the rigidity the freeze doesn't get too locked in

188
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:56,520
Maybe and then the the second one or the second category that's internally

189
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:02,340
focused is um uh restlessness agitation excessive

190
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:08,179
activation we're running around excited not really you know

191
00:20:08,179 --> 00:20:13,980
or filled with regrets with remorse with self-criticism with you know just

192
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:20,160
something is terrible here I did the wrong thing and and um and this also is something where

193
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:26,600
people lose themselves in this inner world of agitation and

194
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:34,679
one of the best really fun meditations I've had is being really restless

195
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:41,580
in meditation and just sitting still and imagining my body is like a big

196
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:49,020
I don't know big room with walls and uh and the restlessness is a ping pong

197
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:56,039
balls that are bouncing around inside when I used that analogy it was kind of fun to sit there and and feel the

198
00:20:56,039 --> 00:21:01,500
restlessness it was certainly better than the alternative was to believe the

199
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:08,580
restlessness or be a victim of the restlessness or feel this is wrong or bad or feel the Authority or the

200
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:13,740
restlessness like this means that adding you know this means that or something

201
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:20,580
as opposed to oh this means that ping-pong balls are going wild in there

202
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:26,820
and that was fascinating to sit there just watch they all kind of move and it was when I had that analogy it was the

203
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:33,059
first time in my meditation where I had the experience of not being caught by the authority of

204
00:21:33,059 --> 00:21:40,980
the restlessness but just allowing it just to be there freely but not losing myself to it so this kind

205
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:46,980
of moving around bouncing around and then there's that doubt there's the

206
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:53,820
fifth hindrance but I think doubt is too tame of a word just to call what it is it's a little bit too intellectual

207
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:58,880
cognitive I think it can be uh you know being bewildered

208
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:06,240
perplexed lost not an understanding what's going on

209
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:12,960
and that can be really hard for people and sometimes maybe it's even reasonable

210
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:18,000
it's things are so confusing but is that a reason

211
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:24,840
to collapse is that a reason to

212
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,000
pick up the other hindrances and blame or want something

213
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:36,780
you know want some food that's going to solve it for me or comfort me

214
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:43,260
but to sit or to stand or to lie down or to walk

215
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:51,240
in a posture that's balanced some of these things I'm talking about that can that are posted that catches

216
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:56,580
our posture and and changes out we do and how we are

217
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:02,640
really powerful difficult and I've found what's useful is to go

218
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:09,179
walking but and so it's the in the walking the movement the it's like massaging

219
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:15,120
everything and giving there's kind of a um I've done walking meditation really fast

220
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:22,140
when I was really pissed off and it was only it was only the fast

221
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:28,200
walking that kind of allowed me to hold it and gave me the capacity to be with it

222
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,480
without getting all being bottled up or something but to do walking meditation in this

223
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:40,039
balanced way and then from there with a posture of a balanced walk walking fast if you need to

224
00:23:40,039 --> 00:23:45,600
then monitor yourself and notice what's going on and and be with what's going on

225
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:52,919
and and maintain that and see that and let that be the place where you look for balance rather than collapse or whatever

226
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:58,640
it is there's lying down

227
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:05,940
I think it's a it's called one of the four dignified postures in Buddhism so sometimes the wisest thing to do to

228
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:12,260
get balance is to lie down but don't lie down in the fetal position

229
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:20,659
nothing wrong with it I do the fetal position when I have a migraine I have no I have no shame

230
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:26,520
about doing so it seems like the best thing I can do I put my head under the

231
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:33,299
covers I get in the field position and I have my practice then I practice with the migraine

232
00:24:33,299 --> 00:24:39,240
but uh but you know if you were talking about this kind of emotional stuff maybe a fetal position is really good

233
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:44,400
sometimes maybe that's the best option sometimes I don't but but the idea is

234
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:51,299
um with this kind of balanced approach I'm trying to suggest today is find a posture that allows you that's the

235
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:56,700
middle way the balanced way to be with it all not for not against not losing

236
00:24:56,700 --> 00:25:02,039
yourself not collapsing sometimes lying down uh is the way that then you can

237
00:25:02,039 --> 00:25:07,620
kind of track and be with things and and discover how powerful these forces are

238
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:14,159
and discover how to relax with them discover what they see them more carefully what they are

239
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:21,480
discover what's underneath them what's driving them or simply discover how to have a larger

240
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:27,120
capacity to hold them to be aware of them

241
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:32,940
and this is a I think an undervalued part of this practice

242
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:38,760
many people come to this practice to fix themselves to make something better and to solve

243
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:44,940
their problems and be you know but sometimes our problems don't get solved

244
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:52,080
but rather our capacity to be balanced and open and free become so big

245
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:58,020
that the so-called problem now just becomes a little detail

246
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:04,860
I have all this anger I have to deal with my anger oh the anger is still here but it's like

247
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:10,380
a book on the bookshelf in a big room as opposed to the book you know that

248
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:17,820
just this is the whole thing so kind of letting the awareness the body become larger or the felt body the

249
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:25,820
experiential body that can hold it and be with it the Mind becomes bigger the heart becomes bigger

250
00:26:26,039 --> 00:26:32,539
so how to uh so this the role of the body the posture

251
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:40,320
I would encourage you to practice this within reason you don't have to go around all the time

252
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:46,559
but look for opportunities where you can take a balanced

253
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:54,840
posture upright aligned posture that works for you you know your body your situation

254
00:26:54,840 --> 00:27:00,240
that is your your posture where you feel like this is a posture right of not

255
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:05,640
giving in and I'm not pulling away and that's a coming and I'm not

256
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:11,220
resisting I'm just there and that'll look very different for everyone what that looks like because of all kinds of

257
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:17,580
issues but find it for you and then breathe with it be with it

258
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:25,159
meditate in that see what goes on what you learn and what unfolds and how maybe

259
00:27:25,159 --> 00:27:31,340
you'll learn the difference between being in the driver's seat

260
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:39,059
and losing and not being in deceit get you know giving yourself giving up to some let it putting your emotions in the

261
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:46,460
driver's seat which what happens for example when we collapse or we act out and react

262
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:52,020
so here present with it

263
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:58,039
and you might discover all kinds of interesting things you might discover

264
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,960
that some of the things that you're troubled by emotionally for example

265
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:10,980
Maybe are not so strong if you don't give in to it with your

266
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:16,140
posture I saw that many years ago when I was in college

267
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:20,720
and I had some kind of I don't know

268
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:29,039
you know this is a you know I don't think it was so serious degree of depression so I want to

269
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:34,740
preface of that so I don't know what else thinks that has to be like what happened to me but I had college student

270
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:39,900
depression whatever that is for me one day

271
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:47,400
and I was just kind of miserable and depressed and and I came home and

272
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:53,700
to this Barren house that we had hardly any furniture and it wasn't a particularly inspiring

273
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:58,740
place to be but there was a couch so I sat down the couch and I don't

274
00:28:58,740 --> 00:29:04,320
think it was possible to be more of a slouch in the couch more than I was

275
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,980
I mean my I think my shoulders were in the crack between the backrest and the seat you know

276
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:15,059
[Music] they were so dramatic

277
00:29:15,059 --> 00:29:22,740
and so I thought so I was so dramatic I noticed wow Gil this is quite something

278
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:30,000
and it occurred to me out of the blue Gail why don't you sit up straight so I sat up straight

279
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:37,200
and ninety percent of the depression kind of like this kind of vanished

280
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:45,539
instead of taking that posture it seldom that easy who knows maybe you know I'd ask someone

281
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:53,279
for a date and she said no some you know maybe it wasn't more more than that I don't know what it was but

282
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:58,559
but uh but um I was so impressed by the role of

283
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:05,159
posture that a posture can make that kind of difference and I'm not saying it's that easy

284
00:30:05,159 --> 00:30:12,419
but posture is a very important part of mindfulness practice the Buddha when he taught mindfulness

285
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:18,000
he taught mindfulness of posture and he taught the mindfulness of those

286
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,820
these four postures and everything in between but he named specifically

287
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:29,279
walking standing sitting and lying down

288
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:35,000
and later in the tradition it's called the four dignified postures

289
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:44,880
and um practice in those and when the time sees time seems right

290
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:50,279
do the same thing that the Buddha did if you're afraid or angry or something

291
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:55,440
don't change your balance posture stay with it and see if you can what

292
00:30:55,440 --> 00:31:03,120
happens if you stay with it without giving into it but but respecting it respect everything

293
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:08,279
about yourself respect these feelings and the difficulties and all that but

294
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:13,380
stay in the posture until

295
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:20,120
the wave crests which someday it will

296
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:28,440
so mindfulness of posture so we have a few minutes we can take a

297
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:34,080
few questions here or comments here and then uh at some point we can go outside

298
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:40,080
afterwards and so as you would like to stay we'll put some chairs in a circle in the outer in the parking lot those of

299
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:49,158
you who want to take off your mask and take it off and we'll continue discussion out there but for now if I see a hand over there

300
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:54,980
oh I didn't know have announcements first yes

301
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:07,380
no and uh next Sunday the 20th we will have

302
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:15,179
for the second time it's a monthly group that has restarted for kids it's called

303
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:23,220
Dharma rocks and we meet here at 11 15 to 12 15.

304
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:31,919
um each month on on a Sunday and uh it's approximately third grade through

305
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:39,779
six we had an eighth grader last time that was fine mature second graders also fine

306
00:32:39,779 --> 00:32:47,580
um we have a great time we did mindfulness of spookiness we'll see what comes up um you know this coming month

307
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,419
next Sunday

308
00:32:57,899 --> 00:33:03,360
thank you so I have a question about

309
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:08,940
so my reaction to things has improved you know I feel like there is space your

310
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,760
your reaction so um I'm just going to remove it more briefly

311
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:21,299
um so you know before I was always reacting right and I would say I would finish it

312
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:26,399
you know I have something smarter to say or you know I'm mad I have to tell that

313
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:31,620
so that has you know has slowed down and have become more patient I feel good

314
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:38,880
like you know there is no rush like you know I don't have to really tell the mean things I feel about

315
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:45,120
anything I guess so but when you know previously it would be like I'm saying

316
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:50,179
stupid stuff means tough but I feel like that is the greatest thing I have to say

317
00:33:50,179 --> 00:33:55,799
and later on it's like oh why did I say it right so how come you know when we

318
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:03,120
are in the in the thick of the action the mind is so numb that in a in a way

319
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:10,440
it's like we say stuff and then we're like oh God I didn't mean it I do like them you know I Ruled around my aunt or

320
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:16,220
you know I was mean you know there is Rush of emotions but afterwards you know

321
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:22,760
so why do we do stupid stuff great foreign

322
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:30,898
well I probably don't have a good good answer it's a good question I probably

323
00:34:30,899 --> 00:34:37,858
don't have a good answer but one of the reasons is because we lose ourselves in our emotions we lose ourselves in our

324
00:34:37,859 --> 00:34:45,658
desires and we get pulled into it and you know and one Buddhist answer to that

325
00:34:45,659 --> 00:34:51,179
question is because of the intensity of our desires our Cravings so we then

326
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:59,099
suddenly that those take over and what I was trying to teach today is a way of beginning to learn how that

327
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:06,599
that operates in us because if you take a posture that you're not going to succumb to things but but watch it and

328
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:13,500
find your freedom with it um the better and better over time you'll notice that tendency from the

329
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:19,619
inside before you do it and then you have the capacity not to give in

330
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:25,320
yeah thank you thank you yes maybe then over here first and then you can do it

331
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:33,720
yeah hi oh yeah um I have a heard that in Zen Foster is

332
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:40,079
extremely important in Zen I'm going to turn it up the volume okay go ahead hold that horizontally

333
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:45,900
like this horizontally flat yeah I've heard that

334
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:51,380
in Zen posture is extremely important um can you please talk a little bit about

335
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:56,820
and then posture is really important and uh

336
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:03,240
and there's a number of there's a number of reasons uh one is that this kind of posture you see here with the Buddha

337
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:09,960
it's a yogic posture and so you get yogic benefits especially if you can sit in full Lotus

338
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,720
and so but it's also a kind of a crutch I used to use full Lotus as a kind of a

339
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:21,420
crutch because I would get concentrated quicker and I would fall asleep I

340
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:27,420
wouldn't fall asleep so much because you get a really good energy going like the chi goes much more easily

341
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:34,079
but to rely on that rather than building it up from the inside out but to have it from the posture I don't think it's

342
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:40,140
really the so wise for what we're doing mindfulness practice where we want to really meet ourselves and be with and

343
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:46,320
see what's going on and not have some kind of you know yogic kind of effect that kind

344
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:53,820
of makes us concentrated or have the energy flow but anyways the yogic posture also some

345
00:36:53,820 --> 00:37:00,359
schools of Zen they have a very very different philosophy and world view about

346
00:37:00,359 --> 00:37:08,160
meditation and Buddhism than than Indian Buddhism has and so this posture is

347
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:13,440
considered people take in Zen sometimes Zen is a ritual

348
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,140
it's a ritual of being a Buddha and so you take a posture of a Buddha

349
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:26,400
and then over time you grow into it but it's more like a ritual enactment of

350
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:33,180
uh enactment of buddhahood rather than you know a path to buddhahood or something

351
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:37,880
and um so those are some of the reasons

352
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:46,140
posture that is is it a person that is unique to sin that you always practice

353
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:51,839
Zen with something like that or is it today concerned well depends where you practice then

354
00:37:51,839 --> 00:37:57,180
uh you know if you practice Chad and in the Chinese and they they have a whole

355
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:03,540
different attitude towards it um in Japan some in some schools of them they have very strict attitude towards

356
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:10,619
it then practitioners in the United States have learned um that not everyone who

357
00:38:10,619 --> 00:38:15,619
practices Zen are 22 year old men

358
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:22,320
and uh where in monasteries in Japan the real training Monastery most of them are

359
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:28,980
uh 22 years old like or you know in the early you know mid-20s and um

360
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:35,880
and so what we're capable of doing with this body is changes over time and circumstances and uh classically and Zen

361
00:38:35,880 --> 00:38:42,780
there's very little tolerance for people who have disabilities you know if you can't sit full Lotus you know you can't

362
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:48,060
be here you know it's very strict um and uh they gave some when I was in

363
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:54,540
Japan Japanese monastery they um they gave me some tolerance they

364
00:38:54,540 --> 00:39:01,859
didn't expect me to be in full notice but if you go into full load it's been expected I don't know if I can do it

365
00:39:01,859 --> 00:39:07,680
anymore but that if you do the Japanese did it full Lotus and and there was a

366
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:12,839
there was a kind of like a hazing to go into the monastery and so you had

367
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:20,400
to sit there for hours you know in full Lotus and they would come with a kind of a stick and if you come underneath their

368
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,540
hips here like like this if you take put the stick all the way through like this if you're sitting in full

369
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:32,640
Lotus you won't hit anything but if you bring your foot down

370
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,000
the stick would hit and so uh

371
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,859
so it was a little bit some some so little bits you know

372
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:50,640
strict and I think some of the strictness

373
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:57,660
wasn't exactly the essence of Zen it was something else

374
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:02,880
they're going on over there so so it depends so that was a long way of saying

375
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:08,339
the you know it depends but Zen does rely a lot on posture and it's I think

376
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:14,099
it's part of I learned a lot of the benefits of a good posture through Zen I think it's one of the strengths of Zen

377
00:40:14,099 --> 00:40:18,980
that they focus on posture but it can be overdone

378
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:27,180
yeah so two questions on uh movement the first one uh during meditation itself I

379
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:33,119
know some people are very strict on not moving at all um they film themselves and make sure

380
00:40:33,119 --> 00:40:39,960
that over an hour they haven't moved by a millimeter how important is it to be completely still even if you sense some

381
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:47,099
discomfort so that's the first question the second question would be outside of meditation if you find yourself getting

382
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:53,640
you know frustrated drumming your fingers something like that I imagine you'd want to approach it with curiosity

383
00:40:53,640 --> 00:41:02,599
and to relax but should you try to stop the drumming or how would you deal with that

384
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:08,720
um you should do whatever whatever it feels right to you

385
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:16,800
okay [Music]

386
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:23,460
but what feels right has something to sometimes I have something to do with what your practice is what you want to

387
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:29,700
see happen if you want to really get to the bottom of what's happening for you when you're

388
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:35,220
drumming your fingers and you want to study it like what's that what I'm going to make it object of

389
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:42,359
mindfulness maybe sometimes it's good to keep doing it you're doing it anyways I'm doing it what's going on here so let's keep doing it and and then that

390
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:48,359
gives you access to what's happening another today you might decide I'm not going to even begin I can feel the

391
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:53,400
impulse now let's see what's going on so it what's right depends on what you

392
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:59,579
want to do if you're trying to make a message to people be really clear that what what feels right is letting them

393
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:05,520
know then keep doing it if it's you know unless you're insulting them or

394
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:11,160
something I mean there's all it depends what you feel there's no shoulds here but in

395
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:16,980
terms of practice sometimes it's good to um

396
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:23,579
um like in terms of not moving uh uh there's advantages to not moving

397
00:42:23,579 --> 00:42:28,920
sometimes it allows the Mind get calmer and quieter the more we move in

398
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:34,400
meditation the more we kind of activating the mind so a lot of movement keeps the Mind activated

399
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:41,520
and so it can get quieter more concentrated for some people when they don't move it can feel really nice as we get more

400
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:48,180
stellar and Stiller to keep that Stillness of the body it feels more more natural than

401
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:53,460
and uh and sometimes it's the wrong thing to do you know we're we start uh

402
00:42:53,460 --> 00:43:01,020
you know we start having pain now it could be that you say you know I keep having pain I always avoiding it I

403
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:07,500
think what I'm interested in doing today is to stay with the pain for a while to see what I can learn maybe I need to

404
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:13,220
learn a little bit about my reactivity to pain that feels right today

405
00:43:13,260 --> 00:43:20,040
um and then after a while if you feel the painful I think I learned a few things about myself but now it's getting

406
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:27,060
grueling you know I don't think I need to do it now you know how I don't want to meditate again ever again

407
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:32,520
I think I overdid it I won't I won't stay with a pain that long I'll move sooner

408
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:39,540
so there's all you know all these choices you can make but you do it out of what feels right with the criteria

409
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:46,020
that you've with the criteria that's appropriate for the occasion yeah very good thanks and that's where

410
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:53,400
you have to use your intelligence yep so it's a matter of being the right attitude with it to it basically mindfulness maybe that Curiosity and uh

411
00:43:53,400 --> 00:44:00,000
and to relax into it yeah and also the criteria the intention the motivation you have what what what's the purpose of

412
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:07,560
this what's the purpose of being still what's the purpose of um you know moving and going along with it and and I if you

413
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:13,680
say I'm going to sit still what's the purpose of it I'm gonna I know I've done this so that's I'm not saying it's you

414
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:21,680
but it's me what's the purpose of sitting still to look really good

415
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:27,359
you know everybody you know I'm the last person sitting still you know I'm that

416
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:33,359
good you know so thank you so let's let's start
