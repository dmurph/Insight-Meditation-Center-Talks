um so uh

10
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:17,040
after the set i'll uh i'll reflect uh on uh

11
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,720
sort of the connections between equanimity and love

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:32,799
uh or equanimity as a kind of indirect route into to a kind of deep love

13
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:42,320
and we can can look in our uh

14
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:48,880
in our practice yeah like what what happens when

15
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,000
the openness of our heart and the balance of the mind

16
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:01,040
meets with the first noble truth meets with dukkha meets with

17
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:06,880
the the difficulties inherent in being human

18
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:12,480
and um my experience is that um

19
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,840
that in that that cauldron that meeting of equanimity

20
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,120
and dukkha the the byproduct

21
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,400
of that meeting is something like love

22
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:37,200
so yeah we gather in this spirit and uh

23
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,040
that's that's it

24
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:38,080
sometimes we sit and it it feels like uh

25
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,159
coming home and sometimes it feels like getting into

26
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:50,200
a body of water that's too cold

27
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,799
we just softened

28
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,520
just give the heart some moments to adjust

29
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:56,600
just still mass

30
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:35,039
even as the the spine ever so gently reaches towards the sky

31
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:44,720
also surrender the rest of the body to gravity that's subtle

32
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,879
soothing downward pull of the earth

33
00:07:54,400 --> 00:08:01,680
receiving all of our concerns and worries

34
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:17,080
just another animal walking on the surface of the planet

35
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:56,880
and in any given moment

36
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:04,360
there are a million things right and a million things are wrong

37
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,519
and equanimity affords us the luxury

38
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:19,839
of not needing to sort all of that out

39
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,959
freedom beckons us from within each

40
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,839
experience

41
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,600
in the face of the flood of experience

42
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,399
can our heart be softened

43
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:49,880
can we bow to the truth of dukkha the intensity

44
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:57,560
of the human condition the intensity of being sentient

45
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:17,360
can we bow knowing that in that bow our

46
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,160
heart is softened

47
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:17,399
foreign

48
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:21,360
so thank you um

49
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:30,960
yes i just sense a certain kind of um

50
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,840
uh closeness to you to the sangha

51
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:46,240
sort of recognition that um whether we're in the same room or

52
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:51,919
on youtube spread across the globe um

53
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:58,480
it's only ever sight and sound and thought and feeling

54
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:04,159
and there's a kind of fundamental equivalence

55
00:32:04,159 --> 00:32:11,240
to all of our situations yeah and

56
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,240
and so this this feeling of closeness is um

57
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:24,320
is not secondary you know

58
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:32,480
so equanimity

59
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:40,080
um the buddha the buddha is said to have found uh the

60
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:46,320
middle path the middle path between self-mortification

61
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:52,559
and self-indulgence and

62
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,840
and it should be noted that the the middle path

63
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:06,159
sounds middle but it's kind of hardcore yeah

64
00:33:06,159 --> 00:33:11,600
it's um one meal a day and

65
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:18,640
no tick tock yeah it's kind of hardcore

66
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:25,679
and but it is not an aesthetic path yeah it's not

67
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:33,279
it is not a path of asceticism in other words it's not trying to

68
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:38,480
make ourselves suffer make the body suffer so that the mind

69
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:44,640
gains strength that was a model a reason to pursue a kind of path of of

70
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:51,360
pain this is not the buddhist conception

71
00:33:53,600 --> 00:34:00,480
desire does not cause suffering the cause of suffering is grasping of desire

72
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:05,679
you really have to investigate desire and know it for what it is

73
00:34:05,679 --> 00:34:11,358
we can be very idealistic and thinking that even the need for food is some kind

74
00:34:11,359 --> 00:34:17,520
of desire we should not have one can be quite ridiculous about it

75
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,800
but the buddha was not an idealist and he was not a moralist

76
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:30,560
he was not trying to condemn anything he was trying to awaken us to truth so that we could

77
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,919
see things clearly

78
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:42,560
so pain pain on its own has no liberatory

79
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:48,000
potential in fact it usually has the opposite effect

80
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,280
self-denial is not a path

81
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:59,359
i i think it's a story from from the the suttas but maybe i'm misremembering but

82
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:05,440
it's something like the buddha meets a spiritual seeker who's standing on one

83
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:11,920
leg and asks like what are you doing and this the seeker says i'm burning up my

84
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:18,880
karma and uh and the buddha is like well how much is burn

85
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:24,800
i i don't know how much is left i don't know how will you know when you're done i

86
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:31,839
don't know and then buddha says like ah this is foolishness yeah

87
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,359
but here's the catch pain

88
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:47,040
minor dramatic met with equanimity has a profound liberatory

89
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:52,880
potential and in a way

90
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:59,119
uh the the buddhist path is about not squandering dukkha

91
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:05,920
not squandering dukkha not squandering the opportunities

92
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:11,440
of of dukkha of suffering of unsatisfactoriness and so

93
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,960
famously tiknot han just says no no mud no lotus

94
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:23,680
it's mud not problems and

95
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:32,480
we recognize that dukkha is usually it's usually squandered

96
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:40,720
it usually doesn't become wisdom it doesn't become love

97
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,960
and this this path is about this kind of this turn of the heart

98
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:53,359
how do we transform difficulty into something

99
00:36:53,359 --> 00:37:00,480
uh nourishing and it is almost a kind of

100
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:05,839
i don't use the word often but alchemical sort of process where we

101
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:12,960
are transmuting difficulty into

102
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:20,800
love and a longing for liberation

103
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:27,200
that that that my experience like that is what what

104
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,280
dukkha is transformed into in the the cauldron of the heart in the

105
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:39,200
trenches of practice dukkha is transformed into something like love

106
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:45,839
and a longing for liberation and so sometimes people say you know i'm

107
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:53,359
doing meta practice i'm doing loving-kindness practice and i cannot feel the love

108
00:37:53,839 --> 00:38:00,000
well sometimes the path into a deep steady radical love

109
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:05,760
it's more circuitous yeah it's not straight into meta

110
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:14,400
it's the circuitous path through dukkha meeting met by equanimity

111
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:22,560
and in a way it can be even more potent yeah than the direct path of love

112
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:31,280
it's a it's a love that that fully understands

113
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,040
that fully understands dukkha

114
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:43,680
uh one of my teaching teaching colleagues uh twari

115
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:49,400
sala said said described ecuador as kind of softening to the

116
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,440
uncontrollability of conditions yeah and she emphasized that word softening

117
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:03,039
softening the heart is softened by this we sit and here we are

118
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:09,200
who knows what comes up yeah knows what comes up and we're where we

119
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:17,359
just actually give up the kind of the rains we have on experience and

120
00:39:17,359 --> 00:39:22,480
surrender surrender soften

121
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:29,760
and i feel like one of the primary roles of a dharma teachers being

122
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:35,280
something like a trustworthy cheerleader you know

123
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:40,880
because there is a part of our selves that just cannot believe this is

124
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:45,280
the practice yeah

125
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:56,279
everyone everyone wants peace but who wants purification

126
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:03,800
so experiencing

127
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:11,200
pain experiencing pain experiencing duca without equanimity

128
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:17,200
often often leads to hate

129
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:24,079
and we can perceive this at a kind of

130
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:31,040
different scales at the national level like pain not met with wisdom not

131
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:37,839
met with equanimity it can wreck the mind

132
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:44,000
can contort the mind into uh

133
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:51,880
just incredible destructiveness ugliness

134
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:59,760
but pain met with equanimity this

135
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:07,839
is a cause for love yeah in that the cauldron of the heart yeah

136
00:41:07,839 --> 00:41:15,839
in the basement level of practice like the capacity to actually bring

137
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:22,079
difficulty into a attention to bring pain physical emotional into

138
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:27,119
attention this is profound and it's the basis for

139
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:34,560
not spilling or suffering on others right like when do we harm others when

140
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:39,040
do we do things we regret when do we

141
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:47,400
when does our own self-regulation fail yeah

142
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:53,200
um so we stay we stay

143
00:41:53,200 --> 00:42:00,400
with the dissatisfaction and it does feel almost like magic what

144
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:04,960
happens that

145
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:12,000
so much of the time of practice has just been this kind of like

146
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:17,040
honest simple labor you know uh labor of

147
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:22,640
the heart this process of purification which is

148
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:27,599
transforming energy that ordinarily

149
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:34,240
causes suffering into the seeds of our growing freedom

150
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:42,720
king described non-violence as the sword that heals

151
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:52,160
yeah the sword that heals how can that be how can that work well

152
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,880
it's kind of wild

153
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:04,640
shinzon young said that equanimity is the

154
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,400
primary cathartic factor of dharma practice

155
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:18,800
i've always loved that that description the primary cathartic factor of practice

156
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,240
now not all of dharma practice is cathartic yeah this building of

157
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:30,160
intensity the pits of despair intense negative affect

158
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:35,760
so the wave crests and breaks and there's relief

159
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:41,200
there's ease there's bliss there's peace there's something yes uh not all of

160
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:46,520
practice is like that some of practice is just this very uh

161
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:54,800
invisible accumulation of the parameters yeah of goodness we don't even see it

162
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:01,760
but some of it is dramatic and cathartic the wave breaks

163
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:06,800
and equanimity is is uh very deeply

164
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:12,560
involved in that wave breaking in the catharsis in the

165
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:19,838
being reborn into some new open space new pasture

166
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:28,720
and so we start to get a taste a taste of this process of purification

167
00:44:28,720 --> 00:44:36,920
an acquired taste for sure but a taste for it nonetheless

168
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:44,800
and that begins to bring a certain kind of

169
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:51,480
equivalence to experience to pleasure and pain

170
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:58,160
and after

171
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:04,560
we we work with this we work with this maybe it's just this sit just this set

172
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:11,680
we've worked patiently with tolerance with equanimity with difficulty

173
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:17,359
it's it's so

174
00:45:17,359 --> 00:45:27,359
hard to hate it's hard to rush it's hard to despair

175
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:33,160
it's hard to do the subtle kinds of

176
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:38,240
violence to our own hearts

177
00:45:39,599 --> 00:45:48,079
so something is softened love is the byproduct yeah of this meeting of equanimity

178
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:55,440
and dukkha and uh that is uh profound

179
00:45:55,440 --> 00:46:00,040
and that is something we share with others

180
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:09,200
so thank you uh yeah thank you for your your attention

181

184
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:35,680
that uh we don't live in a geocentric world nor is california the center of the universe

185
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:43,200
