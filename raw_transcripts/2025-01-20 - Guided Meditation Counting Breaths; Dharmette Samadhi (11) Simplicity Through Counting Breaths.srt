1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:08,880
so hello and good Monday to all of you hello to

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:16,840
this beginning of the week and there is a art in dhma

3
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:23,480
practice to [Music] appreciate

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:30,240
Beginnings to appreciate that in some way every moment is a beginning

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,920
that every moment we come to a fork where we can

6
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:43,840
choose a healthy wholesome good way of being present that supports us that nourishes

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:52,039
us or we can maybe go maybe down another Fork where we get

8
00:00:52,039 --> 00:00:57,719
Den nourished so here we are in Beginnings

9
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:04,838
every moment is an ending and a beginning and the glory of Dharma practice is to

10
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:13,040
really appreciate the newness of these beginnings and there's a wonderful art

11
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,200
wonderful way of leas in

12
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:27,320
meditation to put aside the past you don't have to forget it

13
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:35,840
forever put aside the future future there's lots of time in the future to think about the

14
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:42,000
future to be here and allow every moment to be a new

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:49,360
beginning where we step into it with attention with

16
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,880
awareness and with samadi practice that stepping into this

17
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:02,520
moment over and over again to this newness of

18
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:10,520
now is stepping into or being to a Simplicity of

19
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:16,160
being sometimes I think of the definition of samade I've different

20
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:21,920
definitions that that I like to play with I'll probably offer different ones

21
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,599
as we go along here but the one that I would like to emphasize

22
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,720
today is samadi is

23
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:41,280
Simplicity a radical Simplicity simple way of being with one

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:50,640
thing and what we're going to be with here what I recommend is the experience of

25
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,680
breathing and to enter into that experience of

26
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:03,920
breathing so it's uh we are simply aware of

27
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,840
breathing we're simply becoming

28
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,920
breathing we're simply giving ourselves over giving attention over to experience

29
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:21,760
breathing fully but the language we use like

30
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:30,599
awareness awareness awar be being aware of it fully concentrating on the breath

31
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:39,879
it's all too easy for that to engage s a tension or a tightness in the

32
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:45,000
focus that kind of getting serious and buckling

33
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:53,080
down the Simplicity of samadi without

34
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,280
tension just here in a simple way

35
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:06,840
so I'll offer a few things today for practicing with

36
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:12,799
breathing but one of the key practices

37
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:19,040
techniques that supports a Simplicity of being with something Simplicity of being

38
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:26,000
with the breath is counting the breath it's a

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:31,800
ancient concentration technique and I'd like to offer that there's

40
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:39,039
different ways of doing it and the idea is to keep this very

41
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:47,440
simple and I recommend that for today you count the

42
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:55,400
breathings some from somewhere up to one or up to

43
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:03,160
three and if you lose count just start again at

44
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:08,720
one and sometimes just just counting up to one is enough and then do it again

45
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:17,000
and again the count is at this point less important than how the count allows your

46
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:24,759
gives your thinking mind something very simple to do that's directed towards the

47
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:33,479
experience of breathing and so the thinking mind is engaged in this process of being simply

48
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:39,280
with the breathing and being simply with the

49
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,880
breathing kind of bringing together our

50
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:55,080
experience so we can over time experience the different aspects of

51
00:05:55,080 --> 00:06:01,560
breathing all in the purpose of sh sheering

52
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:06,160
awareness into a simple

53
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,599
relaxed attending to this moment here with the

54
00:06:13,599 --> 00:06:20,880
breathing and they can become very pleasant pleasurable very

55
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:28,880
satisfying if we can become very simple with the breathing with no pull to other

56
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:37,560
things no no judgments about it or anything else just breathing so to count you can just one

57
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:43,160
way to do this is on the inhale count

58
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:51,199
one and on the exhale count two inhale

59
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:01,479
three and then let the uh exhale go without a count just just follow it

60
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:09,560
peacefully and then Begin Again 1 2 3 there's many ways of counting if you

61
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:18,440
prefer just do one on the inhale one on the exhale just over and over again that's

62
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:24,000
okay and the idea is for the count to be very

63
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,240
gentle it's just like a 2% of what them think of what the attention is doing

64
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,440
very light kind of the lightest possible count and then don't you the check list

65
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:44,319
check checking it off kind of approach one then you're done your job

66
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:53,680
but rather see in your m in your silent thinking mind you can say the word one or the the

67
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:00,199
number kind of through the length of the inhale and two through the length of the

68
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:04,400
exhale so it would be

69
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:13,159
one or it might say the the count a couple of times gently

70
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,680
softly one one

71
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:27,080
one however long the inhale is and then two

72
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:34,320
two so you're really there so assuming meditation

73
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:44,039
posture and gently closing your eyes and taking some now some

74
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:49,240
gently but long longer inhales and

75
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:55,360
exhales as a way of familiarizing yourself to the body's experience or

76
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,360
breathing

77
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:09,079
and then as you exhale relaxing your

78
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:26,959
body as you exhale relaxing the breath body the part of the

79
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,360
body that does the breathing for

80
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:12,760
and letting the breathing return to

81
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:22,720
normal and for a few breaths perhaps relaxing as you

82
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,839
exhale and gently putting the

83
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:35,639
awareness on top top of the physical experience of breathing like you'd put a leaf on the

84
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:41,120
top of a flowing

85
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:46,839
Creek and then the Bela would gently flow down with the

86
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:54,279
creek so put the awareness on the flow of breathing

87
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:00,399
and with that very light touch of awareness

88
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:09,399
and flow along all the way to the end of the exhale to that settling

89
00:11:09,399 --> 00:11:16,880
Point deep in your body that you can touch at the end of

90
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:29,440
exhaling and then on the inhale

91
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:35,760
feeling how it arises from that settling Point supported by

92
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:41,519
it expanding through the body

93
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:53,000
awareness is lifted by the rising tide of the water

94
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:18,399
and then gently softly to stay with the flow of in

95
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,360
breath and out

96
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:33,360
breath let there be a soft

97
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:39,279
count that keeps you there floating on the

98
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:45,199
breath so you're not fixating attention straining

99
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:55,399
attention it's almost like peripheral awareness is resting on the experience of

100
00:12:55,399 --> 00:13:01,519
breathing and the count helps you to

101
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:09,760
settle helps you to be simple helps you let go of your

102
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:17,199
thoughts counting the inhales and

103
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:25,079
exhales and if you lose count without any

104
00:13:25,079 --> 00:13:31,120
commentary judgment start again

105
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,040

106

for for

109
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:30,920
with each count being like a dial that quiets the

110
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:40,040
mind quiets the thinking mind in favor

111
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:46,440
of a simple

112
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,160
soft attention

113
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:56,440
resting an inhale and

114
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,839

be that what radiates from us what spreads from us may it be that our

153
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:23,039
contribution maybe our small contribution to this

154
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:28,600
world is a spreading of good will

155
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:36,200
out from us may all beings be

156
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:45,759
happy may all beings be safe may all beings be

157
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:50,760
peaceful may all beings be

158
00:29:53,320 --> 00:30:01,240
free and may may that be what we contribute rute to this world

159
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,360
today may we benefit the

160
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:11,480
world through living

161
00:30:17,270 --> 00:30:25,119
[Music]

162
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,960
today thank you

163
00:30:56,919 --> 00:31:00,960
for e

164
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:51,840
so so welcome to this 11th talk on samadi

165
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:59,840
and the the main point I'd like to make is that

166
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:09,200
is almost an equivalence with somari and simplicity samadi is

167
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:13,960
Simplicity and um

168
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:22,159
to and one of the things that we can do when we practice samadi is to notice how

169
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:29,159
we are not simple and that's important very important to see the complexity in which

170
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:35,919
we live how we get pulled into thoughts and feelings ideas

171
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:42,720
plans and appreciate that this is what the Mind does it's not a

172
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:49,720
crime and there's a homecoming that we can do

173
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:55,159
there's a way in which too much thought Keeps Us alienated Keeps Us separate from

174
00:32:55,159 --> 00:33:00,399
ourselves unless we think who who we are is our

175
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:08,799
thinking but we are so much more than that something deeper and so homecoming into the

176
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:15,000
Simplicity and the more simple we can be with breathing the more there's something

177
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,880
marvelous that can begin to appear and part of that marvelousness is

178
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:26,760
that um it can feel very settled

179
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:32,840
very sweet very simple just to be alive here with the

180
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:39,760
breathing and it's almost like we're entering into the deep place of

181
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:46,760
home so that uh we can turn ourselves inside out

182
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:53,519
to allow some deep capacity for peace and subtleness

183
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:59,279
to animate how we live our life

184
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:13,960
so uh there's many ways in which people develop samade and but one of the ancient

185
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:19,560
techniques is counting Counting the breath and of course the breath isn't

186
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:25,000
suitable as an object for everybody so there are other ways of

187
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:31,919
developing samadi and uh in our tradition one of the

188
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:38,118
um one of the alternative common alternative suggestion is to develop

189
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:44,560
somebody with saying the phrases of loving kindness and just to find a way of

190
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,320
saying that that's settling that's simplifying that gets us absorbed in the

191
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:58,119
the activity of offering good will but the reference point I'll be doing is

192
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:03,480
breathing counting the breath and that'll also be the focus for this week

193
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:08,560
and um the um and you can certainly stop

194
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:15,400
counting uh if you don't want to but if you've never done much counting or even if you have there's something to be

195
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:22,320
learned about spending a week doing it that might be invaluable uh not a few people certainly

196
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:27,480
me have thought I was getting settled and concentrated but really was drifting

197
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:33,040
off often thought and it was only when in a very pleasant way perhaps it was

198
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:40,520
only when I started to count that uh I I saw oh I'm more involved in my thoughts

199
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:46,200
I didn't realize how strong the pull of thoughts were and um because I only got

200
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:52,319
to the count of one and or half a count or I int there have been times where

201
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:58,319
I've intended to count and never got around to it because the thinking mind was so strong

202
00:35:58,319 --> 00:36:04,359
or and so if you can get to 10 then that's pretty good um if you can't get

203
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:09,720
to 10 you if you get to one only and and then you get pulled into thought then

204
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:16,359
you know thinking is really strong if you get to Seven then maybe thinking mind is not that strong and that's kind

205
00:36:16,359 --> 00:36:25,520
of nice to know so you get to see something what's going on with you the counting is also a way of of

206
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:31,280
including the thinking mind in the Gathering the unification the bringing

207
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,040
together of all of who we are into the Simplicity of this moment with the

208
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:42,280
breathing and so rather than having a thinking mind be idle an idle mind gets

209
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,359
in trouble uh rather than the idle to think whatever it wants uh you're

210
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:52,520
actually giving the thinking mind something to do that is supportive of

211
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:57,880
the effort being done and sometimes the thinking mind is H really happy to have

212
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:04,680
a task happy to be included happy to be supportive of something that is so

213
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,920
incredibly profound and useful as developing somebody it has a purpose it

214
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:17,040
has a meaning for the thinking mind and sometimes that's what it wants and if you don't give it then it

215
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:23,079
goes off and looks for something else and so to offer the thinking mind

216
00:37:23,079 --> 00:37:30,440
the simple thing to do that um might just involve one syllable at the count

217
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:37,720
of one two three and um and i i s i s when I was

218
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:43,079
taught doing this I was taught to count to 10 and then start over

219
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:50,839
again and uh or if you lost count to start over again and um and the way I did

220
00:37:50,839 --> 00:37:56,720
it uh how I was understood it was I only counted the exhale and I filled the

221
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:03,160
exhale with count I've since then learned that it can be valuable to count both the inhale

222
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:11,160
and the exhale and what I'm offering today is that um to keep it really simple and

223
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:16,560
that is to count you can from some choose to count somewhere between

224
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:23,560
between one and three and to count both the inhale and exhale and I don't want to confuse you

225
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:29,359
with too many options but maybe you can land on one that just seems intuitively

226
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:34,599
what's right for you rather than kind of struggling around it some people find it

227
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:44,280
helpful to give the same count for the inhale as the exhale so one one 2 two 3

228
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:51,359
three and then start since I'm going to I'm going to keep it really simple here today start over again then at

229
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,520
one some people find it helpful to change to just count the inhale one and

230
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:02,520
the exhale gets two two and then three and when I un done I've done this up to

231
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:07,800
three uh counting both the inhale and exhale gets the part of the count I find

232
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:13,160
it really helpful to not count four but so breathe in

233
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:20,520
one breathe out two breathe in three and then let it be

234
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:29,079
quiet in the mind just ride the exhale in The Quiet Mind and then start again

235
00:39:29,079 --> 00:39:37,440
and um and one of the things that does it stops the counting become going on to automatic pilot it also allows for some

236
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,680
kind of quieter thing to stay there so you're you're you're referencing quiet

237
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:49,800
subtleness for how you're going to say the count I've sometimes counted harshly

238
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:58,160
and you know and hard and you know staccato like the idea is to do it gently

239
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:05,040
softly with just enough uh just enough effort to count that you can um that

240
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:10,599
just just enough to have it the mind make that thought and sometimes what

241
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:15,720
I've done to make it really light for myself is to imagine I'm

242
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:20,839
counting and um and somehow in I this idea this exercise of imagining I'm

243
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:28,400
counting it becomes almost like a wispy or silent or um there's almost no

244
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:33,839
effort going into it no physical energy going into no strain no pushing just it

245
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:39,440
just kind of floats up and then and then but you don't want

246
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:45,079
to make the count the primary thing you do you want the primary thing to do is a

247
00:40:45,079 --> 00:40:53,040
kind of resting settling um entering into the world they're breathing and the count is a

248
00:40:53,040 --> 00:41:00,280
little bit like a pointer like a reminder oh oh stay there stay

249
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:08,280
there and um and it and the focus is not as laser focus on the breathing uh

250
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:17,000
sometimes I've thought of it there's all these metaphors for it and one metaphor that I've liked for myself is

251
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:24,040
um someone coming from behind someone I I trust and and uh and care for and they

252
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:30,520
gently put their hand on my back just letting me know I'm the there and they're there with me just reminder I'm

253
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:36,240
here I'm here to support you and um and so it's kind of that way we approach the

254
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:44,079
breathing the body breathing and just gently the count is here I'm here with you I'm supporting you I'm being here

255
00:41:44,079 --> 00:41:52,520
with you and um and so um in doing so uh the

256
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:58,240
surface Mind of a lot of agitated thoughts and concerns hopefully can

257
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:04,880
understand it's okay it's safe to become quiet it's okay to you don't have to

258
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:11,040
quiet you don't have to actively get rid of that thinking mind but as the energy

259
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:16,560
of attention goes into breathing into accounting um something begins to soften

260
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:25,160
and relax in the body and the mind that that begins um decreasing the tension or

261
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:31,319
pressure that perpetuates agitated

262
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:37,920
thinking so that pressure quiets so to count your

263
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:44,960
breathing and I'll talk more about it this week but this was kind of introduction to this topic and

264
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:51,400
um and um so what I'd like to um

265
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:57,440
suggest uh this week that if you're able to in your life

266
00:42:57,440 --> 00:43:03,240
if you have uh the capacity and hopefully the interest that um meditate

267
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:10,280
a second time today you've done it now with us here do it again so and it can

268
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,440
maybe 20 minutes is enough and uh in order to kind of

269
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:22,200
continue uh the momentum of this kind of practice um the uh I do talk a lot in

270
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:28,119
the guided meditations because of trying to teach this here and um

271
00:43:28,119 --> 00:43:35,640
and ideally uh you then would practice it on your own so you can do this in silence and develop kind of a momentum

272
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:41,720
behind it so if you can manage to sit another 20 minutes each day uh I think

273
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:48,440
that will support this uh amazing process of samade that we're going to go through

274
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:54,440
slowly so thank you very very much and

275
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:00,240
um um and may your ability to be simple and

276
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:06,280
present and attentive may it enable you to enter the

277
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:12,079
world with Good Will May this practice support the spreading of Good Will

278
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:17,240
wherever you go thank you
