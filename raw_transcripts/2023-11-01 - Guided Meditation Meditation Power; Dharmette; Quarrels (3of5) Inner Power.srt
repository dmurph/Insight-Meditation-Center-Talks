1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:09,240
hello and welcome to this meditation session and as an introduction to the

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:17,680
meditation I want to mention that occasionally in the world that uh I

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:23,960
travel in the concept of

4
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:32,599
power is often seen negatively and and partly because PO is

5
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:40,600
used in interpersonal relationships in society in ways that are quite power quite painful and

6
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,079
harmful and uh if you go back and look at the meditation teachings of the

7
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:56,440
Buddha he has a lot of references to power that are power within

8
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:03,960
oneself some of the faculties we have for doing meditation

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,080
practice as meditation develops develop in develops into Powers there's a of

10
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,840
power strength that carries them with which they carry us they

11
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:22,240
support us there's the power of

12
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,600
confidence the power of effort the power of

13
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:33,680
mindfulness the power of Mi and the power of

14
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:38,799
wisdom and none of these are being referred to in relationship to power

15
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,920
over anyone else and maybe not even power over

16
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:52,240
oneself but they are strengths that develop and that from the Buddhist

17
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,600
perspective we we don't need to be afraid of they're here to support what's

18
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:05,640
really best in US power of wisdom is clearly related to uh

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:12,040
the power to recognize and act on what is beneficial

20
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:18,519
for us and to avoid what is harmful for us as we

21
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,160
meditate so this can get very quickly a complicated idea

22
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:30,360
discussion but for this meditation I would like to see if we can

23
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:38,120
I can support you to meditate where there's some underlying

24
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:43,760
sense of power in this body and mind

25
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,000
strength that is an aid keeping us grounded keeping us

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,480
centered here and now keeping us gently

27
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,480
but firmly rooted here in this practice in this time and place

28
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,319
place not with strain not with striving not with

29
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,840
expectation but almost like a

30
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:17,000
delightful appreciated sense of being

31
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:25,599
rooted in the practice so assuming a meditation

32
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:31,680
posture that is right for you

33
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:38,080
a posture that maybe is

34
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:45,239
adjusted maybe small adjustments so

35
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,439
that it expresses a

36
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:57,000
confidence a kind of power that we

37
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:05,239
have almost almost like Gathering ourselves together preparing

38
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,760
ourselves maybe for like a

39
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:15,560
physical activity we have to do that requires all the strength that we can

40
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,000
muster we might take a deep breath we might take a good

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:28,600
stance we might Focus kind of bring together our whole

42
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:35,680
body so a posture a meditation posture that

43
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:43,120
gathers together and gently closing your

44
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,000
eyes and

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:05:02,080
to find a place within that you associate whether it's

46
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:10,880
present now or not you associate with a location

47
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,639
for Gathering Power

48
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:24,360
strength a definitive feeling of being yes

49
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:31,280
here no question about it Gathering it together to be

50
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:36,520
rooted here for an important

51
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:41,840
activity is there a place where you gather where you

52
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:55,400
Center and from that place to take some long slow deep

53
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,560
breaths as if your breathing begins there and spreads from there as you

54
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:09,800
breathe in and returning there as you

55
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:34,199
exhale relaxing as you

56
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,280
exhale almost as if you are relaxing around an inner sense of

57
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:51,800
strength so any complications around the edges of it fall

58
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
away

59
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:17,800
and then to let your breathing return to normal and continue to breathe out of or

60
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:23,319
with some sense of inner strength

61
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:31,319
power and with a gentle breathing

62
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,400
relax on the

63
00:07:36,759 --> 00:07:42,720
exhale maybe so there's a sense of calm or

64
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:50,960
peace around that sense of strength however small it might

65
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
be

66
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,879
a sense of personal strength or power in

67
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:28,240
meditation is closely connected to confidence a simple

68
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:35,240
confidence in the value of being present here and

69
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:50,000
now a confidence in not staying involved with thoughts and

70
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:55,080
attitudes which undermine

71
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,200
you

72
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:33,519
confidence and simpath awareness so that awareness

73
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:41,680
too is rooted in an inner

74
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,200
strength Gathering Together of

75
00:09:58,120 --> 00:10:04,600
oneself a joining of

76
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:13,120
mindfulness with a peaceful strength power definitiveness

77
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:21,040
here now and if you find your mind wandering

78
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,040
off to the best of your ability reenter

79
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:34,839
yourself and whatever sense of inner strength or

80
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:40,560
power that's available to you however

81
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:55,240
small so with confidence and Clarity and definitiveness

82
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,800
you return to being aw aware now now

83
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959

to connect mindfulness with an inner source of

94
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,920
strength power that is not

95
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:31,639
assertive but rather is closely associated

96
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:34,639
with

97

and then as we come to the end of this

120
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:07,720
sitting do once again

121
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:14,200
settle in yourself maybe on the

122
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:27,240
exhale maybe settling in a grounded rooted place where there's a feeling of being

123
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:31,559
strong in being

124
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:37,080
rooted a strength of

125
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,360
presence the advantage of which you're not going to be pushed

126
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:51,518
around collapse give up but stay

127
00:28:51,720 --> 00:29:01,880
present able to look kindly calm calmly onto whatever

128
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,158
challenges you're aware

129
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,919

care without feeling

133
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:47,440
inadequate in the face of what's happening in the

134
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:54,320
world and to wish well to look kindly upon

135
00:29:54,320 --> 00:30:01,440
others to wish them the best to wish them to be free of their greed

136
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:06,919
hate and delusion to wish them to be free of

137
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:11,120
Oppression hunger

138
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:21,000

00:30:44,919 --> 00:30:48,559
people support

143
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:01,490
that [Music]

144
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:06,679
thank

145
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:29,159
you

146
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:25,559
so so welcome to this third talk about the Buddha's teachings on disputes

147
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:30,880
quarrels and we know that disputes and quarrels can be verbally violent they

148
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:39,000
can be assertive there can be a lot of power and strength that is evoked in

149
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:44,679
disputes and sometimes uh some people's

150
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:51,279
uh sense of personal power gets awakened and channeled through

151
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:57,600
anger sometimes through conceit and part of the

152
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:03,440
some people who don't have much sense of connection to their personal

153
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:09,799
power will really value being angry because how it makes them feel powerful

154
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:15,399
and strong but when um when our personal

155
00:33:15,399 --> 00:33:22,880
power is channeled into disputes and quarrels it makes the whole disputes and quarrels much more complicated and it's

156
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:28,919
not so easy to for us to find ourselves in that there's a losing of ourselves in

157
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:34,320
it and it can come along with uh all kinds of unfortunate things that go

158
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:42,000
on one of the things that is um that Buddha talks about is uh what gives

159
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:48,600
strength to any expression of greed hatred and delusion is

160
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:58,000
people's uh love of power some the sense that uh identifying with power say I am

161
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,279
powerful I want power and that kind of power Social

162
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:09,800
Power is a power that's uh that uh has to do with power in the

163
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:15,320
relationship we want control over others we want to um not just be right in the

164
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:21,720
arguments we have but we want to have a sense of that we're powerful we can get our way in a

165
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:27,638
situation sometimes because there's a w only we only believe there's a win lose option

166
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:32,760
it's either that person wins or I win and um and so we want to win we want to

167
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:39,320
be safe we want to not be losing doesn't feel good and to feel

168
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:45,480
powerful is a way of kind of winning in a sense or being right or having a sense

169
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:51,638
of control or a sense of pleasure even in a sense of power power over

170
00:34:51,639 --> 00:34:58,640
people and um and because power is so often used um for people to get their

171
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:04,640
way or politicians to get their way or rulers to get their way uh and sometimes

172
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:11,480
and it's expressed in all kinds of horrible ways um uh Power is often seen as being

173
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:17,200
evil or wrong or people then become afraid to express their power sometimes

174
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:23,359
because if they express it someone else will come along and knock it down someone will Express even more power and

175
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:29,680
say that you're wrong or conceited or something but uh the Buddha put a lot of

176
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:36,680
discussion about power personal power but it was never power over anybody else

177
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:42,119
it was all in relationship to power over oneself though occasionally talked about

178
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:48,000
having the power uh to enter into relationships in such a way that uh to

179
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:53,200
create healthy relationships and I'll talk about that so some of the forms of

180
00:35:53,200 --> 00:36:02,119
power that Buddha uh talked about developing is the the power of cons of uh having a

181
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:09,240
conscience so the power of being having conscience and care and just and to not

182
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:15,640
cause harm he talked up the power of confidence the power of power of

183
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:21,079
confidence over knowing what is uh healthy and unhealthy beneficial and not

184
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:27,599
beneficial he talked about the power of effort the effort of doing what's wholesome and avoiding what's

185
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:35,920
wholesome the power of mindfulness and part of the purpose of mindfulness to really be present is not to be calm but

186
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:42,000
be able to find our way to recognize what is healthy and unhealthy what is wholesome and UNH

187
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:47,280
wholesome the power of samadi the power of being grounded here in the present

188
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:53,839
moment and the power of wisdom and one of the ways that Buddha defines wisdom

189
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:58,960
is in fact the wisdom of being able to recog recognize what is beneficial and

190
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:05,119
what is not beneficial what is wholesome and what is not wholesome and um so over and over again

191
00:37:05,119 --> 00:37:11,280
we see the Buddha is wanting people to have power over themselves over the

192
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:18,680
choices their mind makes their heart makes their their body makes and their activity to be able to choose

193
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:24,760
well and one of the ways of choosing well is to choose the the kind of a

194
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:30,800
strength of mindfulness of being present without Asser assertion and without

195
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,200
giving up without um um running away or

196
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:41,880
collapsing without assenting to things we don't agree to but to be able to hold

197
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:49,319
our own calmly in a relaxed way to stay there and be present uh rather than

198
00:37:49,319 --> 00:37:55,560
turning away from conflict uh I think the Buddhist approach is to stand up

199
00:37:55,560 --> 00:38:03,400
tall metaphorically uh to hold keep our seat and um and be

200
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:09,160
able to look at reality directly and calmly without

201
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,359
flinching and uh without collapsing without getting confused or a agitated

202
00:38:14,359 --> 00:38:21,079
or and this is not an easy thing to do but uh by emphasizing that this is a

203
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:26,920
kind of P there's a kind of internal power that's meant to be awoken and and

204
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:34,000
support us in this Buddhist practice uh when this practice is uh uh

205
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:40,240
only associated with being being calm being peaceful sometimes we we're short

206
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:48,599
changing ourselves of what's possible here yes being calm being peaceful is part of the practice but it's a partner

207
00:38:48,599 --> 00:38:53,720
with having strength a partner with a certain kind of inner personal power

208
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:59,560
that uh so that in the peaceful state We're Not Fragile we're not vulnerable

209
00:38:59,560 --> 00:39:05,160
we're not so so sensitive that that we feel like it's everything is too

210
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:13,280
much so a couple of things that Buddha emphasizes that um in one place he he talks about four

211
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:21,040
powers and um and the first is the power of wisdom which he clearly defines as um

212
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:27,960
the power to know what's beneficial and what's not beneficial to know what's wholesome and not wholesome

213
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:35,359
the power of um energy again like I said before to be able to act on that wisdom

214
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:41,760
to act on what's beneficial to avoid what's not beneficial and then the power of

215
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:48,400
blamelessness this I love this one the power of not living in the world where

216
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:53,760
you people have reason to blame you sometimes he calls that the joy of

217
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:59,640
blamelessness but he also the power of being being that way a certain kind of strength that comes to be able to walk

218
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:05,079
through the world um not not being uh feeling that no one has anything

219
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:11,400
anything to blame a real they might blame us but there's no cause for it and

220
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:17,839
then um and then the power of sustaining favorable

221
00:40:17,839 --> 00:40:25,839
relationships the power of sustaining favorable Community bringing people together and

222
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,000
this also he Des describes in four different ways four kind of sub powers

223
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:38,400
in a sense uh the power of giving as opposed to the power of taking

224
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,520
taking power for example from other people controlling them the the power of giving giving

225
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:52,800
people the benefit of the doubt being generous to them the power of giving them the their opinion okay we can agree

226
00:40:52,800 --> 00:41:00,599
to disagree and you're welcome to your opinion it the power of um kind speech

227
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:08,640
or loving speech so often the in disputes and quarrels the speech is not kind and

228
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:15,520
sometimes is actually downright mean and so the power of knowing how to speak in kind ways

229
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:23,560
and and then um the power of beneficial conduct so not just knowing what's

230
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:28,880
beneficial and but really knowing how to act and giving is one of those kind speech

231
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:35,400
is another one and um and but what you know to really stay conduct oneself in

232
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:45,200
beneficial ways not succumbing to harmful ways of being and then the the uh fourth one is

233
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:53,119
um uh The Power of Equality the power of a certain kind of

234
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:59,079
impartiality where we treat everyone equal and this is the one that our

235
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:05,079
society needs tremendously there's so many different ways that we have bias

236
00:42:05,079 --> 00:42:11,640
Prejudice uh towards people of all kinds of differences from ourselves and um and

237
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:18,200
the power of treating everyone equally uh that that a kind of a power of

238
00:42:18,200 --> 00:42:24,319
respect so I offer this teachings today in the context of disputes and

239
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:30,000
quarrels to uh in disputes and difficulties and challenges you have

240
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,400
with people uh to uh call upon a

241
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:41,160
personal power but don't engage in disputes and arguments uh asserting

242
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:46,920
power over over other people uh but have it over yourself so

243
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:55,040
that you know how to stay present and even just the power of presence uh of keeping your seat keeping

244
00:42:55,040 --> 00:43:04,640
your place without succumbing without giving up without um um um agreeing just

245
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:10,839
because the other person's more powerful seemingly to you or is arguing more strongly than you or you're afraid of

246
00:43:10,839 --> 00:43:16,559
them but to be able to breathe and stay rooted here and it's a sense of inner

247
00:43:16,559 --> 00:43:22,520
power that might be in the long term in all our complexity of our life may be

248
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:28,079
more important than trying to hold on to being calm and peace ful but the more

249
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:33,920
that we can have the power of attention of being present of being rooted I think

250
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:39,720
the more our calm and peace can accompany us and support

251
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:45,119
us so um so I hope that all of us can

252
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:50,640
grow into becoming powerful people but

253
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:56,920
powerful over ourselves with ourselves so that we can do good in the world

254
00:43:56,920 --> 00:44:03,880
World powerful enough that we can avoid the habitual Tendencies to be mean to be

255
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:10,880
argumentative to complain to um uh just be upset about all kinds of things with

256
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:18,440
other people in ways that uh undermine and maybe create uh make the

257
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:24,200
world a worse place for other people uh to have the power to hold our

258
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:32,440
tongue when what we're going to say is going to make things worse so uh this practice of ours is

259
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:41,440
meant to support the development of powerful strong people um and uh who can do good in the

260
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:50,240
world and good for themselves not to assert ourselves over anyone so thank you and uh may this

261
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:56,800
support you in disputes and quarrels that uh um

262
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:02,280
you're being pulled into U or or or

263
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:09,000
you're tempted to get involved in and maybe it'll teach you how to be present

264
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:17,000
for discussions when there's disagreements without it being a dispute or quarrel thank

265
