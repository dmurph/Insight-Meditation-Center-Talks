00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:08,480
so welcome once again everyone to this edition of happy hour

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,119
um practicing cultivating our heart

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,480
so for today um i was thinking today being friday or

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:27,119
saturday morning whatever the time zone you might be in it's been a pretty intense week on the

5
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,920
international stage is a pretty intense week

6
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:39,739
all all around and [Music]

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,960
this being the the quota unquote end of the week

8
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:52,239
sometimes what's nice is to just sit and practice mostly silence coming

9
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:58,800
together you know when when you're tired you just want to come sometimes come together with your friends you just want

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,760
to sit you don't want a loud party you want to just sit with your friends and maybe not even talk much

11
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:12,000
but know that you're with people with good people and and just sitting with

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,360
your body with your heart with your mind just holding presence

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:23,840
with each other it's almost like holding a vigil sitting sitting holding

14
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:30,479
a vigil as if each of us was holding a candle with our meta

15
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,720
as if each of us was a candle was a candle

16
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,960
of light onto unto this world

17
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:52,560
and trusting that each of us each of us are are a light

18
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:58,640
even if we judge ourselves criticize ourselves it's tough it's difficult at times

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,920
and yet there is this inner goodness this inner light

20
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:09,520
and especially when we come together in

21
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,200
this container for cultivating meta for cultivating

22
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:21,200
compassion trusting that our light is shining our light is

23
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,480
shining even brighter

24
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,480
the light shining to dispel

25
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,080
greed hatred and confusion

26
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:44,400
both for ourselves and for everyone in the world as we cultivate

27
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:51,560
our heart and kindness and good will towards ourselves and towards others

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:59,599
so with this frame will be more of a quiet

29
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:07,040
practice session tonight but with really feeling into the sense of

30
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:12,400
interconnection as if we were sitting all of us in a room together

31
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:18,760
in some ways we are sitting on a room in a room together

32
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,920
zoom room youtube room but this sense of sitting with people sitting holding

33
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:33,840
space holding a candle so that's a lie that's an image i like to invoke for us

34
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:40,239
with this practice so so let's formally begin enough words

35
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:47,840
ah let's land let's land in our bodies together

36
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:54,720
both separately and together as a community

37
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,319
separated in space

38
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,120
and maybe time here

39
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,640
here coming here

40
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:03,039
connecting with the body breathing

41
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:11,720
with your heart with whatever is arising in this moment

42
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,400
and asking yourself asking your heart

43
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,240
this dear being who is you sweetheart

44
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,440

46
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:21,840
and answer my top come up or maybe silence is what comes up it's all okay

47
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,800
by just asking the question simply asking the question kindly from

48
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,880
ourselves we're extending

49
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:37,009
[Music]

50
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:46,000
kindness first to ourselves

51
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:51,159
to the light that is us

52
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:40,760
simply letting awareness connect with the body and the breath settling settling

53
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:49,560
with care with gentleness

54
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:19,839
now bringing pure awareness again [Music] that you are sitting

55
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,080
with others

56
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,680
so if we're all together holding vigil each holding a

57
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,680
candle

58
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,560
the candle of our heart's flame

59
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,640
of menta together

60
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:07,839
holding a vigil holding these candles

61
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,680
of light of light together

62
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,399
holding the light together

63
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:33,839
as the light shines it shares the wishes of well-being

64
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:41,680
for ourselves for everyone it shines upon

65
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:49,360
and beyond all beings may all beings

66
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:01,440
be safe fully knowing that it may not be

67
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,880
possible and yet holding the candle

68
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:10,000
holding this light

69
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:18,320
holding this light of goodness for the sake of humanity

70
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:23,560
may all beings be happy

71
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,240
may all beings be healthy

72
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:43,079
may all beings have ease

73
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,360
if phrases of compassion feel more appropriate you can share those may all

74
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:54,480
beings including myself including all of us

75
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:01,040
be free from suffering have ease have peace

76
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,959
may all beings be free

77
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:31,360
remember to connect with your body and the breath especially as you hold the candle

78
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,160
together

79
00:16:56,720 --> 00:17:03,120
and if thoughts stories arise

80
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:08,720
the mind goes off

81
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:16,000
it's okay simply notice that this is not helpful right now

82
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:24,079
ever so gently smilingly free it let it go

83
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:32,440
ah connecting with your body with the breath

84
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:40,240
connecting with your light shining upon yourself and others

85
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:45,640
wherever it's needed in this moment the most

86
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,320
your body heart and mind or suffering

87
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,039
it's okay

88
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:03,679
to really notice the light of your candle shining upon

89
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,960
yourself

90
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:18,960
also know that it can shine on many beings at the same time it is possible

91
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,240
it's not either or

92
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:30,520
letting your light shine letting your light shine

93
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:51,440
just as if you were holding a candle individual together

94
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:58,158
for humanity sharing meta just as

95
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,480
the candles flame doesn't belong to you

96
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,200
it's just a flame the candle might be yours

97
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:20,480
in some way but not the flame trusting trusting this flame trusting

98
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,278
this light

99
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:29,840
that is yours and not yours

100
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:45,520
you are the guardian of you're the guardian of this light this

101
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:51,720
goodness this flame for a limited time in this life

to the world

110
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:52,158
notice the difference between doubting

111
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:58,400
this light doubting that there is a light this flame

112
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:07,359
scandal of goodness shining meta notice the difference between doubting

113
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:15,920
just trying to believe trust trusting with

114
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,640
confidence as contrast that it is here ah

115

holding it with others

119
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:04,240
what happens if you trust it if you trust this goodness

120
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:18,400
trust there is goodness that you're holding holding up

121
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:25,320
cultivating letting it shine

122
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:24,880
for the last minutes of this practice period

123
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,880
having confidence in the goodness

124
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:42,480
we're coming together practicing together

125
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:49,440
this vigil of meta and offering the goodness

126
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:57,280
the merit generated the goodness generated offering it generously

127
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:06,560
may it be [Music] the cause and condition

128
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:13,599
for freedom for awakening for goodness in the whole world

129
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:19,838
may all beings be well may all beings be free

130
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:42,640
thank you for your practice everyone

131
00:38:44,839 --> 00:38:51,760
hmm so we have time for reflections for questions for comments

132
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:59,680
what did you notice what was this like for you and know that when you offer your

133
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:06,640
insights your challenges it's a gift to others it's a gift to others

134
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:13,599
so you can type them in chat if typed publicly to everyone i'll read your name

135
00:39:13,599 --> 00:39:20,400
and the reflection if just typed to me in the chat i will only read the reflection not your name

136
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:27,280
you can also raise your zoom hand to share

137
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:34,160
especially if you haven't shared in a while i'd love to hear from you

138
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:40,960
and as i wait for your reflections to come in what

139
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,000
i'll share about my practice today is

140
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:55,680
this image this image of us holding candles of meta these candles of light

141
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:01,520
as if a vigil all of his coming together the sense of connection

142
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:07,440
was really sweet for me really sweet for me a sense of connection with all of you

143
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,960
practicing either here together on zoom and youtube or

144
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,040
separately later on on audiodharma

145
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:26,480
and those who will be listening later on youtube just the sense of coming together even if separated in time and

146
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,240
space coming together and this idea of holding this light

147
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:37,760
this candle again it's yours and not yours because sometimes if

148
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:42,960
it's ours like oh it's our meta we're pushing it out it becomes too effortful

149
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:50,079
so this idea of well it's yours and it's the the flame isn't yours nobody owns a

150
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:58,640
flame it's not to be owned a flame right so that idea conjuring up conjuring that

151
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:07,920
up is to really get us not to take ownership so much of

152
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,960
of this meta of this cultivation it is ours and not ours the duality is

153
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:18,720
important to keep so so what did you discover what what

154
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:23,760
worked for you ah a reflection comes in

155
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:28,800
thank you nikki i feel less alone thank you for that reflection

156
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,560
appreciate it yeah yeah

157
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:41,920
there's power in acknowledging our coming together we're coming together

158
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:50,000
one more reflection quite a bit of sadness but hold up tonight for me the meta candle image was very supportive

159
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:54,560
beautiful thank you for that reflection

160
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:09,680
another reflection on youtube it's nice to think that we can embrace all creation with our inner

161
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:17,119
light and that creation can in turn embrace us beautiful beautiful thank you henry

162
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:22,560
thank you for that reflection indeed indeed

163
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:32,240
as ramada said we're all just walking each other home all of us all of us

164
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:35,440
serving each other

165
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:51,200
any other reflections anything that was notable or different or challenging or

166
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,440
with these invitations

167
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:18,400
it was a pretty quiet set relatively there's a lot of silence so

168
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:26,880
it's also possible that we're feeling pretty quiet which i do actually i feel pretty quiet

169
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:33,440
it felt nice to sit together in silence so tell you what

170
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:39,599
let's hold our candles in small vigils

171
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:45,359
of small groups of roughly size three or maybe four

172
00:43:45,359 --> 00:43:50,720
and hold light for each other and for ourselves and see what it feels like if

173
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:55,760
you go with this kind of intention into a zoom room and it could be silent you

174
00:43:55,760 --> 00:44:01,119
could just be sitting together silently tonight in the zoom room if you wanted to in the

175
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:08,240
breakout rooms just see what it's like not to feel alone with three other people not feeling

176
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:14,480
compelled to say anything maybe you just actually start with just silence just holding your

177
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:22,720
light and then whoever feels compelled to say anything at any point they may

178
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:28,400
or they may not so so let us

179
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:35,280
hold the candles our light with each other

180
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:42,640
and practice together in this way to me so i'm creating the rooms

181
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:50,400
the rooms are created and i'm going to open them up

182
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:55,520
and here we go take care of yourselves take care of each other

183
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:02,720
welcome back everyone the rooms are closed so we have a few minutes

184
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:09,760
if any reflections have come up any thoughts especially as you practice together in

185
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:15,599
small groups can really bring up more insight

186
00:45:15,599 --> 00:45:21,359
when we sit together how were the small vigils small breakout

187
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:28,520
rooms holding your candle love to hear some reports if you're willing to share please

190
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:54,880
for me i was having a lot of trouble staying present and um kind of nodding off and it was it was

191
00:45:54,880 --> 00:46:02,720
just very quiet for me and i didn't have a whole lot to share and it seemed like other people had that experience too so

192
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:08,800
it's um yeah it was interesting that you know just that um [Music]

quiet sit so so that can be you know when there's it's a quiet set then the

196
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:33,599
mind can also get kind of quiet um and which is nice and there's not a desire

197
00:46:33,599 --> 00:46:39,920
to really talk much which great you know that's the observation really that is the insight that you're

198
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:44,960
sharing that's one insight and the other one is that well sometimes when also the

the mind gets very quiet and one is tired oh sleepiness arises oh yes it's
